These long legs allow them to spring as fast as 35 mph for short distances and run at 10 mph over long distances.\n2. Giraffes eat their food similar to the way cows eat. They chew it, swallow it, and then regurgitate it and chew it some more, like a cud.\n3. Giraffes only need to drink water once every few days because most of the water that they consume comes from the plants that they eat.\n4. When a female giraffe gives birth, their baby, or calf, falls about five feet to the ground.\n5. Within 10 hours of being born, a baby giraffe can run around with their mother.\n6. Giraffes have four stomachs, all of which are used to help them digest their food.\n7. A giraffe\u2019s age can be determined by its spots. The darker the spots are on a giraffe, the older it is.\n8. When it is first born, a baby giraffe can be as tall as six feet!\n9. The giraffe is the tallest living land animal in the world.\n10. The front legs on a giraffe are actually longer than their hind legs. Combined with the long neck, this makes it extremely difficult for a giraffe to bend over and reach the ground with its mouth.\n11. There is only one species of the giraffe, but nine sub-species. They are the Angolan giraffe, Kordofan giraffe, Nubian giraffe, South African giraffe, West African giraffe, Reticulated giraffe, Rothschild\u2019s giraffe, Thornicroft\u2019s giraffe, and the Kilimanjaro giraffe.\n12. Giraffes in the wild are almost exclusively found on the continent of Africa. However, you will find them in zoos in many other parts of the world.\n13. A giraffe has the same number of vertebrae in its neck as most other animals have \u2013 seven. Their vertebrae are just much larger than those of other animals in order to accommodate the long neck.\n14. The horns on a giraffe\u2019s head are called ossicones. They are basically bumps that are covered with fur.\n15. The spots, or brown and yellow pattern on a giraffe\u2019s body is like fingerprints on a human. There are not two that are exactly alike, making each giraffe very unique.\n16. The tongue of a giraffe can be as long as two feet and they are a bluish-black color. They are used to wrap around the leaves on a tree so the giraffe can easily grab them for eating.\n17. A giraffe is most vulnerable when it is at the watering hole getting a drink. That\u2019s because they have to awkwardly bend down with their front legs spread out in front of them so their mouth can reach the water. This leaves them unprotected and easy prey for predators in the surrounding area.\n18. In addition to being the largest animal, the giraffe\u2019s heart is also larger than any other animal\u2019s heart, too. This is necessary to be able to pump the blood to the head along their long necks.\n19. Giraffes only get about 20 minutes of deep, sound sleep every 24 hours. However, they do take short naps throughout the day. When they sleep, they rest their head on their backside.\n20. Healthy giraffes can live up to 25 years if they are in the wild.\n21. One of the biggest dangers to giraffes is being hunted. People hunt giraffes for their meat, tails, and their coat.\n22. Male giraffes often engage in a behavior called \u201cnecking.\u201d This is when they hit each other\u2019s neck with their neck in an aggressive manner. However, these encounters usually only last a couple minutes and they rarely end with one of the giraffes getting seriously hurt or injured.\n23. In some religions, the giraffe is a symbol of flexibility and intuition.\n24. When a female giraffe is ready to mate, she allows the male giraffes to gather around her and she watches as they fight over her. She, of course, chooses to mate with the strongest one that gets rid of the competition.\n25. Giraffes have such a powerful kick that they can actually decapitate a lion if it tries to attack."}

After all, with their unmistakable spots and supersized necks, they certainly stand out in a crowd.\nFound in the sub-Saharan African savannas, giraffes are herbivores that mostly eat leaves and shoots thanks to their height and long necks.\nGiraffe Facts Overview\nHabitat: Savannahs Location: Sub-Saharan Africa Lifespan: 38 Years Size: 14.1\u201318.7 ft (4.3m to 5.5m) Weight: 680kg \u2013 1360kg Color: Tan to yellow coats with dark brown or black spots Diet: Leaves and buds Predators: Lions, hyenas, and leopards Top Speed: 21.7 km/h (35 mph) No. of Species:\n8 Conservation Status:\nLeast Concern to Critically Endangered. Kordofan giraffe (Critically Endangered), Nubian giraffe (Critically Endangered), West African giraffe (Vulnerable), Reticulated giraffe (Endangered), Angolan giraffe (Least Concern), South African giraffe (Vulnerable), Masai giraffe (Endangered), Thornicroft\u2019s giraffe (Vulnerable).\nWhile they tend to be diurnal animals, which means they\u2019re most active in the early morning or late afternoon, you may also find them wandering about at night.\nGiraffes live in family herds of women and their offspring, or herds of unrelated males. They can form in much larger groups as well. Female giraffes bear sole responsibiltiy of raising their young.\nFor sometime giraffes were thought to have a single species which is still recognised by the ICUN today (with 9 sub speciies). This number grew to a proposal of 4 and then 6 different species. With new findings in a 2020 study, researchers now divide giraffes into 8 species.\nThese species exist in a range of conservation statuses, with some still being found abundantly in their natural habitats and others on the brink of extinction.\nInteresting Giraffe Facts\n1. Giraffes are the tallest mammals on the planet\nNot only are giraffes the tallest mammal on the planet \u2013 they\u2019re the tallest animal! It comes as no surprise either when you consider the fact giraffes can grow to be 5.5 meters tall.\nNot sure just how tall that is? It\u2019s around half the height of a telephone pole!\n2. A giraffes neck can be up to 2.4 m (7.9 ft) in length\nVarious theories for a giraffes long neck include evolution to enable it to reach food high in trees that other animals couldn\u2019t. Another theory is proposes males who take part in \u2018necking\u2019 contests obtain access to females, and therefore larger necks are envitable over time.\n3. Males use their necks in combat called \u2018necking\u2019\nMales establish social hierarchies through \u2018necking\u2019, where they fight each other using their long necks to establish dominance and mating rights over females.\n4. They can\u2019t bend down to drink water\nWhat do you get when you pair the tallest animal in the world with a neck too short to reach the ground? An animal that can\u2019t bend down to drink water!\nNow, this isn\u2019t to say that giraffes can\u2019t drink at all! Instead of bending their neck down, giraffes will splay out their front legs in order to bring themselves closer to the ground, which can allow them to easily drink without bending over. If giraffes didn\u2019t do this, they could pass out \u2013 or worse! \u2013 due to the blood rushing to their head.\nThankfully, since most of the water a giraffe needs can be found in the plants they eat, they only need to perform this gymnastic act every couple of days.\n5. A giraffes tongue can measure 20 inches in length\nThis allows it to wrap around branches and pull leaves from trees to eat.\n6. They give birth standing up\nDrinking isn\u2019t the only thing that giraffes have to do standing up \u2013 they also give birth standing! While this may not seem like the most impressive fact, it is when you consider that the baby giraffe then has to fall up to two meters! That\u2019s a drop higher than the height of most people.\nIf that isn\u2019t testament enough to the resilience of giraffes, though, a fall like this doesn\u2019t keep them down. Most baby giraffes are standing within a few minutes of birth!\n7. Giraffes can kill some of Africa\u2019s top predators\nWhile giraffes may have several predators, they can easily turn the tables and kill some of Africa\u2019s top predators, including lions. This is thanks to their powerful kicks, which can easily protect them from small groups of predators.\n8. Their spots are like fingerprints\nGiraffes may not have fingerprints like humans, primates, and koalas \u2013 however, their spots make them unique! Each giraffe has a unique pattern of spots that you won\u2019t find anywhere else, which helps in telling them apart.\n9. Giraffes make a variety of sounds\nFor a long time, many scientists and specialists believed that giraffes didn\u2019t make any sounds. However, it\u2019s recently been discovered that giraffes are quite vocal, although most sounds can\u2019t be heard by the human ear.\nSome of the sounds we can hear, though, include whistles, grunts, and even hissing. Talk about talkative!\n10. They need less than an hour of sleep in a 24-hour period\nIn captivity, giraffes may snooze away up to 5 hours each day. However, out in the wild, this number drops significantly \u2013 down to only 40 minutes a day!\nAs if that isn\u2019t fascinating (or mind-blowing) enough, though, this isn\u2019t a consecutive 40 minutes. Instead, it\u2019s more likely to catch giraffes taking the ultimate power naps multiple times a day. These naps can be as short as only three to five minutes!\nThis is the shortest required sleep time of almost all animals.\n11. Giraffes are ruminant animals\nYou may have heard the word ruminant before, most likely in relation to cattle. A ruminant animal is an animal that has more than one stomach. This only applies to herbivores, who need a specialized second stomach or chamber to help break down and ferment leaves, grass, and other forms of vegetation in order to more easily process it in their regular stomach.\nPaired with the fact that female giraffes are called cows and males bulls, giraffes are more similar to cattle than you might think at a glance! Plus, baby giraffes are even called calves.\n12. Just a giraffe\u2019s heart is almost 1 meter long\nThere are some myths that giraffes have 2 or 3 hearts, which is not true.\nHowever, not only do giraffes have a long neck, but they also have a longer heart! In fact, their hearts can measure up to 0.6 meters (2 feet) long. For comparison, the human heart is only 0.1 meters long, making the giraffe\u2019s heart as much as 6 times larger!\n13. Giraffe have \u2018horns\u2019 on their head, called \u2018ossicones\u2019\nThey are boney projections of the skill covered with furred skin. They can be used in \u2018necking\u2019 combat and when scaring away predators.\n14. Sadly some specicies are critically endangered\nThe Kordofan and The Nubian giraffe species are both thought to have under 2,000 living in the wild today.\nGiraffe Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification"}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Amazing Facts about Giraffes | OneKindPlanet Animal Education & Facts", "url": "https://onekindplanet.org/animal/giraffe/", "text": "Amazing Facts About the Giraffe\nGiraffes are the tallest mammal in the world. Their long legs and necks help them to eat leaves at the top of tall trees that other animals cannot reach. They have long tongues, and no teeth at the front of their top jaw, which helps them to rip leaves from branches. Male giraffes use their necks for fighting, swinging them from side to side to headbutt their opponent.\nHow many species of giraffe are there?\nUp until recently, it was thought that there was one extant species of giraffe, Giraffa Camelopardalis. However, recent research by scientists has shown that there are four species: Northern giraffe (Giraffa Camelopardalis), Southern giraffe (Giraffa giraffe), Masai giraffe (Giraffa tippelskirchi), and reticulated giraffe (Giraffa reticulata).\nWhat do giraffes look like?\nThe long legs and necks of giraffes make them tallest of all the mammals; at around six foot, the legs alone are taller than many humans. They have a distinct spotted coat, with no two giraffes having the exact same pattern. This means that giraffes can be individually identified from their coats, a feature that is often used in the study of wild giraffe populations.\nHow tall can giraffes grow?\nOn average, giraffes are between 16 and 20 ft (4.8\u20136 m) tall.\nHow long is a giraffe\u2019s neck?\nGiraffes have long necks that can be over six foot (>1.8 m) in length.\nThe reason for the long neck is debated amongst scientists, but it is useful for reaching food at the top of tall trees. The added height is good for spotting approaching predators, and males use their long necks to compete with other males, a fight known as necking. Male giraffes swing their long necks and repeatedly head butt the others body. Males with longer and stronger necks tend to win these fights, and often get the female. It is thought therefore, that longer necks may also help when attracting females.\nWhere do giraffes live?\nGiraffes inhabit the open plains, grasslands, and savannas of Africa. They are most common in southern and eastern Africa, but some smaller more isolated populations live in western and central Africa.\nWhat do giraffes eat?\nGiraffes are browsers, so use their long neck to feed on the leaves, shoots, and fruits of tall bushes and trees. They feed on a variety of plants and diet varies depending on location and season, but acacia leaves and shoots are most common.\nDo giraffes have teeth?\nYes! Giraffes have 32 teeth, the same number as humans. However, their mouths look very different to ours. Teeth are located at the front of the bottom jaw, but only at the back of the top jaw. Instead of teeth they have a lump of tissue known as a hard plate, or dental pad, at the top of their mouths, which helps them to grip the leaves.\nHow long is a giraffe\u2019s tongue?\nGiraffe tongues are long, reaching around 20\u201321 in (50\u201353 cm) in length. Giraffe tongues and lips are tough and specially adapted to allow giraffes to forage on trees that other animals would avoid, such as acacias, which are very thorny.\nWhat colour is a giraffe\u2019s tongue?\nGiraffe tongues are dark blueish in colour, which is thought to be a form of sun protection.\nHow do giraffes give birth?\nGiraffes are polygamous, so a few males with mate with one female. Females tend to give birth to a single calf around 400\u2013460 days after mating; females give birth whilst standing up.\nBaby Giraffes can stand within half an hour and after only 10 hours can run alongside their family. Young giraffes hang out in nursery groups until they are around 5 months old, resting and playing together while their mothers forage in the distance; one female will tend to stay and look after the young. Males are not involved in the raising of young.\nHow much do giraffes sleep?\nGiraffes have one of the shortest sleep requirements of any mammal, and will only sleep for around four hours a day. They sleep either laying down with their necks resting on their bodies, or standing up. Sleep occurs in short intervals, sometimes less than a minute."}

Their extreme height allows them to eat leaves and shoots located much higher than other animals can reach. In particular, they seek out acacia trees. Their long tongues are helpful in eating because they help pull leaves from the trees. Spending most of the day eating, a full-grown giraffe consumes over 45 kg (100 lb.) of leaves and twigs a day.\nThe male giraffe is both taller and heavier than the female. Both sexes have skin-covered knobs, called ossicones, on the top of their heads. Female ossicones are smaller and have a small tuft of fur on top, while male ossicones are bald on the top. These knobs are used to protect the head when males fight, which involves swinging their necks at each other in a show of strength called \u201cnecking.\u201d\nWhen giraffes walk, they move both legs on one side of their body and then both legs on the other side, which is unusual. However, they run in a similar style to other mammals, swinging their rear legs and front legs in unison. They can reach 55 km/h (35 mph) at full speed but only in brief spurts.\nGiraffes sleep less than two hours a day. In general, they sleep with their feet tucked under them and their head resting on their hindquarters, but they can also sleep for short periods of time standing up.\nFemale giraffes can become pregnant at 5 years old. They carry a baby for 15 months and give birth while standing up. Newborns are about 2 m (6 ft.) tall and weigh 70 kg (150 lb.).\nThey live up to 25 years in the wild.\nConservation Status\nGiraffes are classified by IUCN\u2019s Red List as vulnerable of extinction. After researchers surveyed the population in trucks, by foot, by aircraft, and by remote cameras, they confirmed the number of giraffes has plummeted 40% since 1985. With some subspecies, such as the reticulated giraffe, the situation is even more dire, with their population declining by nearly 80%.\nGiraffes face several threats, including loss of habitat due to logging for firewood. They are also hunted for their meat, hides, and tails, which are valued by many African tribes.\nWhat You Can Do to Help\nTo help preserve giraffe populations, boycott products made with giraffe body parts and encourage others to do the same.\nGiraffe Distribution\nGiraffe Resources\nBlog Posts about the Giraffe"}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffe", "text": "Tall African ungulate\nThe giraffe is a tall African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements. Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.\nThe giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its spotted coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.\nLions, leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs may prey upon giraffes. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations. Males establish social hierarchies through \"necking\", combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear sole responsibility for raising the young.\nThe giraffe has intrigued various ancient and modern cultures for its peculiar appearance, and has often been featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as vulnerable to extinction and has been extirpated from many parts of its former range. Giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves, but estimates as of 2016 indicate there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010.\nEtymology\nThe name \"giraffe\" has its earliest known origins in the Arabic word zar\u0101fah (\u0632\u0631\u0627\u0641\u0629), perhaps borrowed from the animal's Somali name geri. The Arab name is translated as \"fast-walker\". In early Modern English the spellings jarraf and ziraph were used, probably directly from the Arabic, and in Middle English orafle and gyrfaunt, gerfaunt. The Italian form giraffa arose in the 1590s. The modern English form developed around 1600 from the French girafe.\n\"Camelopard\" is an archaic English name for the giraffe; it derives from the Ancient Greek \u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 (kam\u0113lop\u00e1rdalis), from \u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (k\u00e1m\u0113los), \"camel\", and \u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 (p\u00e1rdalis), \"leopard\", referring to its camel-like shape and leopard-like colouration.\nTaxonomy\nCarl Linnaeus originally classified living giraffes as one species in 1758. He gave it the binomial name Cervus camelopardalis. Morten Thrane Br\u00fcnnich classified the genus Giraffa in 1762. The species name camelopardalis is from Latin.\nEvolution\nTragulina Tragulidae Pecora Antilocapridae Giraffidae Cervidae Bovidae Moschidae Cladogram based on a 2003 study by Hassanin and Douzery.\nThe giraffe is one of only two living genera of the family Giraffidae in the order Artiodactyla, the other being the okapi. The family was once much more extensive, with over 10 fossil genera described. The elongation of the neck appears to have started early in the giraffe lineage. Comparisons between giraffes and their ancient relatives suggest vertebrae close to the skull lengthened earlier, followed by lengthening of vertebrae further down. One early giraffid ancestor was Canthumeryx which has been dated variously to have lived 25\u201320 million years ago (mya), 17\u201315 mya or 18\u201314.3 mya and whose deposits have been found in Libya. This animal was medium-sized, slender and antelope-like. Giraffokeryx appeared 15 mya on the Indian subcontinent and resembled an okapi or a small giraffe, and had a longer neck and similar ossicones. Giraffokeryx may have shared a clade with more massively built giraffids like Sivatherium and Bramatherium.\nGiraffids like Palaeotragus, Shansitherium and Samotherium appeared 14 mya and lived throughout Africa and Eurasia. These animals had bare ossicones and small cranial sinuses and were longer with broader skulls. Paleotragus resembled the okapi and may have been its ancestor. Others find that the okapi lineage diverged earlier, before Giraffokeryx. Samotherium was a particularly important transitional fossil in the giraffe lineage, as its cervical vertebrae were intermediate in length and structure between a modern giraffe and an okapi, and were more vertical than the okapi's. Bohlinia, which first appeared in southeastern Europe and lived 9\u20137 mya was likely a direct ancestor of the giraffe. Bohlinia closely resembled modern giraffes, having a long neck and legs and similar ossicones and dentition.\nSamotherium (middle) in comparison with the Samotherium appears to have shown a transition to a giraffe-like neck. The extinct giraffid(middle) in comparison with the okapi (below) and giraffe. The anatomy ofappears to have shown a transition to a giraffe-like neck.\nBohlinia entered China and northern India in response to climate change. From there, the genus Giraffa evolved and, around 7 mya, entered Africa. Further climate changes caused the extinction of the Asian giraffes, while the African giraffes survived and radiated into several new species. Living giraffes appear to have arisen around 1 mya in eastern Africa during the Pleistocene. Some biologists suggest the modern giraffes descended from G. jumae; others find G. gracilis a more likely candidate. G. jumae was larger and more heavily built, while G. gracilis was smaller and more lightly built.\nThe changes from extensive forests to more open habitats, which began 8 mya, are believed to be the main driver for the evolution of giraffes. During this time, tropical plants disappeared and were replaced by arid C4 plants, and a dry savannah emerged across eastern and northern Africa and western India. Some researchers have hypothesised that this new habitat coupled with a different diet, including acacia species, may have exposed giraffe ancestors to toxins that caused higher mutation rates and a higher rate of evolution. The coat patterns of modern giraffes may also have coincided with these habitat changes. Asian giraffes are hypothesised to have had more okapi-like colourations.\nThe giraffe genome is around 2.9 billion base pairs in length compared to the 3.3 billion base pairs of the okapi. Of the proteins in giraffe and okapi genes, 19.4% are identical. The divergence of giraffe and okapi lineages dates to around 11.5 mya. A small group of regulatory genes in the giraffe appear to be responsible for the animal's stature and associated circulatory adaptations.\nSpecies and subspecies\nMap showing \"Approximate geographic ranges, fur patterns, and phylogenetic relationships between some giraffe subspecies based on mitochondrial DNA sequences.

Asterisks along branches correspond to node values of more than 90% bootstrap support. Stars at branch tips identify paraphyletic haplotypes found in Maasai and reticulated giraffes\".\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) currently recognises only one species of giraffe with nine subspecies. During the 1900s, various taxonomies with two or three species were proposed. A 2007 study on the genetics of giraffes using mitochondrial DNA suggested at least six lineages could be recognised as species. A 2011 study using detailed analyses of the morphology of giraffes, and application of the phylogenetic species concept, described eight species of living giraffes. A 2016 study also concluded that living giraffes consist of multiple species. The researchers suggested the existence of four species, which have not exchanged genetic information between each other for 1 to 2 million years.\nA 2020 study showed that depending on the method chosen, different taxonomic hypotheses recognizing from two to six species can be considered for the genus Giraffa. That study also found that multi-species coalescent methods can lead to taxonomic over-splitting, as those methods delimit geographic structures rather than species. The three-species hypothesis, which recognises G. camelopardalis, G. giraffa, and G. tippelskirchi, is highly supported by phylogenetic analyses and also corroborated by most population genetic and multi-species coalescent analyses. A 2021 whole genome sequencing study suggests the existence of four distinct species and seven subspecies.\nThe cladogram below shows the phylogenetic relationship between the four proposed species and seven subspecies based on the genome analysis. Note the eight lineages correspond to eight of the traditional subspecies in the one species hypothesis. The Rothschild giraffe is subsumed into G. camelopardalis camelopardalis.\nGiraffa Giraffa camelopardalis G. camelopardalis antiquorum (Kordofan giraffe) G. c. camelopardalis (Nubian giraffe) G. c. peralta (West African giraffe) (northern giraffe) G. reticulata (no subspecies) (reticulated giraffe) G. tippelskirchi G. tippelskirchi tippelskirchi (Masai giraffe sensu stricto) G. t. thornicrofti (Luangwa or Thornicroft\u2019s giraffe) (Masai giraffe sensu lato) G. giraffa G. giraffa angolensis (Angolan giraffe) G. g. giraffa (South African giraffe) (southern giraffe)\nThe following table compares the different hypotheses for giraffe species. The description column shows the traditional nine subspecies in the one species hypothesis.\nThe first extinct species to be described was Giraffa sivalensis Falconer and Cautley 1843, a reevaluation of a vertebra that was initially described as a fossil of the living giraffe. While taxonomic opinion may be lacking on some names, the extinct species that have been published include:\nAppearance and anatomy\nFully grown giraffes stand 4.3\u20135.7 m (14.1\u201318.7 ft) tall, with males taller than females. The average weight is 1,192 kg (2,628 lb) for an adult male and 828 kg (1,825 lb) for an adult female. Despite its long neck and legs, its body is relatively short.: 66 The skin is mostly gray, or tan, and can reach a thickness of 20 mm (0.79 in).: 87 The 80\u2013100 centimetres (31\u201339 in) long tail ends in a long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.: 94\nThe coat has dark blotches or patches, which can be orange, chestnut, brown, or nearly black, separated by light hair, usually white or cream coloured. Male giraffes become darker as they age. The coat pattern has been claimed to serve as camouflage in the light and shade patterns of savannah woodlands. When standing among trees and bushes, they are hard to see at even a few metres distance. However, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves rather than on camouflage, which may be more important for calves. Each giraffe has a unique coat pattern. Calves inherit some coat pattern traits from their mothers, and variation in some spot traits is correlated with neonatal survival. The skin under the blotches may serve as windows for thermoregulation, being sites for complex blood vessel systems and large sweat glands.\nThe fur may give the animal chemical defense, as its parasite repellents give it a characteristic scent. At least 11 main aromatic chemicals are in the fur, although indole and 3-methylindole are responsible for most of the smell. Because males have a stronger odour than females, it may also have a sexual function.\nHead\nBoth sexes have prominent horn-like structures called ossicones, formed from ossified cartilage, covered in skin and fused to the skull at the parietal bones. Being vascularised, the ossicones may have a role in thermoregulation, and are used in combat between males. Appearance is a reliable guide to the sex or age of a giraffe: the ossicones of females and young are thin and display tufts of hair on top, whereas those of adult males end in knobs and tend to be bald on top. Also, a median lump, which is more prominent in males, emerges at the front of the skull. Males develop calcium deposits that form bumps on their skulls as they age. Multiple sinuses lighten a giraffe's skull.: 103 However, as males age, their skulls become heavier and more club-like, helping them become more dominant in combat. The occipital condyles of the skull allow the animal to tilt its head straight up and grab food on the branches above with the tongue.: 103, 110\nLocated on both sides of the head, the giraffe's eyes give it good eyesight and a wide field of vision from its great height.: 85, 102 The eye is larger than in other ungulates, with a greater retinal surface area. Giraffes possibly see in colour: 85 and their senses of hearing and smell are sharp. The ears are movable: 95 and the nostrils are slit-shaped, which may be an adaptation against blowing sand.\nThe giraffe's prehensile tongue is about 45 cm (18 in) long. It is black, perhaps to protect against sunburn and is useful for grasping foliage, and delicately removing leaves from branches.: 109\u2013110 The upper lip is prehensile and useful when foraging, and is covered in hair to protect against thorns. Papillae cover the tongue and the inside of the mouth. The upper jaw has a hard palate and lacks front teeth. The molars and premolars have a low-crowned, broad surface with an almost square cross-section.: 106\nNeck\nThe giraffe has an extremely elongated neck, which can be up to 2.4 m (7.9 ft) in length. Along the neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs. The neck typically rests at an angle of 50\u201360 degrees, though juveniles have straighter necks and rest at 70 degrees.: 94 The long neck results from a disproportionate lengthening of the cervical vertebrae, not from the addition of more vertebrae. Each cervical vertebra is over 28 cm (11 in) long.: 71 They comprise 52\u201354 per cent of the length of the giraffe's vertebral column, compared with the 27\u201333 percent typical of similar large ungulates, including the giraffe's closest living relative, the okapi. This elongation largely takes place after birth, perhaps because giraffe mothers would have a difficult time giving birth to young with the same neck proportions as adults. The giraffe's head and neck are held up by large muscles and a strengthened nuchal ligament, which are anchored by long dorsal spines on the anterior thoracic vertebrae, giving the animal a hump.\nThe giraffe's neck vertebrae have ball and socket joints.: 71 The point of articulation between the cervical and thoracic vertebrae of giraffes is shifted to lie between the first and second thoracic vertebrae (T1 and T2), unlike most other ruminants where the articulation is between the seventh cervical vertebra (C7) and T1. This allows C7 to contribute directly to increased neck length and has given rise to the suggestion that T1 is actually C8, and that giraffes have added an extra cervical vertebra. However, this proposition is not generally accepted, as T1 has other morphological features, such as an articulating rib, deemed diagnostic of thoracic vertebrae, and because exceptions to the mammalian limit of seven cervical vertebrae are generally characterised by increased neurological anomalies and maladies.\nThere are several hypotheses regarding the evolutionary origin and maintenance of elongation in giraffe necks. Charles Darwin originally suggested the \"competing browsers hypothesis\", which has been challenged only recently. It suggests that competitive pressure from smaller browsers, like kudu, steenbok and impala, encouraged the elongation of the neck, as it enabled giraffes to reach food that competitors could not. This advantage is real, as giraffes can and do feed up to 4.5 m (15 ft) high, while even quite large competitors, such as kudu, can feed up to only about 2 m (6 ft 7 in) high. There is also research suggesting that browsing competition is intense at lower levels, and giraffes feed more efficiently (gaining more leaf biomass with each mouthful) high in the canopy. However, scientists disagree about just how much time giraffes spend feeding at levels beyond the reach of other browsers, and a 2010 study found that adult giraffes with longer necks actually suffered higher mortality rates under drought conditions than their shorter-necked counterparts. This study suggests that maintaining a longer neck requires more nutrients, which puts longer-necked giraffes at risk during a food shortage.\nAnother theory, the sexual selection hypothesis, proposes the long necks evolved as a secondary sexual characteristic, giving males an advantage in \"necking\" contests (see below) to establish dominance and obtain access to sexually receptive females. In support of this theory, necks are longer and heavier for males than females of the same age, and males do not employ other forms of combat. However, one objection is it fails to explain why female giraffes also have long necks. It has also been proposed that the neck serves to give the animal greater vigilance.\nLegs, locomotion and posture\nA giraffe's front and back legs are about the same length. The radius and ulna of the front legs are articulated by the carpus, which, while structurally equivalent to the human wrist, functions as a knee. It appears that a suspensory ligament allows the lanky legs to support the animal's great weight. The hooves of large male giraffes reach a diameter of 31 cm \u00d7 23 cm (12.2 in \u00d7 9.1 in).: 98 The rear of each hoof is low, and the fetlock is close to the ground, allowing the foot to provide additional support for the animal's weight. Giraffes lack dewclaws and interdigital glands. The giraffe's pelvis, though relatively short, has an ilium that is outspread at the upper ends.\nA giraffe has only two gaits: walking and galloping. Walking is done by moving the legs on one side of the body, then doing the same on the other side. When galloping, the hind legs move around the front legs before the latter move forward, and the tail will curl up. The animal relies on the forward and backward motions of its head and neck to maintain balance and the counter momentum while galloping.: 327\u201329 The giraffe can reach a sprint speed of up to 60 km/h (37 mph), and can sustain 50 km/h (31 mph) for several kilometres. Giraffes would probably not be competent swimmers as their long legs would be highly cumbersome in the water, although they could possibly float. When swimming, the thorax would be weighed down by the front legs, making it difficult for the animal to move its neck and legs in harmony or keep its head above the water's surface.\nA giraffe rests by lying with its body on top of its folded legs.: 329 To lie down, the animal kneels on its front legs and then lowers the rest of its body. To get back up, it first gets on its front knees and shifts hindquarters onto its back feet. It then moves from kneeling to standing on its front legs and pulls the rest of its body upwards, swinging its head for balance.: 67 If the giraffe wants to bend down to drink, it either spreads its front legs or bends its knees. Studies in captivity found the giraffe sleeps intermittently around 4.6 hours per day, mostly at night. It usually sleeps lying down; however, standing sleeps have been recorded, particularly in older individuals. Intermittent short \"deep sleep\" phases while lying are characterised by the giraffe bending its neck backwards and resting its head on the hip or thigh, a position believed to indicate paradoxical sleep.\nInternal systems\nScheme of path of the recurrent laryngeal nerve in giraffe\nIn mammals, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve is longer than the right; in the giraffe, it is over 30 cm (12 in) longer. These nerves are longer in the giraffe than in any other living animal; the left nerve is over 2 m (6 ft 7 in) long. Each nerve cell in this path begins in the brainstem and passes down the neck along the vagus nerve, then branches off into the recurrent laryngeal nerve which passes back up the neck to the larynx. Thus, these nerve cells have a length of nearly 5 m (16 ft) in the largest giraffes. Despite its long neck and large skull, the brain of the giraffe is typical for an ungulate. Evaporative heat loss in the nasal passages keep the giraffe's brain cool. The shape of the skeleton gives the giraffe a small lung volume relative to its mass. Its long neck gives it a large amount of dead space, in spite of its narrow windpipe. The giraffe also has an increased level of tidal volume so the ratio of dead space to tidal volume is similar to other mammals. The animal can still supply enough oxygen to its tissues, and it can increase its respiratory rate and oxygen diffusion when running.\nReticulated giraffe bending down to drink in Kenya . The circulatory system is adapted to deal with blood flow rushing down its neck.\nThe circulatory system of the giraffe has several adaptations for its great height. Its heart, which can weigh more than 11 kg (25 lb) and measures about 60 cm (2 ft) long, must generate approximately double the blood pressure required for a human to maintain blood flow to the brain. As such, the wall of the heart can be as thick as 7.5 cm (3.0 in). Giraffes have unusually high heart rates for their size, at 150 beats per minute.: 76 When the animal lowers its head, the blood rushes down fairly unopposed and a rete mirabile in the upper neck, with its large cross-sectional area, prevents excess blood flow to the brain. When it raises again, the blood vessels constrict and direct blood into the brain so the animal does not faint. The jugular veins contain several (most commonly seven) valves to prevent blood flowing back into the head from the inferior vena cava and right atrium while the head is lowered. Conversely, the blood vessels in the lower legs are under great pressure because of the weight of fluid pressing down on them. To solve this problem, the skin of the lower legs is thick and tight, preventing too much blood from pouring into them.\nGiraffes have oesophageal muscles that are unusually strong to allow regurgitation of food from the stomach up the neck and into the mouth for rumination.: 78 They have four chambered stomachs, as in all ruminants; the first chamber has adapted to their specialized diet. The intestines of an adult giraffe measure more than 70 m (230 ft) in length and have a relatively small ratio of small to large intestine. The liver of the giraffe is small and compact.: 76 A gallbladder is generally present during fetal life, but it may disappear before birth.\nBehaviour and ecology\nHabitat and feeding\nMasai giraffe extending its tongue to feed, in Tanzania . Its tongue, lips and palate are tough enough to deal with sharp thorns in trees.\nGiraffes usually inhabit savannahs and open woodlands. They prefer Acacieae, Commiphora, Combretum and open Terminalia woodlands over denser environments like Brachystegia woodlands.: 322 The Angolan giraffe can be found in desert environments. Giraffes browse on the twigs of trees, preferring those of the subfamily Acacieae and the genera Commiphora and Terminalia, which are important sources of calcium and protein to sustain the giraffe's growth rate. They also feed on shrubs, grass and fruit.: 324 A giraffe eats around 34 kg (75 lb) of foliage daily. When stressed, giraffes may chew the bark off branches.: 325 Giraffes are also recorded to chew old bones.: 102\nDuring the wet season, food is abundant and giraffes are more spread out, while during the dry season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes. Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably to make it easier to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency. As a ruminant, the giraffe first chews its food, then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again.: 78\u201379 The giraffe requires less food than many other herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system. The animal's faeces come in the form of small pellets. When it has access to water, a giraffe drinks at intervals no longer than three days.\nGiraffes have a great effect on the trees that they feed on, delaying the growth of young trees for some years and giving \"waistlines\" to too tall trees. Feeding is at its highest during the first and last hours of daytime. Between these hours, giraffes mostly stand and ruminate. Rumination is the dominant activity during the night, when it is mostly done lying down.\nSocial life\nGiraffes are usually found in groups that vary in size and composition according to ecological, anthropogenic, temporal, and social factors. Traditionally, the composition of these groups had been described as open and ever-changing. For research purposes, a \"group\" has been defined as \"a collection of individuals that are less than a kilometre apart and moving in the same general direction\". More recent studies have found that giraffes have long-term social associations and may form groups or pairs based on kinship, sex or other factors, and these groups regularly associate with other groups in larger communities or sub-communities within a fission\u2013fusion society. Proximity to humans can disrupt social arrangements. Masai giraffes of Tanzania live in distinct social subpopulations that overlap spatially, but have different reproductive rates and calf survival rates.\nThe number of giraffes in a group can range from one up to 66 individuals. Giraffe groups tend to be sex-segregated although mixed-sex groups made of adult females and young males also occur. Female groups may be matrilineally related. Generally females are more selective than males in who they associate with regarding individuals of the same sex. Particularly stable giraffe groups are those made of mothers and their young, which can last weeks or months. Young males also form groups and will engage in playfights. However, as they get older, males become more solitary but may also associate in pairs or with female groups. Giraffes are not territorial, but they have home ranges that vary according to rainfall and proximity to human settlements. Male giraffes occasionally wander far from areas that they normally frequent.: 329\nEarly biologists suggested giraffes were mute and unable to produce air flow of sufficient velocity to vibrate their vocal folds. To the contrary; they have been recorded to communicate using snorts, sneezes, coughs, snores, hisses, bursts, moans, grunts, growls and flute-like sounds. During courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females call their young by bellowing. Calves will emit snorts, bleats, mooing and mewing sounds. Snorting and hissing in adults is associated with vigilance. During nighttime, giraffes appear to hum to each other above the infrasound range. The purpose is unclear. Dominant males display to other males with an erect posture; holding the chin and head high while walking stiffly and approaching them laterally. The less dominant show submissiveness by lowing the head and ears with the chin moved in and then jump and flee.\nReproduction and parental care\nAngolan giraffes mating in Namibia\nReproduction in giraffes is broadly polygamous: a few older males mate with the fertile females. Females can reproduce throughout the year and experience oestrus cycling approximately every 15 days. Female giraffes in oestrous are dispersed over space and time, so reproductive adult males adopt a strategy of roaming among female groups to seek mating opportunities, with periodic hormone-induced rutting behaviour approximately every two weeks. Males prefer young adult females over juveniles and older adults.\nMale giraffes assess female fertility by tasting the female's urine to detect oestrus, in a multi-step process known as the flehmen response. Once an oestrous female is detected, the male will attempt to court her. When courting, dominant males will keep subordinate ones at bay. A courting male may lick a female's tail, rest his head and neck on her body or nudge her with his ossicones. During copulation, the male stands on his hind legs with his head held up and his front legs resting on the female's sides.\nGiraffe gestation lasts 400\u2013460 days, after which a single calf is normally born, although twins occur on rare occasions. The mother gives birth standing up. The calf emerges head and front legs first, having broken through the fetal membranes, and falls to the ground, severing the umbilical cord. A newborn giraffe is 1.7\u20132 m (5.6\u20136.6 ft) tall. Within a few hours of birth, the calf can run around and is almost indistinguishable from a one-week-old. However, for the first one to three weeks, it spends most of its time hiding; its coat pattern providing camouflage. The ossicones, which have lain flat while it was in the womb, become erect within a few days.\nFemale Angolan giraffe with calf\nMothers with calves will gather in nursery herds, moving or browsing together. Mothers in such a group may sometimes leave their calves with one female while they forage and drink elsewhere. This is known as a \"calving pool\". Adult males play almost no role in raising the young,: 337 although they appear to have friendly interactions. Calves are at risk of predation, and a mother giraffe will stand over her calf and kick at an approaching predator. Females watching calving pools will only alert their own young if they detect a disturbance, although the others will take notice and follow. Calves may be weaned at six to eight months old but can remain with their mothers for up to 14 months.: 49 Females become sexually mature when they are four years old, while males become mature at four or five years. Spermatogenesis in male giraffes begins at three to four years of age. Males must wait until they are at least seven years old to gain the opportunity to mate.\nNecking\nMale giraffes use their necks as weapons in combat, a behaviour known as \"necking\". Necking is used to establish dominance and males that win necking bouts have greater reproductive success. This behaviour occurs at low or high intensity. In low-intensity necking, the combatants rub and lean against each other. The male that can hold itself more erect wins the bout. In high-intensity necking, the combatants will spread their front legs and swing their necks at each other, attempting to land blows with their ossicones. The contestants will try to dodge each other's blows and then get ready to counter. The power of a blow depends on the weight of the skull and the arc of the swing. A necking duel can last more than half an hour, depending on how well matched the combatants are.: 331 Although most fights do not lead to serious injury, there have been records of broken jaws, broken necks, and even deaths.\nAfter a duel, it is common for two male giraffes to caress and court each other. Such interactions between males have been found to be more frequent than heterosexual coupling. In one study, up to 94 percent of observed mounting incidents took place between males. The proportion of same-sex activities varied from 30 to 75 percent. Only one percent of same-sex mounting incidents occurred between females.\nMortality and health\nGiraffes have high adult survival probability, and an unusually long lifespan compared to other ruminants, up to 38 years. Because of their size, eyesight and powerful kicks, adult giraffes are usually not subject to predation, although lions may regularly prey on individuals up to 550 kg (1,210 lb). Giraffes are the most common food source for the big cats in Kruger National Park, comprising nearly a third of the meat consumed, although only a small portion of the giraffes were probably killed by predators, as a majority of the consumed giraffes appeared to be scavenged. Adult female survival is significantly correlated with gregariousness, the average number of other females she is seen associating with. Calves are much more vulnerable than adults and are also preyed on by leopards, spotted hyenas and wild dogs. A quarter to a half of giraffe calves reach adulthood. Calf survival varies according to the season of birth, with calves born during the dry season having higher survival rates.\nThe local, seasonal presence of large herds of migratory wildebeests and zebras reduces predation pressure on giraffe calves and increases their survival probability. In turn, it has been suggested that other ungulates may benefit from associating with giraffes, as their height allows them to spot predators from further away. Zebras were found to glean information on predation risk from giraffe body language and spend less time scanning the environment when giraffes are present.\nSome parasites feed on giraffes. They are often hosts for ticks, especially in the area around the genitals, which have thinner skin than other areas. Tick species that commonly feed on giraffes are those of genera Hyalomma, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus. Giraffes may rely on red-billed and yellow-billed oxpeckers to clean them of ticks and alert them to danger. Giraffes host numerous species of internal parasites and are susceptible to various diseases. They were victims of the (now eradicated) viral illness rinderpest. Giraffes can also suffer from a skin disorder, which comes in the form of wrinkles, lesions or raw fissures. As much as 79% of giraffes show signs of the disease in Ruaha National Park, but it did not cause mortality in Tarangire and is less prevalent in areas with fertile soils.\nRelationship with humans\nCultural significance\nWith its lanky build and spotted coat, the giraffe has been a source of fascination throughout human history, and its image is widespread in culture. It has been used to symbolise flexibility, far-sightedness, femininity, fragility, passivity, grace, beauty and the continent of Africa itself.: 7, 116\nGiraffes were depicted in art throughout the African continent, including that of the Kiffians, Egyptians, and Kushites.: 45\u201347 The Kiffians were responsible for a life-size rock engraving of two giraffes, dated 8,000 years ago, that has been called the \"world's largest rock art petroglyph\".: 45  How the giraffe got its height has been the subject of various African folktales. The Tugen people of modern Kenya used the giraffe to depict their god Mda. The Egyptians gave the giraffe its own hieroglyph, named 'sr' in Old Egyptian and 'mmy' in later periods.: 49\nGiraffes have a presence in modern Western culture. Salvador Dal\u00ed depicted them with burning manes in some of his surrealist paintings. Dali considered the giraffe to be a symbol of masculinity, and a flaming giraffe was meant to be a \"masculine cosmic apocalyptic monster\".: 123 Several children's books feature the giraffe, including David A. Ufer's The Giraffe Who Was Afraid of Heights, Giles Andreae's Giraffes Can't Dance and Roald Dahl's The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me. Giraffes have appeared in animated films, as minor characters in Disney's The Lion King and Dumbo, and in more prominent roles in The Wild and the Madagascar films. Sophie the Giraffe has been a popular teether since 1961. Another famous fictional giraffe is the Toys \"R\" Us mascot Geoffrey the Giraffe.: 127\nThe giraffe has also been used for some scientific experiments and discoveries. Scientists have looked at the properties of giraffe skin when developing suits for astronauts and fighter pilots: 76 because the people in these professions are in danger of passing out if blood rushes to their legs. Computer scientists have modeled the coat patterns of several subspecies using reaction\u2013diffusion mechanisms. The constellation of Camelopardalis, introduced in the seventeenth century, depicts a giraffe.: 119\u201320 The Tswana people of Botswana traditionally see the constellation Crux as two giraffes\u2014Acrux and Mimosa forming a male, and Gacrux and Delta Crucis forming the female.\nPainting of a giraffe imported to China during the Ming dynasty\nCaptivity\nThe Egyptians kept giraffes as pets and shipped them around the Mediterranean.: 48\u201349 The giraffe was among the many animals collected and displayed by the Romans. The first one in Rome was brought in by Julius Caesar in 46 BC and exhibited to the public.: 52 With the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the housing of giraffes in Europe declined.: 54 During the Middle Ages, giraffes were known to Europeans through contact with the Arabs, who revered the giraffe for its peculiar appearance.\nIndividual captive giraffes were given celebrity status throughout history. In 1414, a giraffe was shipped from Malindi to Bengal. It was then taken to China by explorer Zheng He and placed in a Ming dynasty zoo. The animal was a source of fascination for the Chinese people, who associated it with the mythical Qilin.: 56 The Medici giraffe was a giraffe presented to Lorenzo de' Medici in 1486. It caused a great stir on its arrival in Florence. Zarafa, another famous giraffe, was brought from Egypt to Paris in the early 19th century as a gift from Muhammad Ali of Egypt to Charles X of France. A sensation, the giraffe was the subject of numerous memorabilia or \"giraffanalia\".: 81\nGiraffes have become popular attractions in modern zoos, though keeping them healthy is difficult as they require wide areas and high amounts of browse for food. Captive giraffes in North America and Europe appear to have a higher mortality rate than in the wild; causes of death include poor husbandry, nutrition and management decisions.: 153 Giraffes in zoos display stereotypical behaviours, the most common being the licking of non-food items.: 164 Zookeepers may offer various activities to stimulate giraffes, including training them to accept food from visitors.: 175 Stables for giraffes are built particularly high to accommodate their height.: 183\nExploitation\nGiraffes were probably common targets for hunters throughout Africa. Different parts of their bodies were used for different purposes. Their meat was used for food. The tail hairs served as flyswatters, bracelets, necklaces, and thread. Shields, sandals, and drums were made using the skin, and the strings of musical instruments were from the tendons. The smoke from burning giraffe skins was used by the medicine men of Buganda to treat nose bleeds. The Humr people of Kordofan consume the drink Umm Nyolokh, which is prepared from the liver and bone marrow of giraffes. Richard Rudgley hypothesised that Umm Nyolokh might contain DMT. The drink is said to cause hallucinations of giraffes, believed to be the giraffes' ghosts, by the Humr.\nConservation status\nIn 2016, giraffes were assessed as Vulnerable from a conservation perspective by the IUCN. In 1985, it was estimated there were 155,000 giraffes in the wild. This declined to over 140,000 in 1999. Estimates as of 2016 indicate there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild. The Masai and reticulated subspecies are endangered, and the Rothschild subspecies is near threatened. The Nubian subspecies is critically endangered.\nThe primary causes for giraffe population declines are habitat loss and direct killing for bushmeat markets. Giraffes have been extirpated from much of their historic range, including Eritrea, Guinea, Mauritania and Senegal. They may also have disappeared from Angola, Mali, and Nigeria, but have been introduced to Rwanda and Eswatini. As of 2010 , there were more than 1,600 in captivity at Species360-registered zoos. Habitat destruction has hurt the giraffe. In the Sahel, the need for firewood and grazing room for livestock has led to deforestation. Normally, giraffes can coexist with livestock, since they do not directly compete with them. In 2017, severe droughts in northern Kenya led to increased tensions over land and the killing of wildlife by herders, with giraffe populations being particularly hit.\nProtected areas like national parks provide important habitat and anti-poaching protection to giraffe populations. Community-based conservation efforts outside national parks are also effective at protecting giraffes and their habitats. Private game reserves have contributed to the preservation of giraffe populations in southern Africa. The giraffe is a protected species in most of its range. It is the national animal of Tanzania, and is protected by law, and unauthorised killing can result in imprisonment. The UN backed Convention of Migratory Species selected giraffes for protection in 2017. In 2019, giraffes were listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which means international trade including in parts/derivatives is regulated.\nTranslocations are sometimes used to augment or re-establish diminished or extirpated populations, but these activities are risky and difficult to undertake using the best practices of extensive pre- and post-translocation studies and ensuring a viable founding population. Aerial survey is the most common method of monitoring giraffe population trends in the vast roadless tracts of African landscapes, but aerial methods are known to undercount giraffes. Ground-based survey methods are more accurate and can be used in conjunction with aerial surveys to make accurate estimates of population sizes and trends. The Giraffe Conservation Foundation has been criticized for alleged mistreatment of giraffes and giraffe scientists.\nSee also"}

They are a part of the Giraffidae family, with the only other member being the okapi. These even-toed ungulates tower over all other animals and are the world\u2019s tallest living mammal. Once having a wide range over Africa, today they can only be found spread out throughout the Subsaharan in open woodlands and savannas. A giraffes height is extraordinary, but there are other amazing things to learn about this animal. Here are ten incredible facts that you should know about giraffes.\n1. A Giraffe\u2019s Neck Can Be Over 7 Feet\nGiraffe necks can stretch 7 feet! iStock.com/Michel VIARD\nA giraffe\u2019s neck is one of its most notable features, and can even weigh as much as 600 pounds. The neck of each giraffe varies, but some are as long as 7 feet tall, making up over half its height. This allows the animal to reach tall leaves in trees and scan the area for nearby predators.\nMale giraffes can even be seen \u201cnecking\u201d, which is where they fight by swinging their large necks at each other. Humans and giraffes have the same number of vertebrae, but theirs can be over 10 inches long.\n2. Giraffes Have A Blood Pressure Double Of Humans\nGiraffes have the highest blood pressure of any other animal which they need to survive because of their massive height. To have a normal blood pressure of 110/70 their heart is extremely powerful and has a blood pressure of around 220/80. Humans only have a blood pressure of around 120/80Hg, and if they had the same as giraffes it would be deadly!\nGiraffes have an amazing cardio-circulatory system optimized for their large size. Their heart is small for its size but is surrounded by thick muscles in the left ventricle to pump blood all the way to its head. The heart can pump as fast as 170 bpm.\n3. Giraffes Can Run Up To 35 mph\nA Giraffe Family on the African savannah. They can run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances, or cruise at 10 mph over longer distances. Craig Fraser/Shutterstock.com\nGiraffes are fast for their large size and can reach a top speed of 37 mph in short distances, which is faster than some horses and all humans. Their walking speed is a quick 10mph. Their speed helps avoid predators even though they are not the fastest. Lions, hyenas, and cheetahs are some of the animals they must defend themselves from.\n4. Baby Giraffes Can Walk Within 30 min And Are 6 Feet Tall\nA baby giraffe with its mother iStock.com/Amit\nBaby giraffes are tall when they are born and are usually around 6 feet in height. Even with their large size, they are still able to walk within about 30 minutes of being born. When learning how to walk it can resemble an infant as it stumbles around. Babies need to be quick when learning as it can be a matter of life or death. Mothers will kick their babies as motivation for them to stand. Predators are always lurking, so they must be able to walk quickly to be able to keep up with their families.\n5. Giraffes Can Survive On 30 Minutes Of Sleep\nGiraffes can sleep standing up umat34/Shutterstock.com\nOn average, a giraffe will sleep around 4.6 hours a day. At night is when they sleep the most but they will take short naps throughout the day. Compared to other animals giraffes can survive off an extremely short amount of sleep. They are able to survive off only 30 minutes of sleep and operate regularly. Giraffes are an animal that sleeps standing up, occasionally laying down. To avoid predators they sleep standing up and only for short periods of time.\n6. Giraffes Eat Over 75 Pounds Of Food A Day\nGiraffes are ruminants and have four compartments in their stomach. They chew their food and swallow it twice. Their different stomach compartments help them easily digest food. Being so large, giraffes need to be constantly eating to survive. Giraffes eat up to 75 lbs of food a day, mostly eating leaves from trees like the acacia. Giraffes will spend around 18 hours a day eating.\n7. Giraffes Are Amazing Pollinators\nWhile Many people don\u2019t know this, giraffes are one of Africa\u2018s greatest pollinators. Like bees, they transfer pollen from tree to tree. Pollen gets stuck on their body then transfers to the next plant while they eat. Acacia leaves and flowers are their preferred food and they spend most of their day foraging and pollinating.\n8. Giraffes Can Go 21 Days Without Drinking Water\nGiraffes can go up to 21 days without drinking water, which is longer than a camel. This is because of their diet and constant eating, where they get water from the leaves that they eat. When a giraffe does drink, it can consume as much as 54 liters in one sitting. Funny enough, their necks are not long enough for them to reach the ground and drink, so they must spread their legs and squat.\n9. Giraffes Live In Groups Called Towers\nGiraffes live together in large numbers in groups called towers. Each tower has around 10 to 20 members. Some towers have been as large as 50 giraffes. Each group is different and can consist of all-female, males, or a mix. A large group of giraffes is more equipped to handle predators. Members of the tower can come and go as they please.\n10. Each Giraffe Has A Unique Spot Pattern\nNo list of giraffe facts would be complete without a look at their spots!\nOne of the giraffe\u2019s most distinctive features is its spots and each giraffe has a unique pattern of spots on them, similar to a human and their fingerprint. Spots are also one of the main factors in identifying different subspecies.\nFor the average individual it is hard to tell the difference between a giraffes\u2019 spots, but giraffes who live together use it to tell family members apart. Their spots are not just for looks but are also used for camouflage and releasing heat."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe Animal Facts", "url": "https://dailyanimalfacts.com/giraffe-animal-facts/", "text": "We are going to discuss the amazing facts about giraffe because most of the people are not aware of these facts. The giraffe is the tallest most species on earth and is mostly found in the forests of Africa. With the passage of time, the giraffe is continuously disappearing from Africa. You will come to know the reason when you will be aware of the amazing facts about them.\n1. Name of the giraffe\nThe name of the giraffe is derived from the Latin word Giraffa camelopardalis.in English, it is also called Camelopard. The reason for this name is that it resembles with the camels and the leopards in shape that is why anciently it was known by this name. Now everyone is familiar with the animal named as a giraffe.\n2. Giraffes are generally quit\nDo you think that Giraffe is mute? May be you are wrong. Giraffe uses different vocal voices and sounds that they use to communicate with each other or with other species. If we do the comparison between the male and the female Giraffe, their sounds are quietly different. Male Giraffe coughs more loudly then females. Giraffe also uses flute-like sounds that they use to communicate. They can also communicate even from long distances. They usually hum at night and its reason is still not known.\n3. Their heartbeat is quick as compared to other mammals\nYou will amaze to know that even these animals are huge in size but they have a smaller heart. Their heart beats approximately 170 times per minute. The blood pressure of the giraffe is doubled so that the flow of blood will be maintained towards the brain.\n4. Amazing facts about giraffe\u2019s fingerprints\nAs the humans don\u2019t have the same fingerprints, similarly, two giraffes of same or different species can\u2019t have same fingerprints. This is the best way to distinguishing one Giraffe from others.\n5. Horns of the giraffe\nThe horns of the giraffe are known as \u2018ossicones\u2019. We can easily differentiate the giraffe from other species from their horns because both the male and the female giraffe have the horns. You will not aware of their horns because these are made from tissues that are covered from the skin or fur. These giraffes have the horns by birth but to save them from any type of injury, these horns are not attached with the skull. If you want to differentiate between the male and the female giraffe, look at their horns. Males have comparatively thicker horns than a female giraffe.\n6. They live in the form of groups\nGiraffe prefers to live in the form of groups and their grouping is named as \u201ca tower of the giraffe\u201d. This animal is social-group living together. If they have to cover some distance, they also move in the form of a tower. Between the several hours, the composition of such species will be changed. Due to this reason, their socialization is considered as the fission-fusion type of socialism. These are not only socialize with their own species but also with the others. Usually, the male giraffe makes the group with the young one. They also prefer to join the group of the females and to drink mate with them.\n7. Giraffe has a long neck\nIts long neck is the best way to distinguish them from other species. These are not only one species that are present in the forests. From all the other species, its long neck is the best source to differentiate it from others. They can swing their neck repeatedly and immediately. Although this is the fact that it has the long neck but the number of vertebrae is the same in its neck as in the other mammals. Each vertebra of it is 25cm long that is the reason to give its neck tallest look. Their neck helps them a lot in necking.\n8. The structure of the giraffe resembles other species\nIf we talk about the physical appearance of the giraffe, we can say that it resembles much with the species called okapi that is found in the forests of Congo. The reason for the resemblance is having the same shape of the body as the giraffe usually has. The only difference is that the giraffe has the longest neck than okapi. Okapi also has the horns that are totally covered with the fur. Its teeth and horns also resemble with a giraffe. But female okapi doesn\u2019t have horns so you can easily differentiate them from a giraffe.\n9. Sub-species of giraffe\nAnother interesting fact is diagnosed some time before; there are almost nine subspecies of a giraffe that are found in the forests of Africa. These animals are found in the form of groups. These are not only found only in Africa, but these can also be found in some other countries. There is not a huge difference in all these species. Due to some minor differences, these are categorized into subspecies. Different researches are being made on the giraffe but there is still no confirmation about the mystery of giraffe genetics. We can also differentiate these species by their size and by other such factors.\n10. Their quantity is decreasing day by day\nYou should know the maximum numbers of giraffe are found in Africa. But from several years, their quantity is decreasing day by day. After the great research, it is concluded that their quantity has decreased up to 40%. The species that are present there are also in great pressure. All its subspecies are also in the very least amount. You will be shocked to hear that the West African giraffe are only less than 400 and the Rothschild\u2019s giraffe are only 1500 that are left there. There is a great threat of fragmentation to these species.\nMost of us only know their name. These all are the amazing facts about the giraffe that someone must know."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Giraffe-facts.html", "text": "giraffe Facts\nPortrait of a Giraffe\nThe giraffe and its closest relative the okapi are the last survivors of the once plentiful Giraffidae family. While the okapi is a solitary, forest dwelling creature rarely seen, the giraffe is a true show stopper, herds of which wander in surprising abundance across the African savanna.\nToday the giraffe is the tallest animal on Earth, with males topping out at about 18 feet at the tip of the horns (called occicones), and 11 feet at the shoulder.\nAlthough no fossil trail exists, it is assumed the giraffe developed its remarkable physique and out-survived its relatives, by reaching for the treetops.\nAs taller individuals ate leaves and fruits unavailable to shorter individuals, the giraffe thrived, and became more and more specialized. While the 6 to 8 foot long, 600 pound neck is most obvious, the giraffes entire body is a masterpiece of specialization.\nViewed from the side, the giraffes shoulder region is towering, with a highly elongated pectoral girdle which gives the illusion that the front legs are longer than the rear. Front and rear legs are about the same length, however, between 5.5 and 6 feet long.\nWhile the relatively short back has vertebrae of a median size, the vertebrae of the neck, are stretched to about 11 inches long, They still have the standard 7 neck vertebrae found in most mammals, including us, but they are not only elongated, but also articulate far more than ours.\nThe neck is supported by powerful muscles and reinforced ligaments which anchor to vertebrae between the shoulder blades, and form a hump where the back and neck meet.\nThe head is refined, streamlined and equipped with an 18 inch long tongue for even further reach.\nBoth males and females have horns known as \"occicones\", which are formed from cartilage and covered with skin. Females have thinner occicones, that are tufted with longer hair on top. Males occicones are larger, have knobs on the ends, and become bald on top as they mature.\nGiraffes live in very loose groups of 3 to 40 or so, mostly related individuals. They are not territorial, and their social structure is very peaceful and cooperative..\nThough the giraffe is the worlds tallest animal, it is, by mammal standards, remarkably peaceful, with very little territorial drive. Even aggression between adult bulls is limited to largely harmless \"necking\" displays.\nMales and females mingle, young are protected by herd members, and individuals take turns looking out for eachother while drinking or napping.\nGiraffes have a \"fission-fusion\" society, that means groups come together and break apart freely, and friendships and alliances are loose and varied.\nWhat Sound Does a Giraffe Make?\nWhile some may incorrectly report that giraffes make no sounds at all, they are, in fact, diverse in vocalizations, emitting grunts, snorts and flute-like noises of different meaning. Giraffe vocalizations are infrequent, however, and are usually at very low volume. The loudest giraffe calls are from baby giraffes separated from their mother - these are robust, guttural grunts that sound very much like the calls of large adult deer such as elk.\nThe length between lungs and vocal chords could be the reason why there is a limit on the production and volume of giraffe noises, but new research has also found that giraffes make sounds we simply can't hear because they are at too low a frequency. In 2015, it was discovered and documented that giraffes in zoos hummed to eachother. This humming was only at night, and only in the dark, and far too low for humans to hear. - Amazing!\nhow do giraffes sleep?\nBecause they are always on the move and always eating, even overnight, t was once thought that giraffes never sleep. After lots of observation it was discovered that the giraffe sleeps 1 or 2 hours a day, and usually only a few minutes at a time. Adults generally sleep standing up, while youngsters lie down and rest their head on their rump.\nWhat do giraffes eat and how do they drink?\nLike cows, giraffes have multiple stomach chambers and \"chew their cud\", meaning they regurgitate partially digested food back up their 6 foot long throat, to re-chew it one mouthful at a time.\nWith this method, they get as much nutrients as they can from the leaves and fruits they consume. The giraffes top lip, and its 18 inch long tongue, are not only prehensile, allowing them to grasp leaves and branches, but are also extraordinarily tough, protecting them from damage as they munch on the leaves from their favorite tree the Acacia - which has 3 inch long thorns! Giraffes have a hard thickness of tissue called the \"dental pad\" in place of the top front teeth, which they grind their food against. Giraffes are some of the largest land animals, and need up to 70 pounds of food a day to survive. They spend almost all of their time grazing among, tall branches for herbs, vines, flowers and fruits, but will lower their heads and graze off the ground if something is tempting enough. Because their legs are so long, they must either bend the front legs, or spread them awkwardly wide, especially to drink. This is a vulnerable position for them, and herd members will take turns looking out for predators while others drink. They can go for long periods without water, and regularly go for days without a drink.\nWhat are giraffe predators?\nGiraffe kills a hyena\nBecause of their immense size, healthy adult giraffes have little to fear out on the savanna. They are extremely cautious, with excellent hearing and eyesight, and effortlessly swift if they spot danger. But more importantly, a giraffes kick can be lethal to even the largest predator.\nGiraffes have been known to kill leopards, hyenas, African wild dogs and adult male lions with a few - and sometimes just one- well-aimed strikes. They can kick with front and rear legs, and are simply too great a risk for even the hungriest on the plains.\nWhile they are still young, however, giraffe calves may fall prey to any of the large predators on the Savanna. Mothers will try to defend their young, but about half of the baby giraffes born will be lost in the first 6 months.\nherd of Masai girrafes\na few more giraffe facts\ngiraffes snuggling\nThe giraffe is the largest ruminant and the worlds tallest animal\nMale giraffes can be 18 feet tall at the top of the horns\nGiraffes have 2 to 5 horns called \"occicones\"\nThe giraffes neck is 6 to 8 feet long and can weigh over 600 pounds\nGiraffes \"chew their cud\" just like cows\nGiraffes defend themselves by kicking\nA giraffes kick can kill a lion!\nThe giraffes tongue is about 18 inches long\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Artiodactyla\nFamily Giraffidae\nGenus Giraffa\nSpecies camelopardalis\nGiraffe Facts - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT bull cow calf herd HOME HABITAT LIFESPAN FAVORITE FOOD Africa Asia savanna 20-25 years acacai leaves ENEMIES GENDER DIFFERENCE AVG.

Check out our ten facts about the beautiful giraffe\u2026\nGiraffe facts\n1) Giraffes are found in the dry savannahs of Africa, where they roam among the open plains and woodlands.\n2) Well known for their long necks, these gentle giants are the world\u2019s tallest living land animals. An adult male can grow to around 5.5m \u2013 that\u2019s taller than three adult humans!\nLove animals? You\u2019d love our magazine! Ask your parents to check out Nat Geo Kids magazine!\n(AD)\n3) A giraffe\u2019s height is helpful for keeping a look out for predators, such as lions and hyenas. Their excellent eyesight allows them to spot hungry beasts from far away, too.\n4) Herbivores, giraffes only eat plants. Their favourite grub is the acacia tree, and they use their long necks to reach the leaves and buds in the treetops. Their long tongues (which grow to a whopping 53cm!) also help them pull down leaves growing way up high.\n5) And boy do these guys have an appetite! They spend most of their time eating, and can guzzle up to 45kg of leaves and twigs a day!\nDid you know that we have a FREE downloadable giraffe primary resource? Great for teachers, homeschoolers and parents alike!\n6) Whilst they may eat a lot, giraffes don\u2019t drink much water. This is because they get most of their water from their leafy meals, and only need to drink once every few days.\n7) Giraffes are very social animals and roam around in groups. These groups, called towers, typically have around 15 members led by an adult male. The other members are females and young males.\n8) To see who is stronger, males (called bulls) fight by butting their long necks and heads. This is known as \u201cnecking\u201c. These fights aren\u2019t usually dangerous, and end when one bull admits defeat and walks away.\n9) Female giraffes give birth standing up. The result? Newborns are welcomed to the world with a 1.5m drop to the ground! Ouch! But these infants are quick to get on their feet \u2013 within 30 minutes they are standing, and only hours later they\u201dre able to run with their mothers.\n10) In the wild these beautiful creatures live for around 25 years. In captivity they live longer, and have been known to reach 40 years old.\nImages \u24d2 Getty Images: Giraffe and babies, (10014200).

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe Facts You\u2019ll Never Forget", "url": "https://kidadl.com/animal-facts/giraffe-facts", "text": "Giraffe Interesting Facts\nWhat type of animal is a giraffe?\nA giraffe is a long-necked animal of the giraffidae family native to Africa. Just like humans, a giraffe also has seven vertebrates in its neck. These animals are herbivores which means they only eat green leafy food.\nWhat class of animal does a giraffe belong to?\nA giraffe belongs to the mammal class of animals. Four of the most popular giraffe subspecies are northern giraffe (giraffa camelopardalis), reticulated giraffe (giraffa camelopardalis reticulata), rothschild's giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi), West African giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis peralta).\nHow many giraffes are there in the world?\nThe giraffe population has faced a massive population decline in the last few decades. The population has dropped down to only 68,000 individuals left in the forests of Africa. The main reason behind this huge decline was deforestation leading to habitat loss. Apart from it, they were also being hunted by humans which reduced their population to such an extent.\nWhere does a giraffe live?\nThe majority of the giraffe population is found living in the open grasslands and woodlands of the eastern parts of Africa. This African species can be found residing in reserves like the Serengeti National Park and Amboseli National Park in Africa. A few populations of the species can also be found in the southern parts of Africa.\nWhat is a giraffe's habitat?\nGiraffes prefer to live in the wild amongst open woodlands and grasslands as these areas have an abundant growth of Acacia. Acacia is basically a genus of trees and shrubs. Giraffes love to eat wild acacia, so they are most likely to make their home in areas where there is ample acacia growth.\nWho do giraffes live with?\nGiraffes usually live in groups known as herds. It is to be noted that not all the giraffes will live in a herd. Some giraffes, mostly males, prefer to live a solitary life. However, there is no hard and fast rule. A giraffe can either live in a group or be solitary as well. Leaving and joining the group is completely voluntary. Members are allowed to join and leave whenever they want. Giraffes are widely spread, and that's why they may appear to be having no contact with one another at all, but actually, it's not true.\nHow long does a giraffe live?\nA giraffe species has an average life span of 25 years living in the wild. In captivity these beasts might live for a longer period.\nHow do they reproduce?\nGiraffes are mostly polygamous animals. The few dominant males wish to mate with the most fertile female. There is no specific time for the breeding season. It can begin at any point of time throughout the year. But yes, calves are usually born during the drier seasons.\nA giraffe becomes sexually mature after becoming 3-4 years old, but they will start mating after the age of 6-7 years. Female giraffes must be physically big enough to handle the pregnancy.\nAs soon as males pass their qualifications for breeding, they start a ritual fight with other males wherein male giraffes use their long necks and heads. Giraffes are non-territorial animals, so the male who wins in the ritual gets to mate with accessible female giraffes. The gestation period lasts for about 13-15 months. During the first birth, females make a calving area which they use throughout their lifetime.\nThe delivery of the calf is quite noticeable. The female stands on her all four legs and the baby falls down on the ground. It is to be noted that the baby, even after falling from a height, doesn't get injured.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nThe conservation status of giraffes is Vulnerable. The reason behind this is that the giraffe population faced massive population decline in recent decades. The population has dropped down to only 68,000 individuals left in the forests of Africa. The main reason behind this huge decline was deforestation leading to habitat loss.\nGiraffe Fun Facts\nWhat do giraffes look like?\nGiraffes are a tall and enormous creature which is recognized by their long neck and tall physique. They have long legs and a white-yellow coat with brown spots on it. Surprisingly, the coat pattern of a giraffe is unique to the individual animal. Both males and females have two hair-covered giraffe horns that are called ossicones which are attached to the giraffe skull. Their long legs can go up to 6 ft in length. Recently one albino giraffe was discovered in the wilderness but studies proved that it is the last surviving white giraffe whose skin color is due to leucism, a genetic condition that causes skin cells to have no pigmentation.\nHow cute are they?\nDespite their enormous physique, every cute giraffe face looks totally adorable. The main reason behind the cuteness of a little giraffe is the cute face and calm nature.\nHow do they communicate?\nGiraffes are mostly silent. Their communication pattern is such that giraffe sounds are not completely audible to humans as they have an infrasonic way of communicating. Their moans and grunts are so low that it is hardly audible to us. Apart from this, they can also communicate through gestures, eyes, and touch.\nHow big is a Giraffe?\nA giraffe can be up to 21 ft tall with the long legs themselves measuring up to 6 ft, which makes it the tallest mammal on the earth. Newborn calves are around 7 ft tall and weigh around 100-160 pounds. Giraffe calves grow 3 in each day during the initial first week of their lives.\nHow fast can a giraffe run?\nGiraffes are really fast runners. Giraffes can run at an impressing speed of 40 miles per hour over short distances.\nHow much does a giraffe weigh?\nThe average weight of a giraffe is somewhere between 1500-3,000 lb.\nWhat are their male and female names of the species?\nA male giraffe is called a bull, and a female giraffe is called a cow.\nWhat would you call a baby giraffe?\nA baby giraffe is called a calf. The newborn giraffes or calves are able to stand on their feet just within a few hours of birth.\nWhat do they eat?\nGiraffes are herbivores, and the majority of their diet is based on leaves and similar plant materials. The almost 20-22 in giraffe tongue helps them reach their preferred diet, comprising the leaves of Acacia and Mimosa trees. Apart from these, they can also eat vines, herbs, climbers, flowers, and fruits. The diet of giraffes contains a lesser amount of grass. Giraffes need at least 75 lb of food per day. Giraffes are known for spending the majority of their time eating. Giraffe water consumption every day is around 38-40 litres.\nAre they dangerous?\nGiraffes are calm animals; they usually do not showcase aggressive behavior unless they are threatened.\nThey usually run away from dangerous spots, but that does not imply that they are totally harmless. A giraffe can kick in order to defend itself, and this kick can cause serious injuries.\nWould they make a good pet?\nNo, the reason is that they are extremely tall and will need a lot of accommodation. And let's suppose somehow you manage to provide them with ample living space, then you have to also provide them with at least 75 lb of food per day.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nDid you know...\nIt will be surprising for you to know that giraffes also have seven vertebrates in the giraffe neck, just like humans.\nThe giraffe name, giraffa camelopardalis, means a camel with a leopard's coat.\nThe tongue of the giraffe is 20 inches long and dark-colored. The dark color of the tongue helps them in preventing excess sun exposure.\nDo giraffes have 2 hearts?\nNo, it is a common misunderstanding. Giraffes do not have two hearts. They only have one heart.\nIs eating giraffe illegal?\nIt is mostly illegal to eat a giraffe, but in very rare circumstances a giraffe is eaten.\nHow to draw a giraffe?\nIf you are up for giraffe drawing, then follow the steps mentioned below for the most impressive giraffe silhouette.\nFirstly, draw two circles with one vertically above the other. Between these two circles leave a reasonable gap as the length of the neck of your giraffe will be based on this gap. Now, join the two circles by drawing a pair of curved lines in a manner that forms the shape of the giraffe's neck. The upper circle will be the giraffe head, and now draw a curved line to make an oval-like shape in front of the head. This oval shape will be the giraffe's face. Now, draw an oval shape just at the base of its neck. This oval shape will form the belly area of your giraffe.Now, in order to give a proper shape to your giraffe's body, connect these shapes and outline the neck, stomach, and back of your giraffe. From the base of the stomach, draw the legs of your giraffe. Then draw the horns and ears of your giraffes at a slightly backward position of the head. Now, the basic body structure of your giraffe is ready, now you just have to give a proper outline to your giraffe. And after outlining the main lines, erase the rough lines. Now, draw the eyes, lips, and spots on the body of your giraffe. And with this the drawing of your giraffe is complete. Now, fill the colors in your giraffe. Giraffes have a yellow coat with sandy brown or tan spots on it. And once you are done coloring, your giraffe will be ready.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly animal facts for everyone to discover! Learn more about some other mammals including zorse, or mountain goat.\nYou can even occupy yourself at home by drawing one on our giraffe coloring pages."}

Interesting: The neck of a giraffe is up to 8.2 feet (2.5 meters) long and weigh 550 lb (250 kg)!\nWhy Does a Giraffe Have Spots?\nViewed from a close distance, the giraffe\u2019s coat pattern looks rather conspicuous. You may ask yourself: Is the giraffe tired of life? Such an unusual coat should be easy to detect for animals of prey. Yet, the large blotches indeed serve as camouflage. They make the giraffe look like a tree or part of the landscape from larger distances. By the way, the blotches of male giraffes get darker in the course of time.\nGiraffes Use Their Spots to Beat the Heat\nThe spots also help the giraffe to adjust its body temperature. There are large blood vessels around each of the dark patches, right underneath the bright lines. Small blood vessels branch off underneath the patch. To cool off, the giraffe sends blood to the center of the patches. They work like \"windows\" through which the giraffe can release heat.\nBehavior\nHow Do Giraffes Drink Water?\nIt is well known that camels can do without water for a long time. A giraffe can survive even longer without water.\nSenses and Abilities\nGiraffe vs. Lion - Who Wins?\nA healthy adult giraffe can kill a lion with a kick of its hoofs.\nDoes a Giraffe Make Sounds?\nFor a long time people thought that giraffes hardly utter any sounds. Yet, they do communicate on an infrasound frequency below 20 Hz most of the time. This frequency is so low that most humans cannot hear it. Giraffes can detect these unbelievably deep sounds over large distances and thus stay in contact with each other.\nReproduction\nGiraffes babies come into the world after 14-15 months. With their body weight of about 50 kg they fall on the ground from a height of almost 6.56 feet (2 meters) without getting injured. At first they feel a bit groggy and wobbly on their legs, but they are able to walk after a short while. If giraffe mothers are concerned about their young, they utter barking sounds. The little ones reply bleating, mewing or mooing.\nThe Giraffe Is Related To:\nAnimals in the Same Biome:"}

Their conservation status was reclassified from a species of least concern to vulnerable in 2016 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature , in response to increased mortality rates brought on by habitat loss and illegal hunting.\nGiraffes eat new shoots and leaves, mainly from the thorny acacia tree. The tongue and the inside of the mouth are lined with tough tissue that protects against the thorns.\nMost giraffes live in grasslands and open woodlands in East Africa, especially in reserves such as the Serengeti National Park and the Amboseli National Park . Some are also found in the reserves of Southern Africa.\nSummary\ngiraffe, (genus Giraffa), any of four species in the genus Giraffa of long-necked cud-chewing hoofed mammals of Africa, with long legs and a coat pattern of irregular brown patches on a light background. Giraffes are the tallest of all land animals; males (bulls) may exceed 5.5 metres (18 feet) in height, and the tallest females (cows) are about 4.5 metres. Using prehensile tongues almost half a metre long, they are able to browse foliage almost six metres from the ground. Giraffes are a common sight in grasslands and open woodlands in East Africa, where they can be seen in reserves such as Tanzania\u2019s Serengeti National Park and Kenya\u2019s Amboseli National Park. The genus Giraffa is made up of the northern giraffe (G. camelopardalis), the southern giraffe (G. giraffa), the Masai giraffe (G. tippelskirchi), and the reticulated giraffe (G. reticulata).\nGiraffes grow to nearly their full height by four years of age but gain weight until they are seven or eight. Males weigh up to 1,930 kg (4,250 pounds), females up to 1,180 kg (2,600 pounds). The tail may be a metre in length and has a long black tuft on the end; there is also a short black mane. Both sexes have a pair of horns, though males possess other bony protuberances on the skull. The back slopes downward to the hindquarters, a silhouette explained mainly by large muscles that support the neck; these muscles are attached to long spines on the vertebrae of the upper back. There are only seven neck (cervical) vertebrae, but they are elongated. Thick-walled arteries in the neck have extra valves to counteract gravity when the head is up; when the giraffe lowers its head to the ground, special vessels at the base of the brain control blood pressure.\nBritannica Quiz Know Your Mammals Quiz Where can you find a capybara? How many cervical vertebrae do giraffes have? Test your knowledge of mammals by taking this quiz.\nThe gait of the giraffe is a pace (both legs on one side move together). In a gallop, it pushes off with the hind legs, and the front legs come down almost together, but no two hooves touch the ground at the same time. The neck flexes so that balance is maintained. Speeds of 50 km (31 miles) per hour can be maintained for several kilometres, but 60 km (37 miles) per hour can be attained over short distances. Arabs say of a good horse that it can \u201coutpace a giraffe.\u201d\nGiraffes live in nonterritorial groups of up to 20. Home ranges are as small as 85 square km (33 square miles) in wetter areas but up to 1,500 square km (580 square miles) in dry regions. The animals are gregarious, a behaviour that apparently allows for increased vigilance against predators. They have excellent eyesight, and when one giraffe stares, for example, at a lion a kilometre away, the others look in that direction too. Giraffes live up to 26 years in the wild and slightly longer in captivity.\nGiraffes prefer to eat new shoots and leaves, mainly from the thorny acacia tree. Cows in particular select high-energy low-fibre items. They are prodigious eaters, and a large male consumes about 65 kg (145 pounds) of food per day. The tongue and inside of the mouth are coated with tough tissue as protection. The giraffe grasps leaves with its prehensile lips or tongue and pulls them into the mouth. If the foliage is not thorny, the giraffe \u201ccombs\u201d leaves from the stem by pulling it across the lower canine and incisor teeth. Giraffes obtain most water from their food, though in the dry season they drink at least every three days. They must spread the forelegs apart in order to reach the ground with the head.\nFemales first breed at four or five years of age. Gestation is 15 months, and, though most calves are born in dry months in some areas, births can take place in any month of the year. The single offspring is about 2 metres (6 feet) tall and weighs 100 kg (220 pounds). For a week the mother licks and nuzzles her calf in isolation while they learn each other\u2019s scent. Thereafter, the calf joins a \u201cnursery group\u201d of similar-aged youngsters, while mothers forage at variable distances. If lions or hyenas attack, a mother sometimes stands over her calf, kicking at the predators with front and back legs. Cows have food and water requirements that may keep them away from the nursery group for hours at a time, and about half of very young calves are killed by lions and hyenas. Calves sample vegetation at three weeks but suckle for 18\u201322 months. Males join other bachelors when one to two years old, whereas daughters are likely to stay near the mother.\nRothschild's giraffe Rothschild's giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) in Murchison Falls National Park, northern Uganda. \u00a9 Hector Conesa/Shutterstock.com\nBulls eight years and older travel up to 20 km per day looking for cows in heat (estrus). Younger males spend years in bachelor groups, where they engage in \u201cnecking\u201d bouts. These side-to-side clashes of heads cause mild damage, and bone deposits subsequently form around the horns, eyes, and back of the head; a single lump projects from between the eyes. Accumulation of bone deposits continues through life, resulting in skulls weighing 30 kg. Necking also establishes a social hierarchy. Violence sometimes occurs when two older bulls converge on an estrous cow. The advantage of a heavy, knobbed skull is soon apparent. With forelegs braced, bulls swing their necks and club each other with their skulls, aiming for the underbelly. There have been instances of bulls being knocked off their feet or even rendered unconscious.\nPaintings of giraffes appear on early Egyptian tombs; just as today, giraffe tails were prized for the long wiry tuft hairs used to weave belts and jewelry. In the 13th century, East Africa supplied a trade in hides. During the 19th and 20th centuries, overhunting, habitat destruction, and rinderpest epidemics introduced by European livestock reduced giraffes to less than half their former range. Today giraffes are numerous in East African countries and also in certain reserves of Southern Africa, where they have enjoyed somewhat of a recovery. The West African subspecies of the northern giraffe is reduced to a small range in Niger.\nGiraffes were traditionally classified into one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, and then into several subspecies on the basis of physical features. Nine subspecies were recognized by coat pattern similarities; however, it was also known that individual coat patterns were unique. Some scientists contended that these animals could be divided into six or more species, since studies had shown that differences in genetics, reproductive timing, and pelage patterns (which are indicative of reproductive isolation) exist between various groups. By the 2010s mitochondrial DNA studies had determined that genetic uniquenesses brought on by the reproductive isolation of one group from another were significant enough to separate giraffes into four distinct species.\nreticulated giraffe Reticulated giraffe (Giraffa reticulata), Kenya. \u00a9 Corbis\nThe giraffe had long been classified as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which places all giraffes in the species G. camelopardalis. A study in 2016, however, determined that habitat loss resulting from expanding agricultural activities, increased mortality brought on by illegal hunting, and the effects of ongoing civil unrest in a handful of African countries had caused giraffe populations to plummet by 36\u201340 percent between 1985 and 2015, and, as of 2016, the IUCN has reclassified the conservation status of the species as vulnerable.\nThe only close relative of the giraffe is the rainforest-dwelling okapi, which is the only other member of the family Giraffidae. G. camelopardalis or something very similar lived in Tanzania two million years ago, but Giraffidae branched off from other members of the order Artiodactyla\u2014cattle, antelope, and deer\u2014about 34 million years ago."}

In Latin, giraffes are referred to as \u201cGiraffe Camelopardalis,\u201d which means \u201cone who walks quickly, a camel marked like a leopard.\u201d Giraffes have even-toed ungulates.\nGiraffes have four different species, namely Masai giraffe (Giraffa tippelskirchi), northern giraffe (Giraffa Camelopardalis), reticulated giraffe (Giraffa reticulate), and the southern giraffe (Giraffa giraffe), which evolved separately according to DNA.\nInteresting Facts\n1. Sex\nOne can determine a giraffe\u2019s sex by its ossicones. The female has their ossicones covered with tufts of hair while their male counterparts have bald ossicones. The male giraffes can grow up to 19 feet tall and weigh over 4,000 pounds, while the female is up to 16 feet tall and weigh 2,500 pounds.\n2. Diet\nA giraffe\u2019s diet mainly consists of fresh leaves at treetops and twigs. As much as giraffes are considered herbivorous, they sometimes eat bones from carcasses to be able to meet their need for calcium and phosphorous to strengthen their bone. This kind of behavior is referred to as osteophagy. Giraffes can consume over 65 pounds of food in a single day.\n3. Height\nGiraffes are the tallest mammals, with heights reaching up to 5.5 meters.\n4. Speed\nGiraffes can achieve speeds of up to 35 miles per hour on short distances and 10 miles per hour while covering long distances.\n5. Heart\nThey have a huge heart that weighs approximately 25 pounds, and this has a crucial role in pumping and circulation of around 60 liters of blood to the brain and body. Their lungs are almost eight times the size of a human lung and have a much lower intake of air.\n6. Water\nGiraffe\u2019s intake of water is limited to once every few days since they get most of their water from plants they eat. They experience awkward moments when drinking water from a source since their necks aren\u2019t able to reach the ground directly; thus have to shuffle, kneel and splay their legs to get a good drinking angle. At one sitting, giraffes can have an intake of ten gallons of water.\n7. Tongue\nTheir tongues can grow up to 45centimeters long, and they are darkly colored to prevent sunburns since they stick out their tongues most of the time. Having a prehensile tongue makes it easy for a giraffe to grip food, just like an elephant trunk. Giraffes use their tongues to pick their nose.\n8. Teeth\nThey have a set of 32 teeth which are place at the front of the bottom jaw and back of the top jaw, and additionally have a dental pad hat assists to grip leaves or twigs.\n9. Play a great role in Pollination.\nDue to their great heights, giraffes are considered to be one of the best agents of cross-pollination as they transfer genetic materials from the flowers of one tree to another.\n10. Relative\nThe only animal that is related to the giraffe is the Okapi which falls in the Giraffidae family, although the Okapi has a shorter neck and has black and white stripes like a zebra and has a long tongue that measures 14 to 18 inches enabling them to lick their eyelids and ears.\n11. Sibling\nAt birth, a giraffe takes almost half an hour before it can stand on its feet and up to 10 hours before it can run.\n12. Life span\nThe normal life span of a giraffe is around 25 years. Giraffes spend most of their life span living in herds.\n13. Sound\nGiraffes will snort, moo or hum when they sense danger or during the night when resting.\n14. Sex and reproduction\nGiraffes mate and give birth while standing. The gestation period of a giraffe is 450days, and they give birth to a calf weighing around 100 kilograms and a height of 1.6 meters tall. They often go back to where they were born to give birth. The calf falls headfirst to the ground a distance of over five feet, and this also detaches the embryo from the mother.\n15. Best Friend\nGiraffe\u2019s best friend is the Oxpecker since it plays a vital role in feeding on insects, mites, and ticks that live on the giraffe\u2019s neck.\n16. Social\nThey are very social, non-territorial, and move in packs of around 15 to 30 members called a tower which is led by a male adult.\n17. Spots\nEach giraffe has its unique spots just like fingerprints, and every species have different unique type of spot patterns.\n18. Eyelashes\nThey have very long eyelashes that protect them from sand and insects.\n19. Endangered Population\nTheir numbers have drastically dropped by almost 40% in the past 50 years and are vulnerable to extinction due to poaching, human encroachment, diseases, and climate change.\n20. White Giraffe\nWhite giraffes are very rare and suffer from a genetic disorder called leucism that affects the production of pigment on their skin.\n21. Sleep\nGiraffes sleep between ten minutes to two hours and mostly sleep while standing.\n22. Stomach\nGiraffes have four stomach chambers that play different roles in the digestion of food.\n23. Horns\nThe two horns on a giraffe are called ossicones and are made of cartilage covered with skin.\n24. Bones\nTheir necks have seven vertebrae, thus having a similarity with the number of bones as a human neck.\n25. Kick\nGiraffes have very strong kicks that could shatter an animal\u2019s skull.\n26. Stink Bulls\nGiraffes produce a pungent smell to defend themselves against parasites and insects, and this odor is nicknamed \u201cstink bulls.\u201d The odor consists of antibiotics and foul-smelling chemicals that repel parasites.\n27. Neck\nTheir long necks act as a defense mechanism to help them keep an eye on predators. Giraffes use their six feet necks to fight each other by swinging them at each other and would result in damage due to the impact and the weight that is around 600 pounds. Due to a dense network of capillaries, valves, and blood vessels that prevent backflow of blood and rapid changes in blood pressure in the brain, giraffes can avoid collapsing when lifting and lowering their heads."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Giraffe images!\nGiraffe Classification and Evolution\nThe Giraffe is a long-necked, hoofed mammal that is natively found grazing in the open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. The Giraffe is the tallest living animal on land and despite its height is mostly closely related to the much smaller and solitary Okapi, that is found elusively dwelling in the dense tropical forests. There are nine recognised sub-species of Giraffe that are found in differing geographic locations and vary somewhat in the colour and pattern of their spot-like markings. Although the Giraffe would have once been found across sub-Saharan Africa and even in parts of North Africa, today they are extinct from much of their historically vast natural range with only small, isolated populations remaining in a handful of regions in central Africa. Further south however, Giraffe populations are considered to be stable and are even growing in some areas due to an increase in demand for them on private ranches.\nGiraffe Anatomy and Appearance\nThe Giraffe is an animal with an enormously long neck which allows it to exploit the leaves and vegetation that are too high up for other animals to find. Despite their length, the neck of the Giraffe actually contains the same number of bones as numerous other hoofed mammals but they are simply longer in shape. The Giraffe\u2019s elongated neck leads into a short body, with long and thin, straight legs and a long tail that is tipped with a black tuft that helps to keep flies away. The Giraffe tends to be white in colour with brown or reddish markings that cover its body (with the exception of their white lower legs). The markings of each Giraffe are not only unique to that individual but they also vary greatly between the different Giraffe species in size, colour and the amount of white that surrounds them. All Giraffes though have large eyes that along with their height give them excellent vision, and small horn-like ossicones on the top of their heads.\nAs a ruminant, giraffes are an animal with multiple stomachs. They\u2019ll often eat north of 75 pounds of leafs per day, with their four stomachs each handling different functions to aid in extremely efficient digestion of nutrients.\nGiraffe Distribution and Habitat\nPreviously found even in North Africa, today the remaining Giraffe populations are restricted to parts of sub-Saharan Africa with the largest concentrations being found in National Parks. Giraffes are animals that inhabit open woodlands and savannah where using their height they are able to see for great distances around them to watch out for approaching danger. The nine different Giraffe species are found in varying countries on the continent, each exploiting their local ecological niche. Due to the fact that Giraffes feed on vegetation that is high in the trees but also too woody for the mouths of smaller herbivores, they are also able to remain in areas where domestic grazing has obliterated the plant species close to the ground, forcing the species that feed on them to move on. Giraffes throughout Africa though have been drastically affected by the loss of vast regions of their natural habitats.\nGiraffe Behaviour and Lifestyle\nThe large size of the Giraffe means that it must spend a great deal of time eating which it tends to do the most during the more tolerable heat of the morning and evening. During the hot midday sun, Giraffes rest in more shaded regions where they (like a number of their relatives) regurgitate their food known as cud, before then consuming it again. Small herds comprised of a number of females and their young spend both the day and night together to protect their offspring from predators, but male Giraffes are much more solitary often roaming over large areas in search of a fertile female. If however they come into contact with a rival male, the two will begin to bump heads and interlock their necks as a way of establishing a dominance hierarchy, with the winner earning the right to mate with the local females.\nGiraffes only sleep one or two hours per day. More impressive is that they have adaptations that allow them to sleep in power naps while standing up.\nGiraffe Reproduction and Life Cycles\nGiraffes breed year round and after finding a female to mate with, the male Giraffe will resume his solitary ways. After a gestation period that lasts for 15 months, the female Giraffe gives birth to a single infant (twins are rare) that already stands at two meters tall and has its unique markings. Giraffe calves look the same as adult Giraffes but simply become even bigger and more elongated as the grow and mature. After birth, the female Giraffe will often keep her calf away from the rest of the herd for an average of 15 days and the calf will then be weaned when it is just over a year old. Male Giraffes are able to breed a year later than females, but are sometimes not successful until they are nearly eight years old. Although both male and female young Giraffes will join small groups males tend to become more solitary with age, where females remain together but will often wander between different herds.\nGiraffe Diet and Prey\nThe Giraffe is a herbivorous animal that has evolved to be the height that it is so that it has less competition for food on the higher branches of the canopy. Giraffes are known to eat up to 60 different species of plant throughout the year and do so by grabbing onto branches with their long, black tongue (that can grow up to 18 inches long) and using their tough prehensile lips and flattened, grooved teeth are able to strip the leaves off the branches. Giraffes most commonly eat from acacia trees but also browse for wild apricots, flowers, fruits and buds along with eating seeds and fresh grass just after the rains. Giraffes get 70% of their moisture from their food so need to drink very little but when they do come across clean water, they must splay their front legs (which are longer than the back) in order to get their head close enough to the ground to drink. Giraffes can survive for up to three weeks without drinking water. Learn more about the toughest animals in the world here.\nGiraffe Predators and Threats\nDespite being the tallest land animal in the world, the Giraffe is actually preyed upon by a number of large carnivores that co-inhabit the dry savannah. Lions are the primary predators of the Giraffe. Lions use the strength of the whole pride to catch their victim, but giraffes are also preyed upon by Leopards and Hyenas. Giraffes rely on the vast open plains so that they can have the best view possible of their surroundings but if a predators does get too close, Giraffes kick their attacker with their large, heavy feet to defend themselves. Young calves however, are much more vulnerable and rely on the protection of their mother and the herd. Sadly though, around 50% of young Giraffes do not make it past the age of 6 months due to predation. All Giraffes are also threatened by hunting from Humans with populations having completely disappeared from certain areas.\nGiraffe Interesting Facts and Features\nEven though Giraffes feed higher than any other animal, males actually still feed at higher levels than females to avoid competing with each other for food. They stretch their necks higher up which also possibly gives them an advantage when watching out for predators. If danger is sighted, Giraffes will instantly sprint away and can run at speeds of more than 30mph for short periods of time. Interestingly enough though they are not actually able to trot as their body shape and size means they trip over and so must instantly go from walk to run. Due to the elongated height of the Giraffe and its large sensitive eyes, they are able to see for some considerable distance and have the greatest range of vision of any animal on land.\nGiraffe Relationship with Humans\nThe Giraffe today is seen as a major tourist attraction and is one of many people\u2019s must-see species when the go on safari. However, Giraffes have been hunted by people and also have been severely affected by their encroachment on their natural habitats which has led to vast population declines across Africa and even the extinction of the species in some countries. In southern parts of Africa though, Giraffe populations are even growing in some areas as they are becoming more and more popular as game on private ranches. However, due to hunting and habitat loss Giraffes have lost half of their once vast natural range with the majority of wild individuals found in a number of Africa\u2019s large national parks.\nGiraffe Conservation Status and Life Today\nToday, the Giraffe is listed by the IUCN as an animal that is of Least Concern of becoming extinct in its natural environment in the near future due to the fact that the majority of Giraffe populations are currently stable and are in fact increasing in some areas. They are however, still affected by both hunting and habitat loss with populations further north becoming sparser and more isolated from one another. A few of the nine Giraffe species are now listed as either Threatened or Endangered.\nView all 111 animals that start with G"}

But the long and short of our infatuation with giraffes lies in their unique characteristics. You would be hard pressed to find another animal as truly unique as the giraffe. Yes, we all have our favorite facts about giraffes. But let\u2019s go beyond the expected. We already know they\u2019re really tall. Instead, let\u2019s dive further into the fascinating lives of giraffes with 20 facts you didn\u2019t already know.\nSouthern giraffe with oxpeckers feeding off it in Moremi Game Reserve, Botswana. \u00a9 Randi Howry\n20 Facts You Didn\u2019t Know About Giraffes\n1.) Standing Tall and Blending In\nYou probably already know that no two giraffes sport the same spots \u2013 just like our fingerprints. But that stunning pattern is first and foremost used for camouflage. Typically, giraffes will spend their days surrounded by brush and trees. Their patterns serve as perfect camouflage, blending with the shadows and leaves. Amazing to think how quickly giraffes can disappear, I know from experience just how challenging they can be to observe in their leafy habitats.\n2.) Spotted Air Conditioning\nGiraffe spots are more than just good looks while blending in. Scientists have recently discovered that underneath each spot patch lies a very sophisticated system of blood vessels. Around each patch is a large blood vessel that then branches off into smaller vessels underneath the patch. This network of veins and vessels allow giraffes to maintain their body temperature and keep cool in the hot African sun.\nA full grown adult male Masai giraffe standing next to a few month old calf in Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania.\n3.) Pokey Bites\nGiraffes have a sweet tooth for acacia leaves. But these delicious leaves come at a cost. Acacia trees have long sharp thorns that keep most wildlife from eating them. Giraffes use their long tongue and prehensile lips to reach around the thorns. It also helps that they have thick, sticky saliva that coats any thorns they might swallow.\n4.) Tongue For Days\nMost have concluded that giraffes have a dark bluish-purple tongue to help prevent sunburn. Measuring between 18-22 inches long their tongues would be quite the painful place to get burnt. Relying mostly on their prehensile tongue, giraffes have no front teeth in their upper jaw. Instead, their 32 teeth are used for grinding and chewing up food.\n5.) Tastes Better a Second Time\nBearing almost no resemblance to cows, giraffes are in fact ruminants, with a four-chambered stomach to help digest the leaves they eat. In other words, after a giraffe swallows their leaves the first time, later they will send a ball of partially digested leaves all the way back up the throat into the mouth for more grinding and chewing. When giraffes aren\u2019t busy eating, they are chewing their cud. Think of it like a rise and repeat method.\nUp-close of the Masai giraffe pattern in Tarangire National Park, Tanzania. \u00a9 Randi Howry\n6.) Giant Everything\nWe know, we know, giraffes are TALL! But let\u2019s breakdown just how tall they really are. On its own a giraffe\u2019s neck is over six feet long, as are their long legs. Meaning that most adults can walk underneath a standing giraffe. Even right at birth giraffes are gigantic, standing taller than most people, at nearly six feet from hoof to head. Giraffe feet are no small matter either, they can be the size of dinner plates with a diameter of 12 inches each.\n7.) Spotted Lookout\nGiraffe are known as the watchtowers of their habitats. Oftentimes other prey species will spend time around giraffes for the extra heads up for predators. Not only do giraffes have a greater perspective, they also have massive eyeballs \u2013 each about the size of golf balls.\n8.) Mini Giraffe Naps\nYou would think that keeping a watch for predators all day and night might leave giraffes sleepy. But surprisingly enough, giraffes only sleep about 5 to 30 minutes in a 24-hour period! These quick power naps are all they need to stay energized. Often giraffes will rest standing up, but they sometimes will lie down with their head resting on their rump. But are only brave enough to do this when another herd member stays on lookout.\nMasai giraffe in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania.\nAdult Masai giraffe laying down in Tarangire National Park, Tanzania.\n9.) Hairy Top Knot x2\nYour word of the day is ossicones, aka giraffe \u201chorns!\u201d Both male and female giraffes have them right at birth. These tiny hairy ossicones lie flat and are not attached to the skull to avoid injury at birth. Later in life they fuse to their skulls. Into adulthood male giraffes will use them to spar, throwing their necks against each other. In fact, as males mature, calcium deposits begin to form on their skulls to help protect against head-butts with other males. These calcifications can be quite pronounced, almost giving some males the odd appearance of having extra ossicones on their heads.\n10.) Giraffe Swan Dives\nBaby giraffes have quite the dramatic entrance into the world \u2013 a six-foot swan dive to the ground. Since female giraffes give birth standing up, the drop alone jolts newborns into taking their first breath. After about an hour most calves begin to stand and walk about. If that wasn\u2019t impressive enough, giraffe calves are known to grow one inch each day during their first week!\nMasai giraffe browsing in Lake Manyara National Park, Tanzania.\n11.) Tall Nannies\nSometimes mother giraffes will leave their calves alone for most of the day. But as they grow older, the mother will leave her youngster together with other calves in a \u201cnursery.\u201d Another mother giraffe stays behind to babysit while the other adults go out to eat. Under the supervision of this designated babysitter, the youngsters explore their surroundings throughout the day. After about four months the young giraffes can eat leaves and will often join the herd out foraging. But they will continue to nurse until they are six to nine months old.\n12.) No Tall Drink of Water Needed\nShockingly a giraffe\u2019s neck is just a little too short to reach the ground. Because they have to splay themselves into a vulnerable position, most giraffes only drink once every few days. Instead, they get most of their moisture from the leaves they eat.\nTower of Masai giraffe drinking from a watering hole in Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania.\n13.) Feeling Light Headed\nLowering their massive head and necks could create quite the head rush after standing upright. But to protect a change in blood pressure, giraffes have elastic-walled vessels that dilate and constrict to manage flow. With the largest heart of any of land animal, they are able to pump about 15 gallons of blood around its body every 60 seconds. (that\u2019s blood pressure twice that of an average human)\n14.) All in Stride\nEven with long legs giraffes can gracefully pick up and run. Record speed for a giraffe has been measured at 34 miles per hour. And unlike horses and most other four-legged animals; giraffes walk by moving both legs on the same side of their body together. Meaning that the left front and the left hind legs step and then the right front and the right hind legs step. Creating a very unique gate as they move about.\nSouthern giraffe feeding in the morning light in Kruger National Park, South Africa\n15.) Four Species Are Better Than One\nGiraffes currently inhabit only 21 countries in Africa, ranging from Niger to Namibia. But most are surprised to learn that there are actually four distinct species of giraffes. Recent studies, supported by the Giraffe Conservation Foundation, have found that these species have their own unique range, habitat, and pattern. The four species include Reticulated giraffe, Masai giraffe, Northern giraffe, and Southern giraffe. For example, Masai giraffes, found in East Africa, have spots that look like tree leaves. While the reticulated giraffe, found in the arid regions of East Africa, has a dark red body with a web of narrow cream lines.\n16.) Silent Extinction\nThe Giraffe Conservation Foundation has estimated that giraffe populations have dropped by almost 30% in the past four decades. Their decline is being referred to as the silent extinction. Giraffes are formally listed as vulnerable throughout Africa; but they lack the protection that other vulnerable species like lions and white rhinos receive. In habitats where they remain their populations continue to decrease due to habitat loss and overgrazing of livestock.\nMasai giraffe running in Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania.\n17.) A Camel-Leopard?\nCenturies ago people would often refer to giraffes as a \u201ccamel-leopard.\u201d They believed this odd species to be a combination of the spotted cats and humped camels. That\u2019s even where giraffes got their scientific name \u2013 camelopardalis! The only true living relative of giraffes are the stunning rainforest dwelling okapi of central Africa.\n18.) What Does The Giraffe Say?\nMost don\u2019t realize that giraffes do in fact make noises. These sounds include moos, dramatic roars, snorts, and grunts. But very rarely are they this vocal. Instead, studies suggest giraffes vocalize below the level of human hearing to communication with one another.\n19.) True Tower\nWhat do you call a group of giraffes, a tower of course! Giraffes are very social animals and enjoy spending time in groups of around 15 members, typically led by an adult male.\n20.) Tall Celebration\nTo increase awareness for this silent extinction of giraffes, Giraffe Conservation Foundation initiated the first ever World Giraffe Day on June 21, 2014. This yearly worldwide celebration brings needed attention to these animals. Fun fact, the 21st of June was selected as the perfect day to celebrate giraffes because it is the longest day or night (depending on the hemisphere) of the year. What better date to celebrate the tallest animals on earth!\nAdult male southern giraffe in Moremi Game Reserve, Botswana.\nMore Fascinating Animal Facts"}

We will see them as we proceed and you will be able to understand more.\nAfrican ruminant mammal, Giraffa camelopardalis, live in open savannahs south of the Sahara and has only one family member, the Okapi. The giraffe is the tallest living mammal. Head/shoulder length is approximately 13' for the male. Shoulder height is 8-12', overall height 15-19'. Weight is 1,100-2,800 lbs. The reticulated giraffes are handsomely patterned in golden browns, with a coarsely netted (reticulated) pattern mainly quadrangular in shape. Males and females have stiff manes along their necks. Both sexes have horn-like structures called ossicones on top of their heads between their ears. These ossicones are present at birth in the form of small knobs of cartilage covered with skin and hair which becomes bony nodules with age.\nThey have seven vertebrae in neck, the same as man and most other mammals despite the long neck. Only that the vertebrae are much bigger. The tail measures up to one yard with a terminal tuft of stiff, black hair.\nThey have long tongues that measure 18-21 inches long. The inner part of the tongue is pink in color, and then changes to a purpli sh-black color for the last 6 inches that are commonly visible.\nA quick look at the adaptations of the Giraffe\nThey have long legs and neck, long, tough, prehensile tongue, and leathery mouth for food gathering. Their coloration is protective. They are tall with good eyesight for watchfulness. Giraffes have high blood pressure (240/160) for pumping blood to the brain. Herds are small and loosely constructed of 5-15 individuals, consisting of one bull with females and young. Other bulls are solitary or in pairs. They usually sleep standing up. Going for a month without water is also possible as an adaptation to long drought periods in their native areas. A browsing ruminant that eats regularly throughout the day, the giraffe prefers young leaves and shoots at tops of acacia trees which sometimes ends up shaping the regularly visited trees. They prefer to drink regularly, but can go without water for several days. Giraffes can run up to 35 mph. Predators are leopards (prey on young), lions, and man. Giraffes kick with their hooves and slam with their heads. A giraffe usually sleeps for only 1-12 minutes.\nOff springs\nGiraffes are non-seasonal breeders, usually producing one calf after a gestation period of 14-15 months. Newborn giraffe calves begin their lives by falling up to about 6 feet to the ground, and weight 87-107 lbs. They become sexually mature between 3 and 4 years of age and have a life span of about 25 years and up to 30 in captivity. Full body size is not reached until five years of age.\nIt is interesting to note that...\nThe carotid artery that carries blood from the heart to the head is thick, muscular and elastic, ballooning when the giraffe stoops to absorb increase in pressure. When the giraffe raises its head, a series of check valves in the inch-wide jugular vein prevents a sudden back flow from the head, emptying the brain. They are most vulnerable to predators when drinking or lying down. They may see red-orange, yellow-green, purple, green and blue as colors. Their scientific name means \"camel-leopard-like one who walks swiftly.\" Their spot patterns are as individual as fingerprints. They are among the very few mammals that cannot swim at all. Giraffe\ufffds have a variety of sounds but they are rarely heard. They may grunt of snort when alarmed, females may whistle to call their young, and calves can bleat. They are most vulnerable to predators when drinking or lying down.

Once a giraffe reaches adulthood its height is often enough to protect it from lions. Adult giraffes, however, must still be careful of lions when they are bending down to drink water or rest.

Vulnerable LC NT VU EN CR EW EX Least Concern Extinct Current Population Trend : Decreasing\nGiraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humans\u2014about 6 feet . These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances.\nBehavior\nTypically, these fascinating animals roam the open grasslands in small groups of about half a dozen.\nBulls sometimes battle one another by butting their long necks and heads. Such contests aren't usually dangerous and end when one animal submits and walks away.\nHeight and Size\nGiraffes use their height to good advantage and browse on leaves and buds in treetops that few other animals can reach (acacias are a favorite). Even the giraffe's tongue is long! The 21-inch tongue helps them pluck tasty morsels from branches. Giraffes eat most of the time and, like cows, regurgitate food and chew it as cud. A giraffe eats hundreds of pounds of leaves each week and must travel miles to find enough food.\nThe giraffe's height also helps it to keep a sharp lookout for predators across the wide expanse of the African savanna.\nThe giraffe's stature can be a disadvantage as well\u2014it is difficult and dangerous for a giraffe to drink at a water hole. To do so they must spread their legs and bend down in an awkward position that makes them vulnerable to predators like Africa's big cats. Giraffes only need to drink once every several days; they get most of their water from the luscious plants they eat.\nFemale giraffes give birth standing up. Their young endure a rather rude welcome into the world by falling more than 5 feet to the ground at birth. These infants can stand in half an hour and run with their mothers an incredible ten hours after birth.\nPopulation\nGiraffes have beautiful spotted coats. While no two individuals have exactly the same pattern, giraffes from the same area appear similar.\nUp until recently, the consensus has been there is only one species of giraffe with multiple subspecies. In 2016, some scientists released a study that claims genetic differences among giraffe populations indicate the existence of four distinct giraffe species.\n8:30"}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe - The Animal Facts - Appearance, Diet, Habitat, Behavior", "url": "https://www.theanimalfacts.com/mammals/giraffe/", "text": "Appearance\nThe giraffe is the world's tallest land animal. They have a long neck and long legs both of which provide the height needed to reach trees from which they obtain browse.\nTheir iconic pattern of spots cover the body with the coloration being variable across their range based on diet and other factors. The color may vary between yellow to almost black for the patches with lines which are a yellowish-white in between. These coloration differences are used to divide the giraffe in to multiple subspecies.\nMoving down the legs towards the feet their spots fade to become solid white.\nSome zoologists have suggested that a giraffe\u2019s coat pattern provides camouflage. Reports exist of people viewing giraffes and thinking they were trees until they began to walk.\nOn top of the head are 2-4 specialized horns known as the ossicones. These help to protect the head during fights. Males have bald top on there ossicones while the females have a small tuft of fur.\nAt the end of the body is a long tail which ends with a tuft of black fur. This can measure between 78 and 100cm (31-39in) long. This tail will be used to flick away flies.\nTheir tongue is a bluey-grey colour. It is believed that this protects it from getting sunburnt while they are feeding. Their eyes are the size of a golfball.\nMale giraffe are larger than females. They may stand up to 5.5m (18ft) tall and weigh up to 1,360kg (2,998lbs). Female giraffes can be up to 4.3m (14ft) tall and weigh up to 680kg (1,500lbs).\nDiet\nGiraffes are herbivores with their diet made up mostly of leaves which they browse off of trees. Other foods consumed by them include shoots, fruit, other vegetation and wild apricot. Up to 93 different leaves are part of their diet.\nBetween 16 and 20 hours of their day are spent feeding. They can survive on as little as 7kg (15lbs) of food each day.\nTheir upper lip is prehensile and they have a long tongue which are used to grab the leaves off of a trees. They are able to eat from thorny acacia trees without injuring themselves.\nMuch of the giraffes water needs can be meet by the browse which they eat. When they do drink they have specialized valves which help prevent issues caused by the high blood pressure needed to push blood to the brain when standing."}

Their distinctive features, like their long necks, are truly one of a kind \u2013 they are one of the most striking animals in the world!\nHowever, because their physical features are so unique and unforgettable, it can be easy to forget that there are other fun facts to learn about them. For example, have you thought about why their necks are so long? Or how do they go to sleep?\nIf you are after an exploration into why giraffes and towers go hand in hand, how giraffes use their necks in innovative ways, and why we as humans have so much in common with the giraffe \u2013 then carry on reading to find out 25 amazingly interesting facts about this beautiful creature!\nTop 15 Interesting Facts About Giraffes\nFact 1: Giraffes Spend Most (If Not All) Of Their Time Standing Up\nThey even have their naps standing up, where the heads will be tilted forward slightly. This is the only way to work out whether they are awake or asleep!\nIt is said that they spend so much time standing up because they evolved to be aware of their surroundings, with so many carnivorous animals around.\nBecause it can take a long time for them to lie down and get up quickly, it is easier for them to rest in a standing position where they can move at a moment\u2019s notice.\nFact 2: Giraffes Are The Tallest Mammals On Earth\nEven a giraffe\u2019s legs are taller than a huge number of the human population \u2013 they\u2019re around 6 feet!\nAn adult giraffe\u2019s full height ranges between 16 and 20 feet, which is taller than a double-decker bus.\nThe only other mammal to get anywhere near the giraffe in height is the African Bush Elephant, which is just over 10 feet.\nFact 3: Giraffes Always Roam Around In Groups Called \u2018Towers\u2019\nThese towers normally have around 10 to 20 giraffes per group, and these are typically led by an adult male giraffe.\nThis is believed to have stemmed from the fact that giraffes have long necks, so a collective noun was chosen that represents something tall and thin.\nGiraffes stay in packs as they can be quite easily hunted in the wild, so they are safer in large numbers.\nFact 4: There Are A Number Of Giraffe Species\nThese four species are called: The Masai, Reticulated giraffes, Northern, and Southern. While there are different categories, they are all still native to Africa \u2013 just different parts of Africa.\nThe Northern and Southern giraffes are from the North and South respectively, and The Masai and Reticulated giraffes are situated in East Africa.\nFact 5: Giraffes Will Use Their Head As A Weapon In A Fight\nThe \u2018bulls\u2019 (male giraffes) will fight with their heads and necks in a test to prove who is the strongest giraffe.\nHowever, they never get too violent or dangerous, it is simply a way of establishing dominance over one another \u2013 when a bull knows they have lost the fight, they will walk away immediately.\nThe term for this is \u2018necking\u2019.\nFact 6: Giraffes Don\u2019t Actually Have Horns\nThe horn-shaped parts of a giraffe\u2019s head are actually called ossicones.\nThey are made from cartilage that has been hardened into bone (the process of which is called ossified which is where the name comes from).\nThese ossicones are then covered in skin and tufts of hair. However, the male giraffes will often lose the hair on the top of their ossicones from the necking (see Fact 5)!\nFact 7: Giraffes Have Incredibly Long Tongues\nThe average length of a giraffe\u2019s tongue is 21 inches, which is around a third of the length of their long legs.\nThese tongues are also prehensile, which means that they can grip things like human fingers can.\nGiraffes use this ability to pluck stubborn leaves from branches!\nFact 8: Giraffes Have The Same Number Of Bones In Their Neck As A Human\nWhile the giraffe\u2019s neck can measure up to 8 feet long, which is an enormous weight of around 600 pounds, they still only have seven vertebrae in their neck.\nThe difference between our neck bones and a giraffe is that their vertebrae can grow up to around 10 inches long, which ours can\u2019t.\nOther than the length of the bones, we can still say that our necks are the same as a giraffe neck!\nFact 9: Giraffes Don\u2019t Need Much Sleep At All\nIn fact, they only need up to half an hour of sleep in one 24 hour day.\nHowever, it is also said that they can sleep for up to 5 hours a day when they are kept in captivity, rather than when they are loose in the wild.\nIt is assumed that giraffes have such short sleeping cycles because they had to be aware of the risks of living in the wild.\nSo, they only take a tiny amount of sleep to keep an eye out for predators the rest of the time!\nFact 10: Giraffe Calves Can Walk An Hour After Being Born\nA calf will have a difficult birth, and a rude awakening \u2013 when they drop around 6 feet to the ground after being born from their mother\u2019s womb.\nHowever, this won\u2019t phase the baby giraffe in the slightest! They will try and stand up immediately, and they should be able to take their first baby steps within an hour of their birth.\nAs well as this, within a week, this calf will start to eat solid food (vegetation).\nFact 11: No Two Giraffes Have Exactly The Same Patterns On Their Body\nSimilar to how no two humans have the same thumbprint and it is impossible for two snowflakes to have the same crystal construction, a giraffe\u2019s marking will always be completely unique from any other giraffe.\nHowever, the different species of giraffe (mentioned in Fact 4) will have some similar, distinctive patterns. These similar markings make it easy to identify which giraffes are from which species.\nFact 12: Giraffes Don\u2019t Need To Drink Much Water At All\nPart of the reason for this is that they get a huge amount of water from all of the plants they eat.\nHowever, drinking water is also a very dangerous task for a giraffe!\nBecause their necks are too long to reach the ground, they have to spread their legs and lower their necks to reach water on the floor.\nThis puts them in a vulnerable position that they struggle to get out of, so it is quite fortunate that they only need water every few days.\nFact 13: The Average Weight Of A Giraffe\u2019s Heart Is 11 Kilograms\nThis is because they need a huge amount of muscle to pump the blood up the length of their necks! So, their hearts have incredibly thick muscle walls.\nInterestingly, scientists have worked out that for every 15cm of a giraffe\u2019s neck length, the heart\u2019s ventricle wall will add another 0.5cm to the thickness of the wall.\nThis ensures that the heart will definitely have the exact right amount of muscle to keep the giraffe alive!\nFact 14: Once A Giraffe Becomes Pregnant, It Will Carry That Baby For 15 Months\nWhile this isn\u2019t as long as an elephant\u2019s gestation period (which lasts nearly two years!), 15 months is still one of the longest pregnancies for a mammal.\nThis is such a long gestation period because the calf has to be well-developed when it leaves the womb \u2013 which is why it can stand up and walk around within an hour.\nThis is necessary because it allows the mother and the baby giraffes to immediately get moving in the wild, and they don\u2019t have to worry about predators.\nFact 15: Giraffes Make Very Few Noises, But The One They Consistently Make Is A Humming Sound\nIt used to be believed that giraffes couldn\u2019t make any noises. However, it turns out they can \u2013 but these noises are at such a low register that they are extremely difficult to be heard by the human ear.\nAs well as this, they have a very small windpipe and limited lung capacity, so it is difficult for them to physically make sounds, which is why they often choose not to!\nWeird Facts About Giraffes\nA newborn giraffe is taller than most humans \u2013 they are 6 feet tall when they are born!\nThe giraffe\u2019s scientific name is \u2018Camelopardalis\u2019, which translates to camel leopard (this is because of their stature, and their markings).\nGiraffes have 12-inch hooves that are incredibly sharp and dangerous \u2013 and are capable of killing predators.\nA giraffe owns the longest tail out of all mammals that live on the land \u2013 they can grow up to 8 feet in length!\nFemale and male giraffes will always eat from opposite sides of the same strength, as this eliminates the risk of creating competition between the two genders.\nFacts About Giraffes For Kids\nGiraffes are able to run up to speeds of 35 miles per hour!\nThey are capable of eating up to 75 pounds of leaves in a day, as this is also their main water source.\nGiraffes have incredibly long eyelashes because it helps to keep sand out of their eyes when they are in desert-like environments.\nThe tall animals evolved to grow their long neck so that they could keep an eye out for predators in the surrounding area and to reach and eat the leaves from tall tree branches.\nA giraffe\u2019s favorite food is Acacia leaves and twigs, but they also love fruits and flowers!\nTo Sum Up\nSo, we have learned that giraffes have incredibly strong babies that can almost immediately walk when they come out of the womb, they are very sociable beings that like to explore the wild in \u2018towers\u2019, and they have (almost) the same necks as humans!"}

We can spot them in savannas, grasslands, and even in open woods. They hang out among the wide-open plains and woodlands. Giraffes are indigenous to Africa which is a very warm and parched region.\nWhat do they eat and drink?\nGiraffes are herbivores which means they only consume plants. Giraffes prefer to meander and search for their meal shoots down building up the ample of their diet. They also relish leaves and herbs. Their favoured food is the acacia tree. They make use of their prolonged cervix to outstretch the leaves in the crown. Most giraffes do not consume lot of grass.\nIt has been approximating that throughout specified hours of the year giraffes pay out 75 percent of their hour searching for food and eating. Giraffes don\u2019t require much water in spite of being very huge.\nThey only take the causal drink, so they are frequently searched far away from water resources. They may consume a lot; giraffes do not drink lot of water. It is because they get major of their water from their leafy food, and only require to drink once every day.\nWhat do they look like?\nThe giraffe is the towering kind of mammal in the whole globe. A masculine giraffe can develop up to 15.5 meters whereas a feminine giraffe can develop up to 4.3 meters. The legs of a giraffe are about 1.8 meters. Giraffes also have the extended tail of any mammal. Their tails can be up to 2.4 meters lengthy. The male and female giraffes have two horns on their head.\nThese horns are known ossicones and many masculine giraffes have broad, less bushy ossicones than feminine giraffes. This is because the bashing they do with other masculine giraffes. The spots on a giraffe are very unique, and oddly enough no different giraffes have the similar group of spots."}

Like most artiodactyls, giraffes are sexually dimorphic\u2014that is, males are significantly bigger than females, and the \"ossicones\" atop their heads have a slightly different appearance.\nWhen fully grown, male giraffes can attain a height of almost 20 feet\u2014most of that, of course, taken up by this mammal's elongated neck\u2014and weigh between 2,400 and 3,000 pounds. Females weigh between 1,600 and 2,600 pounds and stand about 16 feet tall. That makes the giraffe the tallest living animal on earth.\nOn the top of a giraffe's head are ossicones, unique structures that are neither horns nor ornamental bumps; rather, they're hardened bits of cartilage covered by skin and anchored firmly to the animal's skull. It's unclear what the purpose of ossicones are; they may help males to intimidate one another during mating season, they may be a sexually selected characteristic (that is, males with more impressive ossicones may be more attractive to females), or they may even help to dissipate heat in the blazing African sun.\nAnton Petrus / Getty Images\nSpecies and Subspecies\nTraditionally, all giraffes belong to the same genus and species, Giraffa camelopardalis. Naturalists have recognized nine separate subspecies: the Nubian giraffe, the reticulated giraffe, the Angolan giraffe, the Kordofan giraffe, the Masai giraffe, the South African giraffe, the West African giraffe, the Rhodesian giraffe, and Rothschild's giraffe. Most zoo giraffes are either the reticulated or Rothschild variety, which are roughly comparable in size but can be distinguished by the patterns of their coats.\nGerman ecologist Axel Janke has argued that multi-local DNA analysis of giraffe genetic structure shows that there are actually four separate giraffe species:\nNorthern giraffe (G. cameloparalis, and including Nubian and Rothschild's, with Korofan and West African as subspecies),\nReticulated giraffe (G. reticulata),\nMasai giraffe (G. tippelskirchi, now known as Rhodesian or Thornicroft's giraffe), and\nSouthern giraffe (G. giraffa, with two subspecies the Angolan and South African giraffes).\nThese suggestions are not accepted by all scholars.\nHabitat\nGiraffes range in the wild throughout Africa, but are most often found are in combined savannas and woodlands. They are social creatures who mostly live in one of two types of herds: adult females and their offspring, and bachelor herds. There are also isolates, male bulls who live alone.\nThe most common herd is made up of adult females and their calves, and a few males\u2014these are typically between 10 and 20 individuals, although some can grow as large as 50. Typically, such herds are egalitarian, with no clear leaders or pecking order. Studies show that giraffe cows stay with the same group at least as long as six years.\nYoung bachelor males who are old enough to fend for themselves form temporary herds of between 10 and 20, essentially training camps in which they play and challenge each other before leaving the group to become isolates. They practice what adult males do during mating season, for instance: male giraffes will engage in \"necking,\" in which two combatants jostle one another and attempt to land blows with their ossicones.\nYann Arthus-Bertrand / Getty Images\nDiet and Behavior\nGiraffes subsist on a variable vegetarian diet that includes leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. Like camels, they don't need to drink on a daily basis. They have a diverse diet which can include as much as 93 different species of plants; but typically, only about a half dozen of those plants make up 75 percent of their summer diets. The main plant varies between members of the Acacia tree; giraffes are the only predator for acacia trees over 10 feet tall.\nGiraffes are ruminants, mammals equipped with specialized stomachs that \"pre-digest\" their food; they're constantly chewing their \"cud,\" a mass of semi-digested food ejected from their stomach and in need of further breakdown.\nHerds forage together. Each adult giraffe weighs about 1,700 pounds and needs as much as 75 pounds of plants each day. Herds have a home range that averages about 100 square miles, and the herds intersect, sharing one another's ranges without a social issue.\nPal Teravagimov Photography/Getty Images\nReproduction and Offspring\nGranted, very few animals (other than humans) tend to linger in the act of mating, but at least giraffes have a good reason to rush. During copulation, male giraffes stand almost straight up on their hind legs, resting their front legs along the female's flanks, an awkward posture that would be unsustainable for more than a few minutes. Interestingly, giraffe sex can provide clues about how dinosaurs like Apatosaurus and Diplodocus had sex\u2014doubtless equally quickly, and with roughly the same posture.\nThe gestation period for giraffes is approximately 15 months. At birth, calves are about five and a half feet tall, and at about one-year-old, they are 10.5 feet tall. Giraffes are weaned at 15\u201318 months, although some suckle up to 22 months of age. Sexual maturation occurs about 5 years of age, and females generally have their first calves at 5\u20136 years.\nbrytta/Getty Images\nThreats\nOnce a giraffe has reached its adult size, it's extremely unusual for it to be attacked, much less killed, by lions or hyenas; instead, these predators will target juvenile, sick, or aged individuals. However, an insufficiently wary giraffe can easily be ambushed at a water hole, since it has to adopt an ungainly posture when taking a drink. Nile crocodiles have been known to chomp on the necks of full-grown giraffes, drag them into the water, and feast at leisure on their copious carcasses.\nBirdImages / Getty Images\nConservation Status\nGiraffes are classed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), because of ongoing habitat loss (deforestation, land use conversion, expansion of agriculture and human population growth), civil unrest (ethnic violence, rebel militias, paramilitary and military operations), illegal hunting (poaching), and ecological changes (climate change, mining activity).\nIn some countries in southern Africa, hunting giraffes is legal, especially where populations are increasing. In other countries, such as Tanzania, poaching is associated with declines.\nSources"}

Giraffes can be found across the African Savannah where they primarily feast on the leaves of Acacia trees. They are an endangered species. Here are some interesting facts about giraffes!\n10. Are There Different Types of Giraffes?\nCurrently, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature has given recognition to only one species of giraffes. Some independent studies have recognized six sub-species: West African, Masai, Angolan, South African, the Rothschilds, and the reticulated giraffe. The giraffe is classified under the family Giraffidae while the only species recognized is the Giraffa Camelopardalis.\n9. Do Giraffes Sleep? Do Giraffes Sleep Standing Up?\nThe unusual activity of sleeping while standing has been observed among older giraffe. Giraffes sleep for four to six hours every day, mostly at night. To lie down, the giraffe must kneel its front legs before lowering the rest of its body down gently.\n8. Do Giraffes Lay Down?\nContrary to popular belief, giraffes can lay down by resting their body on top of their legs. The front legs fold during kneeling and its hind legs bend and rests on top of its legs. While on this position, its neck can bend so that it can rest on the hip or thigh. However, giraffes do not lay down for long periods of time due to the threat posed by predators like lions, wild dogs, leopards, and hyenas.\n7. Do Giraffes Make Noise?\nGiraffes can make noise! In case of an attack by a predator, giraffes are able to raise an alarm by grunting and moaning. During the mating season, male giraffes create loud cough sounds to make their presence felt among the female giraffes. Female giraffes also watch over their calves by making bellowing sounds. In addition, giraffes hum to fellow giraffes in the herd.\n6. Do Giraffes Have Horns?\nGiraffes have horn-like protrusions called ossicones. Ossicones are found on their skulls and are made of cartilage and covered by skin. The ossicones are fused to the skull at the parietal bones. The horns come in handy when fighting an intruder, such as a giraffe from another herd or a competing male during the mating season. In adult giraffes, the ossicones become knobs and bald, especially in males. Female giraffes tend to have ossicones that are thin and covered in hair.\n5. Do Giraffes Have Teeth? Do Giraffes Chew Cud?\nGiraffes have teeth! The giraffe's skull has an upper and lower jaw filled with teeth and molars that facilitate the grinding of food. However, giraffes do not have front teeth. As the animal lives in the savannah and woodlands, leaves from trees and fruits are its main sources of food. During the wet seasons, food is more plenty than in the dry season. However, giraffes have a rough tongue, lips, and palate that are adapted to the task.\n4. Do Giraffes Lay Eggs?\nGiraffes do not lay eggs. Reproduction takes place during the mating season where a male giraffe courts the female giraffe in synchronized moves. Giraffes give birth to live young after a gestation period of 15 months.\n3. Do Giraffes Give Birth Standing Up?\nA female giraffe will give birth while standing up. The calf\u2019s front legs emerge before the rest of the body follows through. In the process, the umbilical cord breaks. The calf falls to the ground and the mother cleans the calf by licking it.\n2. Do Giraffes Mate For Life? Are Giraffes Monogamous?\nMale giraffes are polygamous when it comes to mating. Since giraffes move in herds, the male giraffes will scout for potential mating partners by tasting the urine of the younger female giraffes to determine the presence of oestrus. Upon its detection during this process, the males will battle among themselves to get the mating partner.\n1. Are Giraffes Endangered?\nWildlife conservation groups around the world have determined that the giraffe is facing an imminent threat of extinction. African communities have in the past fed on giraffe meat while using its tail hairs to make flywhisks and its skin was used in the manufacture of drums, sandals, and shields. During the colonial and post-colonial period, European tourists hunted the giraffe for sport. Environmental degradation has made the situation worse thanks to droughts and human encroachment destroying the giraffe\u2019s habitat. With these factors, anti-poaching laws have been legislated and have seen game parks and reserves being established to protect the giraffe and other endangered animals."}

Bull giraffes forage higher in trees than cow giraffes which reduces food competition between the sexes. Long-legged giraffes walk with the limbs on one side of the body lifted at the same time. This gait is called a pace and allows a longer stride which saves steps and energy. A mother giraffe often gives birth while standing so that the newborn's first experience outside the womb is a 1.8 m (6 ft.) drop! For the first four to five months, calves congregate in nursery groups called creches to rest and socialize while mothers forage in the distance. Giraffes have seven elongated vertebrae in their neck unlike most mammals, an adaptation for feeding high in the trees. Giraffes are the tallest mammal. They are often called the watchtowers of the Serengeti, keeping track of predators. Their extreme long-range vision enables visual communication with other giraffes over several miles. Because their necks are shorter than their legs, they must spread their front legs wide in order to reach the water to drink. Their neck veins contain valves and a network of tiny veins to constrict blood flow to their brain when they lower their head to drink in order to prevent blackouts. Each has unique markings, which distinguish it from others, much like a human fingerprint. Giraffe markings allow them to hide among trees. A giraffe's tongue is purplish-black and can extend almost twenty inches! This adaptation is thought to keep the tongue from sunburn during their all-day feed. Giraffes are one of the few species of mammal to perceive color, and their visual field approaches 360\u00b0 from their tremendous height. They are quite agile and can run up to 56 kph (35 mph), and have been known to jump 1.8 m (6 ft).\nEcology and Conservation\nGiraffes have a special niche in the African savanna. They are able to reach a six-foot band of foliage beyond the reach of all other terrestrial browsers except elephants. Their long tongue is useful for grasping leaves in the crowns of trees. (They also have a modified joint at the base of the skull that allows their head to extend vertically to reach the highest branches.) Giraffes only drink water every 2 to 3 days, but can drink up to 10 gallons at a time. They gather most of their water from the vegetation they eat.\nThe continuous, selective browsing habits of giraffes slow the growth of favorite bush and tree species. This foraging behavior maintains the open woodlands inhabited by many African ruminants.\n(It is interesting to note that the seeds of some species of acacia trees will not germinate unless they pass through the giraffe's digestive system.)\nSeveral types of birds, such as the oxpecker, perch on giraffes and form a mutually beneficial relationship. The birds find food by eating parasites picked from giraffes' skin and hair. This helps giraffes because parasites potentially could weaken them physically and leave them more vulnerable to prey.\nThe encroachment of human populations on their natural habitat has been devastating to the wild population, especially in West Africa.\nMankind has historically honored giraffes. African cave paintings included them, probably as favored prey, and ancient Egyptian art frequently featured giraffe designs. In fact, giraffe tail hairs are still collected for jewelry, and the hide is used to make sandals and ceremonial shields. Some tribes treat nose bleeds with the smoke from burning giraffe skin. Unfortunately giraffes antagonize farmers more and more, often when the animals forage on crops and compete with domestic stock for resources. This conflict is likely to escalate in the future as the African human population continues to increase.\nIn a cooperative effort with other AZA (Association of Zoos and Aquariums) institutions, Busch Gardens closely manages giraffe populations through a program called the Species Survival Plan (SSP), which works to improve the genetic diversity of managed animal populations.\nBibliography\nBenyus, Janine.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe Facts and Information", "url": "https://www.giraffeworlds.com/", "text": "Introduction to Giraffes\nGiraffes are mammals that belong to the order Artiodactyla and the Giraffidae family, which also includes the Okapi, an animal that shares certain characteristics with the giraffe but with a very different appearance.\nMost of us have heard a lot about giraffes, and we have enjoyed watching their impressive size in zoos. We know that they have great height, are native to Africa and that its most iconic characteristic is its long neck that serves them to reach the top of the trees when looking for food.\nGiraffes are the tallest terrestrial animals in the world. They have a pair ossicones or horns covered with skin and a short vertical mane that goes from the head to the hump at the end of the neck. They measure up to 6 m in height and weigh a maximum of 2,000 kg, dimensions which combined with their coat give them a unique and beautiful look. Each species and subspecies that live today have a fur design different from each other, and, even more, each giraffe has a unique pattern that never repeats in another individual, just like our fingerprints.\nThere is no way to mistake a giraffe for any other animal out there in the world. The tall and lanky body covered in spots is very unusual and an animal that most people enjoy seeing. In fact, they are one of the most visited animals at zoos around the world.\nEvery single giraffe in the world has a unique pattern of spots. They can be used to help researchers identify them both in the wild and in captivity. These spots vary in size, shape, color and separation between each species.\nTop Giraffe Facts The heart of the giraffe is about 22 pounds and 2 feet long. Giraffes have 7 vertebrae in their necks. More Giraffe Facts\u2026\nThe heart of a giraffe weighs about 22 pounds and can reach up to 2 feet long. Giraffes have only seven vertebrae in their necks, just like humans. They are the tallest animals in the world, reaching a height up to 6 meters. The tongue of giraffes is black and can measure up to 50 cm.\nThe explanation about why evolution provided giraffes with such a long neck still keeps scientists debating about it. Since the times of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Charles Darwin, some hypotheses have been stated to explain why giraffes developed such characteristic that other non-herbivorous animals didn\u2019t. Although there are several theories, none is fully accepted by the scientific community.\nNew Taxonomic order\nIt has been some controversy during the recent years, regarding the taxonomic classification of the Giraffe. For many years it was considered a single species with up to nine subspecies, but latest technologies like mitochondrial and nuclear DNA analysis are changing the taxonomy classification of some species, and giraffes are not the exception.\nEven before this kind of analysis, there were another proposals to reclassify the giraffes, but in 2016 a new classification based on DNA studies was defined which includes four species.\n\u2013 Northern giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) \u2013 (3 subspecies, 1 Ecotype) Nubian giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis camelopardalis) Kordofan giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis antiquorum) West African giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis peralta) Rothschild\u2019s giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi) \u2013 Ecotype\n\u2013 Reticulated giraffe (Giraffa reticulata)\n\u2013 Southern giraffe (Giraffa giraffa) \u2013 (2 subspecies) South African giraffe (Giraffa giraffa giraffa) Angolan giraffe (Giraffa giraffa angolensis)\n\u2013 Masai giraffe (Giraffa tippelskirchi) \u2013 (1 Ecotype) Thornicroft\u2019s giraffe \u2013 Ecotype\nNOTE: It is important to mention that some sources, even reliable, still have the one species classification which is different from the one above."}

While their remarkable height is common knowledge, many people know little else about these gentle giants. Despite their impressive stature, giraffes keep a relatively low profile, often quietly munching leaves in the background while other animals hog the spotlight.\nEven scientists and conservationists have a history of overlooking giraffes, at least compared with some other species (although, fortunately, that has begun to change in recent years). These fascinating megafauna are increasingly threatened animals who need our help to avoid fading away in the wild.\n1. The First Giraffes May Have Evolved in Europe\nAlthough giraffes now live only in sub-Saharan Africa, research suggests the ancestors of modern giraffes probably evolved in southern central Europe about 8 million years ago.\ufeff\ufeff They entered Africa through Ethiopia about 7 million years ago, according to a study published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa, finding more success there than relatives who moved to Asia and died out a few million years later.\nGiraffe evolution seems to have been driven mainly by shifts in vegetation, the researchers reported, from forest to a mix of savanna, woodland, and shrubs. The giraffes' tallest ancestors would have had an advantage in reaching nutritious tree leaves in this habitat, so taller individuals were likelier to pass on their genes. This evolutionary process resulted in giants who could feast on foliage well beyond the reach of other animals. In addition, males fight with their long necks, adding even more selective pressure. Safety from predators is a big perk, too \u2014 their height means giraffes can see danger from far away, and they aren't easy for predators to subdue.\n2. There Are Several Species in the Giraffe Family (Including One Non-Giraffe)\nThe okapi is considered the closest living relative of giraffes. Daniel Jolivet / Flickr/ CC BY 2.0\nGiraffes were long seen as one species with nine subspecies. That's still how the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies them, but not everyone agrees. A 2001 study suggested two species exist, followed by another in 2007 that identified six species.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff Other studies have gone as high as eight, but many scientists now recognize three or four giraffe species.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\nIn the four-species taxonomy, there is the northern giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), southern giraffe (G. giraffa), reticulated giraffe (G. reticulata), and Masai giraffe (G. tippelskirchi). The northern giraffe has three subspecies (the Kordofan, Nubian, and West African giraffes), and the southern giraffe has two (the Angolan and South African giraffes). This classification is embraced by the Giraffe Conservation Foundation (GCF), which notes it is based on genetic analysis of more than 1,000 DNA samples taken from all major giraffe populations across Africa.\ufeff\ufeff\nThese giraffes are the only living members of the genus Giraffa, but if you zoom out one taxonomic level to the family Giraffidae, they are joined by another genus. It includes just one species, the okapi, a forest dweller whose slightly elongated neck hints at its relation. Research indicates the last common ancestor of giraffes and okapis lived about 11.5 million years ago.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n3. Giraffes Hum to Each Other at Night\nAside from subtle grunts and snorts, it was long believed giraffes don't vocalize. With such long necks, many scientists reasoned, it would be too difficult for giraffes to generate enough airflow to make audible sounds. However, in a 2015 study, a team of biologists reported evidence of giraffes at three zoos humming to each other at night.\ufeff\ufeff\nMuch is still unknown about these hums, which the researchers describe as \"rich in harmonic structure, having a deep and sustained sound.\" It's unclear if they are truly a form of communication, but the study's authors speculated they may serve as contact calls to help the animals stay in touch after dark.\n4. Even Newborn Giraffes Are Taller Than Most People\nA mother giraffe grooms her calf in Tanzania's Serengeti National Park. Alberto Cassani / Getty Images\nNewborn giraffes are roughly 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall and 220 pounds (100 kg). The mother giraffe, whose legs alone are about 6 feet long, gives birth standing up, so the calf must endure a long drop to the ground. Yet it still stands up on its spindly legs within about an hour of birth.\nThat quick adjustment is important. While adult giraffes are tall and massive enough to fend off most predators, the same isn't true for their calves, about half of whom don't survive their first year.\n5. You Have the Same Number of Neck Vertebrae as a Giraffe\nAdult giraffes are two times as tall as the rim of a basketball goal. With so much of that height found in their necks, it would be sensible to assume they have more neck vertebrae than we do \u2014 but it would be wrong. Giraffes, humans, and nearly all other mammals have seven cervical vertebrae.\nAs you might imagine, giraffes' vertebrae are not exactly like ours. A single vertebra in a giraffe's neck can measure 11 inches (28 cm) in length, which is longer than the entire neck of most humans.\n6. Giraffes Have Long, Prehensile Tongues\nGiraffes have incredibly long, prehensile tongues to help them rip leaves from trees. Buena Vista Images / Getty Images\nThe diet of a giraffe consists mainly of fresh leaves and twigs from treetops, especially acacia. In addition to the obvious boost they get from their long legs and necks, their tongues play a key role in helping them access this exclusive food source. Giraffes' bluish-purple tongues are about 18 inches (45 cm) long. They're also prehensile, helping giraffes wrap them around leaves and deftly pull them from between the thorns found on acacia trees.\nGiraffes eat up to 66 pounds (30 kg) of food per day, and the dark color of their tongues may help them eat all day without suffering sunburns.\n7. They Don't Drink Much Water\nAn Angolan giraffe bends down for a drink of water. Dorit Bar-Zakay / Getty Images\nThe giraffe's long neck isn't quite long enough to enable it to drink water while standing upright. To get its mouth down to a water source, a giraffe must either kneel or awkwardly splay out its front legs.\nGiraffes only drink water once every few days; even when water is readily available, they rarely drink it, according to the Giraffe Conservation Foundation. Instead, giraffes get most of their water from the plants they eat. They may be more resistant to drought than some other animals. The tall trees on which they feed tend to have deeper roots, enabling the trees to tab into water deep underground that isn't available to shorter trees \u2014 or the shorter animals that feed on them.\n8. They Have High Blood Pressure\nLong necks have given giraffes a key evolutionary advantage, but they also make it more difficult to pump blood up to the brain. Anup Shah / Getty Images\nSince giraffes' heads are located so far from their hearts, their bodies face a unique challenge in pumping blood up to the brain. As a result, giraffes have evolved extremely high blood pressure of 280/180 mm Hg, which is roughly twice that of humans, according to the GCF.\ufeff\ufeff A giraffe's heart typically beats 40 to 90 times per minute when resting, but it may surge up to 170 beats per minute when the animal is running.\nA giraffe's heart can weigh up to 24 pounds (11 kg) \u2014 reportedly the largest heart of any land mammal, although not quite as large as once believed, the GCF explains. The heart reportedly relies on unusually thick walls of the left ventricle to generate such high blood pressure, pumping up to 15 gallons (60 liters) of blood through the body every minute.\n9. They Might Be Able to Swim\nThe body shape of giraffes does not lend itself to moving through water, and it was long believed that giraffes simply can't swim. According to a 2010 study, however, giraffes probably are capable of swimming, even if not very gracefully.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff Rather than testing this with actual giraffes, the researchers used computational analysis to examine how the mechanics of a swimming giraffe might work. They found that a full-sized adult giraffe will become buoyant in water deeper than 9.1 feet (2.8 meters), at which point it might be able to swim if it really needed to.\n\"While it is not impossible for giraffes to swim, we speculate that they would perform poorly compared to other mammals and are hence likely to avoid swimming if possible,\" the researchers wrote.\n10. Their Coat Patterns Are Unique, Like Our Fingerprints\nSome giraffe species (or subspecies) have distinctive types of spots, but the exact pattern is different for every individual. Charlie Marshall / Flickr / CC BY 2.0\nAll giraffes have spotted coats, but no two giraffes have the same pattern. Some researchers can even recognize individual giraffes by their distinctive patterns. These spots may have evolved at least partly for camouflage, which could be especially valuable for youngsters who are still short enough to be vulnerable to predators.\nThe spots might also help dissipate heat around a giraffe's body, since the skin temperature is slightly higher on the darker regions, and could play a role in social communication.\n11. They May Be Suffering a Silent Extinction\nA giraffe walks toward the sunset in Kenya's Maasai Mara National Reserve. Marcel Oosterwijk / Flickr / CC BY-SA 2.0\nAbout 150,000 wild giraffes existed as recently as 1985, but there are now fewer than 97,000, according to the IUCN. In 2016, the IUCN moved giraffes from \"Least Concern\" to \"Vulnerable\" on its Red List of Threatened Species. The IUCN still classifies all giraffes as one species, but in 2018 issued new listings for seven of the nine subspecies, listing three as \"Critically Endangered\" or \"Endangered\" and two as \"Vulnerable.\"\nGiraffes are already extinct in at least seven countries, according to the GCF, and now their remaining population has shrunk by about 40% in 30 years. Their decline is largely attributed to habitat loss and fragmentation, along with threats from poaching and droughts, which are becoming more severe due to climate change. The plight of giraffes has received relatively little public attention and scientific study compared with other iconic African animals like elephants and rhinos, leading some conservationists to warn a \"silent extinction\" could be underway. There have been some hints of hope in recent years, however, including more publicity of their decline and population gains among certain subspecies."}

It is the tallest extant terrestrial animal thanks to its long neck and is also the largest ruminant. There are currently nine recognized subspecies of giraffe, although it is currently under debate as to whether or not some of these should in fact be considered separate species.\nGiraffes exhibit a distinctive coat pattern consisting of orange, brown or nearly black patches of fur separated by white or cream lines. Each individual giraffe has its own unique coat pattern, although certain coat pattern traits are inherited by calves from their mothers. Giraffes also have two short, horn-like structures on the top of their heads called ossicones, which are composed of ossified cartilage that is fused to the skull and covered in skin. Ossicones are vascularized, suggesting that they probably play a role in thermoregulation, however they are also used in fights between males.\nGiraffes browse mainly on twigs, preferring the subfamily Acacieae and the genera Commiphora and Terminalia, which are high in calcium and protein to support their growth. In addition, giraffes feed on shrubs, grass and fruit, consuming around 75 lb (34 kg) of plant matter per day. Despite being herbivores, giraffes have also been known to lick dried meat off the bones of carcasses. Giraffes are ruminants, which means they acquire nutrients from their food via fermentation prior to digestion, a process that requires their food to be regurgitated and chewed again to break it down sufficiently.\nGiraffes are known for their very long necks, which are typically around 6 feet (1.8 m) long and are thought to have evolved as a result of competition between African browsing herbivores for access to food. It has been hypothesized that giraffes with longer necks were selected for over time because they could reach food higher up in the trees, so didn\u2019t have to compete with other browsers such as kudu and impala. In contrast, it has also been suggested that the giraffe\u2019s neck evolved as a secondary sexual characteristic, with males that have longer, heavier necks having an advantage in so-called \u2018necking\u2019 contests over females.\nBehavior and Reproduction\nGiraffes congregate in herds that vary in size and composition according to ecological, social and temporal factors, but can number over 60 individuals. Herds are generally composed of only one sex, although mixed-sex groups of females and young males are known to occur. Females are more selective than males in which individuals they associate with and associations tend to be based on space-use and perhaps also on kinship. Whilst young males form groups and engage in play fights, they become more solitary as they mature. However, older males might still associate in pairs or with female groups.\nGiraffes are polygamous, therefore older males mate with multiple females whilst younger males miss out. Males sometimes fight over females by engaging in a behavior called \u2018necking\u2019 in order to establish dominance. Low intensity necking involves two males rubbing their necks and leaning against each other, with the individual that is able to remain more upright winning the bout. Hight intensity necking is more aggressive and involves two males swinging their necks at each other and trying to hit their opponent with their ossicones. Whilst most fights don\u2019t lead to injury, broken jaws, broken necks and even death can occur.\nThe gestation period for giraffes lasts 400 \u2013 460 days, after which females give birth to a single calf, although twins do sometimes occur. Newborn giraffes are already 5.6 \u2013 6.6 feet (1.7 \u2013 2 m) tall and are able to stand up and run around after only a few hours. Nevertheless, newborns spend their first few weeks of life hiding from predators, relying on their coat pattern to provide camouflage. Calves suckle for variable lengths of time, ranging from one month up to a year. Similarly, the length of time that calves stay with their mother varies, but can last up until a new calf is born.\nFun Facts about Giraffes\nThe giraffe\u2019s extraordinarily long neck is only one of many adaptations that provide examples of interesting biological concepts.\nThe Giraffe\u2019s Neck\nGiraffes exhibit a number of physiological adaptations that allow them to successfully survive with such long necks. Given that these animals are ruminants, their digestive systems must be capable of regurgitating food all the way back up the neck from the stomach to the mouth, a feat that is achieved by their unusually strong oesophageal muscles. Giraffes also have the longest recurrent laryngeal nerve of any living animal, which extends from the brain to the base of the neck and back up to the larynx. Individual cells in this nerve are almost 16 feet (5 m) long in the tallest giraffes.\nThe circulatory system in giraffes has also adapted to cater for their long necks. For example, in order to maintain blood flow to the brain, a giraffe\u2019s heart must generate a blood pressure double that required in humans. To accomplish this, their hearts have walls as thick as 3 inches (7.5 cm) wide, are around 2 feet (6 m) long and can weigh more than 25 lb (11 kg). When giraffes bend their heads down, their circulatory systems must also prevent blood from rushing back down to the head, which is achieved in part by the many one-way valves in the jugular veins.\nCooperative Care of Young\nMultiple female giraffes and their calves often gather in nursery herds, which move and eat together. These herds practice cooperative care of young, whereby a mother might leave her calf to be cared for by the herd whilst she forages or drinks elsewhere. This form of care is also seen in a number of other mammal species including lions, spotted hyenas and banded mongooses.\nCaring for another individual\u2019s offspring initially seems like a bad strategy for maximising reproductive success and fitness, thus it might be assumed that this strategy should be selected against. However, given that female giraffe herds are thought to be formed in part based on kinship, it is likely that females are caring for their relatives when practicing cooperative care. Therefore, they are still helping to propagate their genes indirectly, thus increasing their indirect fitness.\nSpecies vs. Subspecies\nIt has traditionally been thought that one species of giraffe exists with nine subspecies, which can be distinguished by their different coat patterns. However, recent studies using genetic techniques suggest that between 2 and 6 of these subspecies should instead be classified as separate species. By comparing the DNA of different populations, scientists have found that certain giraffe subspecies have not interbred for a significant length of time, despite a lack of physical barriers to movement. This reproductive isolation is thought to be a result of giraffes only choosing mates with the same coat type as themselves and is driving speciation within the genus Giraffa.\nThe ability to study different populations at a genetic level has greatly improved our understanding of phylogenetic relationships both between and within taxa, which were traditionally determined using morphology alone. For example, a technique called DNA barcoding recently revealed that a presumed single species of skipper butterfly actually comprises 10 separate species that look almost identical as adults. Similarly, genetic techniques have finally been able to settle the debate over whether African savanna and forest-dwelling elephants are different species or not by confirming that they did indeed diverge into separate species between 2.6 and 5.6 million years ago."}

The legs of giraffes are long and solid. The hind legs are shorter than the front legs. The eyes are quite large, ears are medium-sized and the muzzle is long. The short mane stands upright. The tail is long and thin with a dark tassel of hair at the tip. Giraffes have short and sandy colored coat. They have pelage markings of different shape, colored various shades of brown. This animal has bony horns or ossicones, placed on the top of its head. Normally, horns of giraffes are medium-sized in both males and females. Male giraffes can sometimes grow another pair of horns behind the first pair. Females are identified by thin and tufted ossicones while males usually have thick horns with the hair, smoothed due to sparring."}

But there\u2019s much more to learn about this unique animal.\nLet\u2019s get started! Be sure to watch the short, interesting video on giraffes at the end of the article too.\nWhat do giraffes look like?\nGiraffes are the world\u2019s tallest mammals. Their legs alone are six feet tall! Most giraffes reach a height of 14 to 19 feet. Their famously long necks are six feet in length.\nEven their tongues are almost two feet long.\nThey weigh 1,750 to 2,800 pounds. Giraffes have spotted coats. No pattern of spots is exactly the same. However, giraffes from the same area have coats with a similar pattern.\nOn the top of their heads, giraffes have \u201chorns\u201d that are actually knobs covered with hair and skin. They protect the giraffe\u2019s head from injury.\nWhere do giraffes live?\nGiraffes live in central, eastern, and southern Africa. They can be found in the continent\u2019s dry savannas. There, they roam among tall trees and open plains.\nWhat do giraffes eat?\nGiraffes sometimes eat grass, fruit, and vegetables, but their favorite food is leaves. They especially like the leaves of the acacia tree.\nThey feed 16-20 hours a day and are almost constantly chewing. They eat up to 75 pounds of leaves every day. Still, they can survive on as little as 15 pounds daily.\nBecause of their height, giraffes have no real competition for food. Their long necks make it easy to eat leaves that other animals can\u2019t reach.\nAcacia leaves contain lots of water, so giraffes can go days without drinking any water.\nThis is good news, because their long necks and long legs make it difficult for giraffes to bend down and drink.\nThis difficulty makes them vulnerable to predators while drinking. In groups, giraffes take turns drinking so the others can watch for dangerous predators.\nGiraffes in captivity can drink up to 10 gallons of water daily.\nGiraffe herd behavior\nGiraffes are social animals and live in large herds, usually of 10 to 20 animals. Some groups are as large as 50 giraffes.\nThese herds are not organized and can contain males and females of any age.\nUnlike most other species, the giraffes in a herd don\u2019t always stay together. They can come and go as they please.\nBaby giraffes, called calves, stay with their mothers until they are older, and some male giraffes prefer to travel alone.\nFemale giraffes bond very well together. They often form \u201cnursery groups\u201d to take care of young giraffes, with the mothers taking turns eating and watching the calves.\nFemales give birth to one calf after a fifteen-month pregnancy. Infants can stand within 30 minutes and run with their mothers after just 10 hours.\nGiraffes are usually not noisy, but they can communicate with whistles, moans, and cough-like sounds. Calves do make a series of loud noises when they are in danger.\nGiraffe population size\nThere are still 97,500 giraffes in the wild, but they are classified as a vulnerable species. Their numbers are decreasing.\nGiraffes are threatened by the loss of habitat and the loss of the acacia trees they rely on for food. They are also hunted for their meat, hide, and even tails.\nYoung giraffes are often attacked by lions, hyenas, and leopards. Scientists estimate that only 25% of infants survive to adulthood.\nOther Interesting Facts About Giraffes\nThe name giraffe comes from the Arab word zarafa, which means \u201cthe one who walks very fast.\u201d\nWhen baby giraffes are born, they fall five feet to the ground.\nRecent research shows that baby giraffes inherit the shape, size, and color of their spots from their mothers.\nSome scientists now believe that giraffes should be divided into four separate species.\nGiraffes can run up to 35 miles an hour for short distances. At long distances, they can easily maintain a pace of 10 miles per hour.\nGiraffe\u2019s tongues are a bluish-purple color.\nMale giraffes are called bulls. They sometimes fight for dominance with battles called \u201cnecking,\u201d which involve butting each other with their necks and heads. These battles usually end peacefully, with the weaker bull walking away.\nA giraffe\u2019s heart weighs 25 pounds, the biggest heart of any land mammal. Why is it so big? It takes a lot of work to pump blood all the way up to the giraffe\u2019s brain!\nGiraffes are smelly. Believe it or not, this is a good thing. Scientists believe it keeps ticks and fungus away from the giraffes.\nGiraffe\u2019s hooves are the size of a dinner plate.\nMore Animal Facts.\nInteresting Video \u2013 Why are Giraffes Important?"}

A male giraffe can reach 18 feet (5.5 meters), and a female can reach 14 feet (4.3 meters).\nA giraffe\u2019s legs average six feet (1.8 meters). They have the world\u2019s longest tail.\nBecause of their height, their necks are too short to reach the ground. They must bend their front legs awkwardly to drink water.\nGiraffe markings are unique, resembling human fingerprints. Strangely, no two giraffes have the same spots.\nThey weigh between 2,400 and 3,000 pounds, while females weigh between 1,600 and 2,600 pounds!\nGiraffe Neck\nThe Giraffe has a 7-foot long neck, over half its height.

Although a giraffe\u2019s neck is 1.5 \u2013 1.8 metres, it contains the same number of vertebrae at a human neck. A giraffe's habitat is usually found in African savannas, grasslands or open woodlands. The hair that makes up a giraffes tail is about 10 times thicker than the average strand of human hair. The distinctive spots that cover a giraffe\u2019s fur act as a good camouflage to protect the giraffe from predators. When the giraffe stands in front of trees and bushes the light and dark colouring of its fur blends in with the shadows and sunlight. It is possible to identify the sex of the giraffe from the horns on its head. Both males and females have horns but the females are smaller and covered with hair at the top. Male giraffes may have up to 3 additional horns. Giraffes are ruminants. This means that they have more than one stomach. In fact, giraffes have four stomachs, the extra stomachs assisting with digesting food. Drinking is one of the most dangerous times for a giraffe. While it is getting a drink it cannot keep a look out for predators and is vulnerable to attack. Male giraffes sometimes fight with their necks over female giraffes. This is called \u201cnecking\u201d. The two giraffes stand side by side and one giraffe swings his head and neck, hitting his head against the other giraffe. Sometimes one giraffe is hit to the ground during a combat. A female giraffe gives birth while standing up. The calf drops approximately 6 feet to the ground, but it is not hurt from the fall. Giraffes have bluish-purple tongues which are tough and covered in bristly hair to help them with eating the thorny Acacia trees."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe guide | BBC Wildlife Magazine | Discover Wildlife", "url": "https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/mammals/facts-about-giraffes/", "text": "In our expert guide by the Giraffe Conservation Foundation, learn all about these impressively tall mammals, including key species facts, their diet and best places to see them in their natural habitat.\nAdvertisement\nWhat type of mammal is a giraffe?\nThe giraffe is an African even-toed ungulates and the world's tallest living terrestrial animal. Some other even-toed ungulates include, hippopotamuses, deer, goats, camels, cattle, antelopes and sheep.\nHow many species of giraffe are there?\nA study published in Current Biology in 2016 suggests that the giraffe is not a single species, but a subfamily containing four distinct species - the northern giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), southern giraffe (Giraffa giraffa), reticulated giraffe (Giraffa reticulata) and Masai giraffe (Giraffa tippelskirchi).\nTo make this groundbreaking discovery, the team examined DNA taken from skin biopsies of 190 giraffes collected across Africa. This sampling included populations from all nine previously recognised giraffe subspecies, which may now be spread across four separate species.\nThe differences in each group\u2019s genetic composition suggest that there\u2019s little crossover between the various species, which implies that they must have evolved separately.\nHow tall is a giraffe?\nThe giraffe is the tallest mammal in the world, standing at around 4-5m high, and the tallest giraffes ever recorded have been up to 5.9m. That\u2019s over a meter higher than a double-decker bus. It shouldn't come as a huge surprise that such a large animal weighs quite a lot as well - up to 1900kg, which is more than most cars!\nGiraffes under a tree, silhouetted against the sunset in Etosha National Park, Namibia. \u00a9 Ac Productions/Getty\nOne of our favourite giraffe facts is that they're probably the biggest pollinators in the world thanks to their great height. As they wander around feeding from the tops of trees, they inadvertently transfer genetic material on their muzzles from the flowers of one tree to those of another.\nHow many bones do giraffes have in their necks?\nDespite being incredibly tall, giraffes still only have seven vertebrae in their necks - which means a giraffe neck has the exact same number of bones as a human neck!\nA giraffe at Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Game Reserve in South Africa. \u00a9 Jeremy Wade Shockley/Getty\nHow does a giraffe drink?\nWith difficulty! A giraffe\u2019s neck is too short to reach the ground. As a result, it has to awkwardly shuffle and spread its front legs to reach the ground for a drink of water. Fortunately giraffes only need to drink once every few days, as they can get most of their water from all the plants they eat.\nGiraffe drinking from a waterhole in Etosha National Park, Namibia. \u00a9 Martin Harvey/Getty\nWhat do giraffes eat?\nGiraffes mostly eat fresh leaves and twigs from the tops of trees (particularly spiky acacia trees) where other browsing species can't reach them. That means giraffes can afford to be pickier than most big animals, and they're also better able to cope with droughts than smaller animals, as the tallest trees tend to have the deepest roots that reach down to water that other trees can't access.\nA giraffe showing off its tongue - perfect for picking the leaves from acacia trees! \u00a9 Getty\nBut you might be more surprised to discover that the seemingly gentle giraffe also eats bones. Giraffes aren't predators, so they don't kill other animals, but their huge skeletons require more calcium and phosphorous than they can get from a strictly vegetarian diet. The easy solution is to chew the bones from carcasses to make their own bones stronger, a behaviour known as osteophagy.\nWhat noise does a giraffe make?\nIt was previously thought that giraffes are quiet animals that don't make a noise, however research now suggests that giraffes in fact hum mostly at night, with the occasional snort or grunt.\nHow do giraffes give birth?\nGiraffes occasionally sit or lie down, but not for long. They do most things standing up, including sleeping, mating and giving birth. After a gestation lasting around 450 days, one of the longest of any hoofed animal, a female giraffe drops her calf \u2013 literally. The 100kg baby falls around 2m to the ground, snapping its umbilical cord.\nSometimes the mother bends her hindlegs slightly to help, but it\u2019s still a brutal plunge. Amazingly, the infant is unharmed and will be on its legs and suckling within the hour. It stands over 1.6m tall \u2013 tall enough to reach mum\u2019s teats.\nThis Q&A originally appeared in BBC Wildlife Magazine, and was answered by Ben Hoare.\nWhat is a baby giraffe called - and how do they stand so quickly after birth?\nA baby giraffe sitting between her mother's legs in Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya. \u00a9 Eastcott Momatiuk/Getty\nA baby giraffe is called a calf and incredibly it has the ability to stand, with the odd wobble, soon after being born. It is thought the long gestation period of a giraffe \u2013 15 months \u2013 helps the calf become more developed so it can stand and walk at a very early age.\nPlease note that external videos may contain ads:\nWill a giraffe faint if it stands up too quickly?\nA fully grown giraffe can raise or lower its head by up to 5m, so it might actually pass out were it not for a dense network of fine capillaries (the \u2018rete mirabile\u2019) that cushions its brain against rapid changes in blood pressure.\nOther adaptations to prevent sudden giraffe collapse are valves to stop the back-flow of blood and elastic-walled vessels that dilate and constrict to manage flow. NASA has even done research on the blood vessels in giraffe legs to get inspiration for human space suits.\nReticulated giraffes have some of the most distinctive patterns, with big, bold brown patches interlaced by a complex web of white lines. \u00a9 Keith Szafranski/Getty\nAre giraffes endangered?\nCurrent giraffe numbers mean the IUCN classifies the animals as a species of \u2018least concern\u2019. But if the results of the study above lead to the total giraffe population being split between four species, the adjustment could lead to one or more of them being classified as species under threat.\nWhat a tragedy it would be if we lost this funny giraffe face forever! \u00a9 Marc Rauw/Getty\nWhere do giraffes live?\nThe natural habitat for giraffes used to be distributed throughout North and West Africa, including the Sahara, and along the Nile. However, today giraffes are only found in sub-Sarahan Africa.\nHow did giraffes evolve?\nSurprisingly enough for an African species, the giraffe originated from Eurasia, probably temperate Eurasia. This genus evolved seven to eight million years ago.\nTwo giraffes and four zebras at a waterhole in Etosha National Park, Namibia. \u00a9 PytyCzech/Getty\nAre any other animals related to giraffes?\nThe giraffe genus (Giraffa) is part of the Giraffidae family, which contains only one other species: the rare okapi, the closest relative of the giraffe. This forest-dweller has a shorter neck, just like the extinct species from which both it and giraffes are thought to have evolved.\nWhile the okapi's black-and-white hind stripes might make you think of zebras, the resemblance is purely coincidental.\nOkapi - a relative of the giraffe Okapi are the only living relative of the giraffe. Both are in the Giraffidae family, with girafffes in the Giraffa genus and okapi in the Okapia genus. Okapi are the only living relative of the giraffe. Both are in the Giraffidae family, with girafffes in the Giraffa genus and okapi in the Okapia genus. Giraffidae are ruminants, and share a common ancestor with deer and bovids. On first sight, the two Giraffidae look quite different but do share a number of similar features, including a long, dark-coloured tongue. In the okapi, the tongue can measure between 14 and 18 inches long and they can lick their own ears and eyelids. Read our guide to okapi and learn more about the species\nWhat is a group of giraffes called?\nQuite aptly, a group of giraffes is called a 'tower'. Giraffes are also called a herd of giraffes.\nDo giraffes walk like horses?\nUnlike most other four-legged mammals like horses, giraffes swing both legs on the same side at almost the same time during their walk, known as \u2018pacing\u2019. Camels walk in the same way, and you'll feel the sideways motion if you ever ride one.\nWhen a giraffe breaks into a gallop, its odd walk disappears and it runs in a more 'normal' way.\nHow big are a giraffe's hooves?\nGiraffe feet are the size of a dinner plate with a diameter of 30cm. These huge hooves prevent giraffes from sinking into loose sand despite their great weight.\nGiraffe hooves in South Africa. \u00a9 Richard du Toit/Getty\nCan giraffes swim?\nUntil recently it was widely assumed that a giraffe\u2019s long, spindly legs would not provide sufficient purchase in water to support its neck, and that the proportion of its elongated extremities to its short body would reduce buoyancy.\nTherefore the giraffe was supposedly the only mammal in the world that could not swim (indeed, the authoritative Handbook of the Mammals of the World states bluntly that it cannot).\nYou might see a giraffe wading, but you won't see one swimming. Ann & Steve Toon/Robert Harding/Getty\nBut this is probably wrong. A 2010 study in the Journal of Theoretical Biology used a complex digital model to prove that the average adult giraffe would, in fact, become buoyant in 2.8m of water.\nAdmittedly its heavy front legs would tip the animal forward, so to keep its head clear it would need to crank its neck backwards at an awkward angle, while the legs, swept to the rear, would have limited power.\nSo a giraffe could theoretically swim, but it would almost certainly never choose to, and it would be pretty terrible at it anyway.\nHow does a giraffe swim? If you're wondering how you would even go about testing the bouyancy of a giraffe without a very large swimming pool or even a giraffe, have a read of this explanation by one of the study's authors: If you're wondering how you would even go about testing the bouyancy of a giraffe without a very large swimming pool or even a giraffe, have a read of this explanation by one of the study's authors: Can They Swim?

Researchers who spend long enough studying the same giraffes eventually find that they can recognise dozens or even hundreds of individuals from their patterns.\nNo other giraffe looks like this one - its pattern is unique. \u00a9 Paul Banton/Getty\nHow do giraffes cope with high temperatures?\nIt's thought that the pattern on a giraffe doesn't just serve to camouflage the animal, but also helps with temperature regulation too. The coloured skin patches can act to dissipate heat around the body, as the temperature of the skin is slightly higher in darker regions, facilitating the dilation of vessels beneath the skin's surface.\nGiraffes also have an efficient nasal cooling system to regulate brain temperature up to 3\u00b0C lower than the rest of the body.\nHow long is a giraffe's tongue?\nGiraffe tongues are huge!

Children can grasp information at a fast pace, and learning about different animals can really broaden their knowledge. So why not start with some facts about giraffes for kids. Giraffes are the world\u2019s tallest mammals and Africa\u2019s largest Artiodactyla ruminants. Besides their distinctive long neck, they have a unique build with two hairy horns, a long tail, a bluish-purple tongue, skinny legs, and a body covered with intriguing patterns. Giraffes were also called camelopards in the olden days because they have a long neck like a camel and a spotted body like that of a leopard. Thus they got their scientific name of Giraffa camelopardalis. Dive into this post for some more captivating facts on giraffes.\nWhere Do They Live?\nGiraffes are primarily the natives of the sub-Saharan areas of Africa, Chad, Niger, and Somalia. They prefer to live in hot, dry regions such as savannas, woodlands, and grasslands. These long-necked mammals are the most common sights in east Africa\u2019s Amboseli National Park and Tanzania\u2019s Serengeti National Park.\nGiraffes usually live in non-territorial groups, with up to 20 in each group. They live in around 33 square miles in wet areas and 580 square miles in dry areas (1).\nWhat Do They Eat and Drink?\nGiraffes are voracious and enormous eaters. These herbivores have a varied diet and like to devour new shoots and leaves from the thorny acacia tree. They munch on selected low fiber and high energy trees. A fully grown large giraffe consumes around 145 pounds of grass, leaves, and flowers a day.\nThe giraffe\u2019s tongue and an inside layer of the mouth have extra-tough tissues to protect from thorns. It has prehensile lips and a 21-inch tongue to grasp the leaves and pull them into the mouth. In case the foliage is not thorny, it combs the leaves from the stems by drawing with incisor and lower canine teeth.\nGiraffes spend about 16 or more hours per day eating or traveling to other places searching for food. Their keen eyesight and height help them see a long distance to find food or spot a predator.\nDespite their large size and build, they require significantly less water to survive. In the dry or hot season, they drink water once in three days. Hence, they are usually found in places far away from the sources of water. But when they start drinking, they drink a lot of water.\nGiraffes sleep for around 20 minutes per day, with power naps that last only a few minutes. They do not lie down but stand and sleep. At least one giraffe stands on guard while others in the herd take a nap or rest. Instead of running, they sprint at 37mph, which helps them run away from the predators. They also have strong, large hooves that act as a form of defense.\nGiraffe Life Cycle Facts For Kids\nBeing the tallest animal, a male giraffe exceeds 5.5m high and weighs up to 4255lb, whereas a female giraffe is 4.5m high and weighs up to 2600lb.\nThough giraffes are not territorial, they live in groups called towers. An older male or bull leads the pack, and the female giraffe or cow breeds around four or five years. The gestation period is 15 months. The giraffe stands while giving birth, and when the calf is born, it falls from about 5ft to the ground. A single offspring or a calf weighs around 220lb and is about 6.5ft tall (2).\nThe calf starts to walk within an hour of its birth and runs within six hours. Until a week of its birth, the mother keeps the calf isolated and nurtures it. After that, the calf is slowly let in with the other calves of the same age in nursery herds.\nThese calves are more prone to predator attacks, and only half of the newborn offspring survive. Calves start eating grass from the age of three weeks, but they also suckle their mothers till they are 18 to 22 months of age.\nThe giraffes reach maturity between three to six years, and they live for around 25 years in the wild and a little more when in captivity.\n33 Facts About Giraffes For Kids\nListed below are some intriguing facts about giraffes that children would find fascinating (3) (4) (5).\nGiraffes have a long tail, which measures about 8ft long.\nThe giraffe\u2019s neck is about 5.9ft long and has seven vertebrae. These vertebrae have flexible joints, which allow the giraffe to stretch its neck.\nThe giraffe\u2019s tail is made of hair that is around ten times thicker than human hair.\nThe giraffe\u2019s coat is covered with distinctive spots except on the belly that acts as camouflage to save them from predators.\nBoth male and female giraffes have small horns, also called ossicones. The female ossicones are smaller compared to male ossicones and are covered by hair.\nThe giraffes keep on chewing on their food constantly and have four compartments in the stomach, and so they are known as ruminants. One compartment helps in digesting food.\nThe long giraffe tongues are bluish-purple and are covered with bristles like hair. Its hair protects the tongue from the thorny acacia trees.\nThe male giraffes fight with their necks and heads for the female giraffes. It is known as necking, in which they use their head as clubs and swing their neck wildly for fighting.\nThey are tranquil animals and do not stick to only one sound to communicate. They make various sounds, such as grunting, mooing, and hissing.\nThe closest known relative of the giraffe is the okapi, which looks similar.\nThe giraffes are called even-toed ungulates as they have an even number of toes on each hoof.\nThe giraffe legs have a unique character\u2014the front legs are longer than the back legs that help them run fast for a brief spurt of time.\nThough mild-natured, giraffes can be aggressive when attacked, and a firm kick with their hoofs can injure a predator.\nOne uncommon threat giraffe faces due to its height is lightning strikes.\nAs of 2016, the International Union For Conservation Of Nature has reclassified the giraffe\u2019s conservation status as vulnerable.\nThere are nine classified giraffe subspecies, among which the Rothschild giraffe and west African giraffe are endangered.\nGiraffes have long eyelashes that protect their eyes and keep dust particles from getting into their eyes.\nGiraffes have thick-walled arteries in their neck, and the presence of extra valves helps to counteract the gravitational force whenever their head is up.\nWhen the giraffes lower their head to the ground, unique vessels present at the brain base help control their blood pressure.\nThe giraffe\u2019s gait is known as pace. It means that both the legs on one side move together in synchronization.\nA giraffe walks in two paces: amble (around ten mph) and gallop (approximately 35mph). While galloping, it first lifts off its hind legs, and almost together, its front legs come down. It can also be seen that no two hooves of the giraffe touch the ground at a time.\nThey flex their necks while running to maintain their body balance.\nConsidered one of the tallest subspecies of the giraffe, the Rothschild giraffe weighs 2500lb and is about 20ft tall.\nGiraffe has large lungs that can hold approximately 12gal of air at a time.\nGiraffes can drink around 10gal of water at a time.\nGiraffes have a large heart weighing about 22-24lbs that beats 170 times per minute.\nIt has been speculated that giraffes have been living on the earth for more than 30 million years.\nGiraffes have a long tongue that is helpful not only for eating but also for cleaning their ears.\nAll the giraffes have different spots on their bodies, which means no two giraffes have the same spots, which easily distinguishes them.\nReticulated giraffes are the most common giraffes seen in zoos or captivity.\nGiraffes are subjected to illegal wildlife trade and the shrinking of their natural habitat.\nWorld Giraffe Day was established by the Giraffe Conservation Federation in 2014 and is observed on June 21st.\nAccording to IUCN, the main threats for the giraffe species include illegal hunting, habitat loss, habitat conversion, climate changes, and civil unrest.\nGiraffes are beautiful, majestic, and among the oldest mammals known to live on the earth. Many of us are fascinated by the features and height of this gorgeous animal. Known to be strong and sensitive, they can sense the dangers from quite far. But owing to its uniqueness and despite the ability to sense danger at a distance, the giraffe has slowly become an endangered species, with seven of its subspecies being extinct already. According to a survey, in the past 20 years, there has been a steady decline in the giraffe population, and the mammal is now considered under the vulnerable category, which means it requires special attention and protection to prevent total extinction.\nThese facts about giraffes for kids contain fascinating information about them that many may not know. These gentle giants are Africa\u2019s pride that attracts thousands of visitors every year. However, it is unfortunate that some of the subspecies of giraffes are slowly going extinct and are considered endangered. So educate your children about their importance and encourage them to raise awareness about these beautiful and unique animals with this collection of facts about giraffes for kids.\nKey Pointers Giraffes are mainly found in the African continent and live in a group of about 20.\nAn adult giraffe may eat up to 145 pounds of grass, leaves, and flowers each day.\nThe giraffe\u2019s tongue is about 21-inches long, and the length of its tail is around 8ft.\nReferences:\nMomJunction's articles are written after analyzing the research works of expert authors and institutions.

It is traditionally considered to be one species, Giraffa camelodpardalis with nine subspecies.\nPhylum: Chordata\nGenus: Giraffa, Brisson\nKingdom: Animalia\nOrder: Artiodactyla\nThe lifespan of African Giraffes is between 20 to 25 years, they also have the longest gestation period of around 14 to 15 months, They usually give birth to one calf at a time, although twins are possible. African Giraffes spend most of there lives standing up, even giving birth, sleeping. Its baby can stand up and run within an hour of being born, its speeds upto 35mph when running.\nIt has a longest tongue of about 20 inches and are darkly coloured. They consume over 75 pounds of leaves in a day. Its new born is taller than most humans. They take long to drink, its heart weighs approximately 11 kgs and it\u2019s the biggest of any land mammals. Just like fingers prints, no two Giraffe have the same spot pattern.\nThis is not one of those unusual little occurrences in nature, this is completely normal. Mature male African giraffes (bulls) will often grow an extra \u2018ossicone\u2019 (name for those \u2018horns\u2019 \u2014 not actual horns), but this \u2018ossicone\u2019 is not made of cartilage like the real ones \u2014 this one is actually a Calcium deposit that makes its head heavier. Bulls need heavier heads for fighting.\nThe legs of adult African giraffes are taller than most humans. They are the world\u2019s tallest living animal, and to reach those great heights they grow pretty quickly! A calf can grow an inch a day.\nDid you know that the scientific name of a girrafe is G. Camelopardis derived from camel and leopard coz some people thought it\u2019s a cross breed between a camel and leopard.\nCamel \u2013 long neck\nPardalis from pardus \u2013 leopard. That is spotted like a leopard\nA giraffe\u2019s patches contain a high concentration of sweat glands, helps it control its body\u2019s heat \u2014 it gets rid of extra body heat because on the surface are many blood vessels.\nAfrican Giraffes females do not fight; only the bulls and they can live together in a herd of cows and calves, and only fight when they want to breed. The cow does not come into season \u2014 they can breed anytime, but prefer to give birth in the rainy season.\nWhen bull\u2019s fight, they do not use their ossicones (those horn-like protrusions) to fight. They use their heads and neck to slam into their opponent\u2019s body to unbalance him so that he falls to the ground. For this reason, male African giraffes have heavier heads \u2014 usually have more than two ossicones (like an extra one on its forehead) (with neck and head) are a strength thing. The one to lose its balance and sometimes fall, is the loser and the bull still standing is the winner.\nBy the way, those extra ossicones (they can have up to five) are actually Calcium deposits.\nThe giraffe\u2019s range extends from Chad to South Africa.\nBetween 1985 and 2015, we lost 40% of our wild African giraffes population and only in the last few years are greater efforts made to come to the rescue, although they are already extinct in 7 countries.\nAfrican Giraffes in the 19th Century were almost hunted to extinction and in 1906 they were one of South Africa\u2019s rarest species, but thanks to their great conservation efforts they now boast a healthy population \u2014 still vulnerable, but a lot more stable.\nThe greatest population is the subspecies, the Maasai giraffe with almost 38, 000! They are found in central and southern Kenya and Tanzania. Some of these great giraffes (Maasai\u2019s have the darkest patches found on any giraffe) have been trans-located into Rwanda. The greatest number of giraffes are found in Tanzania, but sadly those numbers are falling due to habitat loss as Tanzania has seen a dramatic increase in human population and the poor giraffe has been squeezed out, especially in areas surrounding the Masai Mara National reserve.\nThey are also victims of poaching for bush meat. An international conservation project is underway to educate and collect as much scientific data as possible about these fragile animals.\nMaasai giraffes are classified as a \u2018vulnerable species\u2019.\nOut of all the African giraffes, Maasai giraffes may be the easiest to identify. Besides having darker patches (a richer brown) Maasai giraffe also have the most jagged edges on their patches and they are the largest of all the giraffes. Their patches go all the way down their legs to their hooves.\nAfrican Giraffes: World\u2019s tallest mammal\nAfrican Giraffes are undoubtedly the world\u2019s tallest mammal and by extension, the tallest species in the animal Kingdom. The adult is about 5.5m, taller than 3 adult men joined together. The height plus an excellent eyesight are used for sighting predators (lions and hyenas) from a distance. The leg alone is about 6 feet long and can run 35 miles per hour for short distances.\nThe origins and a few more basic facts\u2026\nGirrafa camelopardalis as the scientific name, was coined by the Greeks to mean \u201ccamel with leopard spots\u201d. Lamarck\u2019s theory of evolution of \u2018use and disuse\u2019 held that the neck became longer due to the constant use of it as a necessity to feed from tree tops (browsing). This was, however debunked since the law postulated that such physical traits were inherited by the offerings.\nIt\u2019s an herbivore and has a long tongue of about 53cm (4.5 feet, 20.8 inches) for aiding its browsing.\nThey get water from the plants they feed on and only drink water once in a few days. These animals spend most of their lives standing up \u2014 they even give birth standing up.\nAfrican Giraffes are more unique than we think.\nLike human fingerprints, giraffes have different pattern of spots, no two individuals have same pattern. Both males and females have hair covered horns called \u2018ossicones\u2019.\nA group of giraffes is called \u2018towers\u2019, usually about 15 members led by an adult male. The male is called a bull and the female, a cow, while the baby is called a calf. Its lifespan is about 25 years in the wild and 40 years in captivity.\nGiraffes do not have territories; they have home ranges, and the males only fight for breeding rights \u2014 this can be at any time as giraffes do not have a breeding season.\nThe fighting of giraffes is called \u2018necking\u2019. Mature males have less hair than the female giraffe.\nThe giraffe has the largest, longest and tallest points of most animals. Here is another\u2026\nA giraffe has the largest heart of any land animal (bigger than the biggest land animal, the elephant) \u2014 it is 24 inches long.. This heavy organ weighs 25 pounds (11 kg)!\nAs you can see, a giraffe has one heart, as some believe they have two hearts.\nGiraffes have no upper, front teeth. They have the same amount of teeth as we do \u2014 32 permanent teeth.\nAlthough giraffes do not drink often because they get most of the water they need through the food they eat, but in dry times we tend to forget about them and think they will cope. They also suffer and have to travel great distances to find waterholes or rivers."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe - Description, Habitat, Image, Diet, and Interesting Facts", "url": "https://animals.net/giraffe/", "text": "Giraffes are the tallest living land animals on earth! No one has towered over these creatures since the time of the dinosaurs. Standing at over 18 ft. tall, these creatures are long-necked and long-legged, making these lanky animals perfectly built for browsing on tall trees and branches, taking advantage of food sources other herbivores cannot. Read on to learn about the giraffe.\nDescription of the Giraffe\nThese tip-top creatures stand in at 18 ft. tall, with a record height for the males of 19.3 ft. They have long legs, long necks, and relatively short bodies. Their heads are topped with bony horns, and their tails are tipped with a tuft of fur.\nA short mane runs down the length of their long necks, and their coat is covered with a blotched/blocky pattern. Their base color is light cream, and their spots range from dark brown to burnt orange in color.\nInteresting Facts About the Giraffe\nWhile their obvious most interesting fact is their height, that doesn\u2019t mean these creatures can\u2019t leave you even more surprised! Giraffes are incredibly unique in a number of different characteristics as well as their record-breaking stature.\nLong-Necked \u2013 Much of these creatures\u2019 height comes from their lengthy necks, which can measure well over 6 feet long alone! You would think that this means they have much more neck bones than humans do\u2026 right? In reality, humans and giraffes have the same number of neck bones, also known as vertebrae. The only difference is that the giraffe\u2019s seven vertebrae are super sized!\n\u2013 Much of these creatures\u2019 height comes from their lengthy necks, which can measure well over 6 feet long alone!

Horns\u2026 or Not Horns? \u2013 The hair-covered \u201chorns\u201d on the heads of these creatures are actually known as ossicones. Unlike horns, which are coated in keratin, ossicones have a coating of skin and fur. Ossicones are originally made of cartilage when they are grown, and harden into bone over time.\n\u2013 The hair-covered \u201chorns\u201d on the heads of these creatures are actually known as ossicones. Unlike horns, which are coated in keratin, ossicones have a coating of skin and fur. Ossicones are originally made of cartilage when they are grown, and harden into bone over time. High Head \u2013 Their unusually long neck makes it difficult for blood to get to the brain. In order to pump blood to their brain and extremities, giraffes need large, strong hearts. Their hearts can be as much as two feet long, and weigh well over 25 lbs.! In comparison, the human heart weighs just 11 ounces.\n\u2013 Their unusually long neck makes it difficult for blood to get to the brain.

In comparison, the human heart weighs just 11 ounces. High-Capacity Consumption \u2013 All of that biological trouble supporting extreme height pays off for these creatures. Being heads, and tails, and heads again, above the other herbivores means that giraffes don\u2019t have any competitors in the food market. The average individual can eat 75 lbs. of plants per day.\nHabitat of the Giraffe\nThese creatures are relatively specialized to specific habitats. Though they can survive in a number of different ecosystems they have preferences for specific types of trees. This means that they thrive in environments like savannahs and sparse woodlands. They are more common in open woodlands than they are in more dense vegetation. When food is more scarce they tend to congregate around evergreen trees and bushes.\nDistribution of the Giraffe\nThere are a number of different subspecies (or species depending on what research you believe) spread across different regions of Africa. Some populations are quite fragmented, putting them in danger of genetic inbreeding. Some populations are found in southern Africa, eastern Africa, and a few areas of sub-Saharan Africa.\nDiet of the Giraffe\nThese large mammals are herbivores, which means that they primarily feed on plants. Their primary diet is the leaves of trees and bushes, but they will also eat branches, bark, twigs, and some fruit. Some of their preferred plant species are acacia, apricot, and mimosa trees. They use their long tongues to carefully pluck and strip leaves from branches.\nGiraffe and Human Interaction\nHumans have hunted giraffes for centuries. These creatures make for easy targets, particularly because they are rather conspicuous. Early people used all parts of the creature when hunting, but nowadays trophy hunters target them for their hides and heads, and give the rest to the native tribes nearby. Sport hunting has combined with habitat destruction to place these creatures in danger of extinction. They are currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.\nDomestication\nThough they have been given as gifts and kept in zoos for years, these mammals have not been domesticated in any way.\nDoes the Giraffe Make a Good Pet\nNo, particularly because they would be quite difficult to house. Being incredibly tall has its downsides, including the fact that it probably wouldn\u2019t fit in your house!\nGiraffe Care\nIn zoos, these creatures are provided with savannah-like enclosures. They have extensive room to roam, other animals to socialize with, trees to browse from, and tall feeders to eat from.\nWhile they get most of their hydration from their food, they are provided with a clean water source to drink from as well. Zookeepers also train these animals to voluntarily perform checkups, foot trimmings, and more, using positive reinforcement.\nBehavior of the Giraffe\nThese large mammals are social, but live in flexible groups. While they are almost always found with other members of their own species, they do not keep the same groups over long periods. Most of the time, groups will consist of all males, or all females, though mixed-sex groupings do occur. They are generally quiet and non-confrontational, though males will fight during the breeding season.\nReproduction of the Giraffe\nThe largest and strongest males fight with one another for supremacy. The male that can chase off all the others will mate with the receptive female. After breeding, females have a gestation period of 400 \u2013 460 days. The calf enters the world via a 6 ft. drop to the ground, and can stand and run within hours of birth! Nursing can last anywhere from one month to one year, depending on the mother.\nBeliefs, Superstitions, and Phobias About the Giraffe\nThese odd creatures were known to a number of different cultures, including African, Greek, Egyptian, Roman, and Chinese peoples. The Greeks believed giraffes to be an odd hybrid between a camel and a leopard, hence their species name camelopardalis. This curiosity even led to these creatures being given as gifts to royalty."}

Behind their beautiful appearance with a unique fur, long neck, and unparallel tallness, some peculiarities define them as unique animals in the world.\n1. The giraffe is the tallest animal in the world with an average height of 16 to 20 feet.\n2. Giraffes can reach a speed running up to 60 km/h.\n3. Humans and giraffes have the same number of vertebrae in their necks; the difference is that those from the giraffe are enormous.\n4. Giraffes are herbivores but can lick carcass bones to absorb calcium.\n5. The favorite food of giraffes are the leaves of the genus Acacia, a thorny tree.\n6. The tongue of all species of giraffes is prehensile, black and can measure up to 20 inches.\n7. Giraffes are not mute; they perform several vocalizations that resemble those of a cow.\n8. Mothers give birth standing, and the baby falls to the ground at the height of about two meters without suffering damage.\n9. The kicks are their biggest defense. They are capable of killing a lion with just one of them.\n10. The speed, size, and excellent vision of giraffes also help them to flee from predators successfully.\n11. Giraffes are the largest ruminants in the world. They have four compartments in their stomach capable of digesting all the leaves they consume.\n12. Males are usually more solitary, although the herds may have a set of females and males as well as young.\n13. Giraffes are genetically related to the okapi, with whom it shares some similarities.\n14. There are four species of giraffes, with some endangered subspecies.\n15. Both genders have protuberances of ossified cartilage covered with skin on the top of their head called ossicones fused to the skull.\n16. Giraffes have been present on the African continent for about 10,000 years.\n17. Each subspecies has a unique pattern of spots that become darker with age, especially in males.\n18. Giraffe\u2019s diet is entirely herbivorous, and they feed on more than 100 types of leaves.\n19. Females live 25% more than males; this is because they wear out more.\n20. The future of all giraffe species depends on the quality of the habitat left to them. Every day their populations are reduced more by an environment insufficient for their survival.\n21. Poaching and farming are the two primary threats that these magnificent mammals face.\n22. Giraffe closest relative is the Okapi.\n23. Both genders have ossicones. While some people assume that only the males do, all have them. However, those of females are shorter and grow hair on the top.\n24. Giraffes have seven vertebrae in their necks which give them the flexibility of a wide range of movement with it.\n25. Giraffes are extremely fast. Their front legs are about 10% longer than their back legs. However, they can only run for a short period which sometimes makes difficult for them to outrun predators.\n26. The heart of the giraffe weighs about 25 pounds and reach up to 2 feet long.\n27. It is common to see giraffes interacting with other animals in the wild including zebras. Experts believe this is because the giraffes can see for a long way, and due to their height in areas where those other animals can\u2019t. This characteristic helps them to get an early warning of potential predators in the area.\n28. Female giraffes give birth standing up, and their young may drop several feet to the ground as they are being born. They are protected by the sac though, and this keeps them from being harmed during that process. A newborn is about 6 feet tall!\n29. The spots on the bodies of giraffes offer them some protection in the wild. The camouflage from it blends in well with the African background. Those spots can also be confusing to predators.\n30. A giraffe will consume around 75 pounds of food each day in the form of leaves, grass, and twigs.\n31. The tongue of a giraffe is about 18-20 inches in length. Also, they can bend it to grasp items and to hang onto them.\n32. Giraffes only need about 4.6 hours of sleep each day. Some of them sleep at intervals of no more than 5-20 minutes at a time.\n33. Giraffes do make some types of vocalization which most people have never heard. They include meows by calves and hissing by adults.\n34. It may surprise you to learn that humans often hunt giraffes for their tails, their hides, and to consume their meat.\n35. Giraffes can go for some days without drinking water which is a huge advantage over other animals. There is usually enough water in the leaves of the food they consume to take care of that need for them, but during the dry season, they can drink 10 gallons of water a day."}

How many of them did you know?\nIf you liked these, make sure to check out more animal facts here, and maybe you'll have a right gi-laugh at our giraffe jokes. You can also head over to animal quizzes to test your knowledge on all kinds of critters!\nGiraffes are the tallest mammal on earth\nThat's right, they don't get any taller! Unless a blue whale was to stand up on its tail (unlikely) the giraffe is the tallest mammel, and can grow up to 6 metres tall! Must be useful at the cinema!\nGiraffe spots are unique\nA bit like human fingerprints, no two giraffes have the same spots, making each of theme totally unique!\nThe Romans called them 'Cameleopards'\nThis is because they looked a bit like camels, but with spots like a leopard! Cameleopards a bit of a weird word though, so maybe giraffe is easier to remember!\nThey need hardly any sleep\nGiraffe sleep for only about 30 minutes TOTAL each day! They do most of this through short naps, and don't need much shut eye at all! Could you stay awake for 23 hours?\nTheir necks can't reach the ground\nAlthough they have long necks, they also have long legs which makes reaching the ground almost impossible. This is why giraffes stoop with their legs splayed when they need to drink. It's pretty funny to watch!\nThey sleep standing up\nNot only do giraffes need a minimum amount of snooze time, they can do it standing up! They also give birth standing up, so they spend most of their time on their feet! Sounds pretty tiring!\nTheir horns are called ossicones\nThese are little horns made out of cartilage, and both male and female giraffes have them, as well as other similar animals like okapis. Sometimes when the males fight, they will butt each other with these little horns. You have to admit, it's not very scary.\nThey are found on the African Savannah\nGiraffes can be found on the African savannah, in countries like Kenya, Botswana and Zimbabwe. They like wide open plains to roam over, as well as places with watering holes and tall trees to provide them with food.\nTheir legs are taller than most people\nA giraffe's legs alone can be six foot tall, taller than the average human! It must be a bit like walking around on stilts all day, but at least you could reach everything on the top shelf of the fridge!\nThey have super long tongues\nNot only do they have long necks and legs, a giraffes tongue is also oversized, often as long as 21 inches -that's about two rulers! Their tongues help them scoop up leaves from high branches on the tops of trees. Clever!"}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe facts to know before your visit - animalsafari", "url": "https://animalsafari.com/giraffe-facts-to-know-before-your-visit/", "text": "Everyone loves giraffes! In fact, giraffes are often the most sought-after animal by visitors. While they certainly look unusual, towering over every other animal, they are actually interested in many ways. We\u2019ve compiled a list of some of the most interesting facts about our long-neck friends to help you get ready for your next visit.\nSocial Animals\nGiraffes are friendly and social animals by nature. In the wild, they live in herds and spend their time traveling, eating, and resting together. Ironically, a group of giraffes is called a tower! Not only do they enjoy being surrounded by other giraffes, they often enjoy the humans as well. They will eat from your hand and may even enjoy the occasional head pet!\nGiraffes are Vegetarian\nGiraffes are huge animals, and they\u2019re entirely powered by plants! These vegetarians eat all types of greenery, from leaves and twigs to berries and seeds. Their favorite type of leafy treats come from the acacia and mimosa trees, and they are known to eat up to 100 pounds of plants a day. They can get all of their nutrients, and water, just from plants!\nThey don\u2019t\u2019 drink much\nIt\u2019s surprising to hear that a giraffe can go a long time without drinking, and when they do drink they don\u2019t need much, but it\u2019s true! Their diet of plants is water-dense, which means they don\u2019t have to venture to a watering hole as often as other animals. This helps them out in the long run since they don\u2019t have to make themselves vulnerable in a watering hole. This is especially helpful since it\u2019s hard for them to lower their heads to drink.\nThey are fast!\nGiraffes are surprisingly fast animals. They have powerful muscles and long legs that take large strides. This allows them to reach speeds of up to 35 miles per hour! While impressive, this speed isn\u2019t sustainable, just long enough to help them get out of dangerous situations. But with their long gait, even a leisurely trot can seem pretty quick!\nGiraffe Babies\nWhen you think of \u201cbabies\u201d you think of something small and cute, but giraffes are born weighing between around 150 pounds! They are also about 6 feet tall at birth. Their impressive size comes in handy because they fall about 5 feet at birth and can start walking just about an hour after birth. So while they aren\u2019t small, they are still very cute!\nAs you can see, giraffes are not only beautiful, but they\u2019re pretty unique as well! From their long lives and long necks to their natural speed, these gentle giants are endlessly fascinating. If you love giraffes and want to see one in person, visit us!

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "50 Fascinating Facts About Giraffes - Green Global Travel", "url": "https://greenglobaltravel.com/facts-about-giraffes/", "text": "Lanky, awkward, affectionate, and endearing\u2026 you\u2019d be hard pressed to find someone who\u2019s not intrigued by Giraffes. These evolutionary marvels, which get their name from the Arabic word Zarafa (\u201cone who walks swiftly\u201d), are statuesque wonders of elegant beauty.\nNative to Africa, Giraffes roam throughout the continent\u2019s sub-Saharan regions. Giraffe habitat primarily consists of open savannahs and grasslands where they can wander around freely, peering out into the distance to see if any predators are lurking nearby.\nAs a herd, these herbivores migrate to areas rich in shrubs and deciduous trees. The climate they live in is very warm, experiencing dry and wet seasons. Giraffes adapt to these changes by being able to consume a variety of different leaves and twigs (but Acacias often seem to be their favorite).\nSadly, their numbers are declining fast due to poaching and habitat loss, with the Giraffe population in Africa dropping by 40%. They\u2019re also preyed upon by Lions, Hyenas, Leopards, and African Wild Dogs, with only about 20% of all baby Giraffes making it to adulthood.\nGiraffes were recently added to the IUCN\u2019s Endangered Species List, with several subspecies currently listed as critically endangered. So here\u2019s a look at 50 fascinating facts about Giraffes, including the most common subspecies, their diets, and what\u2019s being done to save them.\nREAD MORE: Animals in Kenya (A Guide to 40 Species)\nBASIC GIRAFFE FACTS\n1. Though once believed to be a single species, four distinct Giraffe species are now recognized: the Southern Giraffe, Masai Giraffe, Reticulated Giraffe, and Northern Giraffe. They\u2019re classified based on their color, patterns, and geographical regions they inhabit. There are also several subspecies, including the Angolan Giraffe, Nubian Giraffe, West African Giraffe, Rothschild Giraffe, and Kordofan Giraffe.\n2. The earliest known giraffid, the Palaeotragus, lived approximately 20 million years ago. This prehistoric species was tall, but did not have as long a neck as Giraffes do now. Living in areas of barren soil led them to reach for leaves in the trees. After countless generations of stretching, they evolved genetically into the Giraffe we know today.\n3. Female Giraffes are known as cows, while males are called bulls and baby Giraffes are calves. They\u2019re classified as a species of the Artiodactyla order, along with about 220 other mammals. These animals (including Cows, Deer, Goats, and Hippos) are all herbivores and mostly live in grassland habitats.\n4. This weird animal only shares one close genetic relative, the Okapi. The black and white, Zebra-like legs of the Okapi can be deceiving. But a closer look at its head shows a striking resemblance to the Giraffe\u2019s long ears and face.\n5. Giraffes live together in herds with an average of 10 to 15 individuals. This helps them survive against predators, taking turns feeding while others look out for danger. Though they\u2019re generally mild-mannered, an adult Giraffe can shatter a Lion\u2019s skull with one powerful kick.\n6. Hungry carnivores are not the only threatening creatures the Giraffe has to fear. In fact, the most dangerous ones are no larger than a seed. Tiny ticks feast on the Giraffe\u2019s blood, leaving them weak and tired. Nematodes and flatworms can also be ingested through water, causing infections and skin disorders. Tanzania\u2019s Ruaha National Park has observed 79% of its Giraffe population showing signs of infection.\n7. Surviving in the harsh African wilderness leaves little time for sweet slumbers. Giraffes are constantly on alert for danger, so they usually manage to function on just two hours of sleep a day. They normally sleep while standing, just like horses. They will occasionally lie down, folding their legs under their body but keeping their heads erect.\nREAD MORE: Top 10 National Parks in Tanzania\nGIRAFFE NECK & BODY FACTS\n8. The neck is obviously the species\u2019 most distinctive physical trait, measuring up to six feet long and weighing around 600 pounds. The length of the Giraffe neck gives the illusion of a complex anatomical structure underneath. But these towering creatures have only seven neck vertebrae (just like humans!), each of which is about 10 inches long and connected with ball-and-socket joints for flexibility.\n9. The Giraffe\u2019s neck length requires huge, hot air balloon-like lungs, which are eight times the size of a human\u2019s. However, they breathe at a much slower rate because of the \u201cdead air\u201d that gets caught in their long tracheas. So previous breaths are not fully released before the animal begins inhaling again.\n10. The Giraffe is the tallest living mammal on Earth. Males grow to be about 18 feet tall. Females are slightly shorter than the males, but still reach a staggering height of 14 feet.\n11. Giraffes have humongous hearts that weigh around 25 pounds, generating enough pressue to propel blood up through their long necks and into their brains. They also have special blood vessels that contain valves that help prevent the backtracking of blood from gravity.\n12. The two horns that stick out of the Giraffe head are not real horns, but ossicones\u2013 a form of thick cartilage covered in skin. Baby Giraffes are born with flat ossicones to avoid injury during birth, but they grow as they mature into adults. Males have thicker ossicones, which they use in mating-related battles.\n13. Giraffes are fairly quiet beings: They do have a larynx (a.k.a. voice box), but rarely use it. If they become alarmed, a simple snort is often used to alert the herd of a possible threat. They\u2019re also known to produce a mild humming sound during the night, perhaps to help locate other herd members in the dark.\n14. Everything about the Giraffe is long, including its luscious eyelashes. This helps to keep dust out of their big eyes, which are the size of golf balls. They sit laterally on the Giraffe\u2019s head, providing them with keen eyesight. They can\u2019t see in full color, but they do see shades of red, orange, yellow-green, and violet.\n15. Animals with hoofed feet, such as the Giraffe, are known as ungulates. Each foot has two even hooves. Each of an adult Giraffe\u2019s feet are about 12 inches wide. These large hooves give them stability and prevent them from sinking into loose sand.\n16. Sometimes known \u201cstink bulls,\u201d Giraffes carry a not-so-pleasant odor. Their fur releases natural repellents like indole and 3-methylindole (the same compounds found in feces) to ward off insects and parasites. Researchers believe this pungent odor tells potential mates that they\u2019re free of parasites.\n17. Giraffes have also been spotted using their grapple-like tongue to pick their noses.\nREAD MORE: Exploring Magical Tarangire National Park, Tanzania\nGIRAFFE MATING & GESTATION\n18. Male Giraffe necks are massive and powerful. To establish mating rights, bulls participate in a fighting ritual in which they swing their mighty necks like swords, delivering powerful blows by ramming their heads into each other\u2019s bodies. Their heavy skulls are coated with calcium to shield their brains. Although it is very rare, there have been recorded deaths from these intense battles.\n19. Female Giraffes mate with dominant males in hopes of passing on strong genes. They ovulate every two weeks, allowing for year-round Giraffe mating. Ovulating females release pheromones that attract males, who may sip her urine to confirm she\u2019s ready to mate. The willing males will follow her to await her decision on who she wants to reproduce with.\n20. Once successful Giraffe mating occurs, the the gestational period is approximately 15 months. The mother brings her a single baby into the world while standing up, causing the newborn to fall about six feet to the ground. The rough landing breaks the amniotic sac and umbilical cord, and encourages the baby Giraffe to start breathing.\n21. Some Giraffes have been reported returning to the place where they were born to give birth.\n22. Within an hour of birth, a baby Giraffe can get up and walk on its own. This is crucial so that it can quickly move with the herd in case a predator comes near. Even with its shaky, lanky legs, the newborn stands taller than most humans (about six feet) and weighs an average of 150 pounds.\n23. Mothers are extremely protective of their young. They will form \u201cnursery groups\u201d with other females from the herd, taking turns watching over the extremely vulnerable baby Giraffes. Sadly, only about 20% of all Giraffes live to reach adulthood.\n24. Although they\u2019re not considered adults until age four, male calves will leave their mothers at around 15 months old and join all-male bachelor groups. They\u2019ll contest for dominance while still coexisting peacefully. Once they\u2019re ready for mating, dominant male Giraffes will visit a female herd.\nREAD MORE: Meru National Park, Kenya (From Joy Adamson to Elsa\u2019s Kopje)\nGIRAFFE DIET\n25. Baby Giraffes are very dependent on their mothers for the first 4 to 6 months, relying on their milk for nutrients. After that, the mother will pull leaves off trees to feed to them until they\u2019re tall enough to reach their own. An adult Giraffe will typically consume about 66 pounds of food per day.\n26. Giraffes possess an 18-inch prehensile tongue that can grip objects, much like a Gorilla\u2019s hands or an Elephant\u2019s trunk. They use them to pluck leaves from acacia trees, maneuvering around the spiky thorns. The rough-textured surface of the Giraffe tongue, or papillae, keeps it protected. It\u2019s believed that the tongue\u2019s bluish purple coloration helps to keep it from getting burned by the sun.\n27. The Giraffe\u2019s neck doesn\u2019t quite reach the ground when the animal needs to drink, so they have to splay their legs and kneel a bit. The neck\u2019s complex pressure-regulation system (the \u201crete miribale\u201d) prevents excess blood flow to the brain. The Giraffe uses its lips suck water into the back of the mouth, where it\u2019s held in the esophagus until the neck is lifted back up and the water can pass into the stomach.\n28. Like camels, Giraffes don\u2019t require much water, drinking only once every few days. This is a useful adaptation, as the African savannahs often experience dry seasons. Most of their hydration comes from the plants that they eat. When they do drink, they can quickly consume up to ten gallons at once.\n29. Giraffes have a special four-chambered stomach, with a digestive system that classifies them as ruminants. Much like bovines (including Cows, Buffalo, and the Saola), Sheep, and various species of Antelopes, Giraffes chew their cud. Their main stomach compartment, the rumen, helps to break down the cellulose in plants and convert it into energy.\nREAD MORE: How to Get the Most For Your Kruger National Park Entrance Fee\nMASAI GIRAFFE\n30. Also known as the Kilimanjaro Giraffe, the Masai or Maasai is the largest Giraffe subspecies, with males reaching a height of up to 19 feet. They can be identified by their jagged, star-shaped patches. Males have dark chocolate brown patches, while females wear a lighter dirt-brown shade. Unlike other Giraffe species, their patches flow all across their bodies and down their legs.\n31. The Masai Giraffe can be found throughout East Africa, including Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia. They are also the national animal of Tanzania, which boasts the largest overall Giraffe population of any African country.\n32. Although Tanzania has recently increased its anti-poaching and conservation efforts to protect Masai Giraffes, their numbers have severely declined in recent years. The latest estimates put their population at around 35,000, a drop of nearly 50% over the last three decades. As a result, the subspecies was recently declared endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\nREAD MORE: Maasai Mara Conservancies (Community-Based Conservation in Kenya)\nRETICULATED GIRAFFE\n33. If you\u2019ve been to any local zoo, odds are you saw a Reticulated Giraffe. Although native to Somalia, this type of Giraffe is commonly found in captivity, with most wild populations in northern Kenya. They will interbreed with other subspecies in captivity, or if they become low in numbers in the wild.\n34. The subspecies\u2019 appearance is distinguished by their wide, reddish, polygonal spots, which are outlined with bright white lines.\n35. Unfortunately, Reticulated Giraffe habitat is facing destruction, causing them to disappear in the wild. Their current population is around 15,780 (less than half what it was 30 years ago), causing them to be added to the IUCN Red List of endangered species in 2018.\n36.) Two completely white Reticulated Giraffes were spotted at Kenya\u2019s Ishaqbini Hirola Conservancy in 2017. The unusual mother-daughter duo have a genetic condition called leucism, which inhibits pigmentation in the skin cells. Only three of these incredibly rare white-skinned Giraffes have been reported in sightings by the wildlife conservation program.\nREAD MORE: Minnesota Zoo Conservation (How Zoos Help Endangered Species)\nROTHSCHILD\u2019S GIRAFFE\n37. The Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe is named after famous British zoologist Walter Rothschild, who is best known for the collection now housed at the Natural History Museum at Tring.\n38. The subspecies is also known as the Baringo Giraffe (after the Lake Baringo area of northern Kenya) or the Ugandan Giraffe. All animals remaining in the wild inhabit protected areas in these two regions. It was once believed that the Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe and the Nubian Giraffe were completely different subspecies, but recent research has discovered that the two are genetically identical.\n39. It\u2019s easy to tell the Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe from other subspecies. Their coat looks a bit like the Masai Giraffe, but with sandy skin and less jagged, caramel-colored patches that give them a more yellowish coloring. They also have no markings on the lower leg, and are the only Giraffes born with five ossicones, with smaller bumps in the center of its forehead and behind each ear.\n40.) Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe rank among the most endangered subspecies of Giraffes, with approximately 1,399 individuals remaining in the wild. Nairobi\u2019s Giraffe Centre, run by the African Fund for Endangered Wildlife, is a great place to see these endangered beauties up close.\nREAD MORE: The Best Environmental Charities & Animal Charities to Donate To\nWHY ARE GIRAFFES ENDANGERED?\n41. In what\u2019s being called a \u201csilent extinction,\u201d Giraffe population numbers dropped from 155,000 in 1985 to 97,000 in 2015, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Habitat destruction is the leading reason Giraffes are endangered. Rapid expansion of human development and the effects of war continue to fracture the various subspecies\u2019 home lands.\n42. Like most high-profile species of sub-saharan wildlife, Giraffes are also increasingly threatened by poaching. They\u2019re a favorite kill among Big Game hunters, and some African communities target them for subsistence meat.\n43. In the cultural practices of some central African countries, the Giraffe\u2019s tail is used to ask a bride\u2019s father permission for marriage. The long black hairs on the tail are also occasionally taken to make bracelets, fly whisks and threads.\nREAD MORE: 15 Harmful Traditions & Cultural Practices Tourists Shouldn\u2019t Support\nGIRAFFE CONSERVATION\n44. As recently as 2010, Giraffes were considered \u201cLeast Concern\u201d in terms of conservation consideration by the IUCN. But by 2016 the entire species has been classified as Vulnerable, and may no longer exist in their historic habitat in Angola, Eritrea, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria, and Senegal.\nFortunately, the UN-backed Convention of Migratory Species selected Giraffes for special protection in 2017. Today there are numerous sanctuaries and national parks all around the African continent that are striving to provide them with a safe haven.\nHere\u2019s a brief list of the major Giraffe conservation NGOs working to protect the beloved species for future generations:\n\u2022 African Fund for Endangered Wildlife\u2013 The NGO behind Nairobi\u2019s Giraffe Centre has a huge focus on educating kids from local communities about the importance of wildlife conservation. Their sanctuary is also a leading light in breeding endangered Rothschild\u2019s Giraffes and releasing them into the wild.\n\u2022 African Wildlife Foundation\u2013 The AWF works to educates local communities on sustainable agricultural practices in hopes of limiting human-animal conflict, as well as leading acacia planting projects in areas where Giraffe habitat has been deforested.\n\u2022 Giraffe Conservation Alliance\u2013 This nonprofit organization works to connect people and zoos around the world to Giraffe conservation projects in Africa in hopes of ensuring a sustainable future for all Giraffe subspecies.\n\u2022 The Giraffe Conservation Foundation\u2013 The GCF is the only NGO in the world that concentrates solely on the conservation and management of Giraffe in the wild throughout the African continent. They\u2019re currently involved in conservation initiatives in 15 different countries.\n\u2022 The Wildlife Conservation Society \u2013 The WCS monitors Giraffe populations to control habitat loss and poaching, as well as collaborating with other wildlife conservation groups on joint efforts.\nREAD MORE: Top 15 Female Wildlife Conservationists & Animal Rights Activists\nFUN GIRAFFE FACTS\n45. Despite being herbivores, Giraffes oddly seem to enjoy chewing and sucking on bones (which is known as osteophag). They primarily pick on barren carcass remnants when their bodies are very low on nutrients. This supplies them with extra calcium and phosphorous in order to strengthen their bones, which is especially beneficial for males preparing for \u201cnecking\u201d battles over mating rights.\n46. Did you know that Giraffes are pollinators? They inadvertently collect pollen on their fur when rummaging through the trees. Much like bees, they carry this pollen to other trees (especially acacias), allowing them to blossom. Other surprising pollinators include Bats, Rats, and even certain Lemurs.\n47. A small bird known as the Oxpecker is an unlikely friend of the Giraffe. The two share a mutually beneficial relationship, with the orange-beaked birds eating harmful ticks and insects off of the Giraffe\u2019s fur. They\u2019re tiny enough to rest on the neck and back of the giraffe without disruption.\n48. Would you believe that NASA has actually studied these magnificent animals to aid their adventures in space? The Giraffe\u2019s remarkable circulatory system regulates their blood pressure effectively through a considerable amount of gravitational force, particularly when it bends down to drink. NASA examined this gravity-defying adaptation in 1997 to help them develop more advanced space suits for astronauts.\n49. In the ancient world, this bizarre specimen was thought to be a combination of two dissimilar animals. The Giraffe\u2019s small hump on its back and spotted skin gave it the nickname, \u201cCamel-leopard.\u201d This is where the species gets its scientific name, Giraffa camelopardalis.\n50. While it is undoubtedly appealing to the human eye, Giraffe fur is also crucial to their survival. The dusted gold skin between brown shaded patches gives the Giraffe a distinguishable pattern of naturally beautiful symmetry that helps them stay somewhat camouflaged against the African plains. \u2013by Megan Butler & Bret Love; photos by Bret Love & Mary Gabbett"}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe | San Diego Zoo Animals & Plants", "url": "https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/giraffe", "text": "Hello up there! Why do so many people look up to giraffes\u2014besides the obvious reason? The long and short of it is that they are a wonderful example of nature\u2019s creativity.\nGiraffes are the tallest land animals. A giraffe could look into a second-story window without even having to stand on its tiptoes! A giraffe's 6-foot (1.8-meter) neck weighs about 600 pounds (272 kilograms). The legs of a giraffe are also 6 feet (1.8 meters) long. The back legs look shorter than the front legs, but they are about the same length. A giraffe's heart is 2 feet (0.6 meters) long and weighs about 25 pounds (11 kilograms), and its lungs can hold 12 gallons (55 liters) of air! Its closest relative is the okapi.\nGiraffes have a small hump on their back and have a spotted pattern similar to that of a leopard. For a long time people called the giraffe a \u201ccamel-leopard,\u201d because they believed that it was a combination of a camel and a leopard. That's where the giraffe's name camelopardalis comes from!\nAlthough a study of giraffe genetics published in the scientific journal Current Biology concluded that there are actually four distinct species of giraffes\u2014said to be as different from each other as polar bears are from brown bears\u2014one is currently recognized, with nine subspecies. The subspecies have different coat patterns and live in different parts of Africa. Giraffe coat colors vary from light tan to practically black. The differences occur due to what the giraffes eat and where they live. Each individual giraffe\u2019s markings are as individual as our fingerprints.\nMasai giraffes, from Kenya, have patterns that look like oak leaves. Uganda or Rothschild's giraffes sport large, brown splotches separated by thick, beige lines. The reticulated giraffe, found only in northern Kenya, has a dark coat with a seeming web of narrow white lines.\nHow many bones are there in a giraffe's neck? Just like humans, giraffes have seven neck vertebrae. For giraffes, however, each one can be over 10 inches (25.4 centimeters) long!\nBoth male and female giraffes have two distinct, hair-covered horns called ossicones. Male giraffes use their horns to spar, throwing their neck against each other. As a male matures, calcium deposits begin to form on his skull to protect it when he head-butts with other males. These calcifications can be quite pronounced, giving the strange appearance of a three- to five-horned giraffe.\nGiraffes are so big that they really don't need to hide from predators. There is safety in numbers! It\u2019s hard to pick out one giraffe from another when they form a tight group.\nBesides humans, only lions and crocodiles hunt them. If they have to, giraffes defend themselves with a deadly kick, karate-style. Their speed, the way they move, and their body designs also help them to escape predators if they need to. Giraffes have a way of moving, or gait, in which both the front and back legs on one side move forward together, then the other two legs on the other side move forward. It\u2019s called \"pacing.\" Giraffes can run very fast\u2014around 35 miles (56 kilometers) per hour for short distances.\nYou might think watching out for lions and spending 16 to 20 hours a day eating would all weigh heavily on a giraffe. Surprisingly enough, giraffes only need 5 to 30 minutes of sleep in a 24-hour period! They often achieve that in quick naps that may last only a minute or two at a time. Giraffes can rest while standing, but they sometimes also lie down with their head resting on their rump. That\u2019s a vulnerable position for a giraffe, though, so usually one herd member stays on guard.\nMany people think that giraffes have no voice, but they do make a variety of sounds, including moos, roars, snorts, hisses, and grunts. They just very rarely do so. One sound giraffes make when they\u2019re alarmed is a snort. Threats\u2014such as lions nearby\u2014may warrant a snort. Giraffes are often the early warning signal for other savanna wildlife: if a giraffe herd starts to run, everyone else does, too! Studies suggest giraffes vocalize below the level of human hearing and perhaps use this sound for long-distance communication.\nIt\u2019s easy to understand why giraffes top the list of so many people\u2019s favorite wildlife. Their elegant stride, outrageous eyelashes, and calm expression give them an air of refinement."}

But there is no need to worry. Even lions and leopards generally leave them alone.\nHow tall are giraffes?\nGiraffes can be up to 18 feet tall, (5.5 meters), but their average height is around 16 feet, (about 5 meters). They are the tallest land animal on Earth. Taller than lions or tigers, and even elephants.\nHow much do they weigh?\nThey can weigh as much as 3000 pounds. That's almost as much as a Chevrolet Corvette. But the average weight is between 1750 and 2800 pounds.\nMales are usually taller and heavier, (averaging up to 18 feet (5.5 m) tall and up to 3,000 lbs. (1,360 kg)). than females, which average about 14 feet (4.3 m) tall and up to 1,500 lbs. (680 kg).\nHow long do giraffes live?\nIn captivity, like zoos or managed preserves, they can live to be 36 years old, but life is more dangerous In the savannas, and without the health management of a zoo, a wild giraffe usually doesn't live to be older than 26 years.\nThis is how tall some giraffes are GAA Composite CC\nBaby Giraffe Facts\nMother giraffes give birth standing up. That means a baby's first worldly experience is a four to six foot drop to the ground. Almost always landing on its head.\nSurprisingly, this doesn't hurt the baby, and the jolt causes it to take its first breath and start breathing on its own. If that doesn't work, mom will give it a kick or two to get her baby to start breathing.\nNewborns can usually stand up within 30 minutes, and are walking by 60 minutes after birth.\nThey are born after a 14 to 15 month pregnancy, and typical birth weight is between 100 and 150 pounds.\nThey are also almost six feet tall when they are born.\nBaby giraffe drinking from milk bottle Pixabay/EyupPors38\nBreastfeeding from mom in the Wild, (and sometimes from milk bottles in zoos), baby giraffes drink mother's milk for their first four to six months, then they switch to eating leaves.\nThey will reach their mature weight in about three years.\nMother and baby giraffe on savanna Pixabay/\nCan Giraffes Sit Down, and What Do They Eat?\nYes, they can sit down, and lay down, but they almost never do when they are in the Wild -- their natural habitat -- because it makes then vulnerable to attack by predators.\nEven though zoo-raised giraffes still have the instinct to always stand up, because of their safe environment, they are often seen laying down, or lounging much more often than ones in the Wild do.\nThey sometimes sit for a quick nap, (5 minutes or less), but for safety they usually sleep on their feet.\nGrown giraffes get most of their sleep with those quick 5 minute standing naps. Even when they do sleep at night, it is usually only for 30 minutes or less. They only need. 30 minutes to a couple hours of sleep a day.\nWhat do Giraffes Eat?\nThey eat leaves. Their favorite food is the leaves of the acacia tree, and that is almost their complete diet.\nCaptive giraffes in zoos and preserves will also eat hay, carrots, and other high-fiber low-starch foods, (like biscuits), but acacia tree leaves are their favorite food, and many zoos place acacia leaf bundles in artificial trees for them to feed from.\nMature, (grown), giraffes can eat up to 75 pounds of leaves each day. Even using their 18 inch tongue, they can only get a few leaves with each mouthful, so that is why they spend so much time eating. Up to 90% of their daytime hours.\nThey are the world's largest \"ruminants.\" That means they chew \"cuds\" of food, (leaves or hay), just like cows do.\nGiraffe eating Acacia tree leaves Pixabay\nHow Fast Can Giraffes Run?\nThey may look awkward with those long gangly legs and their long six-foot neck, but they can explode with speed bursts up to 35 miles per hour, (MPH), for a short time, and can gallop along at 10 MPH for hours.\nThat means they can outrun most of their predators.\nThat speed burst, and their strong long legs are how they escape most attacks.\nSmaller attackers, (like a lion or hyena), find it hard to try to match that speed burst -- and avoid a deadly kick from their hooves -- while trying to make an eight-foot leap to latch onto the giraffe's body.\nHow Long is a Giraffe's Neck?\nThe length of a giraffe's neck averages about six feet long, (1.8 meters), from their body to the base of their head, and can weigh as much as 600 pounds.\nAnother unusual fact is that they have the same number of neck vertebrae as human necks - seven.\nThe difference is that while human vertebrae are less than one inch long, giraffe neck vertebrae can be over ten inches long.\nThe arteries in their neck, the ones that take blood to their brain, have a type of muscle that acts like a \"check valve\" that keeps the blood from rushing to or from their heads when that long six-foot neck raises or lowers it.\nHow Do They Drink Water?\nVery carefully.\nEven with that long neck, a giraffe cannot reach down to the ground without stooping or bending its legs.\nTo do this they have to splay their front legs out to each side, allowing their knees to bend inward. This will lower their body enough for their head to reach the ground or water. But it is a very vulnerable position for them.\nIt lowers their body, making it easier for an attacker, (like a lion), to leap on them, and they also can't take off running without first standing back up. Robbing them of the safety of that 35 mph speed burst that would take them out of danger.\nFortunately, giraffes drink very little water. They don't need to. They get the majority of the water they need from the moisture in the leaves they eat.\nAdult giraffe drinking Pixabay\nWhat Sounds Do Giraffes Make?\nThere are a couple theories on that. In the Wild, they are mostly heard only making occasional grunts, or powerful \"whooshes\" of air.\nResearchers have a theory, (they have recordings to support their theory), that those whooshers that we humans hear are actually understandable, (at least by other giraffes), communications in the infra-sound range, which is too low for humans to hear.\nOther researchers and zoo keepers have heard and recorded them making more sounds. Grunts, moos, bleats, and mews.\nThey have noted that it is mostly the younger ones that make these sounds.\nIt seems that as giraffes mature, their communication sounds become more and more in the infra-sound style of strong whooshes of air.\nBecause of their low frequency, these infra-sounds can be heard for long distances, even from inside a building.\nYou can see and hear more about the sounds giraffes make at; What Sounds Do Giraffes Make (That Humans Can Hear)\nHow Long is a Giraffe's Tongue?\nA giraffe's tongue can be up to 18 inches long. And it is usually a bluish-black.\nIt is called a prehensile tongue because it can be used for grabbing and pulling leaves from tall tree tops.\nA Giraffe using his tongue to grab leaves from an acacia tree Postdif\nDo Giraffes Have Teeth?\nYes, giraffes do have teeth, 32 of them. The same number that humans have, but they are placed differently in their mouth.\nThey have front teeth on their bottom jaw, but not on the top jaw. There they have a hard thickness of tissue called a \"dental pad\" in the place of teeth.\nThis helps them grind their food against it and their bottom teeth as they chew.\nThere are \"back\" teeth on both jaws, but they are mostly molar-type teeth for grinding and crushing,\nGiraffes have 32 teeth too! GAA Video clip capture\nDo Giraffes Have Horns?\nNo, they are not really horns like other animals have. Those are made of dermal bone or keratinized cells.\nA giraffe's \"horns\" are known as \"occicones\", which are formed from cartilage and covered with skin.\nA female's occicones are thinner and tufted with longer hair on top. A male's are larger, have knobs on the ends, and become bald on top as they get older.\nDo Giraffes Have Two Hearts?\nNo, they only have one heart, but it is big and super-charged.\nAnd it's walls are very thick, making it's heart muscles much stronger and able to pump high volumes of blood at higher pressure.\nTheir hearts can weigh as much as 26 pounds, and their blood pressure is at least twice as high as most other animals. This is how they can get blood all the way up that long neck.\nCan You Ride a Giraffe?\nNo, but you can try. They aren't domesticated, or \"broken\" -- like horses or mules -- to accept riders. Also, their gait; the way they run, would make it a very bumpy and bouncy ride.\nIt is claimed that there was a circus rider, back in the 1950s that rode giraffes, but there is no video proof.\nHowever, one young man, a descendant of that circus rider explains his attempts to ride a six and one-half foot baby giraffe:\nTeenager aims to revive 'lost art' of giraffe riding\nAnd in the short video below, you can see another unsuccessful try.\nA Giraffe Ride FAIL\nCan Giraffes Swim?\nThe honest answer is no. Theoretically they might be able to swim, but in real life, so far, the answer is no.\nBesides their huge and heavy body that would weigh them down, and the long slender legs that wouldn't be able to push much water in a swimming stroke, their gait, (the way they move both legs on each side at the same time), would make the effort very awkward.\nA Group of Giraffes is Called a Tower\nGiraffes are social-group animals. That means that as long as everyone gets along, they hang-out together. But they will also leave one group to join another, for no obvious reason.\nAs a social group, they stay together for both protection, (there is safety in numbers out in the Wild), and to help each other with their young.\nGiraffe moms will sometimes even assume \"day care\" duty; watching young calves of the group while their moms do other things.\nA Tower of Running Giraffes\nA Tower Just Hanging Out\nAre Giraffes an Endangered Species?\nNot yet. But in 2016 the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), changed the giraffe's species rating to \"vulnerable,\" and placed it on their IUCN Red List as a vulnerable species.\nIt is estimated there are slightly less than 100,000 giraffes left in Africa. That is down, (a 40% decrease), from about 160,000 in 1985.\nConservationists say that poaching and human encroachment of their natural habitat are the main reasons for the decline in their population.\nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Giraffe Vulnerable Species Scale GAA Composite Screen Capture\n\u00a9 2018 ga anderson\nPatricia Scott from North Central Florida on December 02, 2018:\nSimply am in all of these amazing creatures.

Even so, giraffes continue to harbor surprising facts. The creatures can turn black or white and make inexplicable noises at night. They even ogled a Chinese emperor during the 1400s.\nThere are funny things in their armpits and a puzzling disease creeping up their legs. Even though giraffes are endangered, it is often conservation breeding programs that decide whether they are allowed to live or die.\n10 There Are Four Species\nUntil 2016, there was one species of giraffe. For those who cared to squint harder at subtle differences between ossicones (head \u201chorns\u201d), coat patterns, and different habitats, there were nine subspecies. As the classifications had been made between 1758 and 1911, modern researchers felt that the requirements were unreliable because giraffes had not been studied as deeply as other big African mammals.\nUnlike lions and elephants, there is plenty that remains unknown about giraffes. To discover the truth, a five-year-long study became the first to genetically analyze all the nine subspecies.\nThe DNA tests proved that the \u201cnine\u201d were actually four distinct species\u2014the reticulated giraffe (G. reticulata), Masai giraffe (G. tippelskirchi), northern giraffe (G. camelopardalis), and southern giraffe (G. giraffa). As they do not breed with each other, the correct identification of species is a positive step forward to ensure that all four survive.\n9 The Imperial Giraffes\nDuring the 1400s, Emperor Yongle of China wanted to explore the world. He sent a fleet of ships on seven expeditions which made it as far as South Africa, landing at the modern-day Cape of Good Hope. Yongle liked to collect exotic animals, and foreign nations gave him rhinoceroses, peacocks, elephants, and bears as gifts.\nDuring the fourth expedition, the Chinese arrived at Bengal and met with envoys from Malindi (Kenya). The latter handed over a giraffe, which was promptly stabled aboard one of the Imperial ships. The animal\u2019s size was not a problem. The vessels that sailed during this expedition remain the biggest wooden vessels ever constructed in history.\nDespite Yongle\u2019s vast collection of strange animals, the giraffe made such an impression on the emperor that it became the only animal he asked the court artist to draw. The image added a mythical flavor, suggesting that it was a qilin\u2014a creature comparable with the West\u2019s unicorn.\nA year later, a second giraffe arrived at the royal court. Despite the animals\u2019 strange story, there is no record of what became of the spotty pair.\n8 They Like Carcasses\nNational Geographic photographer Corinne Kendall visited a reserve a few years ago. Once inside Kenya\u2019s Masai Mara National Reserve, she took photos of a macabre incident. Two adult giraffes were busy with a dead wildebeest. Not only did they mouth the carcass, but they occasionally tossed it into the air.\nThis grated against the giraffe\u2019s image as a gentle herbivore. Experts reviewed the photographs and found the behavior was not as deviant as it first appeared. It was likely a case of osteophagy. To keep their own skeletons healthy, herbivores need calcium and phosphorus.\nFor this reason, these mammals gnaw on bones. Recently, another giraffe was filmed licking the skull of a dead buffalo. One of the experts who assessed Kendall\u2019s pictures also told National Geographic that he regularly witnessed the fascination giraffes have for carcasses during his fieldwork. An average of about six times a year, he would encounter giraffes nosing around bones.\n7 Birds Sleep In Their Armpits\nSnapshot Serengeti was a project that ran for years inside the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. It involved camera traps that automatically took photographs when an animal moved nearby. At one point, a camera documented something that had never been seen before.\nResearchers have always known that a brown bird called the yellow-billed oxpecker grooms giraffes and other large African mammals. The tiny creature removes ticks and even feeds on the host\u2019s blood, eye goop, and nose mucus. However, this activity was only observed during the day.\nOne night, a giraffe triggered one of the traps, which took a series of snaps. They showed that the animal\u2019s armpits contained clusters of sleeping oxpeckers. Never before had anyone realized that the birds sometimes chose to overnight on what was basically their food source.\nAlthough it was a surprising find, it was not hard to see why the oxpeckers did it. Apart from ensuring that they stayed with their food-providing host, the giraffe\u2019s armpits were also safe and warm.\n6 Males Turn Black\nGiraffe dudes do something unusual. As they age, their blocks become black. In 2012, curious researchers studied 36 males, all from the Luangwa Valley in Zambia. They knew the precise age of 10 and estimated the ages of the rest based on how dark their patterns were.\nThe animals\u2019 data had been compiled over 33 years, which provided a rich source to plumb about the color change and lives of males. A calf weans at two years old and leaves its birth environment between four and eight.\nThe darkening first becomes obvious when bulls turn seven or eight. The black starts in the middle of the brown patches and bleeds outward toward the edges. This process takes almost two years, and on average, males have a full set of coal-black spots by the time they are 9.4 years old.\nAlthough the 2012 study was the first to establish a timeline, it could not find the cause. As only males experience the change, it could have something to do with testosterone levels. Bulls mature around age 10, which is around the time that their transformation is complete.\n5 A Mysterious Disease\nIn 2014, Arthur Muneza had to pick an animal to study for his master\u2019s at Michigan State University. Like many others, he considered the popular choices\u2014elephants and African predators. However, the biologist chose giraffes when he heard that they suffered from a strange and understudied skin condition.\nGiraffes are somewhat neglected when it comes to megafauna studies. Even the affliction, which may be a contributing factor to their dropping numbers, received a casual name\u2014giraffe skin disease (GSD).\nHowever, Muneza was on fire. He dug into past research and cornered veterinarians as well as zoo and park officials. He scoured old studies for the symptoms, which include lesions on the legs and neck. The areas often turn gray, bloody, and crusty.\nJust eight sources mentioned anything about it. The questionnaires he sent out to those working with giraffes only garnered 63 responses. Zoos reported 14 cases of GSD in their captive specimens. Frighteningly, the Ruaha National Park in Tanzania reported that 79 percent of their giraffes had the disease.\nMuneza\u2019s collaboration with experts is ongoing to unravel what causes GSD, how it spreads, and how it can be cured.\n4 Marius\nIn 2014, Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark considered euthanizing one of their giraffes. As Marius was a healthy 18-month-old, thousands signed a petition for his life to be spared until a new home could be arranged. The zoo\u2019s reason was that Marius had nothing to add to their international breeding program. They also said they could not keep the growing male in case it led to fighting with others.\nDespite the local and international outcry to make an effort to relocate the giraffe, Copenhagen Zoo refused to do so. On a Sunday morning, a staff member fed Marius his favorite meal of rye bread and then shot him. The giraffe was dismembered in front of visitors before his parts were distributed among the zoo\u2019s predators and research facilities.\nThe demise of Marius caused such anger that the zoo\u2019s staff received death threats against themselves and their families. Marius\u2019s short life and public slaughter highlighted something of which few citizens are aware. It is a common practice for zoos to kill healthy animals when their genetics fail to meet breeding standards, when there is no space, or when they do not attract crowds.\n3 They Hum At Night\nGiraffes are quiet creatures. So quiet, in fact, that scientists became suspicious. After all, they move in herds with social structures. This strongly suggested some sort of communication beyond the occasional kick and snort.\nIn 2015, a strange clue was captured at three European zoos. One theory was that giraffes get chatty on frequencies that humans cannot hear. To test this, researchers left recording devices near the creatures\u2019 enclosures. After slogging through 1,000 hours of recordings, the researchers found that giraffes do make a sound\u2014they hum.\nThe noise resembled something between a swarm of bees and monastic chanting. The humming happened at a very low frequency but still fell inside the range of human hearing. Despite this, zoo staff heard it for the first time only when they listened to the tapes.\nThe exact purpose of the sound remains mysterious. Since it happens exclusively at night, it could be a way for giraffes to stay connected in the dark. It could also be a passive sound related to sleeping, like snoring or dreaming.\n2 Kenya\u2019s White Giraffes\nIn 2017, a villager in Kenya\u2019s Garissa County saw two white giraffes. He told conservationists about the bleached pair, and soon, the animals were tracked down. They lived in the best place for such rare creatures\u2014the Ishaqbini Hirola Conservancy.\nThe species was identified as the vulnerable reticulated giraffe. The two animals were also family\u2014a mother and her calf. When the cow noticed the rangers, she calmly hid her baby in the bushes and positioned herself between the infant and the humans, who stood filming a few yards away.\nNot only did the camera capture the curious beauty of white giraffes but it was also the first footage of specimens with leucism. This genetic condition prevents the normal formation of pigment inside skin cells. It differs from albinism in that dark pigment can still flourish inside soft tissues, which was why the mother and calf had dark eyes and some body coloring.\n1 They Are Critically Endangered\nThe plight of the African elephant is well-known. There are only about half a million of the creatures left in the wild. That being said, elephant numbers look fantastic against the remaining wild giraffe population\u201490,000. The last 15 years saw a 40 percent die-off thanks to habitat loss and poachers. Giraffes are now extinct in seven African countries.\nDespite these glaring warning signs, their official conservation status remains merely \u201cVulnerable\u201d as opposed to the \u201cEndangered\u201d African elephants. However, there is hope in small pockets.\nIn 2016, conservationists learned that oil had been discovered in Uganda and that prospectors planned to move into Murchison Falls National Park. A particularly vulnerable group of giraffes lived on only one side of the Nile, and unfortunately, it was the side where the oil was.\nA daring mission floored 20 of the awkward but dangerous animals, packed them onto a ferry, and released them on the other side. Not only did the small herd thrive, but as researchers followed them, they filmed an unknown behavior for the first time. At night, the animals took turns watching for predators while the rest slept with their necks folded over their backs like swans.\nfact checked by Jamie Frater"}

Just imagine a \"newborn\" that is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds!\nGiraffe mothers are pregnant for 15 months, giving the embryo time to develop to such a large size, and when ready to come out, the baby comes front feet first, with the neck and head stretched out over the front knees in a sort of \"superman\" position.\nThis comes in handy because a mother giraffe gives birth in a standing position, which means the newborn comes into the world falling from a height of over 5 feet.\nThe fall and the impact break the umbilical cord and the natal sac, and the jolt of landing causes the little giraffe to take it's first breath!\nUnharmed by the fall, the infant will take up to an hour to rest where it landed, as the mother licks the infant to stimulate circulation and dry the skin, but Africa's infants must be ready to run with the herd, and remarkably, the newborn giraffe is standing, walking and even running, within about an hour of being born.\nGiraffe babies are born with their eyes open, and look very much like miniature adults, but their little horns, called \"ossicones\" are folded flat against their head while they are inside the mother, and take a few hours to start to stand up straight.\nBoth males and females have horns known as \"occicones\", which are formed from cartilage and covered with skin. Females have thinner occicones, that are tufted with longer hair on top. Males occicones are larger, have knobs on the ends, and become bald on top as they mature.\nbaby giraffe close-up\nThe baby also has a shorter neck, percentage wise than an adult, no doubt to fit more neatly in the womb.\nThe baby giraffe eats only mothers milk for the first four to six months of life, and then begins to sample low growing young shoots and leaves. The leaves of the acacia tree are one of the staples of a giraffes diet. Occasionally, mother giraffes are observed reaching high for a variety of leaves, and bringing them down to their youngster to sample, teaching them what is edible, and where the best feeding is.\nWithin the first year of life, the young giraffe has doubled in height, with quite a bit of this being added neck length, very necessary as they begin to forage and eat on their own.\nFemales share in the raising of young with little \"day-care\" groups of youngsters called creches, that the mothers will take turns supervising.\nnewborn giraffe\nThe female is pregnant for about 15 months, and gives birth standing upright.\nThe newborn hits the ground from a height of 5 or 6 feet, the fall of which breaks the umbilical cord and the natal sac. A newborn baby giraffe stands about 5 or 6 feet at the top of the head, and they can weigh between 140 and up to 200 pounds.\nAt birth, the occicones are folded back against the head, but spring up in a matter of hours. Baby giraffes often have alot of hair on their occicones, and have amazingly long eyelashes too.\nNo doubt because of the difficulties of folding up in the womb, the babies neck is not as long, in proportion to the body, as the neck of an adult. Over the first few weeks and months of life, as the baby grows, its neck gets proportionately longer, and at about 4 months old, the youngster is using its long neck to browse for leaves in branches as high as 10 feet.\nGiraffes stay with their mothers between 18 months and 2 years, and females in particular, may travel with her from time to time throughout their lives.\nYoung males may be sexually mature at 6 years old, but will have to wait, usually until they are in their teens, to compete for an opportunity to mate. Males take no part in the rearing of the young, but any groups traveling together will watch for eachother, keep lookout while others drink, and have been known to defend eachother against predators.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

So what kind of special adaptions must occur in order to make such a unique body function properly?\nTo start with, the giraffe has a 25 pound heart capable of creating the extreme blood pressure required to pump blood 8 feet up to the brain. But when the giraffe lowers its head to eat or drink, the blood rushing down at such high pressure would cause the blood vessels to burst. Pressure sensors along the neck\u2019s arteries monitor the blood pressure and activate contraction of the artery walls (along with other mechanisms) to counter this increase in pressure.\nThe blood leaving the giraffe\u2019s heart has to do more than just reach the level of the head, it has to be at a high enough pressure to pass through all the fine capillaries that supply the brain and other organs. To achieve this, the blood leaves the heart at a pressure of 200-300 mm Hg which is probably the highest blood pressure of any living animal.\nA giraffe\u2019s blood pressure is so high that it would rupture the blood vessels of any other animal, but the arterial walls are much thicker than in other animals, and their skin is so tightly stretched over the body that it acts almost like an anti-gravity suit, keeping the giraffe safely inside the giraffe! - Amazing!\na few more giraffe baby facts\nThe giraffe is the largest ruminant and the worlds tallest animal\nMale giraffes can be 18 feet tall at the top of the horns\nGiraffes have 2 to 5 horns called \"occicones\"\nThe giraffes neck is 6 to 8 feet long and can weigh over 600 pounds\nGiraffes \"chew their cud\" just like cows\nGiraffes defend themselves by kicking\nA giraffes kick can kill a lion!\nThe giraffes tongue is about 18 inches long\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Artiodactyla\nFamily Giraffidae\nGenus Giraffa\nSpecies camelopardalis\nGiraffe Facts - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT bull cow calf herd HOME HABITAT LIFESPAN FAVORITE FOOD Africa Asia savanna 20-25 years acacai leaves ENEMIES GENDER DIFFERENCE AVG.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe Fight - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Giraffe-fight.html", "text": "giraffe Fight\nPortrait of a Giraffe\nThe giraffe and its closest relative the okapi are the last survivors of the once plentiful Giraffidae family. While the okapi is a solitary, forest dwelling creature rarely seen, the giraffe is a true show stopper, herds of which wander in surprising abundance across the African savanna.\nToday the giraffe is the tallest animal on Earth, with males topping out at about 18 feet at the tip of the horns (called occicones), and 11 feet at the shoulder.\nAlthough no fossil trail exists, it is assumed the giraffe developed its remarkable physique and out-survived its relatives, by reaching for the treetops.\nAs taller individuals ate leaves and fruits unavailable to shorter individuals, the giraffe thrived, and became more and more specialized. While the 6 to 8 foot long, 600 pound neck is most obvious, the giraffes entire body is a masterpiece of specialization.\nViewed from the side, the giraffes shoulder region is towering, with a highly elongated pectoral girdle which gives the illusion that the front legs are longer than the rear. Front and rear legs are about the same length, however, between 5.5 and 6 feet long.\nWhile the relatively short back has vertebrae of a median size, the vertebrae of the neck, are stretched to about 11 inches long, They still have the standard 7 neck vertebrae found in most mammals, including us, but they are not only elongated, but also articulate far more than ours.\nThe neck is supported by powerful muscles and reinforced ligaments which anchor to vertebrae between the shoulder blades, and form a hump where the back and neck meet.\nThe head is refined, streamlined and equipped with an 18 inch long tongue for even further reach.\nBoth males and females have horns known as \"occicones\", which are formed from cartilage and covered with skin. Females have thinner occicones, that are tufted with longer hair on top. Males occicones are larger, have knobs on the ends, and become bald on top as they mature.\nGiraffes live in very loose groups of 3 to 40 or so, mostly related individuals. They are not territorial, and their social structure is very peaceful and cooperative..\nThough the giraffe is the worlds tallest animal, it is, by mammal standards, remarkably peaceful, with very little territorial drive. Even aggression between adult bulls is limited to largely harmless \"necking\" displays.\nMales and females mingle, young are protected by herd members, and individuals take turns looking out for eachother while drinking or napping.\nGiraffes have a \"fission-fusion\" society, that means groups come together and break apart freely, and friendships and alliances are loose and varied.\nWhat Sound Does a Giraffe Make?\nWhile some may incorrectly report that giraffes make no sounds at all, they are, in fact, diverse in vocalizations, emitting grunts, snorts and flute-like noises of different meaning. Giraffe vocalizations are infrequent, however, and are usually at very low volume. The loudest giraffe calls are from baby giraffes separated from their mother - these are robust, guttural grunts that sound very much like the calls of large adult deer such as elk.\nThe length between lungs and vocal chords could be the reason why there is a limit on the production and volume of giraffe noises, but new research has also found that giraffes make sounds we simply can't hear because they are at too low a frequency. In 2015, it was discovered and documented that giraffes in zoos hummed to eachother. This humming was only at night, and only in the dark, and far too low for humans to hear. - Amazing!\nGiraffe society is very loose, and varied. It is known as a \"fission-fusion\" social structure, where groups come together for periods of time, drift apart, and come together again.\nMales often travel alone, and tend to have larger territories than females. Females with youngsters, however, usually travel together for safety and convenience, and will take turns watching the babies as they play in little nursery groups called \"creches\" or \"calving pools\".\nThroughout their lives, males will engage in wrestling bouts known as \"necking\", where they will stand beside each other, swing their necks wildly, and batter each other with their heavy heads.\nThe occicones are blunt, however, and these engagements aren't real fights, but rather measures of strength and fitness, that end when the weaker opponent concedes, and rarely result in injury. Often, rather, the combatants will engage in some close cuddling and mutual grooming afterwards, that sometimes even leads to sexual interaction.\nCuriously, it has been widely reported that male giraffes engage in more random homosexual activity then just about any other animals on the savanna.\nNecking occurs exclusively among males, and has little to do with impressing females. It establishes who among them will have the opportunity to mate with receptive females. It may take years for a young male to gain the respect of the dominant few, and some may never acquire it.\nFemale giraffes will usually come into estrus during the rainy season. They will pair up and mate with the dominant male of their choice. Males will taste the urine of females coming into season, and can determine their readiness to mate by this method. next: baby giraffe\nmale giraffes \"necking\"\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "27 Weird And Amazing Animal Facts That Will Surprise You", "url": "https://thecarousel.com/sustainability/27-weird-and-amazing-animal-facts/", "text": "1. A chicken with red ear lobes produces brown eggs, and a chicken with white ear lobes produces white eggs.\n2. Even though a polar bear\u2019s average body temperature is 37\u00b0C, they don\u2019t give off any detectable heat and don\u2019t show up in infrared photographs. They also have black skin. This is a protective adaptation to the climate. Black absorbs heat and keeps the polar bear from freezing. Most people also think the polar bear\u2019s fur is white. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s clear to allow the sunlight and heat through to the black skin underneath. It appears white due to a process known as luminescence. This happens when the sun\u2019s rays bounce off the transparent fur, and some of the light energy travels into the hair, getting trapped. The energy bounces around inside the hollow part of the hair causing luminescence which involves the emission of light.\n3. Male giraffes engage in same-sex sexual activity. Many young male giraffes have been observed courting other males, going through a series of attraction rituals including caresses and the touching of noses. In fact, scientists estimate that 94 percent of all giraffe sex happens between two males leaving the other six per cent of sex for procreation of the species. This responsibility falls to older, dominant males who mate with female giraffes during their breeding cycles.\n4. The Platypus, that unique Australian mammal that looks like a cross between a duck and beaver, swims with its eyes closed.\n5. Baby humans suck on their thumbs for comfort. Baby elephants do the same thing but with their trunks.\n6. Young goats are influenced by their peers. In fact, they pick up each other\u2019s accents. If a group of young goats spends enough time together, they all sound the same. Just like teenagers.\n7. Tardigrades are extremely durable microscopic animals that exist all over Earth. They are segmented and have eight legs. They can survive in any of the following environments: 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 Celsius), -458 degrees F (-272 C), the vacuum of space, pressure six times stronger than the ocean floor and more than a decade without food. They exist on top of the Himalayas and on the bottom of the deepest oceans. They are most common in moist environments and are commonly known as water bears or moss piglets.\n8. The now extinct colossus penguin stood an incredible six foot 8 inches tall. That\u2019s as tall as champion basketballer LeBron James. The colossus penguin could hold its breath for 40 minutes at a time, making it an uber fish hunter. By comparison, most whales and dolphins only hold their breath underwater for 20 minutes.\n9. A Wombat is another unique Australian marsupial that lives in a burrow, is about a metre in length and weighs as much as 35 kilograms (77lbs). It also poops in cubes.\n10. The growth of a moose\u2019s antlers is dependent on two things \u2013 the amount of testosterone that a particular male has and the length of the day. Moose shed their antlers (also known as paddles) every year and grow back new ones. The antlers are covered in velvet. This velvet is vascularised, permitting blood flow during the growing season. Then, during the mating season, they rub away the velvet to expose shiny new antlers to impress all the females. Made from bone, a moose\u2019s antlers weight about 40 pounds or about 18 kilograms. After a bull moose reaches his prime, the size of the antlers retracts each year until he dies.\n11. Flamingos are not pink. They are born grey; their diet of brine shrimp and blue green algae contains a natural pink dye called canthaxanthin that makes their feathers pink.\n12. The bat is the only mammal that can fly. The leg bones of a bat are so thin that out of the 1,200 species of bats, only two can walk on ground. These are the Vampire bat and the Burrowing bat.\n13. Elephants have a specific alarm call that means \u201cWatch out, humans about.\u201d Earlier this year, a group of scientists from Oxford University and Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom combined to investigate elephant communication. They played a recording of the human voices to a group of elephants, and they reacted with a clear and distinctive trumpeting call at the same time becoming more vigilant and alert. Having recorded this distinctive call, the team then played it back to another group of elephants. They also reacted to human voices, erupting with vigilance as they ran and trumpeted in the same way.\n14. Previous Oxford University research shows that African elephants also have a distinct warning call for bees, which prompts fellow elephants to flee while shaking their heads, an apparent attempt to prevent bee stings.\n15. Cows can sleep standing up, but they can only dream lying down.\n16. Hippos can run faster than human beings! Even though they weigh as much 4000 kilograms, hippos are one of the fastest creatures on earth reaching and incredible 30 kilometres an hour. They can hit top speed in a matter of just four seconds. This one of the reasons they are considered even more dangerous than lions.\n17. A reindeer\u2019s eyes turn blue in winter to allow them to see in lower light\n18. The most poisonous fish in the world is the stone fish. The stonefish, which reaches an average length of 30 to 40 centimetres and weighs up to up to 2 kg / 5 lbs, is the most venomous fish in the world, having venomous sacs on each one of its 13 spines. They are found throughout shallow coastal waters of the northern half of Australia. Their venom is so toxic that it will stop a human heart.\n19. African buffalo herds exhibit voting behaviour, in which individuals convey the direction in which they want to travel by standing up, looking in one direction and then lying back down. Only adult females vote in this process.\n20. Snakes always keep their eyes open, even when they are asleep. Snakes can\u2019t close their eyes because they do not have eyelids. They do have eye scales that cover their eyes and which they shed when it sheds their skin.\n21. A dog\u2019s sense of smell is incredibly acute. If you stood in a stadium crowded with 40,000 other people, your dog could find you by smell alone.\n22. At birth, a panda is smaller than a mouse and weighs about 110 grams (four ounces). Giant pandas are about 150cm long from nose to rump, with a 10-15cm tail. A large adult panda can weigh about 100-150kg (250-300 lbs), with males 10 per cent larger and 20 per cent heavier than females. An adult panda can spend up to 12 hours a day eating, and to meet their dietary needs, they need to eat at least 14 kilograms (28 pounds) of bamboo.\n23. Male mice are romantic little devils. They serenade their mate with a special mouse song to both entertain them and hold their attention.\n24. Female mice can reproduce at just two months old. A pair of mice can produce 500 offspring more each season, according to the CSIRO, with females birthing a new litter every three weeks. Australia is currently experiencing a mouse plague and while mice numbers of 800 to 1000 mice per hectare is usually considered a plague, an official recently said that trying to count the number of mice right now would be \u201clike trying to count the stars\u201d.\n25. Male dogs will raise their legs while urinating to aim higher on a tree or lamppost because they want to leave a message that they are tall and intimidating. Some wild dogs in Africa try to run up tree trunks while they are urinating to appear to be exceptionally large.\n26. There is a shark called \u2018goblin shark.\u2019 It was discovered in 1897 and is known as a living fossil as it is believed to be little changed in the past 125 million years\n27. Australian Koalas get their name from an Aboriginal/Indigenous Australian term that means \u2018no drink.\u2019 It\u2019s believed this is because koalas get almost all their moisture from the leaves they eat, and rarely drink water. However, eucalyptus leaves are incredibly tough, difficult to digest and poisonous. But koalas have a long digestive organ called a cecum which allows them to break down the leaves and absorb their nutrients unharmed.\nFor more animal facts check the story below:"}

Let\u2019s get started!\nLearn more about animals in Uganda.\n21 Facts About the Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe\nThe Rothschild\u2019s giraffe, also known as the Baringo giraffe, is one of the most famous types of giraffes. Its population is so low that it is can be difficult to see them in the wild. The Rothschild\u2019s giraffe is often referred to as the watchtower of the Serengeti, due to its height. Because it is so tall, it can see predators from a great distance, giving it the opportunity to warn not only its herd but other animals as well.\nWhen traveling to Africa, you may want to familiarize yourself with some interesting giraffe facts. Knowing a little about these majestic creatures can make your time there more exciting.\n1. Why is it Called a Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe?\nThis giraffe is known as the Rothschild\u2019s giraffe in honor of Walter Rothschild. Mr. Rothschild founded the Tring Library and was a noted zoologist. He had many species named after him, including over 150 types of insects, 58 species of birds, and 17 mammals.\nAnother name for the Rothschild\u2019s giraffe is the Baringo giraffe, which comes from the fact that it is seen in the wild around the area of Kenya close to Lake Baringo.\n2. Is Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe a Species or Subspecies?\nNeither. According to the latest science we have, Rothschild\u2019s giraffe is neither a species nor subspecies of giraffe.\nBut it can depend on who you ask. While no one considers it a species, it has been classified as a subspecies by some taxonomists.\nThe most current study (Multi-locus Analyses Reveal Four Giraffe Species Instead of One) has absorbed Rothschild\u2019s giraffe into the Nubian giraffe subspecies. And it is no longer listed as a giraffe subspecies.\nSo according to this classification, the Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi doesn\u2019t actually exist anymore. It now falls under the larger umbrella of the Nubian giraffe subspecies, of the Northern giraffe species.\nLearn more about all giraffe species.\n3. Where Does the Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe Live?\nThe Rothschild\u2019s giraffe lives in desert and savanna plains areas of Africa. They are primarily located in eastern Uganda and western Kenya. All of the areas where you can see Rothschild\u2019s giraffes in the wild are in protected areas.\nIn the wild, the Rothschild\u2019s giraffe is found in small, segmented herds. The lack of proximity to each other makes expanded breeding efforts difficult. You can find giraffes at a number of Uganda\u2019s National Parks.\n4. What Does the Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe Eat?\nThe Rothschild\u2019s giraffe is a herbivore, which means that it exists solely on plants. Their preference is the new, young shoots, leaves and bark from trees and shrubs. Acacia trees are a particular favorite of the giraffe.\nTheir tongue and teeth are well-suited for their diet. Their tongue is long and tough, allowing them to strip leaves from limbs easily. Their tough tongue also allows them to strip the leaves from stems and branches that have thorns. The Rothschild\u2019s incisors are splayed. This unique shape makes it easier for them to strip the leaves they want to eat from the branches.\nIt is believed that the distinctive dark-colored tongue of the giraffe is to protect it from sun exposure during the time that it spends browsing for food.\nCheck out our full guide to what giraffes eat.\n5. How Much Does a Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe Eat?\nRothschild\u2019s giraffes are very large animals, and it takes a great deal of food to fuel their body. An adult will eat about 75 pounds of food each day. The amount of food required for the giraffe to maintain its weight means it spends between 16 and 20 hours eating each day.\nGiraffes are ruminants, meaning their stomach has multiple chambers. If they are not actively eating, they are probably chewing their cud.\nBecause of the water-rich foods the Rothschild\u2019s giraffe eats, they do not need to drink that often. This is beneficial because extending their long necks into a watering hole makes them extremely vulnerable to predators. Reducing the amount of time they spend at watering holes keeps the giraffe herd safer.\n6. How Does the Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe Sleep?\nRothschild\u2019s giraffes require very little sleep. In fact, they often sleep as little as 30 minutes out of each 24-hour cycle. This sleep is broken up into even smaller bits of time. In fact, sometimes they nap for only a few minutes at a time.\nThe majority of the time, giraffes sleep while standing up. This is to protect them from predators. If a predator approached while they were napping while standing up, they could quickly and easily gallop away.\nThis does not mean they never lay down. Giraffes occasionally lay down, resting their neck on their flanks. They are extremely vulnerable in this position. When they do this, at least one member of the herd will remain standing and on watch for predators.\n7. Is the Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe Endangered?\nNot any more. According to IUCN Red List, it\u2019s status is Near Threatened.\nBack in 2010, the Rothschild\u2019s giraffe was listed on the Endangered list. Of the recognized types of giraffes, the Rothschild\u2019s is the second most threatened. It is difficult to get an accurate number, but it is believed that there are approximately 1,399 mature Rothschild\u2019s giraffes in the wild.\nHistorically, this giraffe spread across western Kenya, through Uganda, and into the southern reaches of Sudan. It is nonexistent in most of these areas now, existing solely in small pockets of Kenya and Uganda.\nThe wild population in Kenya is located entirely in National Parks, on private property, and in protected areas. Agricultural development has driven it out of other areas of the country. The population that remains in the wild exists in small groups, isolated from one another, making it difficult to expand the existing herds.\nHow\u2019s your Swahili? Check out our guide to 100+ animal names in Swahili.\n8. How Much Do Rothschild\u2019s Giraffes Weigh?\nAdult Rothschild\u2019s giraffes weigh between 1800 and 2500 pounds, with the adult males weighing more than the females. At birth, giraffes typically weigh around 150 pounds.\n9. How Tall are Rothschild\u2019s Giraffes?\nRothschild\u2019s giraffes mature to between 16 and 19 feet, with males being larger than females. Young can be 5 and a half feet tall at birth. Giraffes are the tallest land mammals.\n10. What Do Rothschild\u2019s Giraffes Look Like?\nThe Rothschild\u2019s giraffe can be distinguished from other giraffes by its coat. Its coat consists of dark orange and brown patches with areas of beige. It also lacks markings on its lower legs.\nFinally, it has five ossicones. These are the horn-like growths on the giraffe\u2019s head. Most giraffe types have two. In addition to the two on top of the head, the Rothschild\u2019s giraffe has a third in the center of its forehead and one behind each ear.\n11. What Are Ossicones?\nOssicones are the horny growths that extend from the top of the giraffe\u2019s head. They are made from ossified cartilage. This differs from horns or antlers, which are made of bone. The ossicones are covered in skin and fur, although in the case of male giraffes, the fur is often rubbed off due to sparring.\nThe giraffe has the ossicone at birth. When young, the ossicone lays flat against the head and are not attached to the skull. This prevents both mother and baby from being injured at birth. As the giraffe matures, the ossicones get larger and tougher.\nAdult males use these as sparring weapons when there are females available for breeding. The sparring process is to establish dominance and does not involve aggressive fighting. Although sometimes a giraffe will receive injuries, they do not fight as aggressively as the males of many species, and they do not chase the losers of the battle away.\n12. Do Rothschild\u2019s Giraffes Give Birth Standing Up?\nLike other types of giraffes, the Rothschild\u2019s giraffe does give birth standing up.\nWhile this means the newborn giraffe has quite the fall at birth, there are benefits to this method of birth. The giraffe is very vulnerable to predators while lying down. Standing up to give birth keeps both mother and baby safer.\nIn addition, the fall from the birth canal helps break the amniotic sac, which is beneficial to the newborn giraffe.\n13. What Type of Habitat Does the Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe Live In?\nGiraffes, in general, prefer hot, sub-Saharan regions of the African continent. The different species of giraffes all prefer similar habitats, which are open forests, grasslands, and savannas. They will range as necessary to find food.\nAlthough giraffes get most of their food from high in the trees, they do not like heavily forested areas. Because of their long necks, areas with heavy forestation are difficult for them to navigate.\nIn addition, one of their strongest defenses against predators is their ability to see a great distance and gallop away before predators get too close. In areas with heavy growth, they lose this advantage. They also have trouble maneuvering in the tighter confines of heavily forested areas.\nLearn about giraffe babies with these 17 giraffe baby facts.\nThe home range for a giraffe is between 10 and 50 miles square miles. The territory of one group of giraffes may overlap that of another, but they are not territorial and do not fight over boundaries.\nA common problem though is that their natural habitat continues to shrink due to human activities, resulting in a smaller home range. As a result, their food sources are reduced.\n14. Is the Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe Aggressive?\nRothschild\u2019s giraffe is generally very tolerant of other giraffes as well as other animal species. They can be aggressive if they feel threatened.\nMales often spar with each other before mating. After sparring, both winning and losing giraffes continue to inhabit the same territory. Unlike many species, the dominant male does not chase the submissive males away.\n15. What is a Group of Giraffes Called?\nA group, or herd, of giraffes is called a tower.\nMore reading: 9 Facts About Giraffe Tongues\n16. How Large is a Tower of Giraffes?\nGiraffes typically congregate in groups of 10 to 20, although they can sometimes form groups with as many as 50 individuals. The groups are made up of all males or females and their young. Male and female groups only intermingle to breed.\nAs male giraffes mature, they often stop living as part of a group and live a more solitary life. Giraffes do not have strong ties with each other and may leave and join groups frequently.\n17. How Often Do Giraffes Give Birth?\nGiraffes can breed at any time of year. Their gestation period is between 14 and 16 months. They typically give birth to one calf, although twins are not unheard of. A giraffe typically breeds for the first time between the ages of three and five. Because the males spar for dominance before breeding, males typically begin breeding at an older age than females.\nWhen the female gives birth, she separates herself from her herd. She typically stays apart from her herd for anywhere from 10 days to a month after birth. She then returns, with her young, to the safety of the herd. She will nurse her calf for about one year. Although the mother will nurse her young for a year, the calf begins nibbling on leaves at about four months of age.\nMale calves typically leave their mothers at about 15 months old. They often join with other young males, forming a bachelor group. Young females separate from their mothers at around 18 months of age. They typically remain in the same family group they were born in.\nSee this newborn Rothschild\u2019s giraffe take its first steps in Murchison Falls, Uganda.\n18. How Large Is the Population of Rothschild\u2019s Giraffes in the Wild?\nIt is impossible to know the exact number of Rothschild\u2019s giraffes in the wild. It is believed that there are roughly 1,400. And their population is increasing.\nIt is believed that the total number of giraffes in the wild across all species is around 141,000. The Southern species are relatively stable. The Rothschild\u2019s giraffes, along with the reticulated and western varieties, are in much smaller numbers.\nIn addition to the number of Rothschild\u2019s giraffes living in the wild, there are between five and six hundred living in zoos around the world.\n19. What Threats Do the Rothschild\u2019s Giraffes Face?\nThe greatest threat to the Rothschild\u2019s giraffe is the uncontrolled poaching. While this is the greatest danger the Rothschild\u2019s face, they are also susceptible to predators. Crocodiles, leopards, lions, and hyenas all view the giraffe as prey.\nFinally, giraffes have become the victim to degradation of their habitat, leading to their decline. The small pockets of Rothschild\u2019s giraffes in the wild are isolated from each other, making breeding a challenge.\n20. How Many Types of Giraffes are There?\nThere are four giraffe species. Learn more about all giraffe species.\nHere are a few giraffe facts about each of these interesting creatures.\nThe Masai giraffe makes its home across the central part of Kenya, spreading to the south and into Tanzania. The South Luangwa Valley in Zambia is also the home to an isolated group of these giraffes. This is the most populous species, with over 32,000 existing in the wild. They are, however, susceptible to poaching, and their numbers are declining. The Masai is the darkest of the species of giraffes. The Reticulated giraffe is also known as the Somali or the netted giraffe. It is most often found in north, north-eastern, and central Kenya. There are small populations in the southern parts of Somalia and Ethiopia. There are around 8,700 remaining in the wild. The Southern giraffe is divided into two subspecies, the Angolan and the South African. The Angolan giraffe is found in Namibia as well as central Botswana. It is estimated there are around 13,000 of this species in the wild. The Angolan giraffe\u2019s pattern covers its entire body, including its lower legs. The Northern giraffe includes three subspecies: the Kordofan, the Nubian, and West African giraffe.\n21. Do Giraffes Have Two Hearts?\nThere is a commonly held belief that giraffes have two hearts. This is not true. While they only have one heart, it is an amazing two feet long and weighs nearly 25 pounds.\nAs you can see, the Rothschild\u2019s giraffe is a magnificent and interesting animal. If you are hoping to see them in the wild, your best bet is to visit a national park or other protected areas. The effort is worthwhile to see these fascinating creatures."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe Evolution - Giraffe Facts and Information", "url": "https://www.giraffeworlds.com/giraffe-evolution/", "text": "Giraffe Evolution\nGiraffe Evolution and Ancestors\nThe evolution that giraffes have had since their earliest ancestors to the actual specimens is fascinating. What animals share genetic code with them? Was their neck part of an evolutive process?\nWhile the giraffe as we know it is native to Africa, more than 20-25 million years ago their ancestors also roamed along Europe and Asia. There aren\u2019t many fossils of them, but some information has allowed scientists to come up with some evolution theories.\nThese ancient giraffes looked like deer and were much shorter than what we know of them today, but the scientific debate focus on how they ended up with the extremely long necks of today\u2019s giraffes. There are a couple of theories that resume most ideas. Some believe it occurred slowly, over a long time due to the trees in the areas where they lived that trying to reach them got giraffes taller in the process.\nOrder Artiodactyla\nThey are even-toed ungulates which are those animals with hooves like deer, pigs, hippos, among others that share this peculiarity. There are three suborders within the Artiodactyla order:\nTylopoda which includes camels and llamas; Suina a suborder composed by pigs and peccaries and finally the clade Cetruminantia which includes whales, hippos, and ruminants the suborder to which giraffes belong.\nFamily Giraffidae\nThey are ruminant artiodactyls which only has two extant genera Okapia and Giraffa. Although externally they look very different, both have a genetic and morphological relationship. Both okapis and giraffes are distributed only in the African continent.\nAccording to scientific studies, they evolved in the Miocene from ungulate animals occupying regions of Africa and Eurasia; We are talking about 25 million years ago. Eventually, they became extinct, but a new species emerged.\nThe long neck is a later adaptation since such ancestors had short necks and were smaller resembling more a modern okapi than an actual giraffe. Fossils of these species such as the Giraffokeryx, has short necks, horns on one side of the head and behind. By their placement has suggested the possibility that the males wrestled with lateral head movements and not with the long neck like the current giraffes.\nLong neck\nHow did the giraffes develop such a long neck? There are two theories: one from Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and the other from Charles Darwin.\nThis hypothesis, known as the Lamarck Theory, was introduced in the early 1800s. It states that the food on the ground was scarce and that these animals were instinctively raising their necks as high up as they could to reach what was there. Over time, the size of those necks was longer which provide them an adaptation that allowed their survival.\nThe theory of the French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck is the concept of \u200b\u200buse and disuse; That is, a characteristic that is used very frequently by a living being, gradually develops and strengthens until it meets the need of the species. The parts of the body not used go missing until disappearing entirely.\nOn the other side, Charles Darwin had another theory about the survival of the fittest. He believed that some of the giraffes had a genetic mutation that allowed them to develop longer necks. These individuals were able to eat more, and so they were stronger. That means that those males were the ones breeding and that genetic code was passed down to the next generations. Those that couldn\u2019t get enough to eat weren\u2019t strong enough to mate with the females, and they eventually died without having offspring.\nDarwin explains that individuals with characteristics better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and therefore, such traits are inherited. He also said that species that can not compete and adapt eventually become extinct.\nHowever, there is not a definitive explanation for the long necks of giraffes accepted by most scientists. Both theories, have interesting points, but they also have inconsistent and unconfirmed details.\nOther scientists such as Elissa Cameron and Johan du Toit agree with the hypothesis that the necks of giraffes are long because of their continuous reach of high trees, especially because of their preference for the acacia, whose leaves are at heights that other herbivores cannot reach.\nNevertheless, researchers like Robert Simmons and Lue Scheepers disagree with this idea. They claim that regardless of whether they go through the dry season or not, giraffes feed on lower shrubs, even if there are tall trees in the same area. They observed that the females spent more time feeding with their neck in a horizontal position and that both genders ingested quantities of food at a faster rate than when they did it in a vertical position.\nThe hypothesis that giraffes have long neck due to the scarcity of food at low heights is not entirely accepted, so the dilemma is not fully explained yet.\nAnother related question is why only the giraffes developed this feature when many other animals in the zone are also herbivores? The theories and hypotheses have arisen to explain this subject, but none has the general acceptance of the scientific community.\nRecently another theory appeared trying to explain this unique feature of giraffes and is related to the successful reproduction as male giraffes fight for the right to mate with a female through necking, so the bulls with the stronger necks have better chances to reproduce.\nRead the article.

(Amazing Facts) \u2013 Animal World Facts", "url": "https://animalworldfacts.com/do-giraffes-have-gills/", "text": "The giraffes are so amazing and striking, at first sight the most striking attributes of the giraffe are its long neck and its vibrant color with pints, but there are many other elements that cause curiosity and amazement in this animal.\nMany questions arise about the giraffe and its long neck, especially about its breathing, how can the giraffe breathe with such a long neck?\nSo I\u2019ve been constantly confronted with this question of whether giraffes have gills, after some research the answer is clear NO, but developing the subject a bit, I discovered that the giraffe might once have traces of gills in its respiratory system.\nAlso, I discovered interesting data about the breathing process of the giraffe.\nDo giraffes have gills?\nLike all mammals, Giraffes breathe through their lungs and not through gills, so O2 enters through their nostrils.\nIt continues through the Pharynx, Larynx, Trachea, Bronchus and reaches the Lungs where the Alveolar Sacs or Alveoli are located where the true Pulmonary breathing takes place through the Hematosis process, exchanging O2 with CO2 to exit this gas back through the nasal cavities.\nBreathing is the process by which living beings obtain oxygen. This breathing can be pulmonary, gill, tracheal or cutaneous. Giraffes\u2019 breathing is pulmonary.\nWhy don\u2019t giraffes suffocate?\nFunny squirrel eating nuts x To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Funny squirrel eating nuts\nTo understand the complexity of the breathing process of a giraffe, I will use a snorkel mask as an example.\nIf I use a snorkel too long while snorkeling, the risk is very high that I will always breathe my own air again and thus receive less and less oxygen.\nThe air column in the tube would be too high and the breathable air would not be exchanged. But a giraffe has a very long neck, so the lungs would have to ensure a very large gas exchange.\nHow do you solve that in nature? Why don\u2019t giraffes choke on the air they breathe?\nThe giraffe\u2019s lungs and heart system will work in combination to supply the giraffe with the necessary oxygen, although in a unique way. The giraffe\u2019s lungs for example, is eight times the size of a human\u2019s lung and its respiratory cycle is about one-third of that of a human.\nIt is necessary to breathe more slowly to interchange the large volume of air without producing windbrands in the giraffe\u2019s 3.6-meter-long, wavy trachea. If the animal breathes again, the previously depleted breath of oxygen, it can\u2019 t fully exhale.\nThis condition is made worse for the giraffe by the long trachea which holds more dead air than a single person can inhale at one time. Enough lung volume must be available so that this \u201cbad air\u201d is just a small part of the total volume. This is a physical problem that the giraffe solved.\nThe adaptation of the Giraffe\u2019s nostrils\nWith such a high neck, giraffes are exposed to practically all kinds of airborne elements, by this I mean especially dust particles in the air, direct sunlight.\nDue to the environment where the giraffe lives, such as the African savannah, where the incidence of the sun is tremendous and there is a lot of dust and sand both on the ground and in the air, the giraffe is adapted with two amazing physical characteristics to protect it from both inclemencies.\nThe first physical adaptation is its tongue, whose dark blue color allows it to eat from the tall bushes without suffering sunburn from long exposure, and the second adaptation is its nostrils.\nGiraffes\u2019 noses have nostrils that can be closed at will, this is so that they do not get dust when the winds blow hard.\nApart from this amazing feature of the giraffe\u2019s nostrils, the giraffe has the ability to use its tongue to clean its nostrils of accumulated dust, thus keeping the air inlet holes completely clean.\nThis might seem a bit repulsive to us humans, but this adaptation of both the nostrils and the tongue is a wonder of nature.\nJust imagine, giraffes don\u2019t have fingers like humans do, in order to keep their nostrils clean and decongested they do it with their long and useful tongue, this is vital to make less complicated a process that in itself has its complications for giraffes like breathing.\nI mean, imagine having a six-meter long neck, and your hands can\u2019t reach your face, living in a deserted climate where a lot of dust accumulates in your nostrils, that would be a serious problem, wouldn\u2019t it?\nThe nervous system and traces of giraffe gills\nThe nervous system connects the organs of our body, forwards stimuli and commands from the brain to the organs. The conduction speed in the nervous system is high (up to 100 m / s), but cannot be compared with the conduction speed of electrical lines in which voltage impulses propagate almost at the speed of light.\nSo it makes sense to keep connections between the brain and the corresponding target organs as short as possible. Usually, it is like that. The larynx nerve is an exception. Actually, the distance from the brain to the larynx is not that great.\nHowever, the nerve coming from the brain does not pull directly to the larynx, but first further down, around the aortic arch above the heart and then back up towards the larynx.\nThe laryngeal nerve makes this loop in all mammals, even those with an elongated neck. In the giraffe, this leads to an extremely curious course of the nerve.\nInstead of the required length of maybe 20-30 cm with a direct connection between the brain and larynx, the length of the nerve extends to several meters. The larynx sits under the giraffe\u2019s head at a lofty height, while the aortic arch is in the trunk area.\nHow is this curious course of the larynx nerve to be explained? In this case, an engineer would be in dire need of an explanation. An evolutionary biologist, on the other hand, can refer to the tribal history of vertebrates. Our fish-like relatives had no larynx and no throat. However, they already had the forerunners of the larynx nerves, which had a completely different task with them.\nThey conducted nerve impulses from the head to the neighboring gill apparatus and back. In their course, they also moved around blood vessels. No problem with the short distances in this area.\nWhen the gill apparatus was no longer needed in terrestrial vertebrates, some of its elements were retained, albeit in a completely different function. Some cartilaginous gill arch elements were transformed into components of our larynx.\nPart of the gill nerves was also preserved. Instead of pulling to the gill apparatus, they now supplied the larynx area. But the terrestrial vertebrates have developed a neck and therefore a certain distance from the head to the torso. The gill arch vessels became aortic arches, pulmonary arteries and other vessels.\nThe branchial arch nerves, from which the larynx nerve developed, moved around the branchial arch vessels that became the aortic arch.\nThe nerve remained true to its old direction, except that there was now a large gap between the larynx and the aortic arch. Therefore, the larynx nerve still takes an unnecessarily long course today, even if it still fulfills its purpose.\nThe amazing cardiovascular system of the giraffe\nThe cardiovascular system is another special feature. The pumping pressure that is necessary to pump the brain into the brain is almost twice as high as in animals of similar size. The blood pressure in the brain is kept constant at 90 mmHg.\nThe blood pressure at heart level is around 215 mmHg, mmHg is the traditional unit of measurement for blood pressure (millimeters of mercury). Even if a giraffe lowers its head, for example, while drinking, the blood does not shoot uncontrollably to the head.\nThe blood vessels in the giraffe\u2019s neck are equipped with vascular valves that regulate strong pressure. In addition, there is the so-called wound network below the brain, a network of branched arteries that absorbs the incoming blood like a sponge."}

Their distribution includes several parts of the continent but in a very fragmented way. Species and subspecies have similar habitats that include savannas, grasslands, and open forests. Giraffes will move to where they need to to find food.\nSome people might assume that since giraffes feed on leaves high in trees, they would thrive better in thick and plentiful forests. However, this wouldn\u2019t be good for them due to their height as they need space to maneuver.\nThe home range for a giraffe is between 8 and 50 square miles. While these areas of habitat often overlap with other groups, they will get along just fine with that, as they do not show territorial behavior.\nA common problem though is that their natural habitat continues to be shrinking due to human activities, resulting in a smaller home range. As a result, they food sources are reduced.\nWhere do giraffes live?\nGiraffes seem to thrive in areas where the climate is very hot. They also enjoy wide open spaces that allow them to see around for predator from a great distance. While giraffes graze around for food, they can quickly flee if they need to, so their habitat needs to be one that allows them to move around freely.\nThe reticulated giraffe, also known as Somali Giraffa (Giraffa reticulata), inhabits south of Ethiopia and Somalia as well as north-east Kenya. It lives in rainforests, forests, and savannas in these regions. According to estimations around 450 specimens live in zoos around the world being one of the most common species found in these facilities.\nThe South African Giraffe (Giraffa giraffa giraffa) or Cape giraffe, inhabits the north of that country, south of Botswana and Zimbabwe, and also southwest Mozambique. About 12,000 individuals are currently living in the wild and around 45 in captivity.\nIn the case of the Nigerian giraffe or West African giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis peralta), its distribution is limited to the southwest of Niger, and a few more are in natural reserves and national parks. It is in danger of extinction, and there are only around 300 individuals in the wild. It lives in the Niger River basin and the highlands near the rural community Kour\u00e9, located 60 km east of Niamey, the capital of Niger.\nIf we go to South Sudan or southwest of Ethiopia, we can find the Nubian Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis camelopardalis). Very few individuals live in zoos, and in the wild, it is unknown exactly how many survive but is estimated to be less than 250.\nThe Angolan giraffe or Namibian giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis angolensis) dwells in the north of Namibia, and there is another population in the southwest of Botswana and Zambia, as well as western Zimbabwe. It lives in savannahs and shrublands. Some live in protected areas such as the Etosha National Park in Namibia. Their population in the wild is less than 20,000 individuals, while in captivity only about 20 are preserved.\nAnother subspecies of the Northern giraffe is the Kordofan giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis antiquorum). A giraffe that inhabits the north of Cameroon, southern Chad, Central African Republic and only a few survive in the west of Sudan. In zoos, there are around 65 and in the wild nearly 3,000.\nThe Angolan giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis angolensis) lives in the north of Namibia. It also dwells in the southwest of Botswana and Zambia, as well as western Zimbabwe. It lives in savannahs and shrublands. Some inhabit protected areas such as the Etosha National Park in Namibia. Its population in the is less than 20,000 individuals, while in captivity only about 20 are preserved.\nThe Rothschild\u2019s giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi) has a distribution that extends through Kenya and Uganda. Its existence in Sudan is uncertain. In the wild, some estimations show that there are only about 700 still alive and in zoos more than 450, an alarming number.\nThe Rhodesian giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis thornicrofti) has a very limited distribution, since it only inhabits east Zambia, specifically in the valley of Luangwa, where the landscape has abundant vegetation and a high biodiversity of fauna and flora. Less than 1,500 survive in the wild, and there are no confirmed records of Rhodesian giraffes in zoos.\nNational Parks\nSome of the national parks where giraffes live are:\nKenya\n\u2013 Lake Nakuru National Park\n\u2013 Tsavo East National Park\n\u2013 Samburu (natural reserve)\nUganda\n\u2013 Murchison Falls National Park\nSouth Africa\n\u2013 Kruger National Park\nNamibia\n\u2013 Etosha National Park\nTanzania\n\u2013 Manyara National Park\n\u2013 Mikumi National Park\nGiraffes seem to adapt quite well to a variety of environments as long as they meet their basic needs, that is the reason they are so common in zoos.\nReferences\nhttp://www.awf.org/wildlife-conservation/giraffe\nhttp://www.iucnredlist.org/details/9194/0\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffe#Habitat_and_feeding\nhttp://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Giraffa_camelopardalis/#habitat"}

It can reach a height of more than 18 feet (5.5 meters). Giraffes live on the plains of eastern Africa. The scientific name of the giraffe is Giraffa camelopardalis.\nGiraffes have a short body, but their legs and neck are very long. The coat is light brown with reddish brown spots. Many giraffes have two short horns between the ears. Giraffes have large nostrils and a good sense of smell. Their tongues are more than 18 inches (45 centimeters) long.\nGiraffes are plant eaters. They can reach leaves at the top of trees. But they do not eat grass. It is very hard for them to reach the ground because the neck is stiff. To drink, a giraffe must spread its legs far apart to reach down.\nGiraffes live in herds of up to 20 animals. They use their good eyesight to watch for danger. Lions are the giraffe\u2019s main enemy. Giraffes try to gallop away from enemies, but they will fight if necessary. They can run more than 30 miles (48 kilometers) an hour.\nA female giraffe gives birth to one calf at a time. The newborn can usually follow its mother around within hours. Giraffes live about 20 to 25 years.\nGiraffes are still common in eastern Africa. They are protected there inside national parks. In other places, however, hunting has reduced the number of giraffes.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "What do Giraffes Eat? | Science Facts", "url": "https://www.scifacts.net/animals/what-do-giraffes-eat/", "text": "Giraffes are the tallest animals on land and probably some of the strangest looking. They live on the savanna and lightly-wooded regions of Africa, grazing on trees and shrubs at their leisure.\nThey grow to be up to 20 feet tall and weigh 2500 pounds, meaning they are too big for any predator to go after. However, any animal that big needs a lot of food. If a giraffe ate and digested its food like a normal animal, it would never be able to survive. Thankfully, giraffes were given unique and useful traits to support themselves. Read on to learn how they can reach the most nutritious foods on the savanna, and then digest those foods multiple times to power their massive frames.\nWhat do Giraffes Eat?\nGiraffes reach the highest leaves on trees with their long necks. This allows them to reach food that shorter animals cannot. Despite the long spikes on its branches, the acacia tree is their favorite food. Giraffes get around this conundrum by having tongues that are as long as their necks. They can get their tongues through the spikes and collect the leaves without getting hurt. So, what exactly do Giraffes eat? Giraffes eat other trees, as well as shrubs, grasses, and fruits. The average giraffe consumes 65 pounds of foliage per day and requires 15 pounds to survive. At birth, baby giraffes are six feet tall and nurse from their mothers until they are tall enough to reach leaves. Giraffes frequently have trees in their enclosures in zoos, but most zookeepers also leave bales of hay tied in nets to the trees. This allows them to graze naturally while still getting the nutrition they require.\nGiraffes are ruminants, which means they digest food in the same way that cows do and have four stomachs. When a giraffe grabs a mouthful of leaves, it chews them up, swallows them, and then processes them in its first stomach. Food that is small enough is passed through the rest of the giraffe\u2019s system, but larger pieces with a lot of nutrients are passed all the way back up the giraffe\u2019s neck. The giraffe then chews these cud pieces and digests them again. Giraffes have to eat significantly less foliage for their size than most herbivores due to this process and the rich leaves they can access. A giraffe will spend the day browsing before chewing its cud while resting or moving.\nHow do Giraffes Drink?\nGiraffes, like their relative the camel, can go a long time without drinking water. This is partially biological and also because acacia leaves have such high water content. But giraffes do have to drink eventually, and you may look at such a tall animal and wonder how, exactly, they manage to reach the water. Giraffes, just like us, only have seven spinal vertebrae in their neck.\nThis means they can\u2019t just bend their long necks down to get a drink, they have to splay out their front legs and stoop to get their heads that low. Giraffes are usually safe from predators, but having their head at a level vulnerable to crocodiles and lions can be dangerous. Because of this, they usually drink in small groups, with one bending down for water while the rest keep guard. They take turns and then wait another few days before drinking again. In a safe environment like a zoo, giraffes drink up to 10 gallons of water per day. Their reliance on water is the only chink in their armor, a testament to the magnificent evolutionary oddity that is the giraffe."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe: A Complete Guide To The Giraffes Of Africa \ufe0f", "url": "https://safarisafricana.com/animals/giraffe/", "text": "Range & habitat\nWith a range that extends all over most of Africa, the giraffe is a staple sighting on any African safari. They are, however, most common in southern and eastern Africa, where the savannas and open woodlands offer the perfect habitat. However, the Angolan giraffe, which occurs in Namibia as well, prefers a more desert environment.\nGiraffes have home ranges but are not territorial. Home ranges will vary relative to factors such as rainfall and proximity to humans.\nOverall though, giraffes prefer to inhabit savannas and woodlands that are open with foliage like the acacia tree, instead of more dense environments like miombo woodlands.\nDuring the wet season, groups of giraffe may be more spread out, enjoying the resplendent food sources around them. But when the dry season arrives, giraffes are found to congregate around the few evergreen bushes and trees in their area.\nGiraffes mothers tend to feed where an area is most open, which gives her a better view over the surroundings and any danger close by.\nDiet\nGiraffes feed mainly on leaves, fruits and flowers of acacia trees, easily reaching up to nibble on the top parts that other herbivores can\u2019t reach. Acacias seem to be one of their favourite sources of food, as well as trees from the Commiphora and Terminalia genera, which provide giraffes with their much-needed source of protein and calcium.\nNotwithstanding their long necks, giraffes may also bend down and feed on shrubs and grasses. All in all, they feed and ruminate for most of the day, consuming a total of about 34 kg of foliage every day. However, the giraffe actually needs much less food than other herbivores as the food it does get is much higher in nutrients, while its digestive system is extremely efficient."}

Congrats.\nA giraffe in Harpursville, NY is about to give birth. Or rather, she\u2019s been \u201cabout\u201d to give birth for several days now. As of the writing of this article, there are 74,000 people watching a live stream of April the giraffe just slowly wandering around her pen, flicking her tail, and stretching. It\u2019s pretty boring. So instead of just sitting there watching a video feed, take this time to learn a little something about April and what she\u2019s been through for the 15 freakin\u2019 months that she\u2019s been pregnant.\nFirst things first: bring up the live stream.\nOkay. Let\u2019s go.\nWe\u2019ll start at the beginning of this beautiful process: conception. Giraffes don\u2019t have a set mating season. Instead they have an estrous cycle, which is a lot like the human menstrual cycle (but with less blood and slightly different hormones). The male giraffes don\u2019t just mate with the ladies all the time, so they generally try to find a way to determine is the lady is fertile. How, do you ask? Pee. The answer is always pee.\nThe boy giraffe lopes on over to the girl giraffe and rubs against her in what can only be described as gentle whacking. Then when the lady starts a-peein\u2019, the gent leans down and tastes it. If he tastes hormones that indicate she\u2019s in heat, the beautiful mating ritual begins. Once the male knows he has a fertile female in front of him, he sort of follows her around trying to mount her for a couple of days, often while sporting a frankly alarming erection, and sometimes licking her hind legs. His mate just keeps walking away from him every time he tries to do this (and can you blame her?). At some point though, she stands still long enough for the deed to be done. Once the male rears up on his hind legs and mounts her successfully, he ejaculated in mere seconds. Sometimes he can go again (and sometimes again after that) each time only for a few seconds\u2014as his partner continually walks away from him. It\u2019s kind of a weird dynamic, to say the least.\nBut don\u2019t worry\u2014it\u2019s not just the females who have to deal with what must be a deeply unsatisfying mating ritual. It\u2019s the males, too! The internet likes to cite the number 94 as the percent of all giraffe sex that\u2019s homosexual in nature. It\u2019s not actually clear how much of giraffe sex is male-on-male, simply because researchers observe it so infrequently. One paper from 1985 says that in three years of observation, scientists only saw one successful heterosexual mounting (out of 46 attempts) and 16 homosexual ones, though those weren\u2019t all successful. Now, obviously they\u2019re missing a lot of matings, because there was more than one giraffe born in the herd they observed that year\u2014so they certainly have a skewed sample. Perhaps they were too busy checking out the male-on-male action to notice the other heterosexual sexy times, but alas we will never know.\nThe important thing to remember is that the researchers initially thought that the homosexual matings were a dominance thing\u2014one male trying to assert his role over another. But the male giraffes who were being mounted didn\u2019t display any signs of submission the way lady giraffes do, which means it\u2019s probably just sex for sex\u2019s sake.\nAnyway, now the lady giraffe is pregnant and she stays that way for 400 to 460 days. Her mate has already abandoned her\u2014males play no role in raising the young (sorry, April, but your loving partner Oliver has already checked out). After all that time, she has a single calf. She gives birth standing up, which means her baby falls literally head first onto the ground from about six feet in the air. But giraffe calves don\u2019t have a hard time adjusting to that rather rude introduction to the world: They can stand up almost right away, and can run around on their adorably gangly legs just a few hours later.\nAnd there you have it. The miracle of giraffe birth hinges on pee consumption. Congratulations, April!"}

In this 5-part series, you will also shatter common animal myths. In this article, the focus is on whales and giraffes.\nWhales\nWhale milk is comprised of nearly 50% fat , 10 times more than the milk delivered to human babies. Calves emerge after spending a whopping 10 to 12 months in the womb, growing to about a third of the length of its mother. For example, a Blue whale baby measures 30 feet. Using muscles surrounding the mammary gland, the mother whale squirts milk into the mouth of her offspring while the baby holds tight to its nipple. This process allows calves to undergo great growth spurts , gaining up to 200 pounds per day. For more interesting facts about whales, check out the following pieces of trivia:\n5 Whale Facts\n1. The sperm whale possesses the largest brain in the animal kingdom , some weighing as much as 20 pounds. This species of whale can also hold its breath for up to an hour.\n2. The blue whale is the largest animal in the world and has the potential to reach a length of up to 100 feet and weigh as much as a couple of elephants. The smallest species of whale is the harbor porpoise, which only grows to five feet in length.\n3. As for the fastest of the whales, the fin whale can cover more than 20 miles per hour for short periods of time. When moving about the water, whales can stay under the water for five to 15 minutes at a time.\n4. When the right whale is killed, it does not sink to the bottom of the ocean.\n5. Narwhales have only two teeth , one hidden under their gums and in the males , another that emerges out of the head like a tusk. This tooth can reach lengths up to 8 feet long.\nGiraffes\nWith necks that reach about 16 feet into the sky, the giraffe is known as one of the tallest animals on the planet. The long neck of this animal evolved over time when the creatures needed a way to reach leaves that other grazers could not get a hold of. While the height advantage comes in handy when it\u2019s dinnertime, the trait can pose a problem for giraffes. For example, the heart must pump twice as hard as a cow\u2019s to make sure blood reaches the brain of the giraffe. The body is equipped with a complicated blood vessel system to prevent blood from rushing to head when the creature is bent over. Below the heart, the skin surrounding the legs is very tight , to prevent blood from pooling at their hooves.\nCheck out the following five intriguing pieces of knowledge involving the giraffe:\n5 Giraffe Facts\n1. Giraffes usually reach heights between 15 and 19 feet tall , gaining up to 1,600 pounds in body weight.\n2. Breaking leaves, twigs, thorns, and other parts of a tree, the giraffe uses its tongue, which usually measures 16 inches long.\n3. When giraffes reach their full speed potential, they can travel for up to 30 miles per hour.\n4. With a keen sense of sight, giraffes can detect another animal for up to two mile away, making it pretty hard to sneak up on a giraffe in the grass.\n5. Giraffes can survive up to two weeks without any water.\nSource: Life Science"}

The only other known giraffe weevil is found in New Zealand.\nThe neck of the male giraffe weevil is typically 2 to 3 times longer than that of the female.\nThe total body length of the males is just under an inch (2.5 cm).\nThe body is black with a bright red shell called \u201celytra\u201d that covers and protects the fragile flying wings underneath.\nThey also have odd-looking pedipalps (like mandibles) on their heads.\nThe adults spend most of their lives, and feed on, a tree which is known as the giraffe beetle tree (Dichaetanthera arborea). The giraffe weevil will rarely leave these trees.\nGiraffe Weevil\nThe Giraffe Weevil Neck\nIt is not difficult to figure out why this weevil is called a \u201cgiraffe weevil\u201c.\nThe giraffe weevil\u2019s neck, as mentioned earlier, is 2 or 3 times longer than the female\u2019s.\nIt is used for fighting others males for the right to mate with a nearby female.\nThe fight consists of pushing and wresting each other.\nIt is very rare for a male to kill another in these fights.\nThe giraffe weevil\u2018s long neck also assists in nest-building.\nAfter mating, the male giraffe weevil rolls a leaf from the host plant (the so-called giraffe beetle tree) into a tube-shape.\nThe female then lays a single egg in the middle of the leaf tube and then rolls it up, protecting the egg.\nThe female snips the leaf away from the tree. When the larvae hatches, the leaf will be the primary food source in the first few days of its life.\nWATCH THE BBC VIDEO below, showing the courtship ritual of two males fighting, the mating, the laying of the egg, and the building of the leaf-nest. It\u2019s really fascinating. Watch it until the end.\nThe giraffe weevil is rare, but it is not considered to be endangered or threatened by the human population or by predation from other species.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\nSources: Pawnation \u2666 ArkInSpace \u2666 Wikipedia\nW is for Giraffe Weevil : A-Z Collection of Really Cool Animals @AtoZChallenge #insects Click To Tweet"}

You might be surprised to learn that, although giraffes often eat leaves from tall trees, they do not like to live in most forests. Forests are too crowded with trees. In a congested forest, a giraffe can't see in all directions to spot predators like humans, lions, and crocodiles from far off. So giraffes make their homes in wide open grasslands, or savannas, which are grassland areas with some trees. Giraffes do inhabit certain forests, but only those that have a lot of open space.\nDry African Climates\nGiraffes are native to Africa, particularly the area south of the Sahara Desert. It gets really hot on those dry savannas. Imagine for a moment how awkward it would be for you to drink water from the ground while still standing. Now imagine how awkward it would be if you were a giraffe! That's one reason giraffes don't drink water very often, even in a hot climate. In fact, giraffes can go longer without water than camels can!"}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Why Is The Giraffe\u2019s Tongue Blue? (Clear ... - Animal World Facts", "url": "https://animalworldfacts.com/why-is-the-giraffes-tongue-blue/", "text": "The Giraffe tongue has surprising and distinctive characteristics, it is a prodigy of evolutionary design. Its shape, color, texture and length are ideal for fulfilling the goal that nature has given it: to lick the leaves of acacias in search of food.\nThese leaves are protected by defenses in the form of very sharp thorns. The great length of the animal\u2019s tongue allows it to reach the last fresh green leaves (which are usually in the highest and most inaccessible areas of the tree) by avoiding the thorns.\nBut it seems clear that such an endeavor cannot succeed one hundred percent of the time. There are always accidents, miscalculations, unforeseen events that lead to the dreaded puncture.\nFor those cases, the giraffe\u2019s tongue also has protection, a hard and wide skin covered with large amounts of antiseptic saliva. If a wound occurs, the tongue tries to repair itself.\nBut what about its color? Isn\u2019t that really strange?\nFor this, science has also found an answer. Giraffes feed on small portions of nutrients through the tiny acacia leaves. Shot by shot they have to get enough calories to nourish their gigantic body.\nThat forces them to spend at least 12 hours a day just eating.\nFunny squirrel eating nuts x To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Funny squirrel eating nuts\nCould you imagine 12 hours with your tongue out of your mouth, in the sun of the savannah, the grasslands or the open woods where they live?\nThe ultraviolet radiation received in a day is enough to kill off any soft tissue that gets in the way. The dark color, produced by large doses of melanin in the skin, is the best safeguard against this possible damage.\nWhy is the Giraffe\u2019s tongue blue?\nAs explained previously, the giraffe\u2019s tongue is exposed to the sun for a long period of time. Giraffes spend a lot of time using their tongues to obtain food which is found in the treetops, often among the thorns, like the acacia.\nSince their tongues are about 50 centimeters long, there is a lot of margin for sunburn, just like humans.\nThe deep dark color protects against sunburn and can protect against it. The darker color is the result of the extra melanin present in the tongue of the giraffe.\nThe end of the giraffe\u2019s tongue tends to be darker and may be more pink or even purple near the base because that part is not as heavily exposed to the sun.\nThe melanin acts as a kind of sunblock. Just like people with darker pigments, although they can be affected by the sun, they are less susceptible to sunburn.\nThe giraffe\u2019s tongue is strong enough to be able to wrap large branches and pull them out. It is resistant, which helps it to break thick thorns. And it\u2019s handy, so much so that he uses it to clean his ears and hear better.\nIn addition to the dark blue color of the giraffe\u2019s tongue protecting it from sunburn, it also protects the giraffe from other physical damage.\nAfrican acacia trees and shrubs are very thorny, but with the help of its tongue, the giraffe manages to hold the leaves without getting hurt, since such prehensile muscle is provided with small papillae just like the mouth, which helps to cushion the sharp elements of trees and shrubs.\nSimilarly, its thick, sticky saliva covers the thorns that could be swallowed, so that they are not in danger of damaging any internal organ in your body.\nAre giraffes tongues poisonous?\nThe giraffe\u2019s tongue is not poisonous, on the contrary, its tongue produces antiseptic saliva that protects it from physical injuries and poisonous chemicals found in the thorns of acacia branches, branches that are a fundamental part of the giraffe\u2019s diet.\nExamples of other animals that have Bluish tongue\nThere is another animal that shares many similarities with the giraffe, including the dark blue color of its tongue, it is the Okapi.\nOkapi is considered to be the oldest surviving mammals on Earth and originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where habitat loss and poaching have contributed to the reduction of their population.\nAlso known as the forest giraffe, this species can weigh between 200 and 300 kilos and reach a length of two meters.\nIt is considered a living fossil, because of its resemblance to the first giraffes that appeared in the Miocene period 23 million years ago, when the Pyrenees, the Alps and the Himalayas were still in formation.\nAt first glance, it looks like a cross between a zebra and a giraffe. Although if there is one thing that attracts the attention it is its long blue tongue, with which it manages to clean its ears.\nThanks to its tongue, it can reach the highest branches to eat as well as the giraffe. But this is something difficult to see because they are very elusive animals that tend to hide in the half-light of the bushes. So if you ever see one, consider yourself lucky.\nChow chows are characterized by a rare bluish-black, purple or pink-stained tongue and sturdy legs. The blue-black/purple or pink and blue spotted tongue is usually dominant in this breed of Chow Chow.\nTiliqua scincoides is a reptile that inhabits the savannahs and semi-desert regions of Australia and Tasmania. Its physiognomy is also extendable to the rest of the subspecies.\nThus, they show robust bodies of smooth and shiny scales with very short and delicate extremities and a wide, powerful and triangular head.\nAlthough undoubtedly its most identifying feature is the intense blue tongue, present in all subspecies of this type of scintillating.\nThe black bear (Ursus americanus) is a species of carnivorous mammal of the family Ursides. It is the most common bear in North America.\nThe black bear is generally between 140 and 200 cm long. Its height at the withers is between 100 and 130 cm. The black bear is smaller than the polar bear and the brown bear.\nTheir weight depends on the age, the sex of the animal and the season: in autumn, the black bear gets fat and accumulates fat reserves in order to spend the winter."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Okapi, facts and photos - Animals", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/okapi", "text": "Common Name : Okapis Scientific Name : Okapia johnstoni Type : Mammals Diet : Herbivore Average Life Span In Captivity : 30 years Size : Length, eight feet; height, five feet Weight : 440 to 660 pounds IUCN Red List Status : ? Endangered LC NT VU EN CR EW EX Least Concern Extinct\nWhat is the okapi?\nKnown as the \u201cforest giraffe,\u201d the okapi looks more like a cross between a deer and a zebra. Nevertheless, it\u2019s the giraffe's only living relative. The okapi is native to the Ituri Rainforest in the Democratic Republic of Congo\u2014the only place where it can be found in the wild\u2014and has thick, oily fur to stay dry in the rain. It also has scent glands on the bottom of its hooves that help mark its territory. Except for the tips, the okapi\u2019s short horns are covered in skin. While all males have horns, most females have knobby bumps instead.\nHabitat and diet\nThe okapi lives among dense flora in the rainforest. It can blend into its surroundings thanks to the brown and white stripes on its rump, which mimic the appearance of streaks of sunlight coming through the trees.\nIts plant-based diet consists of fruits, buds, leaves, twigs, and other vegetation. Just like the giraffe and cow, the okapi has four stomachs that aid with digesting tough plants. Also like its giraffe cousin, the okapi has a long, dark tongue that can strip leaves from branches. An okapi consumes between 45 and 60 pounds of food each day, including riverbed clay for minerals and salt. It will occasionally eat bat excrement for nutrients.\nBehavior and reproduction\nActive during the day, the elusive okapi prefers to be alone. Its hooves secrete sticky territorial markings, while males also spray their territory with urine. Sometimes, however, okapis will congregate in small groups to eat, groom, and even play.\nFemale okapis typically have only one calf per pregnancy. An okapi calf is able to walk just 30 minutes after it\u2019s born but can\u2019t defecate until it\u2019s at least a month old\u2014that way, the smell of feces won\u2019t attract predators. While adult okapis don\u2019t vocalize much (except when they\u2019re ready to breed), calves will bleat, cough, and whistle when their mother is away. Okapi mothers communicate with their calves by making infrasounds, which are noises that are undetectable to the human ear. Female okapis are very protective of their young and will beat the ground with their hooves to ward off potential threats. However, upon reaching six months of age, a calf must fend for itself.\nThreats to survival\nAccording to the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, the okapi is endangered. While it\u2019s not clear how many remain in the wild, scientists estimate that populations may have been slashed in half over the past two decades. Though the leopard is the okapi\u2019s chief predator in the wild, human hunters pose a greater threat to the okapi\u2019s existence. In 2012, a militia group killed 14 okapis at a conservation center located at the headquarters of the Okapi Conservation Project. Today, poachers continue to kill okapis for their meat and skin, and civil unrest in the Democratic Republic of Congo makes enforcement of wildlife protection laws increasingly difficult. Human-induced deforestation also leads to fragmentation and destruction of crucial okapi habitats.\nConservation\nFounded in 1987, the Okapi Conservation Project still exists, despite the brutal attack on its headquarters in 2012. It supports the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, a World Heritage Site in the Itiru Forest, home to 5,000 okapis. The Okapi Conservation Project works with the Institute in Congo for the Conservation of Nature to provide resources to rangers who patrol the reserve and other okapi-occupied areas. The rangers\u2019 duties include detaining armed poachers before they can kill okapis and monitoring agricultural expansion that could harm okapi habitats. IUCN has also teamed up with other organizations, including the Zoological Society of London, to implement a decade-long strategy to reduce illegal activity that could drive the okapi to extinction."}

In detailed Q&A videos, the owner of the animal park defended the park against a slew of well-meaning critics who have been questioning the state of her straw, feeding containers, outdoor enclosures and any number of other particulars.\nOne fan\u2019s complaint to YouTube about the live feed of the pregnant giraffe even caused YouTube to take the feed down briefly for \u201cnudity/sexual content.\u201d The fan apparently claimed livestreaming the birth of a baby giraffe was vulgar and perhaps exploitative. (See the rare sight of a gelada monkey birth, captured by a National Geographic photographer.)\nAnd yet hundreds of thousands watched the giraffe\u2019s birth on Saturday morning, with most reactions overwhelmingly positive and many of them commenting on the miracle of life.\nBut while this young giraffe is thriving\u2014and will be up and running very soon\u2014the population of giraffes worldwide is declining. (Read more about animals raised in wildlife sanctuaries and zoos.)\nGiraffes Are in Danger of Extinction\nGiraffes are endangered. Over the past 15 years, numbers of the world's tallest animal have plummeted from an estimated 140,000 to a low of about 80,000. That's a shockingly precipitous drop from the possibly more than 2 million animals that roamed the continent 150 years ago, according to the Namibia-based Giraffe Conservation Foundation.\nThe giants strike many as so gentle and unobtrusive\u2014quietly grazing on treetops, bending down to touch noses with a newborn\u2014that discovering that they too, like most of the world's megafauna, are headed toward extinction seems counterintuitive, especially considering the recent outpouring of love for the creatures.\nLike many other creatures the world over, the long-necked herbivores have declined mostly due to habitat loss and threats from the growing human population, such as poaching.\n3:33\nBut this can get overlooked\u2013in part because many conservation groups are focused on protecting other endangered African species, such as elephants, rhinoceroses, chimpanzees, and gorillas.\nGiraffe Pregnancies Last More Than a Year\nApril\u2019s fans had a long wait before her calf came into the world\u2014it\u2019s been almost two months since Animal Adventure Park set up a live feed anticipating the birth, and April was already 13 months pregnant. But a typical gestation period for giraffes can last up to 15 months.\nBaby Giraffes Fall Into the World\nFemale giraffes give birth standing up. Their young endure a rather rude welcome into the world\u2013as April\u2019s calf did\u2013by falling more than 5 feet to the ground at birth. These infants can stand within half an hour and run with their mothers an incredible ten hours after birth.\nScientists Don\u2019t Agree\nLack of scientific consensus doesn\u2019t help with giraffes' predicament, and actually makes the animals harder to catalogue. Up until recently, the consensus has been there is only one species of giraffe with multiple subspecies\u2014April is a reticulated giraffe, one of those subspecies. In 2016, some scientists released a study that claims genetic differences among giraffe populations indicate the existence of four distinct giraffe species. (Learn more about giraffes.)\nGiraffes Are Speedy\nYou may know that giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humans\u2014about 6 feet. But they are also incredibly fast: They run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances\u2013faster than Usain Bolt\u2013and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances.\nGiraffes Have Long Tongues\nGiraffes use their height to good advantage and browse on leaves and buds in treetops that few other animals can reach (acacias are a favorite). Giraffes also have incredibly long tongues, as April proved in her viral video. The 21-inch tongue helps them pluck leaves from branches\u2013and assists in the birth process.\nGiraffes Eat All the Time, but Drink Rarely\nGiraffes eat most of the time and, like cows, regurgitate food and chew it as cud. A giraffe eats hundreds of pounds of leaves each week and must travel miles to find enough food.\nThe giraffe's stature can be a disadvantage as well\u2014it is difficult and dangerous for a giraffe to drink at a water hole. To do so, they must spread their legs and bend down in an awkward position that makes them vulnerable to predators like Africa's big cats. Giraffes only need to drink once every several days; they get most of their water from the plants they eat. A giraffe in captivity eating hay would therefore need more water than those in the wild.\n\u2014Virginia Morell contributed to this story."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe Predators - Giraffe Facts and Information", "url": "https://www.giraffeworlds.com/giraffe-predators/", "text": "Giraffe Predators\nLiving in the African savannah surrounded by expert carnivorous hunters is a game of chance where anyone could loose. Giraffes have no claws, sharp tusks or pointed antlers to protect themselves, but any animal that lives in the wild in such conditions have adaptations that allow them to survive.\nGiraffes protect themselves from intruders with their legs. These are their primary and most powerful weapons that save them from death. The impact of a single kick in the head or a sensitive part of a predator is enough to kill it, but the experienced predators are extremely cautious, and therefore know the exact moment to attack.\nBecause of this, giraffes are not the first choice of African carnivores when they are looking for food. They are a target only when another less dangerous prey is not available. It is not easy catching an adult giraffe, so it is more common that wounded or offspring become the center of attention as long as the mother is distracted.\nGiraffes may look peaceful, but they are not an easy prey. Besides they also have an excellent sight so they can be long gone before a predator can get too close to them.\nThe only significant predators of giraffes are lions, and they will look for the young and the weak giraffes first. They also target pregnant females that are ready to give birth so they can\u2019t move as swiftly.\nWhen the predators a herd of lions, there is not much probability that one will come out alive no matter how big it may be. These big cats attack from behind, riding on the back of the giraffe and causing wounds with their fangs and claws to weaken them, while others try to bite the legs to knock them down and reach their neck, the key area to kill them.\nAn ideal time for predators who want to catch a giraffe is when they drink water from rivers and streams. During this activity, the neck is near the ground so cats can attack them there. On the aquatic side, crocodiles try to catch them in that situation, since with a single bite they unbalance them forward to fall into the water. To avoid such acts, giraffes always take turns drinking water while others watch around them.\nDefenses against predators\nHealthy adults are less vulnerable to being killed by predators due to four important aspects:\n1. They have an intimidating size.\n2. They give deadly kicks, which more predators fear.\n3. They are fast runners, so they are not easy to catch.\n4. They have an excellent vision that allows them to react in time.\nIf a giraffe ends up kicking a predator, it can be severely injured or killed so not so many predators dare to attack a giraffe unless they find a young or they are desperate for a meal, to the extent of risking their lives on it.\nThe offspring, on the other hand, are always in danger but can camouflage in the vegetation and they grow very fast reaching soon twice the size of birth, which reduces the chance of being targeted by predators.\nBaby giraffes need a lot of rest during the first couple of weeks of life, and they do this lying down. That makes them an easy target for a variety of predators including wild dogs, hyenas, leopards, and of course lions. The mothers strive to keep their young close to them but young giraffes are curious by nature, and that can cause them to end up being victims.\nApproximately 75% of all young giraffes don\u2019t survive to adulthood due to becoming the victim of predators. That makes it one of the highest mortality rates among animals out there.\nGiraffes are the sentinels of the herbivorous species of wild Africa. Due to their height and their good vision, they warn other species of approaching danger, so animals like zebras and ostriches can also escape.\nLeopards, hyenas, and wild dogs are other predatory carnivores that are a serious threat to giraffes, especially for newborns or very young who do not have the height, size, strength and experience needed to defend themselves. Lions and leopards usually choke their prey by the throat and crocodiles perform their \u201ctwist of death\u201d to kill them almost instantaneously, but hyenas and wild dogs usually begin to eat before the giraffe is dead.\nWhen attacking, predators try to get the legs of the giraffes tangled up so that they fall to the ground. They also try to attack when they are drinking so that their necks are at ground level.\nSmall creatures also cause problems to giraffes. External and internal parasites cause them various diseases which affect their quality of life, further reducing their short life expectancy. Among the external parasites, there are about 15 types of ticks and fly larvae. The internal parasites include the \u201cTaenia solium\u201d and the human whipworm (Trichuris trichiura). Anthrax and rinderpest are diseases that not commonly or frequently attack them, but when an epizootic affect a population, some get temporarily blind and die.\nCompared to other ruminants, giraffes have a \u201clong\u201d life expectancy of 15 to 25 years in the wild.\nFor the giraffes, their risk does not end escaping from the dangerous animals, because their worst predators by far are humans. The natives consider them a source of meat when others are scarce. They also believe that the tails of giraffes are good luck so that they try to get one.\nThe human being is also considered a dangerous predator to giraffes. The populations living in the north have reduced their numbers dramatically for two main reasons: degradation of their natural habitat and poaching, which is the case in Kenya, Somalia, and Ethiopia, despite the fact that national parks are struggling to preserve them.\nIn some villages, those tails are used to create jewelry, collectibles for tourists, and even flyswatters for the huge mosquitoes out there. The coats are spectacular due to their thickness and the design of the different spots that each giraffe has. Also, many of these animals become nothing but the trophy of hunter that want to say they have killed an exotic animal.\nWhile most areas of Africa make it illegal to harm or to kill a giraffe due to their conservation status it occurs on a regular basis. There aren\u2019t enough resources to enforce the laws. Villagers are desperate to make money so they will do what they can to survive.\nReferences\nhttp://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Giraffa_camelopardalis/#predation\nNicole Helget. Giraffes.

Just think of all the lessons, activities, and crafts you can create around all these animals!\nGiraffe Facts for Kids\nTime to \u201cleaf\u201d through some giraffe facts and digest what we learn.\nGiraffes live in Africa, mainly in open forests, savannas, and grasslands.\nGiraffes are herbivores (plant-eaters) and typically eat up to 75 pounds of food in a day. Their favorite food? Leaves from the tops of acacia trees. Giraffes also get most of the water that they need from these leaves.\nGiraffes spend 16 or more hours per day eating and traveling to find food.\nTheir height and keen eyesight let them see for long distances \u2013 perfect for finding food or detecting a hungry lion.\nGiraffes only need to stop at watering holes once every few days for water. The watering hole is dangerous for a giraffe. They have to bend down awkwardly, and this makes them an easy target for a patient lion or crocodile.\nGiraffes only sleep about 20 minutes each day, mostly through power naps that last only a few minutes each. They sleep standing up, and there\u2019s usually another giraffe on guard to alert others of danger.\nGiraffes can sprint (run in short bursts) at speeds of 35 miles per hour. This allows them to flee quickly from predators (animals who want to eat them).\nThe giraffe\u2019s large size and strong, hooved feet are great defenses.\nBaby Giraffe Facts\nJust like cattle, male giraffes are called bulls, female giraffes are called cows, and baby giraffes are called calves.\nA giraffe cow is pregnant with her calf for 15 months. That\u2019s 6 months longer than a typical human mother. When calves are born, they are already 6 feet tall (the height of a man) and weigh 100 to 150 pounds.\nWhen a calf is born, it drops 6 feet to the ground! Luckily, this does not harm the baby, but rather, it causes the baby to take its first breaths.\nWithin an hour of being born, a baby giraffe is able to stand up and walk. This allows the calf to reach its mother to drink milk.\nA calf can run within that first day after birth. They learn quickly so that they can run away from predators.\nAdult males grow up to 18 feet tall and can weigh up to 3,000 pounds; adult females grow up to 14 feet tall and can weigh up to 1,500 pounds. Giraffes are considered adults at 4 to 5 years old.\nGiraffe Family Life\nA cow sometimes leaves her calf alone. The calf sits down amongst the tall grasses and keeps its head down to hide from lions. Their spotted coats make great camouflage.\nWhen calves are old enough, the cows will set up something like a group nursery where moms can drop off their babies so that they can go out to eat or meet up with friends.\nGiraffes live in groups called towers, and they are very social animals. They do not have territories and are able to freely join or leave towers. Some towers have only bulls, some have only cows and their calves, and some are mixed.\nUnique Features of Giraffes\nAll giraffes have 2 hard, hair-covered horns called ossicones. Bulls use these to fight with one another. They also roughhouse by swinging their heads around and intertwining their necks, which is called \u2018necking.\u2019\nA giraffe\u2019s neck has 7 vertebrae in it \u2013 the same as a human neck \u2013 except each one is 10 inches long (the length of an average washcloth).\nA giraffe\u2019s heart is 2 feet long (2 rulers long) and weighs 25 pounds (the weight of your 2-year-old brother).\nIts tongue is 21 inches long (the length of a newborn human baby) and black to prevent sunburn when it munches leaves on the treetops.\nGiraffe coat colors range from light tan to black depending on where they live and what they eat. There are 4 types of giraffes, and each giraffe\u2019s coat is as unique as a human fingerprint.\nThanks for joining us and discovering more about giraffes!

Did you know that giraffes are the world\u2019s tallest land mammal? Scientists believe they have been on earth for millions of years! These east-to-read facts are perfect for preschool, kindergarten and elementary school students. To learn more about giraffes check out these amazing giraffe facts for kids!\nClick here for more animal facts for kids\nWhat is a Giraffe?\nThe scientific name for a giraffe is giraffa camelopardalis. Giraffes are the tallest land mammal on earth.\nThere is one species of giraffe but 9 total sub-species. The sub-species are Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe, West African Giraffe, Thornicroft Giraffe, Reticulated Giraffe, Masai Giraffe, Angolan Giraffe, Kordofan Giraffe, Nubian Giraffe, and South African Giraffe.\nA male giraffe is called a bull. A female giraffe is called a cow. Baby giraffes are called calves.\nWhat does a giraffe look like?\nGiraffes can be a variety of colors including shades of brown, tan, and orange. They have brown patches/spots all over their bodies like a human\u2019s fingerprint no two giraffes have the same pattern of patches/spots. The darker a giraffe\u2019s patches/spots are, the older he/she is.\nGiraffes have short light-colored hairs that go down the back of their neck. If you look at a giraffe\u2019s eyes you will notice long light-colored eyelashes.\nBoth male and female giraffes have horns covered with hair on the top of their heads. These horns are called ossicones. Their ossicones are formed from ossified cartilage that is covered with skin.\nGiraffes are born with their horns. When they are born their horns lay flat across their head and aren\u2019t attached to their skull.\nAs the giraffe grows their horns will fuse with their skull and stand straight up on top of their head. Sometimes male giraffes will use their horns when fighting against other giraffes.\nGiraffes are very tall. They are the world\u2019s tallest land animals. Their necks along are 6ft long. A male giraffe can be up to 19 ft tall and weigh between 2,400 -3,000 pounds. A female giraffe can be up to 16 ft tall and weigh between 1,600 -2,600 pounds.\nGiraffes have very long legs. Their front legs are slightly taller than their back legs. Giraffes also have the longest tail of any land animal. Their tails can be 8 ft long!\nA giraffe\u2019s tongue can be 18-20 inches long and is a dark color. They can clean their ears with their tongue!\nA giraffe\u2019s heart can weigh up to 24 pounds and be 2 ft long.\nGiraffe Habitat\nGiraffes live in African savannas, grasslands, or open woodlands. Their height allows them to eat leaves high up in the trees while other animals eat grasses below.\nScientists believe that giraffes have been on earth for 30-50 million years.\nA giraffe can live 25 years in the wild and 30 in captivity.\nGiraffes live in herds of about 20.\nWhat do Giraffes Eat?\nGiraffes are herbivores meaning they do not eat meat. Giraffes use their long necks to get food from up in the trees. They eat leaves and twigs mostly from acacia, mimosa, and wild apricot trees.\nThey can eat up to 140 pounds of food a day. A giraffe\u2019s neck is very long but it isn\u2019t long enough to reach water to drink as a result a giraffe must bend its front legs in order for it to reach water to drink. Luckily giraffes only need to drink every few days.\nBaby Giraffes\nFemale giraffes are pregnant for 15 months and give birth standing up. Baby giraffes are called calves. A calf can weigh 155 pounds and be 6 feet tall at birth.\nBy the time they turn one a calf will double its size. Baby giraffes can stand one hour after they are born. They drink milk from their mother for 9-12 months at around 4 months old they will start to eat leaves.\nWhen a baby giraffe is born its horns will lay flat on its head within a couple of days the horns will pop up and stand straight up.\nMothers take care of the baby giraffes. They make sure they eat, have shelter, and are protected from predators. Baby giraffes are considered adults by the time they turn 4 or 5.\nGiraffe Predators\nPredators of giraffes include lions, leopards packs of hyenas, and wild dogs. Sadly only 25-50% of baby giraffes make it to adulthood. Many babies are attacked by predators and killed. A giraffe defends itself from predators by kicking. They can kick so hard that it can kill a lion.\nAmazing Giraffe Facts for Kids\nGiraffes don\u2019t sleep that long. On average they sleep only 5- 30 minutes a day! Giraffes spend most of their lives standing up, they usually sleep standing up, sometimes they will sit down.\nGiraffes can go longer than a camel without water.\nTheir average lifespan in the wild is 25 years.\nSometimes male giraffes will perform a behavior called necking. Necking is when a giraffe will swing its neck at another giraffe usually to show dominance. They will also use their horns to headbutt other giraffes in battle.\nThey can run 35 miles per hour.\nLike human fingerprints, no two giraffes have the same spots/patches.\nGiraffes communicate by making snorting, hissing, and flute-like sounds.\nA giraffe\u2019s legs are 6ft tall.\nGiraffe Coloring Page\nClick the link below to print this free giraffe coloring page"}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "About Giraffes | Giraffe Conservation & Protection", "url": "https://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/about/species-we-protect-giraffe", "text": "Neck: One of the distinguishing characteristics of a giraffe is its long neck. This allows giraffes to reach the highest leaves and shoots up in the Acacia tree (their favourite food source), which others browsers cannot reach, whilst also keeping an eye out for predators from their vantage point. The neck is also used for \u2018necking\u2019 in Bulls. This is a ritualised fight that appears to help establish dominance, and involves repeatedly swinging their neck to deliver head-butts to the other bull on their body and belly. The giraffe\u2019s neck has a very complex system that regulates their blood pressure, ensuring that plenty of blood gets to their brain but not too much when they bend down to take a drink.\nHorns: Giraffes horns are actually known as ossicones and are found in both males and females, they are formed from ossified cartilage and covered in skin and hair. Both males and females are born with their ossicones but they lie flat at birth and are not attached to the skull in order to avoid injury to themselves and the mother, fusing to the skull as they grow older. Interestingly male giraffes often have thicker ossicones than females, which become bald on top due to frequent necking.\nSpots: Each giraffe has a pattern of spots that is completely unique to them, much like a humans\u2019 fingerprint. Their spots also have far more use than the obvious camouflage they provide and around each spot is a large blood vessel which branches off in a complex system of blood vessels underneath the spot. A giraffe can send blood through these smaller blood vessels into the middle of each patch to release heat from the body."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe Fun Facts for Kids - Animals A to Z for Kids", "url": "https://www.animalsatozforkids.com/giraffe/", "text": "Giraffe Introduction\nThe Giraffe is a long-necked, hoofed mammal that is natively found grazing in the open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. The Giraffe is the tallest living animal on land and despite its height is mostly closely related to the much smaller and solitary Okapi, that is found elusively dwelling in the dense tropical forests.\nThere are nine recognized sub-species of Giraffe that are found in differing geographic locations and vary somewhat in the color and pattern of their spot-like markings. Although the Giraffe would have once been found across sub-Saharan Africa and even in parts of North Africa, today they are extinct from much of their historically vast natural range with only small, isolated populations remaining in a handful of regions in central Africa. Further south however, Giraffe populations are considered to be stable and are even growing in some areas due to an increase in demand for them on private ranches.\nDespite their length, the neck of the Giraffe actually contains the same number of bones as numerous other hoofed mammals but they are simply longer in shape. The Giraffe\u2019s elongated neck leads into a short body, with long and thin, straight legs and a long tail that is tipped with a black tuft that helps to keep flies away. The Giraffe tends to be white in colour with brown or reddish markings that cover its body (with the exception of their white lower legs). The markings of each Giraffe are not only unique to that individual but they also vary greatly between the different Giraffe species in size, colour and the amount of white that surrounds them. All Giraffes though have large eyes that along with their height give them excellent vision, and small horn-like ossicones on the top of their heads."}

If that made you gape in wonderment, then read on for more such intriguing facts about giraffes!\nThere are so many interesting things to learn about giraffes that you\u2019ll never tire of reading about them! Their dignified appearance, combined with the poise and grace that they exhibit, makes them one of the most darling animals in the world. In this article, we\u2019ll touch upon some rather interesting facts about giraffes, concerning their physiology, habitat, diet and lifestyle.\nThe Basics\nThe name giraffe is derived from the Arab word zarafa, which means \u2018the one who walks very fast\u2019.\nThe scientific name of the giraffe is Camelopardalis. The etymology of this name can be traced to a belief (which is untrue) that the giraffe was a cross between a camel (height) and a leopard (coat pattern).\nA male giraffe is called a bull, a female is called a cow, and a baby giraffe is called a calf.\nThe species has only nine members. These including the Camelopardalis or Nubian mentioned above, are \u2013 Reticulated, Angolan, Kordofan, Masai, Rhodesian, Baringo/Rothschild/Ugandan, South African and West African/Nigerian.\nThe average life span of a giraffe in the wild is between 20 to 25 years.\nGiraffes usually move in groups of about 30 \u2013 35 individuals, usually mothers and their offspring. Males tend to get more solitary as they age and are generally not a part of a group.\nGiraffe Physiology\nThe tallest living animal on land, the giraffe stands at about 18 feet in height while its shoulders stand at 8 feet.\nAn adult male giraffe weighs between 3,400 lbs \u2013 3,600 lbs, while the female weighs between 1,600 lbs \u2013 2,000 lbs. A giraffe\u2019s heart weighs between 24 lbs \u2013 26 lbs and is approximately 2 feet in length.\nAlthough giraffes have to support a neck that is between 6 \u2013 8 feet in length (almost 18 times the length of a human neck!), they have the same number of cervical vertebrae as that of a human being, i.e. seven!\nBoth, male and female giraffes have small horn-like structures called ossicones. Females and baby giraffes have a small tuft of hair/fur on the ossicones, while males tend to be bald.\nSometimes, the extreme height can prove to be a bit cumbersome. Ever seen a giraffe drinking from a waterhole? They have to get into a pretty awkward position by spreading their front legs apart and bending their neck downward, which makes them extremely vulnerable to predators.\nGiraffes have the highest recorded blood pressure. 280/180mm Hg on average.\nThey have elastic blood vessels in their necks, which makes it possible for them to bend their neck to the ground and lift it again, without fainting.\nWhen they sleep, which is for a measly 30 minutes a day, they fold their forelegs beneath them, turn their neck towards their back and rest it on their rump. Sleeping while standing is also recorded.\nReproduction and Care of the Young\nGiraffes can conceive after the age of 5 years. Delivery takes place in the standing position. The calf falls headfirst to the ground from a height of about 5 to 6 feet!\nMales evaluate the fertility of females by tasting their urine! Males usually prefer young/middle-aged females for reproducing with, rather than the mature or juvenile ones.\nThe gestation period of giraffes is around 14 months.\nA calf is capable of running within a few short hours after being born.\nA newborn giraffe stands approximately 6 feet tall. After it is born, its ossicones, which were flattened in the womb, become erect.\nThe usually very peaceable females will engage in fights to protect their young ones if they feel they are threatened.\nWhen it comes to taking care of the young, giraffes rely on teamwork. One female looks after the young of the entire herd, while the others go around foraging for food.\nEating Habits\nGiraffes are herbivorous animals. They enjoy eating different types of leaves and grass, a special favorite being the thorny acacia leaves.\nTheir unusually long neck helps them reach the high branches of trees to feed on the leaves. In addition to the long neck, they are further equipped with a really long tongue, which measures around 20 inches, which helps them reach branches that seem just out of reach after stretching their neck.\nGiraffes have a black colored tongue and antiseptic saliva! Together with the thick lips, the teeth and the tongue do a good job of protecting the giraffe\u2019s mouth from the prickly thorns on trees.\nThey are ruminant mammals. This means that they first swallow all the food that they wants (generally more than 30 kg a day) after some perfunctory chewing, and then bring up the half-digested cud back up to the mouth later, to chew on again.\nEven though giraffes can consume large quantities of food, if circumstances are extreme they can also survive on a bare minimum of just 6 kg!\nA giraffe can go for a long stretch of time without water, just like a camel. Their water needs are met by the high water content in the vegetation that they consume.\nLifestyle of a Giraffe\nNeck wrestling matches, called \u2018necking\u2019, are often held to show authority in their herds. Males participate in these \u2018authority\u2019 matches. The violent versions are also pretty tame in keeping with their nature, and they make up after by caressing or mounting each other!\nGiraffes are social animals, and they live in open herds. When there is abundant foliage on the trees in the forests, giraffes scatter around to enjoy it. However, once winter approaches and food begins to become scarce, they congregate and live together to collectively look for food.\nGiraffes are silent animals, but they are certainly not mute. Sounds similar to those emitted by cows and goats have been recorded from giraffes too. While males make coughing sounds to attract females, females bellow to call out to their young! The little ones can mew, bleat, moo and snort!\nGiraffes have color vision. They are blessed with excellent eyesight. This helps them keep an eye on each other from a distance and also to survey the area for predators.\nLions and large packs of hyenas are the giraffe\u2019s only predators. Their long and strong legs are helpful in safeguarding them from these predators. A single, full-forced kick from a giraffe can seriously injure and sometimes even kill a fully grown lion!\nRandom Facts about Giraffes\nGiraffes running at top speed can reach a maximum of around 55 to 60 km/h, that too, intermittently.\nThey sleep for hardly half an hour a day, and even this sleep is divided into 5 or 10 minute naps.\nEach giraffe has a unique coat pattern and it has been observed that giraffes of a herd seem to have similar coat patterns.\nA giraffe\u2019s age can be calculated from its spots. The darker the spots, the older the giraffe.\nSame-sex coupling has been observed in giraffes. The incidents of such activities are much higher amongst males (usually occurring after \u2018necking\u2019), than amongst females.\nAlthough it is believed that they cannot cough, scientists have discovered that males emit a coughing sound in order to attract females for mating.\nWhile walking, giraffes use legs on the same side for each step. Meaning, they walk using the front and hind legs of the same side. Every step a giraffe takes is almost 15 feet in length.\nTanzania has honored the giraffe by naming it their national animal.\nAlthough giraffes were hunted pretty extensively many years ago and also driven away from their habitats for various reasons. Some of the subspecies are endangered though and are listed as \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 by the IUCN.\nThese fascinating creatures are probably as peace-loving as they come. Although they usually mind their own business when not bothered, they can be formidable when threatened. The more one finds out about these gentle giants, the more endearing they become!"}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "10 Fascinating Facts About Giraffes - Listverse", "url": "https://listverse.com/2013/10/12/12-fascinating-facts-about-giraffes/", "text": "Giraffes are among the most awe-inspiring creatures on the planet. Their long necks, regal stance, and beautiful features make them seem almost surreal, despite the fact that they roam the African plains with very real danger all around them. Their unique biology means that they have some problems to deal with that never affect other animals, and some behaviors that at first look downright bizarre.\n10 Mating And Flehmen\nThe mating rituals of giraffes are rather complicated, because female giraffes refuse to mate during the entirety of their pregnancy, which lasts 15 months. Between pregnancies, the females are ready to mate with a suitable male, but only for a brief period every two weeks.\nSo that the male giraffes can keep track of the times when the females are available to mate, they have developed a behavior called flehmen, in which the female giraffe urinates in the male giraffe\u2019s mouth. This rather kinky-sounding procedure is actually perfectly pragmatic\u2014the female giraffe\u2019s urine tastes different when it\u2019s ready to mate. So unless a particular taste is present, the male giraffe knows to leave the female alone. If the female is ready to mate, the males will scuffle around her while she waits demurely for the strongest one to dispatch the competition.\n9 Giraffes And NASA\nGiraffes and space travel don\u2019t seem like an obvious mix, but they have actually contributed quite a lot to our travels in space. Weightlessness has always posed a number of problems to the human body. One of the most significant issues is the weakening of leg veins. Since the blood flows differently in space, the circulatory system of the legs doesn\u2019t have to put in so much work in order to pump the blood back up. The veins get lazy, thin, and weak, which can pose serious problems when returning to Earth.\nGiraffes have provided a solution to this problem. Baby giraffes learn how to stand almost immediately upon birth, thanks to their rapidly inflating leg veins. When NASA observed this, they were able to create the Lower Body Negative Pressure process. It\u2019s a device that consists of an airtight tube that seals around the astronaut below the waist and applies vacuum pressure, thus rapidly expanding the leg veins and making blood rush into the legs and pelvic area. When this pressure is applied at regular intervals, the astronaut\u2019s leg veins stay in shape.\n8 The Drinking Problem\nBecause giraffes are built the way they are, drinking can pose serious problems for them. To get to water, they need to spread their front legs and crane their neck down at an awkward angle, a position that leaves them clumsy and vulnerable to predators such as crocodiles.\nGiraffes deal with this very real drinking problem in a number of ways. Their digestive system can obtain almost all the water they need from the plants they eat, so the adults only need water once a day. Young giraffes, being the most vulnerable, are the most efficient at this, to the point where they often don\u2019t need to drink water at all. The reason they\u2019re able to do this is that giraffes are extremely economical creatures when it comes to liquids\u2014they never sweat or pant to cool down, like most mammals. Instead, they allow their body temperature to fluctuate according to the temperature around them, enabling them both to conserve water and to keep cool in any situation.\n7 Speed\nGiraffes seem like relatively clumsy creatures, thanks to their cumbersome-looking limbs and top-heaviness. Their bobbing walk, where both legs on one side are lifted in unison, looks positively relaxed. But looks can be deceptive.\nGiraffes have two modes of locomotion\u2014fast and horrifyingly fast or, as biologists put it, walking and galloping. A walking giraffe might seem slow, until you realize it can cover 4.5 meters (15 ft) with every step. That means even a leisurely walk gives it a speed of 16 kilometers (10 mi) per hour.\nAnd that\u2019s just its normal, lazy cruise mode. If a giraffe decides to run, you\u2019d better hope it\u2019s not because it is chasing you. The fast and surprisingly graceful gallop of a giraffe can easily outpace a human, and even many horses. Its top recorded speed is a whopping 56 kilometers (35 mi) per hour.\nStill, giraffes are unlikely to replace horses anytime soon: Thanks to their long windpipe, they run out of breath quite quickly when running.\n6 Combat Skills\nWith its ridiculously unbalanced build and fast gallop, it\u2019s easy to assume the giraffe is ill-equipped for defending itself and runs away when predators are near. Nothing could be further from the truth.\nGiraffes are well-versed in the art of self-defense, to the point where even lions only dare to attack them in large groups (and then only when they\u2019re desperate). Giraffe legs are powerful and heavy, and each of them ends in a hard, sharp, 30-centimeter (12 in) hoof. A giraffe can kick in any direction and in a manner of ways, and its kick can not only kill a lion, but actually decapitate it.\nUnsurprisingly, very few predators bother an adult giraffe.\n5 The Giraffe Dance\nThanks to their awe-inspiring appearance and hidden strength, giraffes are greatly revered in many traditional African belief systems. Although large world religions (particularly Christianity) have taken their toll on traditional African religions, the giraffe has endured as a mystical symbol here and there. One of the stranger ways this has manifested is the Giraffe Dance. It is a mystical \u201ccuring\u201d dance that came to a woman in a dream in the 1950s. She saw a vision of a herd of giraffes running in the rain, their hooves and the raindrops beating a peculiar melody. The vision became the Giraffe Song, which spawned a Giraffe Dance, which in turn started spreading like wildfire. For decades, the Bushmen of the Kalahari area used it as their main hunting dance.\nThe actual dance consisted of the men doing the Giraffe Dance in a large circle, inside which the women sat in a group, singing and playing the Giraffe Song.\n4 Necking\nMany of you have probably seen pictures of two giraffes gently rubbing their necks together. It\u2019s an adorable image that gives the impression of intimacy and companionship, and as such it has been used on many a Valentine\u2019s Day card.\nThis practice is actually far from friendly\u2014it\u2019s closer to locker room wrestling or even actual fighting. It\u2019s called necking, and it\u2019s usually done by male giraffes as a test of strength\u2014the giraffes bang, twist, and rub their necks together to see which of them is stronger. Although they seem cute, these fights are quite taxing and can last up to 20 minutes.\nStill, the Valentine\u2019s cards are right in one respect\u2014even brutal necking can sometimes turn erotic, though female giraffes are not involved. Sometimes, the test of strength arouses the male giraffes so much that they just drop the fighting and move on to . . . other things.\n3 Magic Mouth\nGiraffes have a prehensile tongue approximately 50 centimeters (20 in) long. The tongue is colored bluish-black to protect it from sunburn, and the giraffe uses it much like an elephant uses its trunk\u2014it grasps things with it and uses it for personal grooming, such as picking its nose and cleaning its ears. The snake-like tongue is especially useful for obtaining food\u2014the giraffe can just wrap it around the foliage and yank it into its mouth.\nThe mouth itself is no less strange. The giraffe\u2019s large upper lip is also prehensile, which gives the mouth an almost hand-like dexterity when combined with the tongue. The insides of the mouth, along with the lips and the tongue, are completely covered with hard, finger-like papillae to protect it from thorns and nasty gashes.\n2 Egyptians And Caesar\u2019s Giraffe\nWith their forceful kicks and enormous height, one might assume a giraffe would make a poor pet. Ancient Egyptians thought otherwise.\nAs early as 2,500 B.C., Egyptian rulers captured giraffes and paraded them in front of their subjects. Hunters found giraffes fairly easy to transport on a raft down the Nile, so they could provide a steady supply of these exotic animals. Giraffes were so impressive and regal that the Egyptians started giving them as presents\u2014and passive-aggressive examples of their power\u2014to the rulers of other countries.\nThe most famous recipient of a giraffe gift was none other than Julius Caesar, who was most impressed by the present. He named his new prize animal \u201ccameleopard,\u201d because he thought it resembled a cross between the two species. He paraded it home for the whole of Rome to admire. And then he stuck the poor animal in a circus arena and fed it to lions to show his power.\nMoral of the story\u2014you don\u2019t become the emperor of the most powerful nation in the world by being a particularly nice person.\n1 Zarafa The Giraffe\nPerhaps the best-known giraffe celebrity in history is Zarafa, the first giraffe in France and a royal gift to King Charles X from Muhammad Ali, the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt. Zarafa\u2014meaning \u201cThe Lovely One\u201d in Arabic\u2014arrived in France in October 1826. She was paraded from Marseilles to Paris at a leisurely pace, and her regal and friendly demeanor made her the toast of the town wherever she went\u2014100,000 members of the adoring public came out to follow her progress.\nEventually, Zarafa set up shop in the Jardin des Plantes in Paris and became the biggest celebrity in the entire country. Famous writers wrote stories about her. Acclaimed artists painted pictures inspired by her. Women started wearing high \u201cgiraffe\u201d hairstyles and clothing with giraffe spots patterned after her. Giraffe-themed furniture and decorations were all the rage, and eventually the entire continent of Europe caught \u201cGiraffemania.\u201d\nOf course, like every craze, it was bound to end. Zarafa fell out of fashion, and the public stopped coming. Although some say it is sad that the giraffe had to spend her final years as a relative recluse, she probably enjoyed the peace and quiet after a lifetime of being constantly followed by millions of people.\n+ Giraffe Fur\nThe most striking feature of giraffes, apart from their necks, of course, is their magnificent, spotted coat. The intricate patterns of the fur are not only individual to different subspecies\u2014every single giraffe has a unique pattern, much as with human fingerprints. Curiously, the patterns also function as gang signs\u2014giraffes from the same area tend to have similar fur patterns.\nWhen you look underneath the coloring, the giraffe\u2019s fur is even more impressive, if by \u201cimpressive\u201d you mean \u201crepulsive.\u201d Because giraffes are pretty bad at grooming their bodies because of the length of their necks, they secrete chemicals from their skin and coat to repel insects and disinfect the skin so that fungi and bacteria cannot grow. Sadly, this chemical cocktail leaves their skin smelling fairly unpleasant to humans. Some older giraffes are so completely saturated with the smell that the local people call them \u201cstink bulls.\u201d It is said that you can smell them up to 250 meters (820 ft) away.\nPauli Poisuo also writes for Cracked.com.

Are They The Tallest Animal?", "url": "https://kidadl.com/fun-facts/do-you-know-how-tall-is-a-giraffe-are-they-the-tallest-animal", "text": "Well, if ever there is a doubt in your mind regarding this, a giraffe is indeed the tallest existing land animal.\nEvery time you go to a zoo, you will be undoubtedly mesmerized by the eye-popping height of a giraffe, and the case is similar for jungle safaris as well. Giraffes are herbivores and are pretty calm and friendly by nature, there aren't many incidents which concern a giraffe posing a threat to life.\nUnlike several other animal species, like monkeys or chimpanzees or baboons, it isn't very difficult to distinguish a giraffe from other animals. Giraffes, Giraffa camelopardalis, are only one species but have multiple subspecies with small differences. Apart from at a zoo, you can get a glimpse of a giraffe, Giraffa camelopardalis, in Africa because this animal is native to Central, East and South Africa. You will have no trouble spotting this animal as giraffes are the tallest terrestrial animals living on earth. They roam around in herds and can be spotted in large open grasslands. You can even spot these creatures while they drink water, and you might be amazed by the amount of water they drink in a day. Giraffes drink around 10 gal (38 l) of water in one day.\nIf you enjoyed this article, why not also read about How rare are 4 leaf clovers? Odds of finding four-leaf clover? and how tall is a grizzly bear here on Kidadl.\nHow tall is a baby giraffe?\nA giraffe in the prime of its life has a height of around 18 ft (5.5 m). What might astonish you even more is that its long neck has a length of 6 ft (1.8 m). In order to complement their staggering body height, giraffes weigh around 3000 lb (1361 kg). Just like most of the other animal species existing in this world, there is a difference in body measurements between male and female giraffes. Female giraffes aren't as tall or as heavy as male giraffes.\nNow in the case of baby giraffes, do not let the word 'baby' misguide you into thinking that a giraffe's calves are born the size of human babies or are as small in size as other young animals. The calves of a giraffe are born at a height of around 6 ft (1.8 m), which is the size of a full-grown human being and weighs around 110-154 lb. (50-70 kg). What might surprise you, even more, is that female giraffes, who are also known as cows, give birth standing! Their calves fall onto the ground from a height of around 5 ft (1.5 m) but suffer no injury, and in fact, owing to their unparalleled agility, a calf can start walking just after an hour of being born. Once the calf is around four to five years old, it is believed to be mature enough to spend the rest of its life on its own.\nHow tall is a full-grown giraffe?\nAn average adult giraffe has a height of around 16-20 ft (5-6 m), it is considerably taller than the females. The majority height of a giraffe is constituted by a giraffe's neck and its legs. Both the long necks and legs are around 6 ft tall (1.8 m), helping it to be the tallest living animal. These are the height and weight specifications of a regular giraffe that originally hails from Africa.\nLet us take a look into the records book and find out what was the tallest ever giraffe recorded. So the tallest giraffe ever recorded was a Masai bull African giraffe named George. It was 19 ft tall (5.8 m) at the age of nine and had its name etched in the 'Guinness Book Of World Records'. Talking about facts, people often believe that giraffes are one of the only mammals to have not one, not two but three hearts! However, this is actually false as giraffes only have one heart. These tall animals with tails at the back and horns on their head amaze us with every other detail about them.\nHow tall is a giraffe in feet?\nThe height of a giraffe greatly varies depending upon its sex, as well as, the stage of its life it is in. For instance, male giraffes are relatively taller than female giraffes by a considerable amount. In the case of newborn giraffes, they are neither taller nor have greater weight than either a male or a female giraffe.\nIn terms of feet, males can be as tall as 18 ft (5.5 m), whereas, females can have a height of up to 14 ft (4 m). Now a newborn giraffe has a height of around 6 ft (1.8 m). The adult, as well as, the baby giraffes who have recently been given birth by their mothers eat leaves and small branches off trees in the grasslands as their source of food, using their hard tongues. The tongue of a giraffe is really hard and rough to protect it from thorns present on some of the trees which they eat as their daily food. Their long necks play an important role in this process by helping them reach the higher branches. On average, the bottom half of a giraffe is as much as 6 ft (1.8 m) tall.\nHow tall is a male giraffe?\nMale giraffes are taller than the other two kinds of giraffes, including female giraffes and young giraffes. Male giraffes have an average height of 18 ft (5.5 m) and are taller than their body is taller than the females by around 4 ft (1.2 m). A similar pattern of difference can be observed when you weigh both these kinds of giraffes. It is the long neck and legs of these animals which play a pivotal role in making a difference between a giraffe's body from another giraffe's.\nA human can easily spot a giraffe's body from some distance owing to its long neck, legs, and the pattern you see on its body. A giraffe's predators use this to their benefit but the thick skin of a giraffe often saves it from some such attacks from its predators and also protects its long legs from some obstacles like thorns which it might not be able to see. This easy spotting of giraffes has led to massive poaching and calls for immediate giraffe conservation. The population of these animals has shrunk massively over the past 30 years. A giraffe's long neck and legs make it easier for poachers to spot them and hunt them down to use their tails for making bracelets or fancy threads for stringing beads. It is high time humans realize the need for giraffe conservation so that they can protect these animals from becoming further endangered.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly facts for everyone to enjoy!

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "How Long Is A Giraffe Pregnant? Giraffe Gestation Period Examined - Kidadl", "url": "https://kidadl.com/fun-facts/how-long-is-a-giraffe-pregnant-giraffe-gestation-period-examined", "text": "Giraffes are the tallest mammals in the world and they are truly amazing creatures with many unique features.\nMost giraffes in the world are native to the continent of Africa, while parts like eastern Africa and South Africa contain the most giraffes. Their conservation status under the International Union for the Conservation of Nature is listed as Vulnerable.\nA giraffe has unique features like a long neck, a long body and exceptionally tall build. It's almost impossible to believe that such creatures exist in reality. Because they are very tall, they can run long distances with ease. They can run as fast as 35 mph (56 kph) over short distances which is faster than the fastest human runners in the world which is not really surprising considering their size. But just as amazing these animals are, giraffe birth is one of the most difficult births in the animal kingdom and it weighs down upon the calf and the mother alike. The birth of every creature in this world is unique but animal birth is certainly more difficult than human birth. Many animal births are much more difficult than human births. This is not to undermine the pain that a human mother goes through, but its certainly more difficult for an animal mother because there are less resources available to aid and ease their pain. Moreover laboring animals are constantly under threat to protect the life of their newborn as well as their own.\nIf you like this article, do check out how do giraffes sleep and how tall is a giraffe.\nWhere and when do giraffes give birth?\nEvery animal gives birth in a slightly different way, but giraffe labor is definitely very unique. There are always some visible signs of laboring animals. In case of a giraffe, you know when it is about too give birth with the following signs. A laboring mother will stiffen her posture and display movement in her hips. Another big sign of labor is that she suddenly stops eating and sticks out her tail often. Subsequently, if the calf comes out with its front feet and nose first, its a good sign but if it comes out backwards, that's a bad sign. Female giraffes give birth standing up.\nDomesticated females are known to have designated 'calving grounds' where they give birth. Most zoos have recorded laboring mothers 'returning' to the ground where they have previously given birth as a giraffe can give birth every 20-30 months. As for the females in the wild, they find a suitable, sheltered location in the wild and laboring giraffes will hide their signs for as long as possible especially in the wild in order to not be vulnerable to predators, like the big cats of Africa.\nAfter the birth of the calf, females and males don't display similar behaviors during the upbringing of the calf. Adult male giraffes don't have anything to do with the bringing up of their babies, so just as the females get pregnant, they leave their family herd.\nAs the calves grow up, the calves that are male shall leave behind their birth mothers after about 15 months to often join all-male groups. Female calves however, often stay in the same herd where their mothers are. If they do leave, they leave at about 18 months old. They will also usually live in the same location with their family herd where they grew up.\nWhat is the gestation period of a giraffe?\nGiraffes have quite a normal gestation period that is similar to other big mammals like camels and elephants. Their gestation period can last for 15 months.\nHowever, gestation periods differ from species to species but giraffe mothers have one of the longest pregnancies. Baby giraffes are born and fall to the ground because mothers give birth standing up so the baby needs to be big enough to be capable of surviving a long fall to the ground. The 'fall' is typically what bursts the amniotic sac, breaking the umbilical cord which is definitely just as difficult as it seems to be. However difficult it may seem, it is essential as it encourages the calf to take its first breath. This fall is really important because the fall practically separates the mother and the baby. Surprisingly though, the fall doesn't hurt the baby giraffes and they are fortunately resistant to maximum amount of pain.\nHow many days is a giraffe pregnant?\nThe giraffe is a big animal with quite a long gestation period. They have similar gestation periods to big animals like elephants and camels. Camels have a more similar duration of pregnancies than elephants, nevertheless the procedure of birth of these animals is very similar. All these animals have a gestation period between 15-22 months. Camels have the shortest pregnancies with a minimum of 13 months, followed by giraffes with a minimum of 15 months which is around 400-450 days, and last on the list are elephants with the longest pregnancy of 22 months.\nIndividual giraffes have different rates of reaching reproductive maturity depending on their sex life. Male giraffes are only reproductive for six years of their life whereas female giraffes can reproduce through a life-time. On average, a giraffe does not reach reproductive maturity until four to five months of age. A giraffe usually gives birth to one calf at a time but there is a possibility of twins while females stop menstruating soon. Early menopause is an interesting biological function which accommodates the female to take up the upbringing of her grandchildren.\nHow big are giraffe calves at birth?\nThe newborns of female giraffes are as big as a full-grown human. Newborn giraffes are astonishingly 6 ft (1.8 m) tall and weigh in at 50 lb (68 kg) at birth on average. The size of a baby giraffe at birth might be an overwhelming size for just a baby. However, this is the baby of one of the biggest and tallest animals in the world so it only makes sense that they are big.. However, a more scientific reason for their gigantic size is that baby giraffes need to reach the height of their mother's udder in order to consume milk.\nA giraffe calf does not really have a choice to not walk right after its born because it needs to follow the herd in order to stay secure and escape predators. Similarly, the laboring mothers prefer to stay among the herd to keep safe from predators in the wild during the months of pregnancy\nFor how long will a giraffe rely on its mother's milk?\nBecause of the extreme size of their offspring, a mother giraffe gives birth standing up so as not damage the lengthy necks of their babies who fall on the ground from an approximate distance of 6 ft (1.8 m) ! The newborns are definitely just as amazing as their mothers.\nA giraffe's amazing newborn is largely autonomous, compared to most animals. Even the newborn of a human can barely open its eyes. Because they are so autonomous, they start eating solid food like leaves from about four months in the earliest cases. They only rely on their mother's milk for up to 9-12 months and have the ability to walk within the first hour of being born and run within 10 hours from birth.\nWhat animal has the longest pregnancy?\nThere is an overwhelming amount of diversity of animals in the animal kingdom, some are small and some are large. All animals have different types of birth and their birth depends on a number of factors. One of the most interesting fact is that, the gestation period of animals is somewhat related to the size of the animal.\nThe rationale behind this conclusion is that, larger and more complex animals need longer time to develop. Whereas, smaller and less complicated animals need a shorter time to develop. Considering this logic, its not surprising to know that its indeed the largest mammal on land that has the longest pregnancy. Elephants, one of the biggest creatures in the world, have an overwhelmingly long gestation period of 22 months which is nearly around two years! Giraffes being one of the biggest creatures join elephants on the list of animals with the longest pregnancies, making it a unique experience in itself.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly facts for everyone to enjoy!

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Okapi Facts (Okapia johnstoni) - ThoughtCo", "url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/okapi-facts-4768622", "text": "The okapi (Okapia johnstoni) has stripes like a zebra, but it is actually a member of the family Giraffidae. It is most closely related to the giraffe. Like giraffes, okapis have long, black tongues, hair-covered horns called ossicones, and an unusual gait of stepping with front and back legs on one side at a time. However, okapis are smaller than giraffes and only the males have ossicones.\nFast Facts: Okapi Scientific Name: Okapia johnstoni\nOkapia johnstoni Common Names: Okapi, forest giraffe, zebra giraffe, Congolese giraffe\nOkapi, forest giraffe, zebra giraffe, Congolese giraffe Basic Animal Group: Mammal\nMammal Size: 5 feet tall at the shoulder\n5 feet tall at the shoulder Weight: 440-770 pounds\n440-770 pounds Lifespan: 20-30 years\n20-30 years Diet: Herbivore\nHerbivore Habitat: Democratic Republic of the Congo\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo Population: Fewer than 10,000\nFewer than 10,000 Conservation Status: Endangered\nDescription\nThe okapi stands about 4 feet 11 inches tall at the shoulder, is about 8 feet 2 inches long, and weighs between 440 and 770 pounds. It has big, flexible ears, a long neck, and white stripes and rings on its legs. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism. Females are a couple of inches taller than males, reddish-colored, and have whorls of hair on their heads. Males are chocolate brown and have hair-covered ossicones on their heads. Both males and females have gray faces and throats.\nOkapis have long tongues. Males have horn-like growths on their heads. Andra Boda / EyeEm / Getty Images\nHabitat and Distribution\nOkapis are native to canopy rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda. However, the species is now extinct in Uganda. Okapis may be found in forests at altitudes between 1,600 and 4,000 feet, but they will not remain in habitats near human settlements.\nOkapis live in the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. U. Schr\u00f6ter / Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\nDiet\nOkapis are herbivores. They feed on rainforest understory foliage, including grasses, ferns, fungi, tree leaves, buds, and fruit. Okapis use their 18-inch tongues to browse for plants and groom themselves.\nBehavior\nExcept for breeding, okapis are solitary animals. Females stay within small home ranges and share common defecation sites. Males continuously migrate throughout their large ranges, using urine to mark territory as they move.\nOkapis are most active during daylight hours, but may forage a few hours during darkness. Their eyes contain a large number of rod cells, giving them excellent night vision.\nBaby Okapi at San Diego Zoo Safari Park. Ken Bohn/San Diego Zoo Safari Park\nReproduction and Offspring\nMating may occur at any time of the year, but females only give birth every two years. Rut and estrous occur every 15 days. Males and females court each other by circling, licking, and smelling each other. Gestation lasts 440 to 450 days and results in a single calf. The calf can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Calves resemble their parents, but they have long manes and long white hairs within their stripes. The female hides her calf and nurses it infrequently. Calves might not defecate for the first couple of months following birth, presumably to help them hide from predators. The calves are weaned at 6 months of age. Females reach sexual maturity at 18 months, while males develop horns after one year and are mature at 2 years of age. The okapi's average lifespan is between 20 and 30 years.\nImran Azhar / Getty Images\nConservation Status\nThe International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the okapi conservation status as \"endangered.\" The population has been declining dramatically, so there may be fewer than 10,000 remaining animals in the wild. It's difficult to count okapis because of their habitat, so population estimates are based on dung surveys.\nThreats\nThe okapi population was devastated by a decade-long civil war in their habitat. Although protected under Congolese law, okapis are poached for bushmeat and for their skins. Other threats include habitat loss from mining, human settlement, and logging.\nWhile okapis face dire threats in their natural habitat, the Okapi Conservation Project works with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums to conserve the species. Around 100 okapis live in zoos. Some of the zoos participating in the program are the Bronx Zoo, Houston Zoo, Antwerp Zoo, London Zoo, and Ueno Zoo.\nSources"}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe Species - Giraffe Facts and Information", "url": "https://www.giraffeworlds.com/giraffe-species/", "text": "Giraffe Species\nAll species of giraffes are native to Africa and belong to the order of even-toed ungulate mammals known as artiodactyls, which also includes deer, goats or camels, to name a few. They also belong to the family Giraffidae being their closest relative the Okapi, an animal similar to their ancestors with anatomical features very similar to the current giraffes and zebras.\nThe Giraffidae family developed from ungulates in the early Miocene; That is, about 25 million years ago. Such family includes two Genera, the Giraffa and the Okapia. As evident, the former includes the four species of giraffes while the latter only includes the Okapi (Okapia johnstoni) which is the only extant species today.\nGiraffes are ruminants, and they are the tallest animals on Earth, although one of the species is the first place in this category.\nThere are four species, six subspecies and one ecotype of giraffes that are native to more than 15 African countries. Although each has distinct fur patterns and different heights, they are not easy to identify, especially if we consider that their type of habitat and reproductive or feeding habits are very similar.\n1. Northern giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis)\nSubspecies:\na. Kordofan giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis antiquorum)\nb. Nubian giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis camelopardalis)\nc. West African giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis peralta)\nd. Rothschild\u2019s giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi)\n2. Reticulated giraffe (Giraffa reticulata)\n3. Southern giraffe (Giraffa giraffa)\nSubspecies:\na. Angolan giraffe (Giraffa giraffa angolensis)\nb. South African giraffe (Giraffa giraffa giraffa)\n4. Masai giraffe (Giraffa tippelskirchi)\nEcotype:\nRhodesian giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis thornicrofti)\nThe differences that are noted include where they live, the coloring, and even the types of patterns that they have on their coats. The distribution ranges of some species overlap. They may even share a given area, but they do not often interact with each other.\nThe Northern giraffe (Giraffa camelopardis) have four subspecies which are among the best known. Regardless they are the same species; each subspecies has a very distinctive fur pattern that makes them easy to identify.\nThe Kordofan giraffe, (Giraffa camelopardalis antiquorum) is perhaps the shortest species with a height between 3.8 and 4.7 meters, which still are relevant dimensions. It has patterns of irregular spots with different sizes that in younger individuals appear with colors less intense than in the adults. The savannas of Kenya and Uganda are part of their natural habitat.\nThe Rothschild\u2019s giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi) is another subspecies of the Northern giraffe and has a fur with a beige background and brown patches whose center shows other much darker spots. These patches are irregular and separated from each other, which helps to differentiate it from other types of giraffes.\nThe second species, The reticulated giraffe (Giraffa reticulata) is one of the most identifiable. They reach a height of four or five meters and have a fur pattern with sharp edges, slightly separated from each other, which produces very narrow white lines and a puzzle aspect. It inhabits the rainforests and savannas of Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia.\nThe Masai giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi) is the tallest animal on Earth with a height of six meters, and coat with spots of two shades of brown very similar to oak leaves on a yellowish background. Currently, they only inhabit the natural landscapes of Kenya and Tanzania.\nThe West African Giraffe is a common type of giraffe that you will see in zoos. They are also commonly referred to as the Nigerian giraffes.\nExtinct genera\nGiraffes have ancestors that today only exist in the history books and museums.\nFossil discoveries revealed the existence of a genus that lived 8,000 years ago that had a medium-sized anatomy. We are talking about Sivatherium. The fossil remains indicate that the individuals of this species had a height around 3 meters and a weight of 500 kg.\nThe genus Giraffokeryx lived in Eurasia and had four ossicones in its head and medium height.\nPalaeotragus was one of the largest genera of primitive Okapis that lived in Africa, Asia, and Europe in the Miocene era. They had ossicones like giraffes and reached about six feet high.\nSome examples of giraffe species that once populated the Earth are Giraffa jumae, Giraffa gracilis, Giraffa punjabiensis, Giraffa priscilla, Giraffa pygmaea, Giraffa sivalensis, Giraffa stillei, but little information is available on them.\nThere is not a conservation status available for all species and subspecies, but the species assessed are:\nSpecies:\nNorthern giraffe (Vulnerable)\nSubspecies:\nNubian giraffe (Endangered)\nWest African giraffe (Endangered)\nRothschild\u2019s giraffe (Endangered)\nSpecies:\nSouthern giraffe (Unknown)\nSubspecies:\nAngolan giraffe (Vulnerable)\nSpecies:\nMasai giraffe (Vulnerable)\nAll species and subspecies of giraffe are under threat due to various factors, but as usual, humans are at the top of the list. The Rothschild\u2019s (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi) and Nigerian giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis peralta) face the most severe condition and therefore require more conservation efforts.\nThe populations located in the south of the continent have had a positive response to conservation and preservation actions, as they are increasing, but it is not the same for the northern species.\nIn general, populations have declined alarmingly due to poaching and degradation of their natural habitat. It is estimated that some populations only have a few thousand members when several years ago they were prolific in any region of Africa, and it was very common to watch them.\nIt also seems that other herbivores look to keep close to giraffes as their ability to see at higher levels than others warn other with anticipation about possible dangers. Also, probably because they can hear the low frequencies that giraffes emit, so they pick up on danger sooner than other animals.\n*Image: Different patterns and colors in giraffe coats.\nReferences\nhttps://giraffeconservation.org/giraffe-species/\nhttp://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/there-are-four-giraffe-species-not-just-one-180960411/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffe\nColin Groves, Peter Grubb.

They subside primarily off of plants and fruits picked from high places. It's because of their necks that giraffes are the tallest extant animal species in the world. Adult males stand on average between 14 ft (4.3 m) and 17 ft (5.2 m), but their have been giraffes discovered that stood almost 20 ft (6 m) tall! For their height, giraffes don't weigh very much, carrying an average mass of 2,600 lbs (1,200 kg) in males, and just 1,800 lbs (830 kg) in females.\nGiraffes are also recognizable by their patchy fur, which usually features brownish patches covering a yellowish coat. They can be most commonly found in the savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands of places like Chad in Central Africa, and South Africa. However, they have been known to venture out of their preferred habitats when in need of food; preferring areas with denser vegetation and plenty of acacia (a type of shrub) growth. They are also known to drink as much water as they can when it's available, storing it so that they can live for extended periods of time in more arid areas. This trait is similar to camels, who are a distant relatives; they also share similar facial features, though giraffes have small horns atop their heads and camels don't. Their closest relative (still in existence) is the okapi, the only other member of the Giraffidae family. The horns of the giraffe add weight to their heads and allow them to deliver heavier blows when sparring and slamming their heads into each other's bodies.\nGiraffes are also known for not being the most pleasant smelling creatures. In fact, older males are sometimes called \"stink bulls\". Their smell is believed to come from their antibiotic and parasite repellent rich fur, and is also thought to have a part in their mating selection. Their peculiar appearance and almost mythical height have made giraffes a fixture in zoos all over the world. While in such captivity, they are known to lick various objects frequently; this is because captive giraffes never get to suckle their mother, and instinctively try to anyway. These wonderful and majestic creatures, are popular among animal lovers everywhere."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe Facts", "url": "https://giraffeconservation.org/facts/evolution-taxonomy-and-scientific-classification/", "text": "Helladotherium, a three-metre-tall antelope-like animal, which once roamed the plains and forests of Asia and Europe between the Eocene and Oligocene epochs 30-50 million years ago, is the forefather of the two remaining members of the Giraffidae family: the giraffe we know today, and the okapi. To date, more than ten fossil genera have been discovered, revealing that by the Miocene epoch, 6-20 million years ago, early deer-like giraffids were yet to develop the characteristic long neck of today\u2019s giraffe.\nLike okapi, hippo, oryx, buffalo and cattle, the giraffe is an even-toed ungulate. Rhino, zebra and horses are odd-toed ungulates. As the world\u2019s tallest animal and largest ruminant (an animal that partly digests its food, then regurgitates it to chew as \u2018cud\u2019), it belongs to:\nClass: Mammalia (mammals)\nOrder: Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates)\nFamily: Giraffidae\nGenus: Giraffa\nIn 2016 the IUCN completed the first detailed assessment of the conservation status of giraffe, revealing that their numbers are in peril. This was further emphasised when the majority of the IUCN recognised subspecies were assessed in 2018 \u2013 some as Critically Endangered. While this update further confirms the real threat to one of Africa\u2019s most charismatic megafauna, it also highlights a rather confusing aspect of giraffe conservation: how many species/subspecies of giraffe are there?\nThe IUCN currently recognises one species (Giraffa camelopardalis) and nine subspecies of giraffe, which is historically based on outdated assessments of their morphological features and geographic ranges. The subspecies are thus divided: Angolan giraffe (G. c. angolensis), Kordofan giraffe (G. c. antiquorum), Masai giraffe (G. c. tippleskirchi), Nubian giraffe (G. c. camelopardalis), Reticulated giraffe (G. c. reticulata), Rothschild\u2019s giraffe (G. c. rothschildi), South African giraffe (G. c. giraffa), Thornicroft\u2019s giraffe (G. c. thornicrofti), and West African giraffe (G. c. peralta).\nHowever, the Giraffe Conservation Foundation (GCF), together with its partner Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (BiK-F), has performed the first-ever comprehensive DNA sampling and analysis (genomic, nuclear and mitochondrial) of all major natural populations of giraffe throughout their range in Africa. As a result, an update of the traditional taxonomy now exists. This study revealed that there are four distinct species of giraffe, and five subspecies. The four distinct species are Masai giraffe (G. tippelskirchi), Northern giraffe (G. camelopardalis), Reticulated giraffe (G. reticulata) and Southern giraffe (G. giraffa). The Angolan giraffe (G. g. angolensis) and South African giraffe (G. g. giraffa) are the two subspecies of the Southern giraffe. Nubian giraffe (G. c. camelopardalis), Kordofan giraffe (G. c. antiquorum) and West African giraffe (G. c. peralta) are the three subspecies of the Northern giraffe. Rothschild\u2019s giraffe is genetically identical to the Nubian giraffe. As the nominate species, Nubian giraffe takes precedence and Rothschild\u2019s giraffe is thus subsumed into it.\nPreliminary data suggests that the Thornicroft\u2019s giraffe is genetically similar to the Masai giraffe. However, additional research is necessary to determine whether Thornicroft\u2019s giraffe are genetically identical to Masai giraffe, or should be considered a separate subspecies of Masai giraffe. In all of GCF\u2019s conservation work and publications, based on this research, we use the updated giraffe taxonomy of the four species, while the IUCN still refers to the traditional concept of one species and nine subspecies.\nAll four giraffe species and their subspecies live in geographically distinct areas throughout Africa. While some of these species have been reported to hybridise in zoos, there is very little evidence that this occurs readily in the wild.\nRead more about the four species of giraffe."}

Interestingly, only the male okapi has ossicones.\nThe rare okapi is listed as Endangered on the IUCN RedList and is endemic to the forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and likely neighbouring Uganda historically. The primary strongholds of okapi include the Ituri/Aruwimi and adjacent Nepoko basin forests, and the forests of the upper Lindi, Maiko and Tshobo Basins; the species is also known to occur in the Rubi-Tele region in Bas Uele."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Why Do Giraffes Have Spots? - AZ Animals", "url": "https://a-z-animals.com/blog/why-do-giraffes-have-spots/", "text": "Giraffes are most well-known for their long necks and legs. However, another distinctive feature of the tallest animal on Earth is certainly their spots. These spots, or patches, cover their bodies from head to toe and appear in innumerable combinations of shapes, patterns, and shades. While the patterns certainly look pleasing to the eye, their primary purpose is not simply cosmetic. On the contrary, giraffe\u2019s spots serve several crucial functions that raise a giraffe\u2019s chances of survival. What seems like a mere splash of color runs more than skin deep. Indeed, giraffes\u2019 spots reveal incredible details about their anatomy, evolution, and social structure.\nWhy Giraffes Have Spots\nNo two giraffes possess the same coat markings. In addition, different subspecies of giraffes tend to exhibit different groups of patterns and shades. While debates continue as to the exact number of giraffe subspecies, there is consensus concerning nine recognized subspecies. These include the Reticulated, Nubian, Angolan, West African, South African, Masai, Thornicroft\u2019s, Kordofan, and Rothschild\u2019s giraffes. Each of these giraffes displays distinctive patterns that help to identify them from other subspecies. For example, Kordofan giraffes have more irregular spotting patterns. In addition, their spots can be found below the hocks and the insides of their legs. Meanwhile, Nubian giraffes normally possess prominent chestnut-colored spots but spotless undersides. Then there are Masai giraffes, which sport irregular, star-like spots all the way to their hooves. Finally, Angolan giraffes contain spots on their legs but not on their faces.\nFor years, scientists wondered why these patterns differed and what they meant. Now, thanks to recent studies and marking analysis, we better understand why these spots exist and the purposes they serve. According to a study from 2018, baby giraffes obtain their marking patterns from their mothers. In total, scientists identified 11 different attributes that can be used to differentiate spots, including size, shape, color, outline, pattern, and distribution. Characteristics such as roundness and smoothness correlate highly in mother-infant pairings, which suggests that giraffes inherit their spots. While scientists may never know exactly why or how giraffes get their spots, three prevailing theories currently dominate the conversation. They include spots as camouflage, spots as signs of social makings, and spots as heat regulators. Let\u2019s take a look at each of these functions and see how they help giraffes survive and what could underpin their development.\nSpots as Camouflage\nThe spots on a giraffe help it to blend into its surroundings. Ketan shah/Shutterstock.com\nMany animals evolved spots as a form of camouflage. Patterns such as stripes and spots allow animals with camouflage to blend into their surroundings, which can help them to avoid detection from a hunter or the hunted. For example, predators evolved spots to better stalk their prey, while prey evolved spots to hide from predators. Animals developed unique spots and colorings to match their environment, which explains why such a wide variety of patterns exist. From dark to light to brightly colored hues, animals evolved spots to match their habitat, enabling them to better survive in that particular area.\nIn the case of giraffes, the primary reason why they developed their spots is likely as a form of camouflage. Their pattern allows them to blend in with the yellow and brown landscape common across Africa\u2019s savannahs. Overall, the color of a giraffe\u2019s spots normally matches the coloring of the vegetation that grows in its native habitat. This suggests that spots evolved in response to environmental stimuli which increased giraffes likelihood of surviving and bearing offspring with similar markings. Furthermore, researchers identified that certain patterns tend to convey a greater likelihood of survival to infants than others. In particular, calves with larger, more irregularly-shaped spots were more likely to survive than calves with smaller, more uniform makings. This selection for diversity and uniqueness is likely why so many different patterns exist today and why no two giraffes look exactly alike.\nSpots as Social Markings\nCalves inherit their spots from their mothers, which helps the mothers to identify their calves in a group. Craig Fraser/Shutterstock.com\nAnother reason why giraffes have spots has to do with their role as social markings. Since calves often inherit their mother\u2019s pattern, this makes it easy for mothers to identify their offspring in a mixed group. Giraffes live in herds of 10 to 20 individuals, which means that differentiating characteristics serve an important role in helping giraffes tell each other apart. The more easily a mother can visualize her calf, the easier it is to keep it from danger. Just imagine if all giraffes bore the same pattern, and how difficult that would make it for mothers to single out their calves. By evolving distinct markings, and then passing these markings on to their offspring, giraffe mothers developed a way to keep an eye on their young. This adaptation likely greatly benefits caring mothers with strong maternal instincts whose offspring earn a higher likelihood of growing to reach adulthood.\nSpots as Heat Regulators\nGiraffes use their spots as a form of built-in cooling system. Eugen Haag/Shutterstock.com\nIn addition to serving as camouflage and social markings, spots serve a third, less obvious function. While not obvious, it may also represent one of the most important reasons why giraffes have spots. Anatomical studies of giraffes\u2019 bodies indicate that they use their spots as an intricate method of heat regulation. Specifically, giraffes\u2019 spots help them to release body heat and therefore cool off. Beneath each patch lies an intricate system of blood vessels. A large blood vessel surrounds each patch which then transitions into numerous smaller blood vessels beneath each marking. Giraffes can send blood into the larger blood vessel, which then distributes blood into the smaller vessels in the middle of the patch.\nThis movement of blood releases heat through the spots, allowing each one to act as a heat reducer. In a way, giraffes contain a built-in cooling system that allows them to prevent their bodies from overheating. Given that they live in some of the hottest and driest climates on Earth, this remarkable adaptation makes complete sense. Giraffes cannot roll around in the mud or dirt to cool off like other animals, due to their long legs and overall shape. So, they developed this amazing heat-reducting system to compensate.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhich pattern is the most popular among giraffes?\nWhile all giraffes possess unique markings, each subspecies possess certain traits in common, including marking patterns. Among the subspecies of giraffe, the one with the largest population is the Masai. This would make the Masai pattern the most common among giraffes."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Fact vs. Fiction: Do Giraffes Have Two Hearts? - Reference.com", "url": "https://www.reference.com/pets-animals/giraffes-two-hearts-697b707e0ccc8223", "text": "[Juhasz Imre/Pexels]\nA giraffe has a lot of space between its chest and head, which is probably the reason so many people wonder if the unique animal has two hearts. National Geographic confirms that these gentle giants are the tallest land mammals in the world. Their necks are 6 feet long on average, which is why they need powerful cardiovascular systems.\n\ufeffUnlike octopus or squid \u2014 which do have multiple hearts \u2014 giraffes only have one heart. Their anatomy and size require a lot from that single heart, which is part of what makes these animals so interesting.\nBig-Hearted Animals\nGiraffes are tall animals, reaching average heights of 14 to 19 feet, with males typically growing taller than females. They weigh anywhere from 1,750 to 2,800 pounds, and their legs are around 6 feet long, similar to their necks. That large amount of body mass requires a large heart to pump blood to the extremities and the head. On average, giraffe hearts weigh around 25 pounds and are approximately 2 feet long, according to the San Diego Zoo.\nThe Role of the Left Ventricle\nNot only is the size of the heart related to the size of the animal, but the size is also an important factor in pumping enough blood up those long necks. Additionally, other anatomical features are even more important in combating gravity than the overall size of the heart.\nThe right ventricle is one of four chambers of the heart and is responsible for pumping blood to the lungs. The muscle in a giraffe\u2019s right ventricle, as noted by the iGiraffe Conservation Foundation (GCF), is around 1 centimeter thick. The left ventricle is the part of the heart that pumps oxygenated blood out to the rest of the body. The muscle wall increases in thickness by 0.5 centimeters for every 15 centimeters in neck length. Africa Geographic estimates that the left ventricle can be up to 7 centimeters thick.\nUnder Pressure\nA giraffe\u2019s left ventricle isn\u2019t the only thing helping to combat gravity. The heart beats 40 to 90 times per minute while resting or up to 170 beats per minute while running. Even more notable, giraffes have very high blood pressures. GCF estimates that giraffe blood pressure runs around 280 over 180. That\u2019s slightly more than twice the optimal blood pressure of humans. Researchers believe this helps pump blood efficiently to the brain.\nCirculatory System Adaptations\nDiscover Wildlife points out that giraffes have a dense network of capillaries that stabilizes their blood pressure and protects them from the negative effects of fast blood pressure changes. They also have valves within their circulatory system to dilate and constrict as necessary. This minimizes the risk of fainting when giraffes stand up quickly or bend their necks for a drink.\nThick Skin\nGiraffes have tall, slender legs with skin that\u2019s tight and thick. The skin on their legs works much like compression socks and keeps the giraffe\u2019s blood pressure stable. It also helps keep the blood pumping through the body instead of pooling in their long legs. According to Live Science, the combination of thick skin and an added muscle in their jugular vein helps carry blood from the head back to the heart.\nOther Giraffe Facts\nGiraffes only have one heart, but there are plenty of other interesting facts to delight those interested in giraffe trivia. Check out these five fun facts:\nIn the wild, giraffes live about 25 years and roam freely on the woodlands and plains of their African home.\nAdult males grow to heights more than three times that of humans, allowing them to scope out the terrain for hyenas and crocodiles, their main predators, according to the San Diego Zoo.\nGiraffes spend anywhere from 16 to 20 hours eating every day and only sleep for five to 30 minutes daily.\nGiraffes eat up to 75 pounds of leaves every day, which also provides most of their hydration, so they only have to drink once every few days in the wild.\nScientists have identified four species of giraffes: Masai, reticulated, southern and northern.\nADVERTISEMENT"}

The Pistol Shrimp is capable of snapping its claw shut so rapidly, that it creates a bubble which collapses to produce a sonic blast, louder than a Concorde\u2019s sonic boom.\nThe shock wave can reach 230 decibels, also louder than the sound of a gunshot. The imploding bubble for split seconds also generates temperates of 4,400C, nearly as hot as the sun, killing its prey.\n2. Flamingos are not pink. They are born grey, their diet of brine shrimp and blue green algae contains a natural pink dye called canthaxanthin that makes their feathers pink.\nFlamingos in zoos often lost their colouring, until zoo keepers supplemented their diets.\n3. Otters \u201chold hands\u201d while sleeping, so they don\u2019t float away from each other.\nAnd it\u2019s super-cute. Look.\n4. Hummingbirds are the only known birds that can also fly backwards.\nThey often do this when retreating away from flowers.\n5. Dolphins use toxic pufferfish to \u2018get high\u2019.\nDolphins deliberately handle pufferfish causing them to release toxins as a defence mechanism. These toxins can be deadly in high doses, but also have a narcotic effect \u2013 and are a powerful hallucinogenic, which dolphins appear to enjoy.\n\ufeff\nA documentary witnessed them passing around pufferfish in a pod, before floating just underneath the water\u2019s surface, apparently \u2018mesmerised by their own reflections\u2019 afterwards.\n6. The Inland Taipan (also known as, the Western Taipan) is the most venomous snake in the world. A single bite contains enough venom to kill at least 100 fully grown men, and can kill within just 30 minutes, if left untreated.\nThey very rarely ever come in contact with humans, however. Every reliable identification of a snake bite victim from an Inland Taipan have been herpetologists, when handling or studying the snakes. They have all survived, due to successful treatment with antivenom.\n7. The worlds deadliest animal isn\u2019t a shark, bear or tiger, but something far smaller \u2013 the mosquito. According to the World Health Organization, 725,000 people are killed each year from mosquito-borne diseases, such as Malaria, dengue fever and yellow fever.\nThey outnumber every other animal in the world, apart from ants and termites. They can also be found in nearly every part of the world, which all add up in the risk they pose to humans.\n8. There are more than 1.4 billion insects for EACH HUMAN on the planet, according to recent estimates.\nAnts have colonised almost every landmass on Earth. Their population is estimated as 107\u2013108 billion alone, in comparison to approx. 7 billion humans on the planet.\n9. The shortest living animal in the world is the Mayfly. Its entire lifespan is just 24hrs.\nThe Mayfly reproduces and then dies, during that short 24hr period of life. Some species of Mayfly only live for 8-10 hours.\n10. The horned lizard is able to shoot blood from its own eyes, up to a distance of 3 feet away. The rather bizarre and disgusting act is a defensive mechanism to confuse predators.\nTheir blood contains a chemical that is noxious to predators, and this isn\u2019t its only trick \u2013 short-horned lizards are also capable of inflating their bodies up to twice their size to scare anything away.\n\ufeff\ufeff\n11. Roosters prevent themselves from going deaf due to their own loud crowing, by tilting their head backs when they crow, which covers their ear canal completely, serving as a built-in ear-plug.\nA study showed that their crowing averages over 100 decibels, which is roughly the same as running a chainsaw.\n12. Little is known about the elusive Giant squid, however the largest squid ever found measured over 50 feet and weighed nearly a tonne.\nTo put that in perspective, that\u2019s bigger than a bus.\n13. The pangolin is able to roll up into an armour-plated ball, so lions can\u2019t eat them.\nIf only this worked for poachers, who simply pick them up when they roll into a ball.\n\ufeff\n14. Koalas can sleep for up to 22 hours a day.\nKoala need more sleep than most animals, because their diet of eucalyptus leaves contain toxins, are very low in nutrition, and high in fibrous matter \u2013 so they take a large amount of energy to digest!\n15. Swifts spend most of their lives flying in the air, and can fly for almost an entire year, without ever landing.\nA study showed that over a 10-month period, a swift stopped for just 2 hours.\n16. Even after having its head cut off, a cockroach can still live for weeks .\nEven stranger, a cockroach\u2019s head can actually survive by itself for a few hours, too.\n17. A group of parrots is known as a pandemonium.\nAnd the collective noun for porcupines, is a prickle.\n18. Cows poo up to 15 times a day, which can be as much as 115 pounds of manure per day, or approximately 21 tons per year.\nThe large quantities are often put to good use, though \u2013 manure, to fertilizer, to fuel, or biogas to create electricity and heat for developing parts of the world.\n19. Panda\u2019s must eat 25 \u2013 90 pounds (12-38 kg) of bamboo every day to meet their energy needs.\nThis is because bamboo contains very little nutritional value, so they have to eat it in vast quantities to survive. Although the giant panda possess the digestive system of a carnivore, they have evolved to depend almost entirely on bamboo.\n20. A Blue Whales tongue can weigh as much as a car, or a small adult elephant.\nA Blue Whales tongue can weigh approx. 2.7 tonnes, or 6,000 \u2013 8,000 pounds (2,720 \u2013 3,630 kg).\n21. The longest living, verified animal is a Madagascar radiated tortoise, which died at an age of 188 years in May 1965.\nHowever, there might be even older. Adwaita, an Aldabra giant tortoise, died at an estimated age of 255 in March 2006 in Alipore Zoo, Kolkata, India. If verified, it will have been the oldest terrestrial animal in the world.\n22. The fastest land animal on the planet is a cheetah. It can reach speeds of up to 75 mph (120 kph).\nWhile the Peregrine Falcon is the fastest bird, with a diving speed of 242 mph (389 kph). The Black Marlin is the fastest sea animal, and can swim up to 80 mph (130 kph).\n23. Baby elephants suck their trunks for comfort.\nJust like babies and young children suck their thumbs, awwww.\nPhoto courtesy of Darkroomillusions.\n24. The Nile crocodiles jaws can apply 5,000 pounds of pressure per square inch \u2013 the strongest bite of any animal in the world.\nA human\u2019s jaw produces 100 pounds of pressure per square inch in comparison. A crocodiles bite is 10 times more powerful than that of a great white shark\n25. Axolotl are able to regenerate lost limbs and body organs.\nMexican walking fish can regrow the same limb up to 5 times, and even regenerate parts of its brain.\n26. The Giant Pacific Octopus has 3 hearts, 9 brains and blue blood.\nThey are also able to change their colour and texture to camouflage themselves in a blink of an eye.\n27. A flea can jump distances 200 times their body length.\nThey are able to jump 10 inches (25cm) vertically and up to 18 inches (45 cm) horizontally, making them one of the planets best jumpers relative to its size. It\u2019s equal to a human jumping as high as the Empire State Building in New York.\n28. The male seahorse goes through pregnancy and gives birth to babies. They are the only animal on earth where the male carries the baby rather than the female.\nThe male seahorse has a pouch on its stomach in which to carry babies\u2014as many as 2,000 at a time.\n29. Pufferfish can contain a tetrodoxin, a toxin that is up to 1,200 times more deadly than cyanide to humans. There is enough toxin in one pufferfish to kill 30 adult humans, and there is no known antidote.\nAmazingly despite this, some pufferfish meat is considered a delicacy in Japan. The meat called Fugu, is expensive and only prepared by licenced chefs with over 3 years of rigorous training who remove toxic parts of the meat for diners.\n30. The loudest animal relative to size is the Water Boatman, which measures at just 12mm long, but can produce 99 dB of sound by rubbing its genitalia across its abdomen.\nThis is the equivalent noise level of operating a circular saw, or a drill.\n31. The howler monkey is the loudest land animal. Its calls can be heard from 3 miles (5 km) away.\nAt its peak, the howler monkey can produce sounds that reach 140 decibels. That\u2019s as noisy as a jet engine, on take off!\n32. There is an average of 50,000 spiders per acre in green areas.\nThere\u2019s over 45,000 known spider species, with the venom of a few only known to be dangerous to humans.\n33. The aptly named colossal squids eyes are as large as a basketball.\nThis allows them to detect the faint light of a predator from over 400 feet (120 metres).\n34. White-tailed jackrabbits are the greatest land jumpers, having been recorded leaping an astonishing 21ft (6.4m) vertically.\nThat\u2019s higher than 3 average sized men all stood on top of each other. This large species of hare can also run up to 35mph (55kph) when escaping predators.\n35. Grey-headed Albatross can circle the globe in only 46 days.\nThe incredible round-the-world journey covers 14,000 miles over the 46 day period at a steady 13mph. They perform this feat by making various pit-stops along the way.\n36. Giraffes are the tallest land animal in the world, reaching heights of 19ft (5.8 m). The ostrich is the world\u2019s tallest bird. It can grow up to 9 feet (2.7m) tall.\nOver 2 metres (7ft) of a giraffes total size is its famously long neck, which helps it reach leaves in tall trees.\n37. An ostrich legs are so powerful that their kicks can kill a lion.\nOr a human! Each two-toed foot has a long, sharp claw \u2013 making them formidable weapons. Animals often end up running away from the large bird.\n38. The dementor wasp paralyses cockroaches with venom to its head, turning them into a zombie-like state. The toxins leave the cockroach unable to control its own movements, which incredibly makes it run into the wasps nest to meet its demise.\nThe venom is thought to cut brain activity that makes cockroaches sense fear and run away to safety. The dementor wasp will then lay eggs on the cockroach to act as an incubator for its young.\n39. More than half of all pigs in the world are kept by farmers in China.\nThere are over 440 million pigs in China. United States in comparison has a mere 73 million pigs.\n40. Polar bears have jet black skin under their white fur coats.\nIt helps them absorb heat to keep warm, while the white fur helps provides camouflage in the snowy and icy environment they live.\n41. Giant anteaters consume up to 35,000 ants and termites in a single day.\nThey use their long sticky tongues to slurp up hundreds of ants per minute. Interestingly, anteaters purposefully never destroy an ant nest, preferring to leave some ants alive to rebuild, so it can return and feed again in the future.\n42. The little known pangolin is the worlds most poached and trafficked animal.\nThis is due to the high demand of their scales and meat in Asian cultures. 70% of Chinese citizens believe pangolin products have medicinal value, when its been scientifically proven to be false.\n43. Great white sharks can detect a drop of blood in 25 gallons (100 litres) of water and can even sense tiny amounts of blood from 3 miles (5 km) away.\nThey use their acute sense of smell to detect blood using an organ called the \u2018olfactory bulb\u2019.\n44. The Naked Mole-Rat can live in an almost zero oxygen atmosphere.\nIncredibly, in a zero oxygen environment, the Naked Mole-Rat can still survive for up to 20-minutes without suffering any harm at all.\n45. The smell of a skunk is powerful enough for a human to smell it up to 3.5 miles (5.6 km) away.\nThe foul smelling spray from a skunk can also cause skin irritation and even temporary blindness.\n46. The most venonmous fish in the world is the 30cm Stonefish.\nStonefish have 13 sharp fin spines on their back, each with two venom glands. Their stings are extremely painful, can be lethal to humans, and mostly occur as a result of stepping on the creature.\n47. Only 5% of cheetah cubs survive to adulthood.\nA study in the 90\u2019s in the Serengeti found that 95% of cheetah cubs died before reaching adulthood. Many deaths were due to Lions, but also other predators and disease.\n48. A tigers rear legs are so powerful, that they have been found remaining to stand even after death.\nTigers have been witnessed to have been shot, bled out, and died \u2013 and remained standing throughout.\n49. A Rhinoceros\u2018s horns are made of \u2018keratin\u2019, the same type of protein that makes up hair and fingernails.\nSome species of Rhinos have two horns, while others just have a single horn.\n50. The Alpine Swift is able to stay airborne for over 6 months without touching down.\nIt holds the world record for the longest recorded uninterrupted flight by a bird, at over 200 days in the air as it hunted flying insects on its wintering range in the skies over West Africa.\n51. The Edible Dormouse (Glis glis) is able to hibernate the longest \u2013 up to 11-months of the year when food availability is low.\nTo be able to pull of this feat, they double or even triple their body weight before hibernation. During hibernation they are able to reduce their metabolic rate and the animal may stop breathing for periods of up to an hour at a time.\n52. Japanese Macaques play with snowballs for fun.\nThese snow monkeys have been observed rolling up snowballs, then pushing them down hills just for the heck of it. Others gather lumps of snow in a ball and carry them around, proudly sometimes to the envy of other monkeys who try to steal it.\n53. Sperm whales are the world\u2019s largest predator.\nThey can be up to 18m long and weigh up to 53 tonnes. These giant whales dive down to almost 3000m below the surface where they hunt giant squid. Giant squid can be the same size or bigger than sperm whales and will fight viciously with them. Adult whales can be seen with scars on their heads from the beaks of giant squid.\n54. The largest insect to ever live was a \u201cdragonfly\u201d with a wingspan of over 75cm (2 and a half feet) across.\nThey are called Meganeuropsis and were around 247 million years ago. They were proficient predators, with large mandibles that they used to capture fish, amphibians and insects.\n55. Koala\u2019s have fingerprints almost identical to human.\nIt is so hard to distinguish between the fingerprints of koalas and humans that even under a microscope it is hard to tell. There are even reported cases of a koala\u2019s fingerprints confusing forensics at crime scenes.\n56. Greenland sharks are the longest living vertebrates on earth, with one individual thought to be over 400 years old\nGreenland sharks are giant, reaching up to 5m in length, and live in the cold deep waters of the North Atlantic. They are rarely seen, and little is known about them.\n57. The blood \u2018Dracula ant\u2019 has the fastest recorded animal movement when it snaps its mandible.\nThis cannibalistic ant can go from zero to 200mph in 0.000015 seconds when it snaps its mandibles, that\u2019s roughly 5,000 times faster than humans blink. 5 This is the fastest recorded movement in the animal kingdom.\n58. The box jellyfish is considered the most venomous marine species in the world.\nThese cube shaped jellyfish have long tentacles and can be over 3m in length. Their toxin, delivered via stinging cells in their tentacles, is so potent that many die before they can even reach the shore.\n59. The Japanese Spider Crab has the longest leg span of any arthropod.\nFrom the tip of one claw to the other can be as long as almost 4m! Japanese spider crabs have 10 legs stretching out from a central body, giving it its spider like appearance. They live deep in the oceans south of Japan.\n60. Some albatrosses are lesbians.\nAlbatrosses form bonds for life, returning to the same place every year to raise their young. Some of these bonds are between two female albatrosses, with a study finding that in one breeding area 31% of pairs were two females.\n61. Some corvids (crows, rooks, ravens etc,) can understand physics.\nCorvids are highly intelligent. They can use tools, solve puzzles, recognise faces, and even understand physics. Tests show that rooks have the same level of understanding of physics as a 6-month-old baby, which is higher than some apes.\n62. Sheep can recognise faces.\nAs social animals, sheep are capable of recognising familiar and unfamiliar faces. Studies even suggest that they miss other sheep when they are taken away for a long time afterwards.\n63. Tardigrades can survive in space and go without eating for more than 10 years.\nTardigrades are microscopic animals with crazy endurance abilities. They can survive in temperatures as high as 149oC or as low as -272oC and pressures 6 times more intense than the bottom of the ocean. They also look like tiny bears!\n64. Hoatzin\u2019s are the only bird species with a ruminant digestive system, and they smell like cow-dung.\nA ruminant digestive system is one that uses fermentation to digest food, cows being a well- known example of this. It\u2019s this digestive system that gives it it\u2019s lovely cow-dung smell. These birds are found in the amazon and have a dinosaur like appearance to them.\n65. Echidna\u2019s are relatives of duck-billed platypuses and have a beak, spikes, a kangaroo-like pouch, and lays eggs.\nThey are small at just 30\u201345cm and are known as spiny anteaters. One of the few egg-laying mammals, echidna lay a tiny egg which is then transferred into a kangaroo-like pouch where it then hatches.\n66. The desperate leaf chameleon is less than 3cm long.\nOne of the tiniest reptiles in the world, this tiny chameleon is native only to Madagascar. It can change colour to match its environment and lays huge eggs compared to its body size. They are named \u201cdesperate\u201d due to their status as critically endangered.\n67. The Yangtze giant softshell turtle is the biggest freshwater turtle in the world.\nIt weighs between 150 to 220 kilograms (330 to 485 pounds) and is over 100cm (39in) in length. They are found primarily in the area of the Yangtze River in China.\n68. The Mariana snailfish is the deepest fish in the ocean, living up to around 8,000m below the surface.\nThey live down in the deepest trenches of the ocean where they hunt invertebrates, such as crustaceans and shrimp.\n69. Pea Crabs are miniature crabs that spend their whole lives inside oysters, clams, and mussels.\nNames so because it is the size of a pea, this tiny crab relies entirely on its host for food.\n70. The shoebill stork can swallow baby crocodiles whole.\nThese huge birds are over a meter tall (up to 5 feet) and have a wingspan of more than 2 m (almost 8 feet!). Its name comes from its huge beak which is over 20cm long and almost that wide. Along with lungfish, it also eats baby turtles and baby crocodiles whole.\n71. Lungfish are the only fish that have both lungs and gills.\nThis allows them to survive when the water in their ponds/lakes dries up.\n72. Electric eels are in fact not eels, and give a shock strong enough to knock out a horse.\nIn the Tennessee Aquarium an electric eel\u2019s tank has been hooked up to a computer programmed to send out a tweet whenever the eel produces enough electricity.\n73. The yellowhead jawfish incubates its eggs in its mouth.\nThe male gathers up all of the eggs once they\u2019ve been fertilised and stores them in his mouth until they hatch.\n74. The patu digua is thought to be this smallest spider in the world at just 0.37 mm.\nThis Colombian spider is about one fifth the size of the head of a pin.\n75. Vampire bats share blood with their friends.\nVampire bats need to eat blood at least every 48 hours to survive. Bats will share blood after a good meal with another bat that\u2019s fed them in the past.\n76. The U.S. military trained bottlenose dolphins.\nBottlenose dolphins were used in both the Vietnam and the Gulf to detect enemy swimmers trying to plant explosives on ships.\n77. Wojtek the bear was a corporal in the polish military during WWII.\nWojtek was brought by polish shoulders while in Iran. He was made an officer so that he was allowed rations and eventually was promoted to corporal. He helped out by carrying boxes of ammunition.\n78. Horned lizards shoot blood out of their eyes.\nTo scare of predators, this lizard shoots blood out of its eyes.\n79. Cuckoo birds hide their eggs in the nests of other species.\nThe other bird species then raises the cuckoo chick as if it were its own, and the cuckoo mother doesn\u2019t have to do any of the work.\n80. Elephants mourn their dead.\nElephants will return to the place where family members died and stand in silence over the bones, sometimes bowing their heads.\n81. Meerkat parents train their offspring to hunt scorpions.\nThey will bring back dead or almost dead scorpions back to the younger ones so that they can practice killing them without getting stung.\n82. Only 3-5% of mammals are monogamous.\nThe majority of mammals are not monogamous, making humans unusual.\n83. Gorilla\u2019s have been seen dismantling traps set by poachers.\nPoaching is a big problem for gorillas, but young gorillas have learnt how to trap and dismantle snares.\n84. The earliest found depictions of dogs come from 8,000 years ago.\nDogs have been human-kinds best friend for a long time, with a carving in a rock face in Saudi Arabia showing a man hunting with 13 dogs. Two of them even have leads!\n85. Cat\u2019s were domesticated 9,500 years ago in Ancient Egypt.\nThey were worshiped in Ancient Egypt and some historians report that it was illegal to kill a cat.\n86. Emperor penguins are the world\u2019s biggest penguins, and they trek 50\u2013120 km (31\u201375 m) across the Antarctic to reach breeding colonies.\nThese impressive penguins reach 100 cm (39 in) in length and weigh 22 to 45 kg (49 to 99 lb). They breed during winter, when they emerge from their more natural habitat in the ocean to trek long distances over treacherous ice.\n87. Yaks are specially adapted to high altitudes, with a huge lung capacity and small red blood cells.\nNative originally to Tibet, these giant oxen-like animals live at high altitudes in the Himalayas (4,000\u20136,000 metres). They are specifically adapted to the low oxygen levels with a lung capacity that is ~3 times that of normal cattle, and have smaller red blood cells to improve oxygen transport.\n88. Cuvier\u2019s Beaked whales are one of the deepest diving mammals and can collapse their lungs to survive the high pressure.\nOne of the deepest diving mammals, one individual was recorded diving down to 2,992 m (9,816ft) below the surface. The pressure at these depths is so high that in order to survive it they have to collapse their lungs.\n89. Orangutans are the heaviest tree-dwelling animals.\nThere are three species of orangutan and adult males of all three typically weigh around 75kg (165lb) while females are ~37 kg (82 lb). They are ~1.5m(5ft) tall and have a huge arm span of ~2m (6ft). They spend most of their time up in the canopy, making them the heaviest tree-dwelling animal.\n90. Chimpanzees are very intelligent and make all kinds of tools.\nFor example, some use long sticks to fish out termites from their mounds. Others have been recorded creating \u201cspears\u201d to hunt bushbabies!\n91. Shrike\u2019s impale their prey on sticks to save them for later.\nAlso known as \u201cbutcherbirds\u201d they are famous for being fairly brutal songbirds. They catch all kinds of animals, including crickets, lizards, and small birds, and impale them on sticks to save them for later.\n92. Atlantic wolffish are terrifying predators reaching up to 5 feet in length.\nThey have very sharp teeth and a powerful bite, making them powerful predators. Atlantic wolffish use this bite force to crush the hard shells of molluscs and crustaceans.\n93. The wood frog spends 7 months of the year frozen.\nThese Alaskan frogs freeze almost completely at the start of winter, with two-thirds of their body water turning into ice. To all intents and purposes, they seem dead; their heart stops beating, and their blood flow stops. However, once winter starts to thaw so do they and they hop back to life.\n94. Certain animals have anti-freeze proteins that allow them to survive extreme temperatures.\nThese anti-freeze proteins prevent water in the cells of the animals from crystalising and forming ice. Examples of animals with this superpower include the winter flounder and the eelpout.\n95. Honeypot ants swell up to a huge size with food.\nHoneypot ants have to be seen to be believed. During wet season, certain ants consume huge amounts of nectar, making their abdomens swell up to the size of a grape. Then, during dry season, they provide the other ants with food by throwing the nectar back up again. Yum!\n96. The lesula, discovered in 2007, has giant human like eyes and a blue bottom.\nThis relatively newly discovered monkey lives in the Congo. Their eyes are very distinctive because of their human-like appearance, as are their bright blue bums.\n97. The Donald Trump caterpillar looks identical to the ex-president\u2019s hair.\nThis species of caterpillar, prior to 2016, was known as the Flannel Moth Caterpillar (Megalopyge opercularis). It gained popularity as it is very furry and bright orange, giving it an uncanny resemblance to Trump\u2019s hair (wig?). This \u2018fur\u2019 however, is actually composed of multiple venomous \u2018hairs\u2019. Grabbing hold of one of these caterpillars is a painful experience.\n98. Frilled sharks are 2-meter-long living fossils that eat their prey whole.\nFrilled sharks are considered living fossils, meaning they\u2019ve gone unchanged for a long period of time and most of their closest relatives can only be found in the form of fossils. They get their names from their \u201cfrilly\u201d gills and they are predators, which swallow their prey whole.\n99. Giant vampire bats lived 100,000 years ago and had a wingspan of 50cm (20 inches).\nThese giant bats were roughly 30% larger than the modern vampire bats. The remains of one were recently found in a cave in Argentina.\n100. There are an estimated 8.7 million species on earth and more than 80% of them are undiscovered.\nBased on current data, complex statistics, and models we can predict how many species there are on Earth, telling us how many are still left to be found. It will likely take another 500 years to find them all."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "75 Animal Facts That Will Change the Way You View the Animal Kingdom", "url": "https://bestlifeonline.com/animal-facts/", "text": "With an estimated 7.77 million species of animals on the planet, the animal kingdom is an undeniably diverse place. But while the breadth of earthly biodiversity may be well known, the incredible things our animal counterparts can do are often hidden to humans. From furry creatures you never realized kissed to those who enjoy getting tipsy, these amazing animal facts are sure to wow even the biggest animal lovers out there.\n1 Koala fingerprints are so close to humans' that they could taint crime scenes.\nKoalas might not seem to have a lot in common with us, but if you were to take a closer look at their hands, you'd see that they have fingerprints that are just like humans'. In fact, they're so similar when it comes to the distinctive loops and arches, that in Australia, \"police feared that criminal investigations may have been hampered by koala prints,\" according to Ripley's Believe It or Not. Any koalas who want to commit crimes would be wise to do so wearing gloves.\n2 Parrots will selflessly help each other out.\nParrots may be associated with pirates, but it turns out African grey parrots are nothing like the infamously greedy, treasure-seeking criminals. Instead, researchers have discovered that the colorful birds will \"voluntarily help each other obtain food rewards\" and perform \"selfless\" acts, according to a 2020 study published in Current Biology. Study co-author Auguste von Bayern noted, \"African grey parrots were intrinsically motivated to help others, even if the other individual was not their friend, so they behaved very 'prosocially.'\"\n3 Prairie dogs kiss.\nPrairie dogs are quirky creatures for a number of reasons: They're giant rodents, they dig massive interconnected underground homes, and they kiss. While they're actually touching their front teeth in order to identify each other when they seem to be sweetly sharing a smooch, the BBC explains that scientists believe prairie dogs \"'kiss and cuddle' more when they are being watched by zoo visitors,\" because they \"appeared to enjoy the attention.\"\n4 Ghost crabs growl using teeth in their stomachs.\nCrabs may be able to intimidate other creatures with their claws, but if that's not enough, ghost crabs will growl at their enemies like a dog. However, unlike our canine friends, crabs make these fearsome noises using teeth located in their stomachs. \"There are three main teeth\u2014a medial tooth and two lateral teeth\u2014that are essentially elongated, hard (calcified) structures. They are part of the gastric mill apparatus in the stomach, where they rub against each other to grind up food,\" Jennifer Taylor, from the University of California, San Diego, told Newsweek. She and her colleagues were able to nail down the source of the noise after noticing that \"the crabs [were] 'growling' at\" them.\n5 The mantis shrimp has the world's fastest punch.\nYou might think that boxers have the most impressive jabs, hooks, and uppercuts on the planet, but it's the mantis shrimp that boasts the world's fastest punch. Traveling at about 50 mph, when a shrimp punches, its little fist of fury (which, of course, isn't a fist at all) is \"accelerating faster than a .22-caliber bullet,\" according to Science. National Geographic shared the tale of one such small smasher, explaining that \"in April 1998, an aggressive creature named Tyson smashed through the quarter-inch-thick glass wall of his cell. He was soon subdued by nervous attendants and moved to a more secure facility in Great Yarmouth. Unlike his heavyweight namesake [former professional boxer Mike Tyson], Tyson was only four inches long. But scientists have recently found that Tyson, like all his kin, can throw one of the fastest and most powerful punches in nature.\"\n6 Female lions do 90 percent of the hunting.\nWhile male lions attract their fair share of attention thanks to their impressive manes, it's the female lions who do the bulk of the work when it comes to feeding their families. \"Lionesses, not male lions, do the majority of hunting for their pride,\" according to CBS News. \"Lionesses hunt around 90 percent of the time, while the males protect their pride.\"\n7 Narwhal tusks are really an \"inside out\" tooth.\nNarwhals are unlike most other whales because they have what appears to be a giant tusk. But that's not actually a tusk at all\u2014what you're seeing is a tooth. Harvard University's Martin Nweeia told the BBC that the \"tooth is almost like a piece of skin in the sense that it has all these sensory nerve endings,\" adding that it's \"essentially built inside out.\"\n8 The world's oldest known breed of domesticated dog dates back to 329 BC.\nDogs are well known for being man's best friend, and it turns out that's a relationship that goes back longer than you might expect. According to Guinness World Records, the oldest known breed of domesticated dog goes all the way back to 329 BC. \"Saluki dogs were revered in ancient Egypt, being kept as royal pets and being mummified after death,\" they note. \"There are carvings found in Sumer (present-day southern Iraq) which represent a dog, closely resembling a saluki, which date back to 7000 BC.\"\n9 And the oldest evidence of domesticated cats dates back 9,500 years.\nCats have also been hanging around humans for thousands of years. Guinness World Records reports that we've been domesticating cats for 9,500 years. Proof of this came in 2004 when the \"bones of a cat were discovered in the neolithic village of Shillourokambos on Cyprus. The position of the cat in the ground was next to the bones of a human, whose similar state of preservation strongly suggests they were buried together.\"\n10 Puffins use twigs to scratch their bodies.\nPuffins surely have enough to be proud of with their beautiful beaks, but the seabirds also happen to be quite clever. According to a 2019 study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), Atlantic puffins in both Wales and Iceland were observed \"spontaneously using a small wooden stick to scratch their bodies.\" Indeed, in a video shared by Science, a little puffin can be seen picking up a tiny twig before using it to scratch an itchy spot on its belly.\n11 Bottlenose dolphins are even more right-handed than humans.\n\"Most humans (say 70 percent to 95 percent) are right-handed, a minority (say 5 percent to 30 percent) are left-handed,\" according to Scientific American. And the same holds true for bottlenose dolphins. In fact, the savvy swimmers are even more right-handed than we are. A team led by Florida's Dolphin Communication Project took a look at the feeding behavior of bottlenose dolphins and found that the animals were turning to their left side 99.44 percent of the time, which \"actually suggests a right-side bias,\" according to IFL Science. \"It places the dolphin's right side and right eye close to the ocean floor as it hunts.\"\n12 There's a kind of ant that only lives in a small area of Manhattan.\nIf you're ever in the area of \"the Broadway medians at 63rd and 76th streets\" in New York City, keep an eye on the ground for crawling critters and you might spot something rare. That's where the \"ManhattAnt\" can be found, an ant that only lives in the one small area of the city. \"It's a relative of the cornfield ant, and it looks like it's from Europe, but we can't match it up with any of the European species,\" Rob Dunn, a biology professor at North Carolina State University, told the New York Post. Dunn and his team discovered the isolated ant variety in 2012.\n13 Cows painted with zebra-like stripes can avoid being bitten by flies.\nCows have to deal with pesky flies that are beyond annoying for the docile creatures. Luckily, farmers can now protect their animals by painting them with zebra-like stripes. According to a 2019 study published in PLOS One, \"the numbers of biting flies on Japanese Black cows painted with black-and-white stripes were significantly lower than those on non-painted cows and cows painted only with black stripes.\" IFL Science suggests this might work because \"the stripes may cause a kind of motion camouflage targeted at the insects' vision, confusing them much in the way that optical illusions \u2026 confuse us.\"\n14 Capuchin monkeys wash their hands and feet in urine.\nMonkeys are undeniably cute. They can also be pretty darn gross. Capuchin monkeys, for example, urinate on their hands and feet when they're feeling \"randy.\" \"We think the alpha males might use urine-washing to convey warm, fuzzy feelings to females, that their solicitation is working and that there's no need to run away,\" primatologist Kimran Miller told NBC News. \"Or they could be doing it because they're excited.\" Either way, ew!\n15 Sperm whales in the Caribbean have an accent.\nPeople who come from different areas around the world tend to speak with inflections, fluctuations, and patterns that are specific to their home regions. Apparently, the same can be said for whales. Researchers from Dalhousie University in Canada and the University of St. Andrews in the UK have found evidence that seems to show whales in the Caribbean have a different \"accent\" than whales in other oceans.\n16 Some pigs in China are the size of bears.\nIn Nanning, the capital of China's Guangxi province, a man named Pang Cong has a rather remarkable animal living on his farm: a 1,102-pound pig. That's roughly the same size as a full-grown adult male polar bear. According to Bloomberg, massive swine of that size \"can sell for more than 10,000 yuan ($1,399), over three times higher than the average monthly disposable income\" in the area.ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb\n17 Some sharks glow in the dark.\nSharks boast some enviable\u2014and terrifying\u2014features, like their sleek design and razor-sharp teeth. And while glow-in-the-dark sharks sound like something you'd see in a sci-fi film, they're totally real, as noted in a 2019 study published in iScience. Researchers were already aware that some shark species produce a glow that only other sharks can see, but now scientists have discovered that \"previously unknown small-molecule metabolites are the cause of the green glow,\" according to CNN. This glow \"helps sharks identify each other and even fight against infection on a microbial level.\"\n18 Some snails have hairy shells.\nWhile it's not a secret that snails have shells, you probably didn't know that some actually have hairy shells. These hairs are rather handy to have, as they help a snail stick to wet surfaces like leaves.\n19 Cowbirds use secret passwords to teach their young.\nCowbirds lay their eggs in other bird species' nests, which means that the little ones eventually need to reconnect with their own kind when the time is right. And when that time comes, the young birds have a trick for figuring out who to reach out to. \"Juvenile cowbirds readily recognize and affiliate with other cowbirds. That's because they have a secret handshake or password,\" according to Science Daily. To put it more simply, they use \"a specific chatter call\" to beckon each other.\n20 Baby Tasmanian devils make life-long friendships.\nIf you have best friends who have been around since you were a child, then you have something in common with Tasmanian devils. Research has shown that Tasmanian devils form bonds when they're young that last for the rest of their lives. As Zoos Victoria's Marissa Parrott told IFL Science, \"In the wild, when baby devils leave their mums, we believe they all socialize together.\" As the website notes, \"young devils have their own dens,\" \"engage in friendly sleep-overs,\" and when given the chance, they prefer \"to share with their \u2026 original friends.\"\n21 A grizzly bear's bite is strong enough to crush a bowling ball.\nThose who find themselves in the presence of a grizzly bear will surely want to stay out of reach of this animal's super sharp claws. But they'll certainly also want to keep out of the grizzly's mouth, because these creatures \"have a bite-force of over 8,000,000 pascals,\" according to National Geographic. That means grizzly bears can literally crush a bowling ball between their jaws. Yikes!\n22 Humpback whales use bubbles to hunt.\nYou might think that a whale's massive size is the only edge they'd need when it comes to hunting in the open waters. But humpback whales actually team up to use a \"bubble-net\" technique in order to catch their prey. \"Sometimes, the whales will swim in an upward spiral and blow bubbles underwater, creating a circular 'net' of bubbles that makes it harder for fish to escape,\" Science News reports.\n23 A housefly buzzes in an F key.\nWhen you hear a housefly buzzing around your home, you might be annoyed by the persistent sound. However, the next time it happens, try to soothe yourself by noting that the airborne pest is actually buzzing in an F key. How melodious!\n24 Moray eels have a second pair of \"Alien-style\" jaws.\nIf you already thought that eels were kind of creepy, then this fact isn't going to make you feel any better about them. Moray eels have what's called pharyngeal jaws, which are a second pair of \"Alien-style\" jaws that are located in the throat and emerge to grasp prey before pulling the unfortunate meal down into the eel's gullet.\n25 Ducks can surf.\nOver in New Zealand, surfers have noticed the same thing that those who ride the waves in California have witnessed: ducks can surf. The birds do so in order to catch food or simply to move through the water quickly. Sports reporter Francis Malley spotted a female duck and her babies catching a wave and told the New Zealand Herald, \"The mother was surfing on her belly on the whitewash. I've never surfed with ducks before so this was a first.\"\n26 Slow lorises are the only venomous primates.\nThey may be cute, but their bite can kill. According to Popular Science, these adorable animals secrete toxins from a gland in the crook of their inner arms. Their bites have caused anaphylactic shock and even death in humans. Better watch out!\n27 Pigeons can do math.\nYou might think of pigeons as\u2026 not that smart. But it turns out, they're actually quite intelligent. In fact, one 2011 study published in the journal Science found that the birds are capable of doing math at the same level as monkeys. During the study, the pigeons were asked to compare nine images, each containing a different number of objects. The researchers found that the birds were able to rank the images in order of how many objects they contained. Put simply, they learned that the birds could count!\n28 Zebra stripes act as a natural bug repellant.\nCows may benefit from artificial stripes, but zebras have the real deal. One 2012 report published in the Journal of Experimental Biology suggests that zebras' black and white stripes may be an evolutionary feature to fend off harmful horsefly bites. \"A zebra-striped horse model attracts far fewer horseflies than either homogeneous black, brown, grey or white equivalents,\" the researchers wrote.\n29 Wild chimps like to drink.\nHumans aren't the only animals who enjoy a drink or two. A 2015 study published in the journal Royal Society Open Science reveals that chimpanzees in Guinea had a fondness for imbibing fermented palm sap and getting tipsy in the process.\n30 Sea otters are adept at using tools.\nWhile many scientists believe that tool use among dolphins is a relatively new phenomenon, a 2017 study published in Biology Letters suggests that otters may have been using tools for millions of years. Sea otters frequently use rocks to break open well-armored prey, such as snails.\n31 Frogs can freeze without dying.\nWhy tolerate the cold when you could just freeze yourself solid? According to Kenneth Storey, a professor at Carleton University in Ottawa, frogs undergo repeated freeze-thaw cycles. \"We have false springs here all the time where it gets really warm and all the snow melts and then suddenly\u2014bam\u2014the wind comes from the north and it's back down to minus 10, minus 15 [Celsius], and they're fine,\" Storey told National Geographic.\n32 Male horses have way more teeth than their female counterparts.\nMale horses have 40 to 42 permanent teeth, while females have just 36 to 40. According to the VCA Animal Hospital, the original purpose of these extra teeth was as fighting weaponry.\n33 Koalas sleep up to 22 hours a day.\nIf you thought your cat was sleepy, just wait until you hear about koalas. According to the Australian Koala Foundation, these cuties sleep between 18 and 22 hours a day. The koalas' diets require a lot of energy to digest, which is why they've got to nap so much.\n34 A group of ferrets is called a business.\nNo, it's not because they're so professional\u2014it's a modernized form of \"busyness,\" the word originally used to describe a group of these weasel-related mammals.\n35 Octopuses can taste with their arms.\nAnd yes, they are called arms, not tentacles. According to the Library of Congress, the animals can taste and grab with the suckers on their arms. Even more impressive? Octopuses are capable of moving at speeds of up to 25 miles per hour.\n36 Dolphins have names for one another.\nYou already know that dolphins are smart. But did you know that they even have their own names? One 2013 study published in PNAS found that bottlenose dolphins develop specific whistles for one another.\n37 Reindeer eyes turn blue in the winter.\nReindeers have beautiful baby blues\u2014but only in the winter! According to the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, \"the eyes of Arctic reindeer change color through the seasons from gold to blue, adapting to extreme changes of light levels in their environment.\" The change in color impacts how light is reflected through the animals' retina, and improves their vision.\n38 Giraffes have black tongues.\nScientists believe that it's so they don't get sunburns while they eat. The animals' tongues are also around 20 inches long.\n39 Alligators will let manatees swim ahead of them.\nIn busy waters, manatees will nudge alligators to get in front, and alligators generally oblige.\n40 Sloths can take up to a month to completely digest a single leaf.\nEverything about life is slow for these sleepy mammals. Most sloths will only have a bowel movement once a week, and it can take them up to 30 days to completely digest a single leaf. For comparison, it takes the average human 12 to 48 hours to ingest, digest, and eliminate waste from food.\n41 Adult cats only meow at humans.\nYou probably know that cats love to talk to their humans. But did you know you're unlikely to see your feline friend interact the same way with another cat? That's because other than kittens meowing at their mothers, cats don't meow at other cats.\n42 Elephants and humans have similar self-soothing techniques.\nElephant calves will suck their trunks to comfort themselves. The babies do it for the same reason humans do (it mimics the action of suckling their mothers).\n43 Female bats give birth to babies that weigh up to a third of their weight.\nAccording to Bat Conservation International, bats give birth to babies\u2014known as pups\u2014that can weigh as much as one-third of the mother's weight. If that doesn't sound like a lot, imagine a person giving birth to a baby that weighed 40 pounds.\n44 Painted turtles survive winter by breathing through their butts.\nNot all creatures head to warmer climates when it gets cold out, and that means they need to learn to survive in chilly conditions. Painted turtles need to adapt to frozen ponds, which restrict their access to the air above the water. They do that by breathing through their butts\u2014specifically, the all-purpose orifice called the cloaca. Thanks to a process called cloacal respiration, the turtles are able to get oxygen directly from the water around them.\n45 Dogs have way fewer taste buds than humans.\nWhile you may think that Fido has the same dinnertime experience as you do, he's actually got a much different taste bud arrangement. Humans have about 9,000 taste buds, while dogs have only around 1,700. And while they can identify the same four taste sensations as people, dogs are not fond of salt.\n46 Otters have the world's thickest fur.\nThey're thought to have up to one million hairs per square inch. Their fur consists of two layers and is designed to trap a layer of air next to their skin so their skin doesn't get wet.\n47 Alligators can grow for more than 30 years.\nAccording to a 2018 study published in Copeia, alligators often haven't hit their full size until 33.\n48 A group of owls is called a parliament.\nTheir legislative powers, however, are still up for debate.\n49 Snow leopards don't roar.\nSnow leopards have less-developed vocal cords than their fellow large cats, meaning that they can't roar, but make a purr-like sound called a chuff instead. For a 2010 study published in the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, scientists researched why some cats have a higher-pitched meow than others. They found that it's not size that determines a kitty's call, but habitat.\n50 Axolotls can regenerate their parts.\nThe salamanders are the only vertebrates that can replace their skin, limbs, tail, jaws, and spines at any age. On the flip side, humans can regenerate lost limb buds as embryos and fingertips as young children.\n51 A group of rhinos is called a crash.\nIndividual male rhinos are referred to as bulls, and females as cows.\n52 Squirrels will adopt orphans.\nTurns out, squirrels have an intense motherly instinct. One 2010 study by researchers at the University of Guelph found that the animals will take in the orphaned pups of their late family members.\n\"Social animals, including lions and chimpanzees, are often surrounded by relatives, so it's not surprising that a female would adopt an orphaned family member because they have already spent a lot of time together,\" said lead researcher Andrew McAdam, an evolutionary biologist. \"But red squirrels live in complete isolation and are very territorial. The only time they will allow another squirrel on their territory is the one day a year when the females are ready to mate or when they are nursing their pups.\"\n53 Giant anteaters have two-foot tongues.\nAccording to National Geographic, it's the longest tongue of any known mammal.\n54 Cows have best friends.\nCows have stronger social ties than you might think. One 2013 study conducted by researchers at the University of Northampton found that when cows were separated from their BFFs, their heart rates increased as a sign of stress.\n55 Moths experience love at first scent.\nWhen a male moth catches a whiff of a female moth, he'll travel miles to find her\u2060\u2014based off her scent alone. According to the experts at Audobon, \"they don't know what the female sounds like, or even what she looks like. But when they smell her, boy, do they know it, and they use her seductive musk to track her down.\"\n56 Horses have distinct facial expressions.\nHorses can make 17 facial movements, which is 3 more than chimps and only 10 fewer than humans, according to a 2015 study published in PLOS One.\n57 Deer can run up to 35 miles per hour.\nYes, white-tailed deer can hit top speeds of 35 miles per hour. Think that's fast? Reindeer can run up to 50 miles per hour.\n58 An octopus has three hearts.\nOctopuses have two more hearts than you do. Two hearts are used to pump blood to their gills, while the third brings blood to the rest of their body. If that's not enough, they also have nine brains.\n59 Some worms can jump.\nCertain species of the Amynthas worm, which have recently been identified in the Midwestern United States, can jump and detach their tails when disturbed.\n60 Crocodiles can live up to 100.\nNile crocodiles can live for a full century. And they can do a lot of damage over the course of those 100 years: Approximately 200 people die every year from Nile crocodile attacks.\n61 Ravens are masters of deception.\nJust how smart are ravens? A 2002 study published in Animal Behaviour found that these tricky birds have the ability to deceive each other. The entire corvid family\u2014which includes crows, ravens, and jays\u2014is exceptionally intelligent. These birds have also been known to play pranks on one another, and to tease other animals.\n62 Rats laugh.\nWhile scientists don't exactly think they have a sense of humor, rats will make a laugh-like sound when tickled.\n63 Tigers have striped skin.\nYou might think it's just their fur, but no, tigers have striped skin. And speaking of those stripes, much like our fingerprints, they're unique to every tiger.\n64 Cats recognize their own name but choose not to respond.\nSorry, cat owners, you're not just being paranoid: Your pet does know when you're calling their name, and they're ignoring you anyway. In a 2019 study published in Scientific Reports, researchers discovered that while cats can distinguish their own name, they don't necessarily feel obligated to respond.\n65 Cows produce more milk when listening to slow music.\nCall it a moo-d. Researchers at the University of Leicester School of Psychology found that cows produced 1.54 more pints per day\u2014a 3 percent increase\u2014when they were played slow music, as opposed to more upbeat tunes.\n66 Butterflies taste with their feet.\nNot only do butterflies taste using their feet\u2014the receptors on their legs are also 200 times stronger than human taste buds. When a butterfly lands on a plant, they use these sensors to determine whether or not what they're standing on is edible.\n67 The spur-winged goose's diet makes it poisonous.\nDon't plan on eating a spur-winged goose if you happen to come across one during your travels. These birds, natives of sub-Saharan Africa, have flesh that's often poisonous to humans, thanks to their diet of blister beetles, which contain the deadly cantharidin poison.\n68 Vampire bat saliva keeps blood from clotting.\nVampire bats do more than just bite their prey\u2014they also keep the other animal's blood from clotting. Their saliva works as an anticoagulant, so that the blood can flow freely as they feed. Here's another fun fact: The protein in the anticoagulant has been nicknamed \"Draculin.\" Spooky!\n69 Wombat poop is cube-shaped.\nWombats use their droppings to warn other animals to stay off their turf. Luckily, their cube-shaped poop makes it easy to see that a spot is governed by wombats, as the little squares tend to stay put more easily than spherical droppings would.\n70 Giraffes with darker spots are more dominant.\nYou can learn a lot from the color of a giraffe's spots. According to a 2019 study in Animal Behaviour, giraffes with darker spots are more dominant than giraffes with lighter spots. And not only that: Dark-spotted giraffes also tend to be more solitary.\n71 Orcas can learn to speak dolphin.\nGroups of killer whales have their own dialects that are further influenced by the company they keep. A 2014 study published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America revealed that orcas housed with bottlenose dolphins over a long period of time were able to replicate the dolphins' language.\n72 Queen mole rats make other female mole rats infertile.\nTo ensure her dominance, the queen mole rat works to make it impossible for other female mole rats to have litters. In fact, the queen can produce a substance in her urine that renders other female mole rats infertile.\n73 Horned lizards squirt blood from their eyes.\nThe horned lizard has a pretty impressive trick for evading predators. When a horned lizard finds itself in a perilous situation, it can squirt a stream of blood from its eyes. The predator then runs off, because, well, wouldn't you?\n74 Catfish have taught themselves how to kill pigeons.\nRelax, pigeons\u2014it's not all catfish. But yes, in southwestern France, a group of European catfish have learned to kill pigeons, launching themselves out of the water to grab the sunbathing birds.\n75 Primitive crocodiles could gallop.\nIf you think crocodiles aren't frightening enough, consider this: They used to gallop. While modern-day crocodiles can move surprisingly fast, giant crocodiles during the Cretaceous period could use their legs to chase and kill dinosaurs.\nAdditional reporting by Desir\u00e9e O."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe Communication - Giraffe Facts and Information", "url": "https://www.giraffeworlds.com/giraffe-communication/", "text": "Giraffe Communication\nGiraffes and types of Communication\nWhen you ask children what sounds various animals out there make they can often tell you without too much of a hesitation. However if you want to stump them ask what sounds a giraffe makes. Many adults aren\u2019t even sure of this one so it can be a fun way to teach them something new as well.\nGiraffes are mostly quiet animals and the majority of their communication takes place on a non-verbal level. However, they do make some noises that have been observed both in the wild and in captivity by researchers. The vocalization of giraffes becomes more prevalent during the mating season. The males will make what appears to be similar to a human coughing in order to attract the attention of females. When you hear a low but constant roaring bellow whistling sound that is a female communicating with her offspring.\nFor researchers the vocalizations of giraffes are something that still puzzle them in many ways. While they don\u2019t have very many sounds these animals seem to have a system that allows them to effectively communicate with each other on many levels. It is interesting to watch. Most researchers will tell you that a great deal more of observation and learning needs to take place in this area of giraffe research.\nThe non verbal aspects of giraffe communication that are observed including necking. This has has one meaning, when it is two males it is due to a battle to prove who is stronger. There isn\u2019t any evidence to suggest that two females will engage in this particular behavior.\nSometimes giraffes can be observed making low growling or hissing sounds. This is often to indicate that they are in danger or to ward of others. Mothers are extremely protective of their young. They can also hiss to reprimand their young and to get them to stay close so that they are less likely to be an easy target for predators.\nThere is plenty of evidence to indicate that giraffes are much smarter than we have given them credit for in the past. It is believed that they are able to rely upon infrasound. This means that the frequency level that they use is well below what the human ear can pick up. It is believed this is why some animals including the giraffe seem to have early warning signs of imminent danger such as natural disasters.\nThis has put some major holes in the early theory that giraffes are usually silent. It is now thought that they do communicate all the time but that they do so in such low tones that we don\u2019t hear them. Evaluating them though with infrasound is very time consuming and expensive though. Many of the studies used for this record 24 hour periods of time of the giraffe. Then they can review the tapes and use technology to get those sounds that they didn\u2019t hear themselves picked up from the recording.\nIt is also interesting to note that while giraffes don\u2019t sleep more than a couple of hours a day. As you can see there is still plenty that needs to be evaluated to fully understand the communication process for these animals.\nReferences\nhttp://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Giraffa_camelopardalis/#communication\nBaotic, A.; Sicks, F.; Stoeger, A.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe Reproduction - Giraffe Facts and Information", "url": "https://www.giraffeworlds.com/giraffe-reproduction/", "text": "Giraffe Reproduction\nGiraffes are mammals which go through a reproduction process similar to other animals of the same class but with some characteristics particular to the species.\nMales are ready to mate when they are about seven years of age. However, having access to an available female usually requires a neck to neck fight with other bulls to earn the right to mate so not many can breed at such early age. Females are ready to mate when they are about four years of age. To find which of them are willing to mate, the males smell their urine.\nReproduction might be the key to the unique appearance and the long neck of giraffes because, through \u201cnecking\u201d or battles made with their necks, they determine the strongest male, and the right to mate with a female, which is the most successful bull reproducing.\nThere is no particular period for the breeding; it can occur in any month of the year. The males emit a strong body odor and smell the urine of the females to know their reproductive status. They show their availability with physical contacts between their front legs and the female\u2019s hind legs. The courting rituals of giraffes involve the chin resting of the male on the back of the female.\nAlthough giraffes do not have a mating season, it is more common during the rainy season because they are less stressed out and there is plenty of food to consume. When food supplies are very low, and they struggle to survive are less likely to breed. In captivity, they mate throughout the year as they do not have shortages of food or water.\nThe interval between births is almost two years. Mothers usually move away from the rest of the herd to have their offspring. They return to the same area where they had previous births, and once the little giraffe is born, it stays with the mother to protect it from predators.\nThe arrival of the giraffes to the world is not the most gentle. After a gestation period ranging from 425 to 465 days, that is approximately 15 months, calves born falling to the ground from almost two meters height from the mother who remains standing up during the birth. However, they do not suffer any hurt, and in a matter of at most 20 minutes, they can walk. The thick sac protecting the calf prevents it from being harmed during the birth process.\nCases of twin births are very rare; The most common is the arrival of a single calf. At birth, they weigh about 150-220 pounds and are approximately 6 feet tall, which they can double in the first year. They begin to drink milk from the moment when they can stand on four legs and stay on their feet.\nIn the wild, the newborns are a threat to the entire herd as they will attract more predators to the group than normal, which is probably the reason why mothers separate from the group to deliver their offspring.\nCalves depend on the mother\u2019s milk for nine to twelve months and begin testing solid foods slowly at about four months of age, at the time they start to ruminate. At the age of four, males have fully developed their horns, but females complete their development until the age of seven.\nThe first few months of birth are difficult for giraffe calves, as they are very vulnerable to being trapped by predators. Hyenas, lions, wild dogs and leopards target the weakest and young animals like the little giraffes.\nAlthough they learn to walk within a couple of hours, they get tired very fast, and that makes them vulnerable to predators. For about two weeks the young calves will rest as much as they can while protected by their mothers. Regardless this care, only about 25% of young giraffes make it to adulthood because of predators.\nMothers are very protective and defend their little ones by throwing powerful kicks, but when they have to get food, leave the calf on the ground a few meters from her. Although the vegetation and the color of their skin is an excellent camouflage for giraffes, there are always dangerous predators lurking around.\nOnce the mother joins the herd again, some members take care of the young while others are looking for food. Most females are already pregnant again while taking care of an offspring, so they spend most of their lives caring for calves. When a calf dies, a mother is deeply disturbed and has been seen trying to move its lifeless body to revive it.\nThe females reach sexual maturity at an age earlier than males. The former at 4 to 5 years old, while the latter at 7 to 8 years old.\nIn captivity, giraffes can live a little longer than in the wild, as some individuals have reached the age of 40 years. Females live 25% more than males.\nOdd behaviors\nA giraffe mother is very concerned and devoted to its offspring, but in the wild, some have left their calves in the vegetation at the expense of the predators; This is a strange and uncommon behavior not regular of the species.\nIn zoos, they also exhibit unusual behaviors, such as attacks on their offspring, accidental blows, and neglect to care for them.\nReferences\nAnne Innis Dagg.

Keep reading to find out more about the giraffe's sleeping habits.\nGiraffe characteristics\nThe giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is a quadruped mammal known for height, with its long legs and characteristically long neck. In fact, it is the tallest living animal in the world. Here are some of the most important facts about giraffes: Habitat : Giraffes are native to the African continent, where they inhabit areas with abundant grass, or savannas and hot plains like the Serengeti. They are herbivorous animals, and feed on leaves that they strip from the tops of trees.

Behavior : Giraffes are sociable animals, and they usually travel in groups of varying size to protect themselves from predators.\n: Giraffes are sociable animals, and they usually travel in groups of varying size to protect themselves from predators. Predators: The giraffe's main predators are lions, leopards, hyenas and crocodiles. However, giraffes have a powerful kick, so predators tend to be cautious when attacking them. Humans also present a threat to their survival, as giraffes are often victims of poaching for their skin, meat and tail. Unfortunately, poaching and habitat loss have led to giraffe numbers dropping by 40% in the last three decades and they are categorized as a vulnerable species in the IUCN Red List.\nTypes of giraffes\nGiraffa camelopardalis is the only species of giraffe that exists. There are 8 recognized subspecies, though they are physically very similar to each other. All of the subspecies are native to the African continent. Rothschild's giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi)\nWest African Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis peralta)\nMasai Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi)\nReticulated Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis reticulata)\nKordofan Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis antiquorum)\nAngolan Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis angolensis)\nThornicroft's Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis thornicrofti)\nNubian Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis camelopardalis) Of these, the Rothschild's and West African subspecies of giraffe are classified as endangered in the IUCN Red List.\nHow long do giraffes sleep?\nBefore talking about how giraffes sleep, we need to understand how much time they spend sleeping. Like most other animals, giraffes need to rest to recover energy and develop normally. However, not all animals share the same sleeping habits. Each species has evolved to sleep in the most productive and least risky way possible. Giraffes are among the animals that sleep the least, not only because they spend very little time sleeping but also because of their inability to achieve deep sleep. In total, they rest for only about 1-2 hours a day, but not all at once. These two hours are usually spread out throughout the day in the form of 2 to 10 minute naps. Adult giraffes in the wild sleep as little as half an hour a day. Baby giraffes need to sleep more than adults, and usually spend longer continuous stretches of time sleeping. Why do giraffes sleep so little? In the wild, giraffes cannot sleep for long stretches of time because they live in open savannas. Sleeping makes them vulnerable to predators. Although they are fast runners, it takes them a while stand up, given their long legs and body structure. So short naps, rather than a long night's sleep, can help them avoid predators better. Young giraffes in the wild can sleep for longer stretches, because the adults keep a look out and protect them from predators. In captivity, giraffes need to be less alert and therefore tend to sleep more - sometimes up to 4.5 hours, and usually at night. Another theory suggests that giraffes don't sleep much because of their eating habits, and the fact that they spend a lot of their day ruminating. This involves regurgitating food and and chewing it again, which takes up a large part of their day, and for which they have to remain standing up. In fact, rumination is associated with a relaxed state. A giraffes can doze off, squeezing in short naps, while still chewing. If you are curious about the sleeping habits of other animals check out these articles: Are there animals that don't sleep?\n15 animals that sleep a lot\nHow do giraffes sleep?\nWe've discussed the characteristics of giraffes, the different subspecies that exist and their sleeping habits. Now, for the big question: how exactly do giraffes sleep? Because of their unusual body structure, giraffes have developed unique postures for sleeping and resting. Do giraffes sleep standing up or sitting down? Giraffes usually sleep in short naps, and adults generally sleep standing up. This way, they can react quickly in case of danger. Lying down makes it harder for them to run away or kick a predator, increasing their chances of falling prey to to an attack. When a giraffe sleep standing up, its neck usually relaxes and and its head may tilt forward. This posture is associated with light sleep in giraffes. Giraffes can also sleep sitting down, in what is called a recumbent posture. They first sit down with their legs folded under their bodies. When sleeping, a giraffe either sits with its head tilted forward, or with its neck bent backwards and head resting on its back, hindquarters or the ground. This swan-like sleeping posture is most common among young giraffes and is associated with deeper sleep. Adult giraffes may occasionally sleep in this posture as well, though only for very short periods of time. Sleeping standing up is not exclusive to giraffes. Other species that run similar risks of being attacked, or are also ruminants, share this habit. Donkeys, cows, sheep and horses are some examples. In this article, for example, we explain how horses sleep.\nIf you want to read similar articles to Do Giraffes Sleep Standing Up?, we recommend you visit our Facts about the animal kingdom category.\nReferences\n1.

It is a subspecies of the giraffe family and is native to East Africa. At present, the primary threat to these \u2018vulnerable\u2019 giraffes is habitat loss resulting from the increasing human population.\nScientific Classification Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Artiodactyla Family: Giraffidae Genus: Giraffa Species: G. camelopardalis tippelskirchii Scientific Name: Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchii\nPhysical Description\nSize: The males can be up to up to 19 ft tall, while the females can reach up to 16 ft.\nWeight: The males can attain a maximum weight of 4,250 lb and the females, 2,600 lb.\nFur/hair/coat: They can be distinguished from other giraffes by the star-like reddish-brown blotched patterns on their body that look like oak leaves.\nEyes: Each of their eyes is the size of a golf ball.\nMasai Giraffe Masai Giraffe\nTail: The tail is of a medium length that extends almost up to the thighs with a tuft of black hairs at the tip.\nHorns: Both the sexes have two hair-covered horns called \u2018ossicones\u2019.\nSexual Dimorphism: Unlike the females, the males usually possess a median lump.\nLifespan\nMasai giraffes can live up to 10 to 15 years in the wild and between 20 and 27 years in captivity (like in the zoo).\nDistribution & Habitat\nQuite like the reticulated giraffe and other giraffe species, the Masai giraffes are also limited to the continent of Africa, specifically to the savanna regions in the central and southern parts of Kenya, as also in Tanzania.\nBehavior\nThe Masai Giraffes live in herds relatively smaller than other giraffes. The individuals, especially the females, are quite tolerant of each other. Male Masai giraffes can show aggression only when it comes to mating or group leadership. However, during other times they rarely interact, but can make strong bonds with each other.\nThese animals are not really territorial in the real sense of the term since they do not tend to protect their territories on a regular basis unless other herds of giraffes intrude inside their home territory that can expand over 50 miles.\nThese mammals spend most of the time feeding and grazing which can last anything between 16 and 20 hours per day. When it comes to feeding, the males consume the top branches of the trees, unlike their female counterparts that feed on the lower ones. The mouths of these animals are relatively smaller than the size of their body. Hence, while chewing with their blue or black tongue, they take in small portions of food every time before ingesting them slowly.\nThey need only 5 to 30 minutes of sleep in a single day, while still standing, with short naps in the middle that last for 1 to 2 minutes. Though, at times, they rest lying down with their head and long neck folded on the rump. Though these animals cannot call, they can hiss, whistle, roar, and moo."}

It is a species in the cat family \u2018Felidae\u2019, which includes Tigers, Leopards and Jaguars.\nThey inhabit the grasslands and savannahs in Sub-Saharan Africa, and there is a critically endangered population in a small section of India.\nLion Facts Overview\nHabitat: Savannas, Grasslands, Scrub, Open Woodlands Location: sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Central African Republic & South Sudan Lifespan: 10 \u2013 15 Years Size: 4.6 \u2013 8.2 ft (1.4 to 2.5 m) Weight: 265 \u2013 550 pounds (120 \u2013 250 kg) Color: Tawny Brown, & White (A Rare Morph) Diet: Zebras, Giraffes, Wild Pigs, Cape Buffalo, Antelope, Wildebeests Predators: Hyenas, Leopards (When Cubs) Top Speed: 80 Kph (50 Mph) No. of Species:\n1 Conservation Status:\nVulnerable\nThe lion is visibly different from most other cats in that they have a muscular, deep chest with a short but rounded head. The neck is reduced and they have rounded ears plus a hairy tuft at the end of their tails. The male is easy to distinguish from the female, as they have a prominent mane.\nLions are diurnal, which means they typically hunt during the day, but they can adapt and hunt at night if necessary.\nThe lion has few predators, although man is reducing the habitat they require on a regular basis, which has put the lion on the vulnerable list of the IUCN. This means that their natural habitat is shrinking along with their numbers. They are slowly moving into the territory identified as endangered.\nInteresting Lion Facts\n1. African lions live in groups called \u2018prides\u2019.\nThe African lion is actually the most social of all big cats on the planet. A pride can include up to 30 animals, but typically are made up of 10-15, with five or six females, their cubs (both male and female) and two males who breed with the females in the group.\n2. Young male lions get kicked out of the pride by older males when they reach sexual maturity, at about 2 years old.\nThese young males then live and roam in small groups (often with brothers and cousins), until they find another pride that they could take over and breed with females. This will often lead to fights with existing males in the pride.\n3. When a male lion takes over a pride, it can kill all the lion cubs to bring the pride\u2019s females into heat again.\nThis allows the new males to breed and raise their own offspring.\n4. A male lions mane is a symbol of their fighting ability and health to both potential mates, and rivals.\nExperiments showed that darker and longer manes are attracted more females, and male lions were more likely to attack blonder, and shorter manes.\n5. Lionesses can turn on and kill older previously dominant males in a pride.\nMale lions become a member of the pride because the females accept them as the pride male. Therefore, their social status can can be precarious. The lion has to win the grace of the females and usually will only be able to remain the pride male 3 to 5 years in the wild.\n6. Lions have a roar that can carry up to 8km (5 miles).\nThe roar of a lion can be heard as far away as 5 miles from the source.\n7. Lions run up to speeds of 80 Kph (50 Mph).\nWhile not quite as rapid as the Cheetah which can reach speeds of 70mph, a lion can achieve a land speed of 50 Mph for short distances.\n8. They have an amazing jump, and have been recorded springing as far as 36 feet.\nThey can also climb extemely well, capable of climbing vertical trunks of trees with ease.\n9. There is also a very rare white lion.\nIt is not a different sub-species or albino, the white is due to a genetic condition called leucism, which causes a partial loss of pigmentation.\n10. Lions can live twice as long in captivity.\nIn the wild, the average life span for a lion is between 10 and 14 years. They can live up to 20 and 25 years in captivity.\n11. The lion diet is primarily meat.\nAfrican lions hunt and consume large animals they find in the grasslands they inhabit. These animals include zebras, wildebeest and antelopes. The male lion requires 7-kilograms of food daily and the female can survive on 5-kilos.\n12. Lionesses do much of the hunting.\nThe majority of the hunting in a group of lions is handled by the females. They will actually use intelligent hunting tactics and work as a group to trap and capture prey they would otherwise not be able to get while hunting on their own. They also use this \u2018team approach\u2019 to other activities within the pride.\n13. Lions are pretty good at chilling out.\nActually, the average lion will spend between 16 and 20 hours a day just resting or sleeping. It\u2019s because they do not have many sweat glands so in order to conserve energy, lions will just lie about and watch the world unfold around them. They are more active at night when it is cooler although they do conduct most of their hunting activity during the day.\n14. They have amazing vision.\nThe eyes of the lion are six times more sensitive to light than the eyes of a human. This means their night vision is far better than that of some of their prey.\n15. Lions mate early in their lives.\nThe age is the same for both male and female. Either is ready to mate when they reach the age of 3 to 4 years.\n16. There is a rather short gestation period for lions.\nIt takes about four months before a young lion is born.\n17. The birth process is kept secret.\nFor some reason, the pregnant lioness will give birth to a cub away from the rest of the pride. Then she will proceed to hide the young from everyone else for the following six weeks.\n18. Lion cubs are very small at birth.\nA newborn will weigh not much more than 3-pounds at birth and will be completely dependent on its mother for the first several months of its life.\n19. Lionesses are pretty awesome mothers.\nNot only are they caring towards their own young, if a cub is neglected in any way, a lioness will allow it to suckle in an effort to help the cub survive.\n20. Cubs are raised together in a pride.\nThe females in a group of lions typically give birth at about the same time. This allows for the cubs to play and grow up together with support from the entire pride.\n21. Maturing cubs have different roles.\nThe female cubs will stay with the pride as they grow older. At the age of two they will be hunters for the pride. At that same age, the males are pushed out of the pride.\n22. You can tell the age of male lions by the colour of their mane.\nThe mane of the male lion gets darker as it ages so the darker mane of a lion in a pride denotes the oldest of the group.\n23. Lions walk in an unusual manner.\nTheir heels do not touch the ground when a lion walks. This is because they have big toes and pads on the bottom of their feet, which allow them to move quietly.\n24. The lion population has dropped considerably in the past few decades.\nIn the 1950\u2019s there were an estimated 50,000 lions in Africa. Today there are around 21,000.\n25. Lions are symbolic in various cultures.\nThe lion generally stands for strength and courage and as such, are usually symbols commonly used in association with royalty. It is probably because of this that the phrase \u201cKing of the Jungle\u201d came into being.\n26. Lions have a very, very long history on the planet.\nAncient Egyptians held lions in high esteem as their war deities because of the power, strength and fierceness lions possess. The sphinxes in Egypt are a fine example of the age old depiction of lions in Egyptian culture. The lion head also appears in many pieces of art from ancient times as well in pieces of jewelry.\nLion Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification\nKingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Carnivora Suborder: Feliformia Family: Felidae Subfamily: Pantherinae Genus:\nPanthera Species Name:\nPanthera Leo\nRelated \u2018Big Cat\u2019 Facts"}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe Research - Giraffe Facts and Information", "url": "https://www.giraffeworlds.com/giraffe-research/", "text": "Giraffe Research\nRelationship with okapis and deer\nMuch has been questioned about the relationship between giraffes and okapis and why of their distinct anatomical differences when both belong to the same family, especially those related to neck size and coat color. A recent research done in 2016 revealed that the common ancestor between giraffes and okapis lived about 11.5 million years ago.\nGiraffes are also related to the Cervidae family regarding their skin. Also, the members of the family Antilocapridae (of which the pronghorn currently survive) are said to be closely related to the Giraffoidea superfamily. Animals that we see so different today had an evolutionary past fascinating more related to each other than we believe.\nThe controversy over their species and subspecies\nSince Carl Linnaeus first classified giraffes in 1758 under a single species, other authors joined the task of research to find differences between members of the genus Giraffa. From then to date, its taxonomy has been modified several times when reclassifying species and subspecies.\nThe taxonomy of the giraffes has been a bit changing over time. First, a single species with eleven subspecies was recognized, although the scientific community only accepted nine subspecies eventually. However, research on these mammals continued for over a century, and there are still doubts about the distinction of each species and its genetic variation across its range of distribution.\nIn 2016, a group of scientists took DNA samples of wild populations of all types of giraffes and for the first time, the subspecies Giraffa camelopardalis camelopardalis, better known as Nubian giraffe, was included in the genetic analysis.\nThe results identified four separate and monophyletic species, meaning that all individuals evolved from a common ancestral species. Therefore, under this criterion of genetic isolation, four distinct species of giraffes should be recognized.\nSuch modifications and new discoveries show the genetic complexity that this fauna involves, sometimes overlooked by the research on its conservation efforts, which has become a central and urgent theme in to fight the many threats that giraffes face all over the African continent.\nIn short, modern scientists considered for many years, all the giraffes as a unique species called Giraffa camelopardalis. But this has become a topic of debate because researchers from three countries published the results obtained from DNA analysis, where the whole previous panorama was modified, arriving at a very different conclusion from what is already known by all.\nThe four species identified according to the new 2016 classification are:\nFrom Giraffa camelopardalis three subspecies were recognized:\n\u2013 G. c. Camelopardalis (Nubian giraffe and the Ecotype Rothschild\u2019s)\n\u2013 G. c. Antiquorum (Kordofan giraffe)\n\u2013 G. c. Peralta (West African giraffe)\nAnd Giraffa giraffa has two subspecies:\nG. g. Giraffa (South African giraffe)\nG. g. Angolensis (Angolan giraffe)\nThe other two species do not have subspecies.\nGenetic analysis is being used more and more to understand the populations and the evolution of the species. When different populations reproduce between them, a genetic flow occurs that helps to maintain similar genetic code, and therefore, is enough to continue the same species. However, when these different populations do not breed for long periods of time, they become genetically isolated and may diverge into new species with distinctive characteristics that come to light, forcing a resetting of the Taxonomic order.\nThis analysis also explained that the genetic evidence of giraffes suggests that the divergence of the four species occurred more than one million years ago, at a time when populations separated.\nAfter this, some scientists say that the species and subspecies should be treated differently and for reasons of biodiversity they should not be mixed or considered as part of a unique species only because they are anatomically similar. Some species have more ossicones, different colors, shapes of spots, and even different heights than others.\nNew results on giraffes continue emerging, which means that this recent analysis will not always be entirely definitive. The classification on this fauna will continue, and most likely, the documentation and scientific books must always be updated.\nThis issue is paramount regarding conservation because considering giraffes as a single species, they would not be in a critical conservation status, but considering four species, the perspective changes radically, since some populations may be at significant risk of disappearing or could be undergoing a silent extinction. A population of 100,000 giraffes is estimated throughout Africa, representing a 40% decrease in the wild.\nStill unanswered questions\nWhile genetic research has changed the taxonomy perspective completely, there are still many unanswered questions.\nThere is a debate about how intelligent giraffes are. While you can\u2019t train giraffes to do tricks or other things they seem to have a good sense of information that goes well beyond their instinct. However, some argue that these animals don\u2019t know much except how to eat and how to survive. More research has to be done to prove these theories.\nOne particular element of giraffe research that needs a great deal more of information is their communication as they don\u2019t make many vocalized sounds. While researchers have recognized the meanings behind many of their sounds, there are other that have to be understood, and if proved it indicates a higher level of intelligence than most thought.\nOne study in Africa brought to light some interesting information about giraffes. From time to time large numbers of them die off, and that is a concern. Now there is evidence that it is a parasite that is in the water they drink, which cause them to become sick and die.\nReferences\nhttps://books.google.ch/books?hl=en&lr=&id=v3uZtA1ZpTAC&oi=fnd&pg=PP2&dq=ungulate+taxonomy&ots=4RudAv6pT7&sig=nLwYrCMfY-3u6uJkWE19cJv8-bs#v=onepage&q=giraffidae&f=false\nhttps://giraffeconservation.org/ Category / research /\nhttp: //www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822 (16) 30787-4? _returnURL = http% 3A% 2F% 2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com% 2Fretrieve% 2Fpii% 2FS0960982216307874% 3Fshowall% 3Dtrue\nhttp: //www.iucnredlist.org/details/9194/0http: //ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe Facts", "url": "https://giraffeconservation.org/facts/how-much-do-giraffe-eat-in-a-day-what-does-their-diet-consist-of/", "text": "Giraffe are predominantly browsers and mainly eat leaves and buds on trees and shrubs. They will also eat herbs, climbers and vines, and prefer flowers and fruit when in season. The proportion of grass in their diet is very low. Vachellia or Senegalia (formerly Acacia) leaves and shoots form the bulk of a giraffe\u2019s diet in most areas.\nGiraffe use their extremely dexterous and long tongue as well as the ridged roof of their mouth to help feed on a variety of leaves and shoots \u2013 all dependent on the plants defences!\nEvidence shows that giraffe adapt their diet to the food species available in the specific region they live in, as well as adapting intake depending on seasons and plant growth stage; for example in some parts of Southern and Eastern Africa, giraffe often feed on deciduous trees, shrubs and vines during the wet season, and on evergreen species, near streams and rivers, during the dry season.\nMales are capable of feeding on vegetation at higher levels than females, although both can stretch their head and neck near vertical to access preferred forage. Scientists have found that the diet of adult females is nutritionally richer than that of males who consume significantly higher proportions of fibre and lignin. Giraffe appear sensitive to their own nutritional needs. For example, in Niger nursing females seem to avoid high levels of tannins in leaves even though it means giving up higher quality forage.\nRegardless of their size, giraffe are not as destructive as elephant when feeding, indeed one researcher in the Serengeti, Tanzania, demonstrated that when giraffe are not too numerous, their impact can actually stimulate shoot production in plant species, which soon declined when the browsing stimulus was withdrawn. There are, however, also some natural plant protection methods at work which ensure over-browsing does not happen. For example carnivorous ants that are symbiotic with some plant species reduce the amount of time that giraffe can spend browsing on any one plant.\nOn a positive mutual note, giraffe can actively benefit some of their food sources. Seed consumption by giraffe favours seed dispersal into non-shaded habitats and enhances the potential for seed germination through the beneficial effects of its digestive processes. Giraffe are also thought to play a role in pollination.\nFeeding takes up most of a giraffe\u2019s day \u2013 up to 75% at certain times of the year. Time spent browsing often increases markedly during the dry season compared with the wet season as good quality browsing is harder to find and giraffe often have to travel further to satisfy their nutritional needs. Giraffe are also active at night, but it is believed that they feed significantly more during moonlit nights and ruminate more during dark nights."}

They have very keen vision and hearing. They have 7 neck vertebrae, and oversized lungs compensate for the volume of dead air in the trachea. The giraffe heart is 2 feet long and thickly muscled. Blood pressure is 260/160, which is two or three times higher than a human\u2019s. Their prehensile tongues are 18 to 22 inches long, and protruding hairy lips protect against thorns. Young giraffes are prey to lions, leopards, cheetahs, crocodiles, and hyenas. Lions will occasionally attack adults, and they are most vulnerable to attack when drinking because of the awkward stance they must use to lower theirs heads to the ground. However, a giraffe can kill a predator with a single blow from its hooves. Giraffes can run 30 to 35 miles per hour and can jump over obstacles five to nine feet high."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Interesting Facts About Giraffes | African Budget Safaris", "url": "https://www.africanbudgetsafaris.com/blog/facts-about-giraffes/", "text": "The Giraffe\nThe giraffe, tallest land animal in the world, is under threat. The IUCN has recently upgraded this majestic giant from \u2018least concern\u2019 to \u2018vulnerable\u2019. While the giraffe is common within park borders, and you are likely to see giraffe on most safaris, populations have been in steady decline. In the past 30 years giraffe numbers have dropped by nearly 40%. Giraffes have been a part of our history and culture for centuries and below you will find a compendium of interesting and little known giraffenalia.\nGiraffe running by John Hilliard\nA few Giraffe facts\nThe giraffe is the world\u2019s tallest animal. It exploits the very exclusive ecological niche of tall trees on the open planes of the savannah. To this effect it has prehensile lips and a very long and tough tongue (over 50cm!) both adaptations for stripping tiny leaves from their unpleasant and thorny branches. Giraffes need over 35kgs of food a day. Because they only eat tiny leaves, this means that they spend most of their time eating. It therefore follows that they only need between 6 and 30 minutes of sleep per day!\nBecause of their unusual shape, giraffes have a highly-specialized cardiovascular system. It starts with an enormous heart that weighs up to 11 kilograms and reaches over 60cm long. Additionally, the jugular veins contain a series of one-way valves that prevent excess blood flow to the brain when the giraffe lowers its head to drink. Because of this, scientists have examined giraffes and applied what they have learnt to zero gravity environments and the design of spacesuits.\nGiraffes Hate Cyclists\nCamelopardus or what\u2019s in a name?\nThe first known giraffe came to Europe via Alexandria in 46BC. It is believed to have been a gift from Cleopatra to Julius Caesar. Caesar, on his triumphant return to Rome after years of civil war, exhibited the animal to the public. Interestingly enough, the scientific name of the giraffe, Camelopardalis, comes from the Greeks and Romans who believed the animal to be an unnatural hybrid of a camel and a leopard.\nGiraffe of the Seven Seas\nBetween 1405 and 1433 when the Chinese were first sailing the seven seas, a giraffe made the journey from Africa to China as a tribute for the then emperor Yongle. The curiosity was well received. The Chinese believed the giraffe to be the flesh incarnation of the mythical qilin, or chinese unicorn - half dragon half horse. Records indicate that this was not an isolated event and that numerous animals made this journey during the Ming period.\nChinese giraffe by Qilin brings Serenity Ode by Emperor Yongle\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u0083\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0083\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u0082\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0083\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u0083\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0082\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u0082\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0083\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u0083\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0083\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u0082\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0082&At\nGiraffe in the sky\nThere is a group of stars called \u2018camelopardalis\u2019 or in laymen\u2019s speak, the giraffe constellation. It is a large and faint group of stars that appears in the northern sky and was introduced in 1612 by Petrus Plancius a Flemish astronomer of the time.\nGiraffes and Fine Art\nThe great surrealist Salvidor Dali took the giraffe as a symbol of masculinity. In his famous painting \u201cThe Burning Giraffe\u201d 1937, the giraffe is meant to be a \u201cmasculine cosmic apocalyptic monster\u201d. I will just leave that there.\nSalvador dali the burning giraffe by Salvidor Dali\nGiraffes in Stand-up Comedy\nBritish comedian Eddie Izzard seems to be particularly taken with giraffes. In his 1997 video release, Glorious, he dramatizes what \u201cevil giraffes\u201d may be like. The youtube video has over 1.5 million views.\nThis is not his only giraffe skit however. He returns again to giraffes in 2008 as part of his stand-up comedy tour, Stripped. Here he elaborates on the fact that giraffes are silent beings that do not have a distinctive call.\nIn fact, it is not that giraffes do not make a noise but rather that no one has ever heard a giraffe. This is due to their noises falling outside of the human range of hearing.\nExtreme Preservation\nIn London, the Huntarian Museum can be found on the grounds of the Royal College of Surgeons. The museum holds a bizarre collection of bits of animals and humans alike. It is macabre but also fascinating. My favourite item in the whole museum, carefully preserved in formaldehyde, is a giraffe\u2019s eyelid.\nItem RCSHM/E 34.3 is headed: \u201cEyelid, Mounted wet tissue\u201d and is followed by the description \u201cSkin from around the eye of a giraffe\u201d. This is exactly, in scientific terms, what is in the jar. What it does not describe, even in preserved form, is the length of the eyelashes and the incongruity of this sample even existing in damp and rainy London.\nHuntarian museum by Greg holland\nAnd Finally a little bit of Weird\nBeing the tallest animals in the world has to come with a little bit of just plain weird. To start with, Giraffes take part in a behaviour called osteophagia. This is literally \u201cfeeding on bone\u201d. The reason is not however as nefarious as I had hoped. It\u2019s natures version of a calcium supplement and such a humdrum affair that giraffes have been known to fall asleep mid chew!\nLastly, the mating ritual of giraffes involves the practice of necking where male giraffes bash one another to determine who has the mating rights. Impressive though this is what is more astonishing is what happens after this show of bravado. The male giraffe will test the females fertility by tasting her urine.\nMother and baby giraffe by Chris Parker\nGiraffes\nGiraffes are awesome. So awesome that they get their very own day on the 21 June every year.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe - Zoo Boise", "url": "https://zooboise.org/animals/vulnerable/", "text": "Giraffes are somewhat social and may form loose herds of up to 50 individuals that may be spread out over large distances. Herds can be composed of any combination of males, females, young, and adults. There is no leader, and little coordination among individuals. The composition of individuals changes constantly, even within a 24 hour period.\nGiraffes are often seen foraging with other species, such as zebras, antelope, and ostriches. Giraffes may act as sentinels for other animals due to their height and ability to see danger from far away. Oxpecker birds climb all over giraffes, picking off ticks and other parasites. Piapiacs and cattle egrets take advantage of insects that are stirred up in the wake of a walking giraffe. Every step a giraffe takes is 15 feet long, and their footprints are 12 inches long and 9 inches wide.\nThe giraffe has one of the shortest sleep requirements of any mammal, which is between 10 minutes and two hours in a 24-hour period, averaging 1.9 hours per day. They sleep standing up, occasionally resting their head on a branch. However, giraffes will sometimes sit down on top of their folded legs.\nPredator defenses for adult giraffes include: large size, good vision, fast running, and powerful kicking. Calves are more vulnerable, and their primary defense is camouflage. They also grow quickly, doubling in size, during their first few years, making them less vulnerable to predation.\nBoth male and female giraffes have horns, called \u201cossicones\u201d, which are different from the horns found on other hoofed mammals. Most horns project from the frontal bones of the skull, but giraffe horns start as cartilaginous bumps which grow and ossify (become bony) starting at the tip, eventually fusing to the cranium over the sutures between the frontal and parietal bones.\nGiraffe horns are paired, short, unbranched, permanent bony processes that are covered with skin and hair. Males have larger horns that end with hairless knobs. Horns on females and juveniles have straight ends that are tufted with hair. Horns are present at birth and fully developed at age 4.5 in males and age 7 in females. In both males and females, the forehead area can become more heavily ossified forming an additional knob in front of the main horns. The knob on the male may develop into what looks like a third horn, and bony grown may continue all over the front of the skull becoming much more dense than that of females.\nMales use horns and heavily ossified skulls during aggressive encounters with one another. They spar with each other by standing side by side and swinging their necks to thump their heads into the other male\u2019s body like a club. These fights can be quite gentle, or quite fierce, sometimes resulting in knocked-out giraffes. Once dominance has been established, the two combatants often coexist peacefully.\nEach time a giraffe picks up its neck it picks up 550 pounds. Because of its long neck, one would expect blood to rush to the brain of a giraffe when it lowers its head to drink, or to drain away from the brain when the head is lifted back up. Either scenario could cause the animal to faint, so giraffes have special adaptations to prevent this from happening. A giraffe has a large, strong heart (24 in. long and 25 lbs.) that produces twice the blood pressure seen in humans. The heart can pump 16-20 gallons of blood per minute against gravity when the head is erect. The neck vessels are equipped with numerous one-way valves that prevent blood from back flowing to the brain when the head is lowered, and muscle fibers surrounding the veins slow the flow of blood when the head is raised again.\nHistorically, giraffes were thought to be mute. However, they do possess vocal chords and recent research shows that they can make a variety of sounds. Although normally quiet, the following types of vocalizations have been reported: alarm snorts, bleating by calves, bellows by females looking for their young, raucous coughing by males during courtship, moaning, snoring, hissing, and flutelike sounds. Giraffes may also communicate using infrasound (low-frequency sounds below the range of human hearing)."}

Your head is not as close to the sky as that of this amazing animal, and your contact with the ground and its underground riches passes through two short limbs rather than four long legs. But as the giraffe knows, like all other living species, you are a path where all these energies cross.\nIn other words, the giraffe reminds you that your body and your spirit communicate and influence one another. Are you aiming for height of thought and spirituality? Or do you prefer maintaining your body\u2019s vivacity as well as its correct functioning? Whatever your way of expression may be, intellectual, physical, or spiritual, the giraffe speaks to you: it suggests to you both momentum towards the top, and terrestrial pleasures.\nThe Giraffe And Learning To Trust Your Intuition\nThe giraffe can awaken the need in us to search for a \u201csixth sense\u201d or intuition, and to activate this as it will be very useful to us in life.\nWithin yourself, you have a supplementary sense to the five senses used to connect you to the surroundings: hearing, touch, smell, taste. But you are not always conscious of this sixth sense, or you may not have used it yet, when involved with getting to know the people and the events that life places on your path.\nYour giraffe animal guide, with its kind, big eyes guide you on the path of clairvoyance. Inspired by its power, you will be able to see the true personality of people you meet. You will intuitively understand the mechanisms in place that lead to a future event.\nThe giraffe spirit animal speaks to you of the utility of your sixth sense, or third eye. Because just like this animal, which thanks to its long neck places its sight above the landscape and sees everything that can come into its life early, you have within you the ability to perceive everything that is not normally visible.\nWhat Does Dreaming Of A Giraffe Mean?\nThe giraffe can slide into our nights or provoke daydreams if we have a strong link with the animal\u2019s energy.\nA giraffe with a very long neck. This dream speaks of clairvoyance. You dream that like Alice in Wonderland your neck is long and flexible. You feel great happiness to turn around in all directions and you suddenly understand the significance of problems that until now were obscure. Your giraffe teaches you the benefits of the gift of double vision through this dream. The giraffe comes to speak to you through dreams of the pleasure of travel and discovery. The giraffe invites you to be curious and to open your spirit to the entire universe.\nThe giraffe which analyses everything. Or how the giraffe teaches you the right method to manage your private life. Through this dream, your giraffe invites you to realize the necessity to see all facets of a family or relationship problem, or all angles of a professional project. You will be happy thanks to your forward-looking ability and admired for your way of resolving difficult situations.\nThe giraffe\u2019s tongue, symbol of active communication. A giraffe\u2019s tongue measures approximately 50 centimeters long, it wraps it around leaves on trees to pick them. This giraffe pushes you to communicate, to exchange verbally, to get out the words that you keep inside you. You will feel a deep relief and your psychological pains will disappear."}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Reticulated Giraffe | The Maryland Zoo", "url": "https://www.marylandzoo.org/animal/reticulated-giraffe/", "text": "Overview\n\u201cWhere I live\u201d\nGiraffes live in eastern, central and southern Africa. They range across savannah, grasslands, and open woods in search of trees \u2013 especially their favorite, acacias \u2013 to feed upon.\nThe Maryland Zoo has several reticulated giraffes, one of nine recognized subspecies of giraffe.\n\u201cHow I live there\u201d\nGiraffes travel in loose, informal herds and are not territorial. They roam freely in search of food. For the most part, life in a giraffe herd is calm. Bulls will spar to establish dominance but then will continue to graze side by side. The dominant male feels no need to drive other males from the herd.\nGiraffes spend most of their time feeding. Their extraordinary height allows them to browse on leaves that other grazing herbivores can\u2019t reach. Giraffes curl their long, black tongues around leaves or new shoots in the upper branches of trees and pull them into their mouths. They prefer the thorny acacia tree to any other plant. They also browse on leaves closer to the ground and may also eat fruit and even soil that is rich in minerals. A giraffe can eat well over 100 pounds of food per day.\nGiraffes can go several days without water but must eventually drink to satisfy their thirst. Adults are most vulnerable when drinking because of the awkward stance they must take: legs spread wide and head lowered to the ground.\nLike many large land mammals, giraffes doze more than sleep. Deep sleep is brief (and dangerous, because of vulnerability to predators). While young giraffes lie down periodically throughout the day, adults rarely do. They rest while standing; they may lie down after dark, but only briefly.\n\u201cMaking my mark\u201d\nWhen giraffes stand together on open land, they are hard to miss. They make an impression. That being said, they do not significantly alter the environment in a way that affects other animals, despite their size and constant need to feed. They graze mainly on the highest leaves and branches, leaving those lower down for other animals.\n\u201cWhat eats me\u201d\nLions, leopards, hyenas and wild dogs may try to prey on giraffes but it\u2019s no easy task. Despite their gentle tendencies, adult giraffes are formidable foes and can inflict serious injury on any predator, including lions, with blows from their front hooves. According to data for giraffes of the Serengeti, the mortality rate for adults is very low \u2013 around 3% \u2014 while for more vulnerable baby giraffes, aged six months or less, the mortality rate is almost 50%.\nRaising Young\nAfter a gestation period of 15 months, a female giraffe gives birth usually to a single offspring. Twins are extremely rare. When born, a baby giraffe drops about six feet to the ground \u2013 a rude awakening by any standards! The newborn attempts to stand within a few minutes but may need to keep trying for an hour or more. Once standing, a newborn giraffe immediately starts walking and seeks out its mother. It will begin to eat solid food in just a few weeks but will continue to nurse for 15 to 17 months. To survive, baby giraffes require the protection of their herd.\nConservation\nA species-wide assessment of giraffes has resulted in a \u201cvulnerable\u201d listing by the IUCN, the world\u2019s leading conservation organization, with the caveat that \u201cpopulations of giraffes are scattered and fragmented, with different growth trajectories and threats.\u201d Currently, of the nine subspecies, four are increasing, four are decreasing, and one is stable. Reticulated giraffes are one of the subspecies suffering population decline. Giraffes are threatened primarily by habitat loss and degradation and illegal hunting and poaching."}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe Feeding - Giraffe Facts and Information", "url": "https://www.giraffeworlds.com/giraffe-feeding/", "text": "Giraffe Feeding\nNot all African wildlife is carnivorous and is born to hunt. Large animals that live on this continent feed on nutrients such as vegetation. Elephants, rhinos, and giraffes have an impressive size, and all of them have a diet based on plants.\nGiraffes are part of those animals that do not need protein from the meat to survive.\nWhat do Giraffes Eat?\nGiraffes are avid eaters when food is plentiful. They prefer to consume what is in the trees including twigs and leaves but also consume a variety of fruits that seasonally grow in the trees. What they eat depends on the time of year and where they inhabit.\nThe elongated neck of giraffes helps them to reach the leaves of tall trees up to 5 meters height, which no other animal can, except for the elephants and with the aid of their trunk; This is a great advantage for giraffes, as they do not compete for food with other animals.\nWhat do Giraffes Eat?\nReticulated giraffe eating leaves\nGiraffes don\u2019t have to consume as much foliage as other animals that graze and feed on such a diet because they get the part of the plants that holds the essential nutrients since they can reach high into the trees. They will only feed on the ground when that is scarce although the young will feed on the grass though due to their size. However, they get plenty of nutrients from the milk of their mothers.\nTheir favorite food is the acacia, a genus of trees and shrubs that are common in their environment, but also they also consume herbs, fruits, seeds and leaves of more than 100 types of plants, depending on the season. When they are under stress, they eat the bark of the branches.\nWhile giraffes are not predators, it has been observed some of them licking bone remains of dead animals and chewing the dry bones for their high calcium content.\nIn Africa, there is a rainy season which allows giraffes to feed on fruits, leaves, twigs, and water but there is also a drought season when they will try to forage for all that they can, mainly acacia trees and bushes. During this rainy months they eat deciduous plants, and during the dry season, the evergreen plants are more consumed. They eat between 34 and 75 kg of vegetation every day.\nThe shrubs and trees of African acacias are thorny, but with the help of their tongue, they manage to hold the leaves without hurting, since such prehensile muscle of about 45 cm long has small papillae as well as the mouth, which helps Cushion the sharp elements of trees and shrubs. Similarly, its sticky, thick saliva covers the spines that could swallow, so that they are not in danger of damaging any internal organs of their body.\nThey are ruminant animals because they have a stomach with four parts that performs a digestive process in a different way than other mammals. The eating process for giraffes is peculiar. They start chewing the food for a few moments and then swallow it. Next, they regurgitate that food into their mouths to chew it a second time. They may do this process before they move on to consume another food; this is a lengthy process which takes giraffes a lot of time feeding each day.\nDuring the rainy season, they get plenty of water from the leaves they consume, but in dry times they drink up to 38 liters of the vital liquid every three days. Drinking water for giraffes is a challenge; Youngs may not have much trouble bending and reaching the water, but adult giraffes require to separate their forelegs wide almost creating a 90-degree angle between both legs so that they can drink, keeping the rear legs in a position just flexed a bit to maintain the balance. It seems that they are about to break, but this part of the body of the giraffes is particularly robust and resistant.\nHowever, this position is very dangerous for giraffes because they are vulnerable and easier to attack, an opportunity that predators usually do not let pass. Crocodiles hiding underwater come out surprisingly, preventing the giraffe from taking back its position and flee, and on land, its neck is at ground level, an occasion that the lurking \u201cbig cats\u201d see as an excellent opportunity to attack. That is why giraffes watch around them before they crouch down to drink and take turns watching each other.\nThey have an internal structure that prevents too much blood from rushing to their head when they are feeding on the ground or drinking water.\nGiraffes are common in zoos, to feed them, the personnel supply the acacia leaves and put them in artificial trees or high structures so that they can eat in the usual way. They also feed on carrots and hay.\nReferences\nhttp://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Giraffa_camelopardalis/#food_habits\nD. S. Mills, Jeremy N. Marchant-Forde.

Their tail can grow to be 8 feet (2.4 metres) long, including the tuft on the end.\nGiraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humans\u2014about 6 feet (1.8 meters). These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles (56 kilometers) an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles (16 kilometers) an hour over longer distances.\nTypically, these fascinating animals roam the open grasslands in small groups of about half a dozen.\nBulls sometimes battle one another by butting their long necks and heads. Such contests aren't usually dangerous and end when one animal submits and walks away.\nGiraffes use their height to good advantage and browse on leaves and buds in treetops that few other animals can reach (acacias are a favorite). Even the giraffe's tongue is long! The 21-inch (53-centimeter) tongue helps them pluck tasty morsels from branches. Giraffes eat most of the time and, like cows, regurgitate food and chew it as cud. A giraffe eats hundreds of pounds of leaves each week and must travel miles to find enough food.\nThe giraffe's height also helps it to keep a sharp lookout for predators across the wide expanse of the African savanna.\nThe giraffe's stature can be a disadvantage as well\u2014it is difficult and dangerous for a giraffe to drink at a water hole. To do so they must spread their legs and bend down in an awkward position that makes them vulnerable to predators like Africa's big cats. Giraffes only need to drink once every several days; they get most of their water from the luscious plants they eat.\nFemale giraffes give birth standing up. Their young endure a rather rude welcome into the world by falling more than 5 feet (1.5 meters) to the ground at birth.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffes Facts and Gifts - HubPages", "url": "https://discover.hubpages.com/animals/the-best-giraffe-gifts", "text": "Gorgeous giraffe at Taronga Zoo in Syndey Image belongs to author\nWith their long, graceful necks and beautiful patterning, giraffes are one of the most unique and majestic animals on the planet. They are also very peaceful animals, which only adds to their appeal. It's certainly not difficult to see why giraffes are one of the most popular animals.\nPersonally, I've always loved giraffes. They're incredibly cute and actually quite friendly. Whenever I've seen them in zoos, they always lean down and try to get a closer look at us, just like we're trying to watch them. There was even one that tried to lean right through our car window as we stopped to take a look. Of course, I'm sure wild giraffes are happier to ignore their human neighbors, but they still live in harmony with us.\nPeople have always been fascinated by this remarkable animal. They are a part of many local African cultures and are a favorite among people in all areas of the world. They're at the top of many people's list of animals they want to see live, especially in the wild. In fact, I've never met anyone who doesn't want to see a giraffe.\nThere's an endless array of unique giraffe gifts out there. I've hunted for what I think are the best options, from the very small to the very large. Along the way, you'll learn some interesting facts and be treated to some cute photographs and videos.\nPhoto is from Public Domain\nA Remarkable Animal\nThe giraffe is an incredibly fascinating animal. Not only is it the tallest mammal on Earth (5.2 meters for males), it has the longest tail of any mammal. Including the tuft, their tail can reach 8 feet. At about 6 feet, their legs alone are taller than most humans. An adult male typically weighs about 1600 kg. This is more than many cars that are on the road today.\nTheir necks are 1.5-1.8 meters long. Average human height falls within this range. Despite this incredible length, they actually have the same number of vertebrae in their necks as humans do. This gives them an incredible range of motion.\nEven their heart is two feet long, the height of a child. Their heart pressure is higher than any other mammal; this means they cannot run quickly for very long. However, when they do need to run, they can reach speeds of 31-37 miles per hour. They can gallop comfortably at 10 miles per hour for longer periods of time.\nGiraffes aren't typically aggressive, even with each other. When the males fight, the battle usually only lasts a few minutes and ends when one gives in and leaves. This is called \"necking\" and they are rarely hurt during it. Giraffes are generally communal animals, roaming through the grasslands of Africa in small groups.\nThey require very little sleep. They spend just ten minutes to two hours each day sleeping, less than almost any other mammal on Earth.\nThey're too cute not to watch!\nIf you're looking for a daily dose of cuteness, you need to watch this video. You'll get up close and personal with a baby giraffe as he follows the camera.\nMore Giraffe Facts\nDid you know that every giraffe's spots are unique, just like human fingerprints? They may look the same when we're not paying attention, but as soon as you look closely, you can see just how distinct each animal's patterning is from each other. Giraffes from the same area will look similar to each other, but still maintain subtle differences.\nA giraffe's horns are called \"ossicones.\" Both males and females have ossicones and the males will sometimes use them when fighting.\nThey rarely lie down. Occasionally, they will fold their legs under them and lie down for a while, but they generally spend their lives standing. They even give birth and sleep while standing up. When they do lie down, they will sometimes munch on low lying vegetation.\n\"Giraffa\" translates to \"one who walks swiftly.\" Each step a giraffe takes is 15 feet long!\nIn the wild, they live to about twenty-five years. In captivity, they may live up to thirty years.\nIt used to be thought that they are silent, but we now know they make a wide variety of sounds. They bellow, hiss, and snort. They also makes noises that are too low for humans to hear.\nHabitat\nGiraffes live in the wild only in Africa. They cover the central, eastern, and southern parts of the continent. They prefer wide open spaces, since it's easier for them to move through these areas with their tall necks. Therefore, they typically live in the grasslands, savannahs, and open plains of the continent. However, they will also live in wooded areas when they need to.\nThey are currently under threat by humans as we continue to cut back their natural habitat. They typically need anywhere from 8 to 50 square miles to roam, but as humans continue to encroach, giraffes are finding it increasingly difficult to find this space. They are happy to overlap their territory with another herd, but this only works up to a point before food runs out.\nPhoto is from Public Domain\nDiet\nThey love to munch\nGiraffes eat a variety of leaves and twigs, but they especially love the acacia leaf. They eat up to 75 pounds of food a day, mainly consisting of this delicious leaf. They are able to get most of their required water from the acacia leaf, and therefore only need to drink every few days.\nTheir long neck allows it to easily reach higher leaves that other animals can't get, which is certainly an advantage in the wild since they don't need to compete as heavily for food. However, even with this advantage, they spend a great deal of their time eating and need to travel great distances in order to find enough food. Their long tongues also help them as they feast. They will actually regurgitate some of their food, just like cows, and chew it again.\nTheir height is a disadvantage when trying to drink water, though. They have to bend in a rather awkward position in order to reach the water, which leaves them vulnerable to predators. However, travelling in groups can help decrease this risk, and their height allows them to check their surroundings carefully before taking a drink.\nCute Baby Giraffe Videos\nBabies are always adorable, no matter what they're doing. What could be cuter than a \"tiny\" baby giraffe having trouble holding it's long neck up? If you don't believe me, check out this video of a baby giraffe at his cutest. It's so cute, you'll definitely have to watch it more than once. Just don't blame me if you want to run out and find one to adopt for a pet!\nBaby Giraffes\nBecause all babies are cute!\nBaby giraffes have a bit of a difficult time at birth; it's another instance where a giraffe's height isn't always a good thing. Because female giraffes give birth standing up, their babies must drop 5 feet to the ground when they are born. However, this fall doesn't seem to phase the babies. Within a half an hour they are able to stand up and they can run alongside their mothers after 10 hours.\nMany females will return to the same spot where they were born to give birth, but this does not always happen. Giraffes don't have a normal time of year for breeding. Their gestation period is about 15 months and there is often synchronization between mothers so that there is safety in numbers. This helps to protect both mothers and newborns against predators. Mothers often form \"nursery groups\" where one mother will watch several babies while the other mothers go in search of food. Babies are raised solely by the females.\nJust like humans, they usually have only one baby at a time. Twins have happened, but are not common. Calves grow quickly and typically double their height in their first year of life.\nPrehistoric Roots\nThe giraffe's ancestors date back millions of years and used to cover much of Eurasia. The oldest members were actually much smaller than today, reaching the height of a deer. Identifying the various fossils as belonging to the Giraffidae family has actually been quite difficult and at various points some of these fossils were incorrectly thought to be similar to elephants or antelopes. Prehistoric species varied greatly, ranging from larger boned animals to more slender boned animals.\nToday, only two species still exist: our modern giraffe and the okapi. The okapi looks distinctly different from a giraffe and is much smaller, but is actually it's closest living relative. They also live in Africa, but only in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nThis content is accurate and true to the best of the author\u2019s knowledge and is not meant to substitute for formal and individualized advice from a qualified professional.\nCynthia Sylvestermouse from United States on July 07, 2014:\nI absolutely love giraffes!

This file is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported license.\nThe Southern Giraffe is an ungulate mammal of the order Artiodactyla and the family Giraffidae. It was described initially and named with the binomial Camelopardalis giraffa by the German naturalist and zoologist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1784. Shortly after that, in 1785, the Dutch physician and naturalist Pieter Boddaert gave the name Giraffa giraffa to this species. Although other researchers tried to assign different scientific names, finally this one became the official.\nThe southern giraffe has two subspecies:\n\u2013 Angolan giraffe (G. g. Angolensis)\n\u2013 South African giraffe (G. g. Giraffa).\nAnatomy\nIn general, southern giraffes have dark patches, rounded and irregular in a reddish-brown color. Unlike other species that have a faded color in their legs, this giraffe keeps the spots all over the limbs, although they become smaller as they get closer to the feet.\nThe Angolan giraffe subspecies has large brown spots with an angular shape that reach down to the legs. At the top, they do not reach the forehead. It has a white patch in the ear that can serve as a distinctive feature among both subspecies.\nThey have a small but pronounced hump on the back by the end of the mane and a neck formed by seven vertebrae, approximately 8-10 inches each. They also have the peculiar and strange horns called ossicones, which are in part some of the sexual dimorphism characteristics of each gender as those of females are smaller and with more hair than those of males.\nHabitat and distribution\nThe Angolan subspecies also known as Namibian giraffe inhabits in the north of Namibia, the southwest of Zambia, as well as in Botswana and western Zimbabwe. Despite its name, it is extinct of Angola. The latest census of 2016 estimated a population of 17,551 individuals in the wild (Fennessy, J.).\nThe South African subspecies inhabits the north of South Africa, southwestern Namibia, and Zambia, southern Botswana and Zimbabwe. Due to their disappearance of several places by the illegal hunting, the conservation groups reintroduced some individuals in several locations at the south of the African continent like Swaziland, and there are efforts of reintroduction in Mozambique. According to the 2016 census, there are approximately 21,287 South African giraffes from South Africa (Deacon et al. 2016).\nThere are some protected areas where both species live protected, but also outside them, the danger increases as they are at the reach of poachers.\nIts habitat is made up of savannas, bushes, and forests with varieties of vegetation. Botswana is a semi-arid country with hot summers that has average temperatures of 26 degrees Celsius and during the dry season winds last from April to October in the south and only during November in the north.\nZimbabwe, another of the places with significant numbers of southern giraffes, presents many variations between its warm and arid climate. The rainy season is from late October to March and droughts are recurrent.\nFeeding\nAs herbivorous animals, they feed on leaves, flowers, fruits and shoots of woody plants. Among the flowers and shrubs that exist in their natural habitat is common to find hibiscus, different types of lilies and Dombeya, but giraffes prefer acacia, a very broad genus of thorny trees and shrubs that grow abundantly in Africa and Australia. Besides the implicit nutrition, the leaves of this genus of plants provide them with large amounts of water, which is why they can spend a lot of time without drinking.\nThey dedicate much of their day to feeding since they chew slowly and must cover with their saliva the large spines of the acacias to avoid any damage in their organism.\nIn captivity, fresh leaves of acacia, hay, starch, carrots and cookies with high fiber contents are usually their food. Like all species, the southern giraffes are also ruminants and have a stomach with four chambers or compartments that aid in the process of regurgitation and digestion.\nReproduction\nThe males have to fight to establish domination, and the winners have greater reproductive success than the rest. Their confrontations are neck to neck battles called \u201cnecking\u201d where they decide who will earn the right to mate. They measure the sexual receptivity of females by smelling and testing their urine, which determines who would be a better sexual partner.\nThe young are about 1.70 meters at birth and walk within a few hours of knowing their new habitat. Mothers are very protective of their offspring and maintain strong bonds generally until the next birth.\nFemales mature at four years on average, while males do so at the age of five, although they do not have the opportunity to mate until they are seven years old, which is when they have the strength and size to fight with other peers and have access to a female.\nThreats\nThe natural threats of the southern giraffes are the carnivores around that represent a danger not only to them but also to all the different types of herbivores of Africa. Among these are the leopards, hyenas and wild dogs of South Africa. The latter two can knock down adults when they attack as a coordinated herd.\nCrocodiles usually hide in muddy waters to surprisingly attack when giraffes are inclined to drink water. In such a position, its neck is almost at the level of the ground, which facilitates its capture and drag, especially with the young and offspring.\nSome authors, do not consider the southern giraffe a threatened species because of the increase of its population thanks to the conservation efforts, but for others, the numbers are still under the expectations and encourage to keep the work before considering them out of danger.\nAs in all other species and subspecies, illegal hunting and the destruction of their habitat are the main causes of the population reduction. Sites such as the Etosha National Park in Namibia are home to Angolan giraffes besides other endangered animals, which contributes to preservation issues, but not all parks and reserves have the same surveillance. Huge extensions of land can hardly be guarded 24 hours a day, especially because of the high costs of air and ground transport, which benefits poachers who live off these illicit activities.\nReferences\nLesson, R.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "ADW: Giraffidae: INFORMATION - Animal Diversity Web", "url": "https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Giraffidae/", "text": "This family includes only two living species, the giraffe and the okapi. These two very different animals are restricted to subSaharan Africa.\nGiraffids are large (okapis) to huge (giraffes); weights range from around 250 kg to over 1500 kg. They have long and narrow heads, thin lips, and long, seemingly prehensile tongues. Okapis lack, however, the extraordinary long neck and legs of giraffes. Both species have long, narrow, fully unguligrade feet that lack lateral digits. Third and fourth metapodials fuse to form cannon bones. The tarsals of giraffes consist of only four bones: calcaneum, astragulus, fused navicular and cuboid, fused cuneiforms. Okapi tarsals are even more specialized, consisting of just three bones.\nGiraffids have short horns that project from the parietals and frontals. These are unique among mammals, consisting of bony cores ( ossicones) covered by furred skin.\nIn addition to having unusual horns, giraffid skulls lack sagittal crests, and they may have rough, thickened areas near the junction of the nasals and frontals which in some populations develops into a third horn. A postorbital bar is present. The mandibles are very long and slender. The skull of the giraffe contains extensive pneumatized areas and is remarkably light for its size. These pneumatized areas are much less well developed in the okapi.\nThe cheekteeth of giraffids are selenodont and brachydont. Upper incisors and canines are absent. The lower incisors and incisor-like canines are separated from the cheek teeth by a very long diastema. The dental formula is 0/3, 0/1, 3/3, 3/3 = 32.\nGiraffids have a complex four-chambered, ruminating stomach.\nOkapis and giraffes are very different in their ecology and behavior. Okapis inhabit the deep forests of central Africa. They are solitary animals with relatively small home ranges. Their diet includes mostly browse, but they also graze on grasses. Giraffes are gregarious, living in herds of up to 25 animals, which occupy large home ranges usually in relatively open savannahs. Their eyesight is excellent (in contrast to that of okapis). They are exclusively browsers, using their long necks to reach into the crowns of trees to feed.\nGiraffids first appeared in the fossil record in the early Miocene.\nTechnical characters:\nReferences and literature cited:\nFeldhamer, G.

Keen eyesight along with the giraffe\u2019s long neck and height give it an advantage when it comes to keeping ahead of predators. It can see for long distances and spot lions slinking through the grasslands.\nHowever, the giraffe\u2019s long neck does make it difficult to drink from ponds and puddles. In order for it to drink, it must splay its legs far enough apart for its head to reach the ground. The giraffe has adapted for this difficulty by drinking from dew and getting much of its water from the food it eats. It can also go for long periods of time without water.

However, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s senior domestic policy adviser, Lachlan Stuart, responded angrily on Twitter over what he felt it also meant about gay people. \u201cIt is a ludicrous, offensive, homophobic claim,\u201d Stuart said, insisting instead that the same-sex physical contact observed between giraffes in the wild is \u201cnot gay behaviour\u201d at all, but a display of dominance.\nAccording to Stephanie Fennessy, director of the Giraffe Conservation Foundation in Namibia, Stuart is right. \u201cWhile I totally agree with Dawn Butler\u2019s comment that we should accept people for who they are, she is incorrect in her comment that giraffes are gay,\u201d Fennessy says. \u201cSometimes they fake-hump each other, which is also dominance behaviour. Dogs do that as well. And when you see them necking, it\u2019s fighting. It\u2019s vicious. They can kill each other.\u201d\nDr Natalie Cooper, a researcher in life sciences at the Natural History Museum, sees things slightly differently. According to her understanding of giraffe research, same-sex necking, licking, nuzzling and mounting is not always an aggressive act. Indeed, it may not be aggressive at all, and sometimes includes genital stimulation. It is common among males, but has been seen among females too. \u201cAt the moment, I don\u2019t think we have enough research to know why the males do it,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cThere are usually females around, so it\u2019s not just because there are no females.\u201d\nEven so, it is probably a mistake to call any giraffes \u201cgay\u201d. \u201cGiraffes don\u2019t have a sexual orientation,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cThat\u2019s a human thing.\u201d In any case, whatever their same-sex predilections, all giraffes have heterosexual sex as well, or at least they try to. Nor do they form couples of any kind. Adult females live together in herds, and only mate with the transient males who manage to be dominant enough, or surreptitious enough, to visit them at the right time. Afterwards, the male leaves, and takes no role in rearing any offspring. If most giraffes have any \u201ctrue, authentic selves\u201d, in short, they would be bisexual, aromantic. And, as fathers, they set a very bad example."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "ADW: Giraffa camelopardalis: INFORMATION", "url": "https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Giraffa_camelopardalis/", "text": "Geographic Range Giraffa camelopardalis is native to Africa, mainly found south of the Sahara to eastern Transvaal, Natal, and northern Botswana. Giraffes have disappeared from most of western Africa, except a residual population in Niger. They have been reintroduced in South Africa to game reserves. (\"Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia\", 2003) Biogeographic Regions\nethiopian native\nHabitat Giraffes inhabits arid, dry land. They seek out areas enriched with Acacia growth. Giraffes are found in savannas, grasslands, or open woodlands. Because they only occasionally drink, giraffes can be found away from a water source. Male giraffes can venture into denser wooded areas in search of more foliage. (\"Walker's Mammals of the World\", 1999) Habitat Regions\ntropical\nterrestrial Terrestrial Biomes\nsavanna or grassland\nscrub forest\nPhysical Description Giraffa camelopardalis is the world\u2019s tallest mammal. Male giraffes (bulls) stand a total of 5.7 m from the ground to their horns: 3.3 m at the shoulders with a long neck of 2.4 m. Female giraffes (cows) are 0.7 to 1 m shorter than bulls. Bulls weigh up to 1,930 kg, while cows can weigh up to 1,180 kg. At birth, giraffe calves are 2 m tall from the ground to the shoulders. Newborn giraffes weigh 50 to 55 kg. Both male and female giraffes have a spotted coat. The pattern of the coat varies and is an aide for camouflage with the different habitats. The nine giraffe subspecies have various skin patterns. The patches on a giraffe coat can be small, medium, or large in size. Giraffe coats are sharp-edged or fuzzy-edged; small, medium, or large; or yellow to black in color. The skin pattern for an individual giraffe is constant throughout the giraffe\u2019s life. With the changing of season and health, the coat color may be altered. (\"Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia\", 2003) Giraffa camelopardalis have long, sturdy legs, with their front legs longer than their back legs. Giraffe necks contain 7 elongated vertebrae. Giraffes have a steeply sloping back from the shoulders to the rump. Their tails are thin and long, measuring about 76 to 101 cm in length. A black tuft at the end of the tail whisks away flies and other flying insects. Giraffe horns, called ossicones, are bone protuberances covered with skin and fur. Female giraffe horns are thin and tufted; male giraffe horns are thick but the hair is smoothed by sparring. A medium-sized horn is common in both male and females; while males can grow a second pair behind the first pair of horns. The eyes are very large and their 45 cm long black tongue grasps prickly food from the very tops of trees.

Bulls carefully guard an estrous female from other male giraffes. Courtship starts when a bull approaches a cow to perform a urine test, smelling the urine with a pronounced lip curl, a behavior referred to as flehmen. The bull will then proceed to rub his head near the rump of the female and rest it on her back. Male giraffes lick the tail of the female and lift his foreleg. If receptive, the female giraffe will circle the male, hold her tail out, and take on a mating position, after which copulation occurs. (\"Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia\", 2003) Mating System\npolygynous For Giraffa camelopardalis, conception occurs in the rainy season, with birth occurring in the dry months. Most giraffe births take place from May to August. Female giraffes breed every 20 to 30 months. The gestation period is about 457 days. Mother giraffes give birth standing up or walking. The giraffe calf drops 2 m to the ground. Most often a single calf is born; twins are uncommon but do occur. Newborn calves get to their feet and begin suckling fifteen minutes after birth. The weaning period for female calves is 12 to 16 months; the weaning period for males is 12 to 14 months. The independence period varies between bulls and cows. Cows tend to stay within the herd. However, bulls tend to become solitary until they find or obtain their own herd and become the dominant male. Female giraffes reach sexual maturity at 3 to 4 years of age but do not breed for at least another year. At age 4 to 5 years, male giraffe become sexually mature; however, it is not until seven years of age when they start to breed.

Mother giraffes stay nearby, within 25 m, guarding their young and feeding. At night females return to their young to nurse them. After three to four weeks, mother giraffes steer their young calves into cr\u00e8che groups. The cr\u00e8che group allows mother giraffes to wander further away from the young calf to feed or drink. The mother giraffes take turns watching over all the youngsters in the cr\u00e8che group. Now the mother giraffe can drift as far as 200 m from her calf. Mothers still return before nightfall to suckle and protect their calf.

In areas where the savanna floor is salty or full of minerals, they eat soil as well. Giraffes are ruminants and have a four-chambered stomach. Chewing cud while traveling helps to maximize their feeding opportunities. (\"Encyclopedia of Mammals\", 1997; \"Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia\", 2003) Giraffa camelopardalis have long tongues, narrow muzzles, and flexible upper lips to help obtain leaves from the tall trees they use for browsing. Giraffes use many tree species for browse, including: Acacia senegal, Mimosa pudica, Combretum micranthum, and Prunus armeniaca. Their main food is the leaves from Acacia trees. Giraffes browse by taking the branches in their mouths and pulling away the head to tear away the leaves. Acacia trees have thorns but giraffe molars crush the thorns. Up to 66 kg of food for one day can be consumed by an adult, male giraffe. However, in poor-quality areas, a giraffe can survive on 7 kg of food per day. (\"Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia\", 2003; \"Walker's Mammals of the World\", 1999; Sanderson, 1982) Male giraffes typically feed with their head and neck completely outstretched to the shoots. Their fodder is from the underside of the high canopy. Female giraffes feed at body and knee height, feeding from the crown of lower trees or shrubs. Female giraffes are more selective when feeding. They choose foliage with highest nutritional value.

Giraffes are hunted and poached for their skin, meat, and tail. Habitat destruction also impacts giraffe populations. Giraffe populations remain common in east and southern Africa but have drastically fallen in west Africa. In Niger, conservation of giraffes has been made a priority. In other places where large mammals have disappeared, giraffes have survived. Their survival could be because their height diminishes competition with domestic mammals.

Females give birth walking or standing up, and calves are able to stand and begin nursing within an hour. Newborns are about six feet (1.8 m) tall and weigh up to 160 pounds (72.6 kg). When the calf is a month old, it and its mother join a nursery made up of other mothers and their calves. Mothers take turns guarding the nursery while others forage nearby, returning to the nursery frequently to nurse their calves. Calves are weaned at twelve to thirteen months and remain with their mothers for a few additional months. Females reach sexual maturity at three to four years old; males about a year later. Giraffes have an average lifespan of about 25 years in their natural habitat and a range of 20 to 27 years in human care.\nCollection Connection\nDenver Zoo is home to a small herd of reticulated giraffes.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe Social Structure - Giraffe Facts and Information", "url": "https://www.giraffeworlds.com/giraffe-social-structure/", "text": "Giraffe Social Structure\nGiraffes are social animals that live in unstable herds of 10 to 20 individuals, although they can be up to 50 members. However, they do not have strong social ties like other animal species, except the mothers with their offspring, since each member of the herd can leave the group at will. The herds have females, offspring, young, and some males. Some individuals prefer to stay alone, especially some bulls that are less social than cows.\nObserving the social structure of giraffes is interesting. The females bond very well together, so they group in small herds with about 10 to 12 members. There will not be males often in that group unless they are still under the care of their mothers.\nTo protect their young, females help each other out and form what are called nursery groups to take care of the offspring while mothers alternate watching and eating.\nThe young males that are old enough to care for themselves, form bachelor herds. They will play with each other, interacting to try to find out who is the strongest and thus the most dominant in the group. For this, they often engage in battles called necking where they contest for a couple of minutes. Similar to a human arm wrestling contest to see who is the stronger party.\nThese confrontations are not carried out for territorial reasons since they are not concerned about that, but to select the dominant male and the one that will have more opportunity to mate. They can take several minutes and usually do not end in deaths, but sometimes they can suffer some injuries.\nIt is possible to say that between males exist certain cordiality, since once they finish the confrontation, they can coexist peacefully in the same territory, unlike other animals where the winner chases the loser until it completely disappears.\nMature males leave their born group and usually spend the rest of their lives alone except when it is time for mating. The dominant adult males have the privilege of mating with an entire herd of giraffes. However, it is very rare when a bull comes in for mating and then leaves again.\nGiraffes sometimes gather in large herds, but this is usually two or more groups that are in the same vicinity for feeding.\nCommunication\nDo the giraffes vocalize? This question has generated some myths that some people still believe. Perhaps when we have seen giraffes in captivity, we do not hear any sound coming out from them, and we take it for granted that they do not make any.\nGiraffes are not a noisy species nor make a particular sound that identifies them like many other animals, but in certain situations, they communicate with sounds. During courtship, males emit some cough-like vocalizations, but both genders have the ability to whistle, moan and communicate through some infrasounds when they are at long distances, which is why we can not always hear them.\nSome people who have had the opportunity to listen to their vocalizations assure that they are not very pleasant and it seems that they do not come from those animals so visibly calm. It is similar to the sound of a cow but sharper.\nOffspring and young are very loudly when they are in danger; In the presence of a lion, hyena or other threat, they make a series of continuous sounds to grab the attention of the mother. Once the danger is gone, they are silent again.\nNonverbal communication expressed with body movements is important within the herds. The members recognize the dominant male by its posture. When they keep the neck straight, the head upright and the legs firm, they are competing against another bull to measure their level of dominance. When the giraffes are in submission behavior, the head and ears are held down.\nBehavior\nGiraffes prefer to feed in the morning and afternoon hours to have maximum visibility to keep aware of predators. They rest in several positions, sometimes they just stand still, while others they lie on the ground with their four legs bent and their heads straight watching around. Another posture that is very peculiar is common in the young, they let the whole body rest on the floor and to relax the neck they take it back by supporting it on one of their hind legs. It seems that they are totally uncomfortable or crooked, but that is the curious way in which they rest to recover energy.\nGiraffes aren\u2019t territorial, but males become that way when they want to mate to keep other males away from the females they plan to courtship and mate. Also, they can be more territorial when the food is scarce, and they have to fight to keep their herd together.\nIn captivity, both males and females live in the same areas. However, you will notice that they keep their distance. While they are tolerant of each other, they keep to their elements as they would in the wild. It has been noted both in the wild and in captivity that the loose social structure of the giraffe allows it to change and to adapt as it needs to.\nWhen food is scarce, it is common that large herds split and travel on their own to ensure that they do not completely deplete the food sources in a given area.\nIt seems that the giraffe has one of the least structured types of socialization of all the large mammals. Although females create relationships, they do not have the strong bonds and emotions of other animals that spend many years together, like elephants. They are often considered to be not very smart either because they do not socialize or because they do not have a sophisticated communication system.\nMany experts believe that this lack of social structure helps giraffes to adapt and survive in the wild. They also think that this makes the transition to captivity less stressful so they can live relaxed in zoos.\nReferences\nhttps://www.nwf.org/Kids/Ranger-Rick/Animals/Mammals/Giraffes.aspx\nAnne Innis Dagg.

Mammal of high altitude. The male can reach 5.3 m, which is why it is considered the highest animal of all that exist. It lives in the dry regions and with dispersed trees, located to the south of the Sahara desert .\nScientific Classification\nThe giraffes belong to the family of the Jir\u00e1fidos (Giraffidae), within the order of the Artiod\u00e1ctilos. It is classified as Giraffe Camelopardalis\nInteresting facts about Giraffe\nCharacteristics\nThe giraffe, like most mammals , has only seven cervical vertebrae, which are very elongated to support its long, muscular neck. Because of the great distance between the heart and the head (situated far above the animal\u2019s head, and far below the head), giraffes need a regulatory mechanism that keeps the blood pressure in the brain constant ; for this they have a system formed by small arterieswhich dilate to varying degrees, and allow blood pressure to stabilize in the brain. This system is called an admirable reticle. In this way, when the giraffe lowers its head, the external carotid artery fills with blood, and prevents the excessive flow of this to the admirable reticulum; at the same time, the jugular vein prevents blood flow through a series of valves arranged along this vessel. When the head is erect, blood from the internal carotid artery passes into the reticulum, which will maintain the blood supply to the brain. Females and males are provided with two or four short, blunt horns covered with fur. The tongue is long (it can measure up to 40 cm in length), and flexible; use it together with the upper lip to remove the leaves from the highest branches of the acacias, which constitute one of its main foods.\nReproduction\nThe gestation of a giraffe lasts between 14 and 15 months; a single offspring is born. The mother gives birth and the embryonic sac breaks when the baby falls to the ground. Newborn giraffes are about 1.8 m tall and weigh about 50 kg. Within a few hours of being born, the offspring can run and are not distinguishable from a one-week-old calf. During the first two weeks they spend most of the time lying down, sheltered by their mother.\nDo you want to know about National animal of Cuba?\nSenses\nGiraffes have excellent sense of hearing and smell, as well as a highly developed view . They congregate in unorganized herds , with a number of members between two and ten, to which they are frequently joined or separated by other individuals. Each herd is led by an adult male, who leads a group of several females with their offspring and some males that have not yet reached sexual maturity.\nWeight\nDue to their great weight, which can be 800 kg, giraffes are unable to cross marshes or to ford rivers; however, these animals move easily on dry and hard terrain. Unlike many other African herbivores that feed on grass, giraffes do not migrate during the dry seasons, because they get their food and most of the water they need from the leaves of the acacias . They can spend more than a month without drinking, and the few times they do, they have to separate their forelegs a lot so they can lower their heads to the water. It is for this reason that giraffes do not usually pacer. Giraffes rest and sleep on their feet.\nWhile adult giraffes are too large to be attacked by most predators, the younger ones may be prey to lions, leopards, hyenas and wild dogs. The baby becomes independent around 18 months and feeds on breast milk up to that age. Only 25 to 50 percent of giraffes reach adulthood; those have an average life span of 20 to 26 years."}

However, it is a very real relative of the giraffe (though the okapi obviously has a much shorter neck), and can be found not only in zoos, but running wild in the Ituri rain-forest of The Democratic Republic of Congo. It stands 4.9 to 6.6 ft (1.5 to 2 m) tall at it's shoulders, and is 6.2 to 8.2 ft (1.9 to 2.5 m) long; with a weight of 440 to 660 lbs (200 to 300 kg).\nFor many years, the okapi, whose looks can be best described as that of a horse with a giraffe's head and a zebra's stripes on it's legs, was thought to merely be a legend; it was even described as \"The African Unicorn\" by skeptics. However, In the late 1800s/early 1900s, Sir Harry Johnston was able to confirm the herbivore's existence through remains given to him a pygmy tribe. Due to its close resemblance to a creature found in ancient Egyptian markings, the okapi is considered to be a living fossil; that is, a creature who appears to be related to a creature otherwise believed to be extinct. It's most notable feature is obviously it's striped markings, which many believe exist to help young okapis recognize and follow their mothers while traveling through the dense rain-forest. This recognition helps to preserve the baby's life until it can separate from it's parent.\nOnce independent, they tend not to form packs. Males are actually very territorial, although they seem to have no problem tolerating each other when forced to interact. Another notable characteristic of the okapi is it's long, giraffe-like tongue, which it uses to strip leaves and buds from trees; and to clean itself (it's tongue is long enough to reach the inside of it's ear). Although deforestation threatens it habitat, the their numbers are strong. So despite spending most of it's existence as a myth, the okapi is certainly real; and it appears it is here to stay."}

In, however, all giraffe are \u201csouthern giraffe.\u201d Subspecies differ only in their blotch pattern, color and distribution; all other characteristics are the same.Giraffes inhabit open woodland and wooded grassland. They also may be seen in open grassland, and occasionally at the forest\u2019s edge. Giraffes often frequent drainage-line vegetation in the dry season, but riparian thickets are the only place you are likely to see them in dense vegetation. One often observes giraffes stretching as high as they can go and extending their extremely long, leather-like tongues to pluck a couple of leaves off an umbrella thorn acacia.Giraffes are typically diurnal creatures, but also move about at night. They sometimes utter snorts and grunts, but are generally silent animals. Often, the only noise to be heard when a giraffe moves is the click of its hooves when its feet are lifted off the ground.These long-legged animals have few enemies. They are most vulnerable when drinking, as they splay their front legs and lower their heads, often in the vicinity of thick, waterside vegetation. Giraffes will only drink after carefully looking around, and it is only done every two to three days. At waterholes in, it is often frustrating to watch a giraffe trying to come to drink, as the entire process could take hours; young may even be taken byif the adults are not around. Females will defend their young against any attacker by kicking with their hind legs. The mortality rate for a giraffe, up to age 3, is about eight percent.Traditionally, giraffes have not been hunted by humans. They rarely raid local maize farms, and their feeding habits make them almost impervious to drought. But increasing pressure from development and poaching have more recently landed giraffes on the vulnerable list among the international Red List of Threatened Species.The individual is the basic social unit in giraffe society. The animals are loosely gregarious, with group sizes between two and 12, and herd composition changing constantly as adults come and go. A female\u2019s home range may be as large as 48 square miles, but she will spend most of her time in the central part where she feeds. Dominant males have a tendency to wander in and out of female home ranges.Fights between dominant males are rarely seen. When they approach each other, they frequently adopt a threat posture in which they \u201cstand tall.\u201d This is normally enough to persuade the less dominant male to leave. Serious fighting occurs only when the fixed dominance hierarchy breaks down\u2014forwhen a new nomadic male comes into the neighborhood.A ritualized form of fighting known as \u201cnecking\u201d is carried out by males, normally during the time a female is in estrus. The animals intertwine necks, often accompanied by blows to the head and neck. The \u201cwinner\u201d of the bout often climbs on the back of the \u201closer.\u201d This frequently leads the observer to the erroneous conclusion that necking is a courtship ritual.Giraffes breed year-round. Females reach sexual maturity at age 5, males not until eight. Dominant males will patrol the home range looking for females that come into heat. Males test females by smelling their vulvas or sampling their urine to see if they are receptive. If a dominant male finds a female in estrous, he will displace lesser males and consort with her until mating occurs.During their lifespan, females may have up to 12 calves, each weighing approximately 220 pounds and measuring six feet tall at birth. Twins are very rare. Births normally occur in a calving ground; this may lead to the formation of \u201ccr\u00e8ches\u201d in which unweaned calves spend most of the day together on their own.Feeding generally occurs between 6 am and 9 am and again from 3 pm to 6 pm. Giraffes are ruminants and spend a good portion of the day resting and chewing their cud. They are exclusively browsers, with 95 percent of their feeding confined to the foliage of bushes and trees. All parts are taken\u2014leaves, buds, shootsfruits. On rare occasions, they\u2019ll eat grass and creepers.Mostly, the graceful giraffe favors the leaves of specific acacia trees. One often observes giraffes stretching as high as they can go and extending their extremely long, leather-like tongues to pluck a couple of leaves off an umbrella thorn acacia. Giraffes are the tallest animals on the planet, in addition to being the biggest ruminants (four-stomached creatures). Ruminants are able to consume smaller amounts of food, extracting a high quantity of nutrients from each leaf.Acacia fodder is harvested in a couple different ways, depending on the strength of the thorns. Young, flexible thorns are flattened and the leaves stripped off with a sideways sweep; older, more robust thorns may also be flattened, engulfed in mucous and swallowed along with the branch. Very woody branches may simply be nibbled at selectively. A giraffe uses its tough tongue and lips very deftly. Its agile black tongue, which can reach up to 18 inches, curls around branches. Giraffe saliva is exceptionally sticky and antiseptic, helpful when browsing thorny branches.Photo Credit: Alex Mazunga"}

We believe that both male (bulls) and female (cows) giraffe can live to about 25 years in the wild and even longer in captivity. In our long-term conservation project in northwest Namibia we now know that some giraffe that were first identified as sub-adults in 2000, are still alive today \u2013 making them some of the oldest recorded giraffe in the wild.\nHowever, even the world\u2019s tallest animal has enemies. Giraffe mortality rates vary from region to region dependent on density of natural predators. Even adult male giraffe are sometime predated by lion, while sub-adults and calves are particularly vulnerable and can also be taken by hyena, leopard, wild dog and crocodile.\nAs an example, the infant mortality rate in the Serengeti (Masai giraffe \u2013 G. tippelskirchi) for one month old giraffe calves is over 20% while approximately half of the calves do not survive their first 6 months. This figure reaches nearly 60% by the end of the first year in the Serengeti, dropping to 8% in the second year and just 3% in the third.\nOnce mature, the defensive kick of an adult giraffe is enough to seriously damage even the most determined predator, and many a lion has succumbed to the fierceness of their dinner plate size hooves."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Reticulated Giraffe - Fresno Chaffee Zoo", "url": "https://fresnochaffeezoo.org/species/giraffe/", "text": "The Tallest Mammal in the World\nBoth the legs and neck of the animal are extremely elongate. The body is short-coupled and the back is sloped upwards from the tail to the base of the neck. There are two ossicones, known by most as \u201chorns\u201d on the skull and a large bump in the middle of the forehead. The eyelashes are quite long and thick.\nDiet\nWild \u2013 Giraffes are browsers, taking leaves and shoots of Acacia and other trees and shrubs. The only competition that the giraffe has for food is the elephant.\nZoo \u2013 Alfalfa, omolene, tree browse and grain.\nColoration\nAll Giraffes are mottled tan and cream to distinct orange or dark liver blotches on a white background. The various subspecies are told by the size and shape of the dark blotches. The edges of the blotches on the Reticulated Giraffe tend to be straight, like cut paper, while those of the Masai Giraffe look like torn paper. Rothchild\u2019s are like the Masai but with a darker center on each spot. The eyes are a dark brown and the mane, ossicone tassels and long tail tassel are black.\nBehavior\nSociable by nature, Giraffes live in loose groups but do not form permanent herds. Adult males, called bulls, have an identifiable pecking order that is established through a ritual of neck wrestling. Females, called cows, move in and out of various groups, and generally hang together more for the watchfulness of others against predators than for companionship. Giraffe very seldom graze, for the same reason that they take great precautions when drinking. Their necks, long as they are, are not long enough to reach the ground. Giraffes must spraddle their legs, or buckle them in a very ungainly manner in order to drink. They must be quite certain that there are no predators around before lowering themselves into such a vulnerable position. Their long necks offer an excellent field of view but they depend on the alarm of others when drinking. If they need to defend themselves, they can run 30 mph, with a stride speed of 25 or more feet.\nAdaptation\nGiraffes have an extraordinary circulatory system. For instance, they have the highest known blood pressure but, interestingly enough, the blood pressure to the brain drops when the giraffe lowers its head. The blood vessels in the giraffe\u2019s neck are extra heavy \u2013 thick walled \u2013 in order to withstand the great pressure without a blowout. A giraffe\u2019s long neck has the same number of vertebrae, as most mammals, seven, but each is disproportionately long. Giraffes are ruminants, like cows, with a multi-chambered stomach. The giraffe has a 19-20 inch prehensile tongue that enables the animal to pick shoots and leaves from between the very long thorns of the acacia trees. They have tough mouths and copious amounts of viscous saliva to deal with large thorns.\nBreeding & Growth\nFemales bear one calf that will stay with the mother until the next calf is born, and will often hang out with them for the next year. The calf is about 6 feet tall at birth. The legs of adult giraffes are about 6 feet long to the belly (elbows and knees) so the calf must be that tall to reach the udder for its milk. The calf\u2019s neck is quite short, relatively, but it elongates rather quickly over the calf\u2019s first few months. Giraffe cows deliver standing up. The calf\u2019s front toes appear first, the long legs following, with the neck and nose laid along those legs.\nThe calf may hang, suspended from the waist for what seems an interminably long time and then whoosh. The cow squats and the calf slips out and slams, splat on its side. The fall is actually only about 3 feet. The shock causes a sudden inhalation and breathing begins. The cow will lick the newborn and it soon raises its head on a wobbly neck. A normal calf stands within about 20 minutes and can run within hours. Giraffes were once thought to be mute, but they do make a soft lowing, especially when with the calf.\nAnimal Facts Lifespan Healthy giraffes live about 25 years in the wild.\nHeight Males reach 15-20 feet and females 12-17 feet.\nWeight Males range between 1,765-4,255 pounds and females 1,215-2,600 pounds.\nDiet Giraffes browse (take leaves from trees and bushes), they cannot graze (taking grass from the ground).\nStatus Vulnerable."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Are giraffes endangered? | IFAW", "url": "https://www.ifaw.org/journal/are-giraffes-endangered", "text": "Well are they?\nIt\u2019s complicated. There are approximately 68,000 giraffes left in the wild. But the number of giraffes has plummeted dramatically in the past three decades\u2014by up to 40%. Some people refer to this as \u201csilent extinction\u201d because it\u2019s been such a slow decline that it\u2019s almost gone unnoticed. But luckily some conservationists were paying attention (we love those peeps!). All the typical reasons are at play: loss of habitat, civil unrest and poaching. But since giraffes were never afforded protection from trade until 2019 (thanks to the hard work of IFAW and aforementioned conservationists), pointing precisely to illegal trade of their parts is difficult.\nUm, it\u2019s really complicated\nWhat this means, under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), is that anyone wishing to trade internationally in giraffes will have to prove that trade is legal and sustainable. Conservationists (there they are again!) saw this protection as a huge win because it had been impossible to say how much the decline in the giraffe population was due to trade vs. other factors. With the U.S. being the only country to collect trade data on giraffes, we know that almost 40,000 giraffe items were traded in a decade.\nUn-fair trade\nSo, what parts of the giraffe are traded and considered valuable to poachers? Similar to elephant tusks for ivory, there\u2019s a significant amount of international trade in giraffe bone carvings and trophies. Of those 40,000 items mentioned, conservative estimates point to at least 3,751 individual giraffes, including 21,402 bone carvings, 3,008 skin pieces and 3,744 hunting trophies.\nThat\u2019s why, according to Matt Collis, Deputy Vice President of Conservation for IFAW, \u201cThis listing on Appendix II [by CITES] is an important step in regulating giraffe trade, preventing any illegal and unsustainable trade and helping to safeguard this iconic species for future generations.\u201d\nDon\u2019t get mad, take action (or get mad and take action)\nCITES classifies the urgency for species protection based on an Appendix system. Appendix II lists species that aren\u2019t necessarily threatened with extinction now, but that may become extinct unless trade is closely controlled. And like any protection, this won\u2019t prevent or stop all trade of giraffe parts, but it will ensure that trade isn\u2019t further contributing to population declines and, most importantly, provides global data that we wouldn\u2019t have otherwise. Giraffes have been listed as Vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List since 2016, with some of their nine subspecies classified as endangered or critically endangered.\nIn the U.S., we are petitioning the government to add giraffes to the Endangered Species Act (ESA) as an endangered animal.\nFun fact: Only one species of giraffe is recognized, but they have nine subspecies, each an important keystone that plays a vital role within their ecosystem."}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "8 Extraordinary Facts About the Okapi - Treehugger", "url": "https://www.treehugger.com/okapi-facts-5074974", "text": "The okapi is not a particularly famous animal, at least not outside its small native range. About 100 live at zoos around the world, but otherwise, they're hidden in rainforests and rarely seen by humans.\nYet while these secretive creatures are adept at staying out of the spotlight, they deserve the admiration we often give to more well-known wildlife. Here are a few things you may not know about the extraordinary okapi.\n1. Okapis Belong to the Giraffe Family\nAt first glance, it would be sensible to assume okapis are related to zebras. Those stripes on their legs, after all, do evoke the distinctive markings of a zebra. Yet despite that superficial similarity, the two are not closely related. They even belong to different taxonomic orders: Okapis are even-toed ungulates (a broad group that includes most hoofed mammal species), while zebras are odd-toed ungulates (along with horses, rhinos, and tapirs).\nIf you look closely at an okapi's head, however, you may notice another resemblance \u2014 the giraffe. Okapis are the only surviving members of the giraffe family who aren't giraffes. They are the lone species in the genus Okapia, which joins Giraffa as the two extant genera in the family Giraffidae. Okapis aren't as tall as giraffes \u2014 since tree leaves are easier to reach in their rainforest habitats \u2014 but there are other clues, from males' horn-like ossicones to their long, purple, prehensile tongues. Research suggests the last common ancestor of giraffes and okapis lived about 11.5 million years ago.\ufeff\ufeff\n2. Their Stripes May Serve Multiple Purposes\nThe stripes on an okapi's legs help with camouflage in the forest. Andrea Izzotti / Getty Images\nThe stripes on an okapi's legs provide excellent camouflage. While giraffes tend to forage in more open habitats, okapi live in dense rainforests, where they blend in uncannily well with the shadows and filtered sunlight.\nIn addition to camouflage, the stripes may also serve a secondary \u2014 and seemingly contradictory \u2014 purpose. Okapi stripes are sometimes referred to as \"follow me\" stripes because they're thought to help baby okapis see and follow their mothers through the vegetation. And since the stripe pattern is unique for each individual, they may also help okapis identify one another.\n3. Wild Okapis Only Live in One Country\nWild okapis exist only in the central, northern, and eastern regions of the Democratic Republic of Congo. There were once okapis in Uganda, but they are now extinct there.\nOkapis are limited to forests with high and closed canopies, between about 1,500 and 5,000 feet (450 to 1,500 meters) above sea level. They mostly inhabit primary or older secondary forests, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and don't occur in gallery forests, savannas, or disturbed habitats surrounding larger human settlements.\ufeff\ufeff\n4. Their Fur Is Velvety and Oily\nThe bulk of an okapi's body is covered with dark purple or reddish-brown fur, which is dense and feels like velvet. Okapis also produce oil from their skin that helps waterproof their fur, a beneficial adaptation to living in a rainforest. According to the Oklahoma City Zoo, captive okapis at zoos often enjoy a neck rub, which reportedly leaves a dark, slippery residue on the hands of their caretakers.\ufeff\ufeff\n5. They Are Rarely Seen in the Wild\nThe okapi has long been known to Indigenous people in the Ituri Forest, but the species was not known globally until 1901, when British explorer and colonist Harry Johnston obtained the skin and skull of an okapi. (Before then, rumors of a forest-dwelling \"unicorn\" in Central Africa had circulated among Europeans.)\nThe okapi remains elusive. In fact, there were no images of an okapi in the wild until 2008, when the first wild okapi photo was captured by a Zoological Society of London camera trap.\ufeff\ufeff\n6. Their Tongue Is Long Enough to Clean Their Eyes and Ears\nOkapis' tongues are long enough to help them groom their eyes and ears. Thorsten Spoerlein / Getty Images\nOkapis are herbivores, feeding on the leaves, buds, and fruits of trees as well as ferns, grasses, and fungi. They can eat 40 to 65 pounds (18 to 29 kg) of food every day. They play an important role in the ecology of their native rainforests as they devour a variety of plants in the understory. This task is made easier by their prehensile tongue, which can grow up to 12 to 14 inches (30 to 36 cm) long, allowing it to wrap around branches and strip them of foliage. Like giraffes, the tongue of an okapi is black or dark blue in color.\nTheir tongues are so long, in fact, that okapis use them to wash their eyelids, clean out their ears, and even swat insects away from their neck.\n7. They Speak a Secret (and Quiet) Language\nOkapis share giraffes' reputation for being quiet, but much like giraffes, they do make sounds to communicate. Researchers from the San Diego Zoo recorded lots of \"coughs, bleats, and whistles\" from okapis, but only when they later analyzed the recordings more closely in a lab did they realize they had captured even more.\ufeff\ufeff\nOkapis emit low-frequency sounds beyond the range of human hearing, evident only computer analyses that can reveal their infrasonic signals. Researchers believe these are used to help mother okapis stay in touch with their calves while foraging, allowing a secret channel of communication that won't tip off their main predator, the leopard.\n8. They Are Endangered\nPopulation estimates of okapis are rough, relying heavily on extrapolation from a limited number of scattered surveys based on their dung. Estimates have ranged from 10,000 to more than 30,000 left in the wild, but given their limited available range, their sensitivity to habitat disturbance, and the threats they face \u2014 namely habitat loss due to logging, mining, and human settlement \u2014 they are listed as endangered by the IUCN.\ufeff\ufeff Experts believe their numbers have already halved in the past 25 years, according to the ZSL, and the species is considered to be in decline.\ufeff\ufeff"}

The Nubian giraffe, scientific name Giraffa camelopardalis camelopardalis is the designated subspecies of the northern giraffe with awesome beauty, impeccable grandeur, and ornamented by nature.\nNubian Giraffe profile\nThis beautifully structured giraffe is found in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan, and Sudan. Currently, it is extinct in the Congo, Egypt, and Eritrea floods of the Democratic Republic because of the optimum environment, lavish nature, and abundance of food.\nA giraffe can not live everywhere on earth. They have some specific areas to live and grow. The Nubian giraffe is common to some extent all over northeast Africa. The subspecies was listed in 2018 by IUCN as critically endangered because of some risks, and cruel factors.\nClassification and evolution\nThe IUCN currently recognizes only one species of giraffe with nine subspecies, one of which is the Nubian giraffe.\nThe Nubian giraffe as well as some other species are first introduced by the Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus Reagan.\nGiraffes are divided into numerous subspecies, though the most well-known are the giraffes of Masai, Reticulated, and Rothschild.\nCommonly one may not be able to distinguish the species. In South Africa, all giraffes are \u201csouthern giraffes\u201d Subsidies differ only in their stain layout, color and distribution; All other features are the same. One needs to have a good study and understanding of species in order to explore them further.\nNubian giraffe Habitat\nGiraffe is born a natural animal and loves to live in the wild, rather than in captivity. Giraffes live in open woodland and woodland. They can also be seen in open grasslands and occasionally on forest shores.\nSince it is a long neck animal with a comparatively bigger body, small trees or bushes are not suitable fr them. Giraffes are most likely to be seen in dense plants, often in the dry season, but only in riparian thickets.\nNubian Giraffe Behavior\nThe Nubian Giraffe is a gentle, timid, and calm animal. One can often go as far as the giraffes go, and an umbrella extends their long, leathery tongue to drop a few leaves from the prickly babble.\nGiraffes are usually Duranal animals but roam at night. These are sometimes pronounced snores and grants but are usually silent creatures.\nA giraffe can look around well with its flexible neck and sharp look. The giraffe is often heard only when the click of his hoof is raised when his feet are raised above the ground. From a distance, it can sense predators, feeding, or food.\nThese long-legged creatures have very few enemies. They are the most vulnerable when drinking, as they spell their front legs and lower their heads, often around dense, watery plants. Giraffes will drink only after careful viewing and this is done every two to three days.\nIn Botswana waterholes, it is often frustrating to see giraffes try to come in to drink, as the whole process can take hours; If the adults are not around, the lions can catch the young.\nWomen will protect their youth against any attacker kicking with their back legs. By the age of 3, giraffe\u2019s mortality rate is about eight percent.\nSince its quite cool and gentle, the giraffe doesn\u2019t hunt people. They rarely attack local corn farms, and their feeding habits make them almost vulnerable to measles for their survival.\nThey can be violent when sensing any danger, fear, irritation, or any other need.\nHowever, giraffes have been on the vulnerable list in the recent international threat species Red List due to the increasing pressure on development and hunting.\nNubian Physical Description\nNubian giraffe sharply defined chestnut color spots surrounded by mostly white lines, while the bottom part lacked spotting. The median body is developed, especially in the male giraffe.\nThe giraffe is a social animal and may roam around in a group. They weigh up to 2,220 pounds and have a unique gait.\nBoth legs appear to be moving at the same time, making it look like the giraffe is rotating. During the race, the two toes went forward and planted trees in front of the forfeit.\nAlthough their gait can see the final, giraffes can reach a maximum speed of 37 miles per hour.\nThe pattern of the giraffe coat is fixed to live, which makes it possible for human observers to distinguish one animal from another; However, with age, animals become thicker.\nMale and Female\nIt is not easy to separate males from females, though men tend to grow older and spend more time feeding on tree shades, where women prefer to eat at the bottom of the tree.\nThe giraffe has only seven uterine vertebrae in its long neck, no more than any other animal, though they are extremely long and workable in need.\nBoth sexes are borne with covered horns on the skin and topped with black hair.\nBreeding\nBy natural instinct, giraffes come together during the breeding season. Giraffes breed year-round. Women reach sexual maturity when they are 5 years old, not men when they are eight years old. Influential men will patrol the home range for heated women.\nMen test their wives by smelling them or checking their urine samples to see if they are acceptable.\nIf a dominant man finds a wife in a state of excitement, he will displace the lesser men and have intercourse with him until they have sexual relations.\nDuring their lifetime, wives may have 12 calves, each of which weighs about 220 pounds and is about six feet tall at birth. Twins are very rare.\nBirths usually occur on a lining ground; This can lead to the formation of \u201ccrutches\u201d where unwanted calves spend most of their days together on their own.\nNubian giraffe Feeding habits\nThe giraffe does not feed all day, rather, they have some particular time to graze in the field.\nFeeding usually occurs from 6 am to 7 pm and again from 9 pm to 5 pm. The giraffes are ruminants and spend a good portion of the day resting and chewing them.\nThey are exclusively browsers, confined to 95% of feed bushes and tree leaves. All parts \u2013 leaves, buds, shoots, and fruits are taken. On rare occasions, they will eat grass and shrubs.\nLong bushy trees are suitable for their food. In most cases, the sighting giraffe prefers the leaves of certain Babula trees.\nThough there are plenty of spikes in the trees, the Nubians are so smart that they can easily manage to eat leaves without any injury.\nThe giraffe is the tallest animal on the planet, with the exception of the largest ruminants (four-tailed animals). This uniqueness has made different lifestyles, habitats, food, and socialization.\nBrushants are able to consume small amounts of food, collecting high amounts of nutrients from each leaf.\nThe very wooden branches can only be selectively bent. A giraffe uses his hard tongue and lips very efficiently.\nIts crisp black tongue, which can reach up to 18 inches, curls around the branches. Giraffe saliva is exceptional when browsing the sticky and antiseptic, prickly branches. This makes their immune system stronger by nature.\nPopulation\nThe giraffe is particularly an African animal. Giraffes are found everywhere in Africa; Nubian giraffes were widespread throughout North Africa, from Kenya to Egypt from time immemorial.\nGiraffes live in savannah and woodland. Nubian giraffe currently lives in eastern South Sudan and southwestern Ethiopia and in isolated pockets of Uganda and Kenya. They live in the wild. Moreover, there are several conservation projects.\nIt was estimated in 2010 that fewer than 250 Nubians live in the wild, though this number was uncertain and declining.\nIn captivity\nThe Nubian giraffe is one of the common giraffes present in captivity when combined with the reticulated giraffe, due to the introduction of the Rothschild\u2019s giraffe into its subspecies.\nHowever, the original phenotype is rare, because the Al Ain Zoo in the UAE is the only known zoo outside Africa, where the endangered root phenotype breeds. Nubian giraffes are bred in captivity at the Giza Zoo in Egypt.\nNubian giraffe Socialization\nAs we have said, the giraffe is a social animal. The individual Nubian is the primary social unit of the giraffe community.\nAnimals are grouped between two and 12 and the loose compositions change regularly, and as the adults come in, the animals gradually turn green.\nThey have their particular group and altogether from around the forest.\nA giraffe grazes in a huge area without being tired. A woman\u2019s home range can be as large as 48 square miles, but she will spend most of her time in the central part. Influential men have a tendency to wander in and out of the female room.\nNubian Fights\nThere may have some tussle in the group for several reasons. Fighting is rarely seen among influential men.\nWhen they approach each other, they often pose a threat where they \u201cstand tall\u201d \u2013 this is usually enough to convince low-impact males to leave.\nSerious conflict occurs only when the dominant classification breaks down. For example, when a new Nubian arrives on the trail.\nA formal form of fighting known as \u201cknocking\u201d is carried out by a male giraffe, usually when a woman is in eustress. Animals are often associated with head and neck injuries.\nThe \u201cwinner\u201d of the fight often goes after the \u201closer\u201d This often leads the observer to make the wrong decision that the wedding ceremony is a necklace.\nIt is a pride for the owner and the other members of the group rely on him."}

Learn more with 10 fascinating Brachiosaurus facts.\n01 of 10 It Had Longer Front Than Hind Limbs DariuszSankowski/Pixabay Rather disappointingly, considering its long neck, long tail, and enormous bulk, the late Jurassic Brachiosaurus (Greek for \"arm lizard\") was named after a less impressive feature. Compared to its hind limbs, the relatively long length of its front limbs endowed this dinosaur with a distinctly giraffe-like posture. This was clearly a dietary adaptation, as the longer front limbs allowed Brachiosaurus to reach the high branches of trees without unduly straining its neck. There's even some speculation that this sauropod could rear up occasionally on its hind legs, like a giant grizzly bear!\n02 of 10 Adults Could Live to Be 100 Years Old AStrangerintheAlps/Wikimedia Commons/CC BY 3.0 As a general rule, the bigger and slower an animal is, the longer its life span. The enormous size of Brachiosaurus (up to 85 feet long from head to tail and 40-50 tons), combined with its presumed cold-blooded or homeothermic metabolism, means that healthy adults might have reached the century mark on a regular basis. This is very possible, as a full-grown Brachiosaurus would have been virtually immune to danger from predators, like the contemporary Allosaurus, once it aged out of its vulnerable childhood and teenage years.\n03 of 10 It Was Probably a Homeotherm Nikon D300/MaxPixel/CC0 How did a dinosaur as big as Brachiosaurus regulate its body temperature? Paleontologists speculate that sauropods took a long time to warm up in the sun and an equally long time to dissipate this built-up heat at night. This would create a steady state of \"homeothermy,\" a relatively constant body temperature at any given time of the day. This still-unproven theory is consistent with sauropods possessing a cold-blooded (reptilian), but not a warm-blooded (mammalian), metabolism. Contemporary meat-eating dinosaurs like Allosaurus, on the other hand, may have been genuinely warm-blooded, given their relatively active lifestyles.\n04 of 10 It Was Discovered in 1900 Thomas Quine/Flickr/CC BY 2.0 In 1900, a fossil-hunting crew from Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History discovered a near-complete dinosaur skeleton missing only its skull in the Fruita region of western Colorado. The expedition chief, Elmer Riggs, named the type fossil Brachiosaurus. Ironically, this honor should have belonged to the famous American paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh, who nearly two decades before had incorrectly classified a Brachiosaurus skull as belonging to the distantly related Apatosaurus.\n05 of 10 The Skull Was Easily Detached From Its Neck James St. John/Flickr/CC BY 2.0 One of the odd things about dinosaurs like Brachiosaurus is that their tiny-brained skulls were only loosely attached to the rest of their skeletons \u2014 and thus, were easily detached (either by predators or by natural erosion) after their deaths. In fact, it was only in 1998 that paleontologists conclusively identified a skull discovered by the 19th-century paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh as belonging to Brachiosaurus, rather than the similar-looking Apatosaurus. This same loose-skull problem also bedeviled titanosaurs, the lightly armored sauropods that inhabited all the world's continents during the Cretaceous period.\n06 of 10 It May Be the Same Dinosaur as Giraffatitan Dmitry Bogdanov/Wikimedia Commons/Public Domain The picturesquely named Giraffatitan (\"giant giraffe\") lived in late Jurassic northern Africa rather than North America. In all other respects, it was a dead ringer for Brachiosaurus, except for the fact that its neck was even longer. Even today, paleontologists are unsure whether Giraffatitan merits its own genus, or is best classified as a separate species of Brachiosaurus, B. brancai. The exact same situation holds with the giant \"earthquake lizard\" Seismosaurus and another famous genus of North American sauropod, Diplodocus.\n07 of 10 It Was Once Believed to Be Semi-Aquatic Eunostos/Wikimedia Commons/CC BY 4.0 A century ago, naturalists speculated that Brachiosaurus could only have supported its 50-ton weight by walking along the bottoms of lakes and rivers and thrusting its head out of the surface, like a snorkel, to eat and to breathe. Decades later, though, this theory was discredited when a detailed mechanical analysis demonstrated that the high water pressure of an undersea habitat would quickly have suffocated this giant beast. However, that hasn't kept some people from claiming that the Loch Ness Monster is really a 150-million-year-old Brachiosaurus or some other type of sauropod. To date, only one dinosaur, Spinosaurus, has been shown to be capable of swimming.\n08 of 10 It Wasn't the Only Brachiosaurid Sauropod Steffen Marung/Wikimedia Commons/CC BY 2.0 Though the exact classification is still a matter of some dispute among paleontologists, generally speaking, a \"brachiosaurid\" sauropod is one that mimics Brachiosaurus' general body shape: long neck, long tail, and longer front than hind limbs. Some well-known brachiosaurids include Astrodon, Bothriospondylus, and Sauroposeidon. There's also some evidence pointing to an Asian brachiosaurid, the recently discovered Qiaowanlong. The other main category of sauropods is the \"diplodocids,\" that is, dinosaurs closely related to Diplodocus.\n09 of 10 It Wasn't the Only Sauropod in Late Jurassic North America Gerhard Boeggemann/Wikimedia Commons/CC BY 2.5 You might think a dinosaur as big and imposing as Brachiosaurus would \"crowd out\" its niche on the floodplains of late Jurassic North America. In fact, this ecosystem was so lush that it could accommodate numerous other genera of sauropods, including Apatosaurus and Diplodocus. Most likely, these dinosaurs managed to coexist by evolving different feeding strategies. Perhaps Brachiosaurus concentrated on the high branches of trees, while Apatosaurus and Diplodocus held out their necks like the hoses of giant vacuum cleaners and feasted on low-lying shrubs and bushes."}

Giraffes and elephants are among the most mentioned by children when they are asked to name animals.\nThe presence of giraffes in the human culture has been outstanding, always represented as a kind, beautiful, elegant and peaceful animal, but at the same time powerful and able to defend itself when necessary.\nDue to the unique physical appearance of the giraffe, they have been part of the popular culture for a very long time.\nThere are many cave paintings and illustrations of giraffes all over Africa from early civilization that often depicted giraffes in various drawings showing them in high regard. The heritage of this particular animal was found in that continent and continues to be the only place in the world that they still freely roam in the wild. Many found the giraffe to be a symbol of uniqueness.\nIn fact, it is the African culture that has the most respect for the giraffes. They are the ones with the traditions and the links back to earlier days of when these animals were considered to be magically and also something that the people viewed as very different from those around them.\nOne of the earliest recordings of this is a giraffe that was successfully transported from Africa to a zoo in China in the early 1400\u2019s. Specifically, in 1414 a giraffe was taken to China along with precious stones and spices of great value; They named it Qilin. Qilin is part of Chinese, Korean and Japanese mythology and is represented by a beast with a mixture of characteristics of various animals such as fish, lion, deer, and even a dragon and means prosperity and serenity. They related it to the giraffe because it has certain elements in their appearance that refer them to the being of the mythology so important within their culture.\nThere are many cave paintings and illustrations of giraffes all over Africa from early civilization.\nIn the 19th century, Charles X of France was given a giraffe by the leaders of Egypt. He loved this animal, and it was a something he showed to his guests for 18 years. At that time the chance to see one in person was very limited, and so people felt this was a special honor. His palace featured many paintings of his beloved giraffe, and he often referred to it as one of the best gifts he had ever received.\nMany books, in particular for children, use the giraffe as the protagonist to make them feel good about themselves. It is common for children to feel uncomfortable if they are different from others. For example when a child doesn\u2019t have uniform characteristics or is taller than others. The giraffe is the perfect animal to help them see that every creature out there is fantastic no matter the way they look.\nGiraffes, by Nicole Helget, is an educational book that explains the social behavior, physical characteristics, habitat, and distribution of giraffes, as well as the importance they have in human culture around the world. Also, it has beautiful photographs that make the reading enjoyable.\nThe book Giraffe: Biology, Behavior, and Conservation of Anne Innis Dagg, a Canadian zoologist author of numerous works is also an excellent source of information. She has valuable information about giraffes and her passion for this animal has given her worldwide recognition. It is a 256-page book that also deals with the situation of giraffes in captivity.\nFor younger people or children the short book titled Giraffes, by author Judith Jango-Cohen is an option. There are basic and brief explanations, with colorful typography, illustrations, and photographs to complement the texts. It is not a children\u2019s book, but it is not a thorough work either.\nIf you have small children, the National Geographic Little Kids book with giraffe-oriented editing is an excellent gift that will entertain your kids. It contains beautiful photographs and fascinating facts that with the help of adults they will enjoy. It\u2019s a great way to start reading their first words while learning about giraffes.\nTurning to audio-visual materials, we have the 60-minute DVD created by the BBC entitled \u201cAfrica, Eye to Eye with the Unknown,\u201d narrated by the renowned English naturalist Sir David Frederick Attenborough. It deals with the wildlife of Africa and shows the different ways in which living beings survive in a dangerous and challenging habitat. The giraffes have a prominent role in this documentary.\nAlex is an animated educational series aimed at preschoolers. They are short chapters but with many bright colors, fun music, friendly characters and educational teachings. It also has episodes where many other animals, both terrestrial and aquatic, are addressed. Not all TV shows are aggressive with the kids, Alex proves to be a big difference that parents love.\nGeorgina the Giraffe is an animated character created by the BBC for the entertainment of the children. She lives with other friends who help her solve problems; Among them are a pair of monkeys, an elephant, a zebra, an ostrich and a hippopotamus.\nThere is an online game called Giraffe Got Game. The concept is a bit strange, but some people admit to saying it\u2019s fun and addictive. It is a giraffe with a gun built to the height of his chest that serves to shoot penguins, balloons, flying puppets, red cubes and even zombies who want to feed on it.\nAnyone with children is likely to know the fun-loving giraffe called Geoffrey as he is the mascot for the giant known as Toys R Us. He has a pleasant voice, and the toy store offers stories by him as well as stuffed giraffe toys that are huge sellers. Children can also be signed up to get a phone call from Geoffrey on their birthdays and around Christmas time if parents provide that information.\nMany advertisers like to use the giraffe too as a form of promoting their business. They know it is an animal that gets attention and that stands out as being unique. They want to offer that same thing to their customers. The giraffe has a good natural look that people don\u2019t associate it with a wild animal.\nYou will find that stuffed giraffes seem to have a prominent place in the hearts of children and they are great gifts for them.\nPlaygro, B kids, Playskool, Fisher Price, Hasbro, among other brands of toys for preschoolers, have within their products, entertainment based on the image of giraffes. Because their concept represents protection and tranquility, they are the favorites for mothers when choosing a toy for their baby.\nIt is common to see company logos with giraffe figures. Whether abstract, in caricature or with real elements, a corporate identity that carries a giraffe in its presentation, provokes confidence, dynamism, socialization and an air of coolness and originality. Look online for examples of logos with giraffes, and we are sure that you will like more than one.\nFor those children that love reading, there is a diverse list of options to choose according to their age. Some examples are\n\u2013 The little giraffe by Lesley Sims\n\u2013 Giraffes can not dance by Giles Andreae\n\u2013 The pregnant giraffe by Sergio Ram\u00edrez\nIf you saw Madagascar the movie, you certainly enjoyed Melman, the giraffe. It is a reticulated male scary, hypochondriac and very romantic. He knows how to treat injured animals and how to be a good friend. It is a good recommendation for the whole family.\nReferences\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffe#Relationship_with_humans\nBarbara Keevil Parker. Giraffes.

They\u2019re predominantly browsing animals, meaning they tend to eat leaves and bark off trees as the main part of their diet. This feeding pattern has allowed the giraffe to develop two very famous evolutionary traits \u2013 a very long neck and a very long, prehensile tongue that can extend up to 45cm! Both of these physical features allow giraffes to reach vegetation that is difficult to get to, giving it an advantage over other animals.\nGiraffes are extremely picky eaters, favouring acacia trees, although they feed for up to 20 hours a day and consume approximately 30kg of foliage daily. A six-foot tall calf grows rapidly, as much as 2.5cm a day, and by six months old is fairly independent of its mother.\nThe giraffe has one of the shortest sleep requirements of any mammal, averaging two hours daily. Individual giraffes have a unique pattern on their coat, just like fingerprints are unique to each human.\nIt is estimated there are approximately 80,000 giraffe roaming the savannah plains of Africa. This number is declining as their habitats shrinks due to human population growth and an increase in agricultural activity, expanding settlements and road construction. The giraffe\u2019s main food source, acacia trees, is also on the decline."}

Your snack is too high and just out of reach.\nYou might not have this problem if you were a giraffe. Giraffes have adaptations, or characteristics that help animals survive in their natural habitat. And one of those adaptations is a very long neck. Without that neck, giraffes would be in the same situation you are with your snack.\nAlthough they'll eat plants and shrubs closer to the ground, giraffes have a favorite snack: acacia tree leaves. But you can't eat leaves in tall trees if you can't reach them. Fortunately, giraffes' necks are the perfect length to reach those lip-smacking leaves!\nBut their necks aren't just good for reaching tasty treats.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffe", "text": "Giraffe in a zoo\nA giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is a mammal which lives in Africa. Giraffes have an even number of toes and are the tallest land animals. Giraffes and Okapi are the family Giraffidae, and are the only extant giraffids.\nGiraffes have a very long neck and long legs. Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth, with necks that can be up to 2-2.4 m (6.6-7.9 ft) in length. Fully grown giraffes stand 4.3\u20135.7 m (14.1\u201318.7 ft) tall, with males taller than females. The tallest recorded male was 5.88 m (19.3 ft) and the tallest recorded female was 5.17 m (17.0 ft) tall. The average weight is 1,192 kg (2,628 lb) for an adult male and 828 kg (1,825 lb) for an adult female. Maximum weights of 1,930 kg (4,250 lb) and having been recorded for males and females, respectively. They have a long black tongue, up to 45 cm in length. This they use to wrap around leaves and pull them off trees.\nTheir fur has a light yellowish tan or off-white colour with brown or russet patches. No two giraffes have the same pattern. The different sub-species have different coat patterns. Both male and female giraffes have small horn-like stumps on their head, which are covered with skin. The horns are called ossicones. These come from the cartilage displaced from their skull as it develops. These are fur-covered bumps on their skulls, unlike the horns of other animals.\nGiraffes are found in parts of Africa. They live on the savannah, which is the African grassland, or in light woodland. They do not live in thick forests where it is difficult to see predators (such as lions) approaching.The temperature is normally around 70 degrees. Most giraffes live either in East Africa or in Angola and Zambia in southwestern Africa.\nGiraffes eat mostly leaves from tall trees, which they can reach because of their long legs and long necks, as well as fruit. Their rough tongue allows them to eat the acacia leaves protected by thorns. They can go without water for weeks. Like all mammals, giraffes have only seven bones in their necks.\nGiraffes live alone or in loose groups. Young male giraffes foa single baby, which is called \"calf\". Giraffes give birth while standing, so the baby falls down 2 metres. Giraffe calfs are already 2 m tall and weigh 50-55 kg. The calf stays with its mother for 1\u00bd years. Young giraffes become mature when they are 4 years old, and they are fully grown when they are 6 years old. Giraffes can live to 25 years old, and in captivity they can live 35 years.\nGiraffes use their feet to kick predators away, and mature male giraffes use their head and necks to fight for dominance at mating time. These long necks, are, in fact, used as a weapon during the male on male intra\u2013sexual battle that is also referred to as a spar. The females, who receive little to no aid from their partners in raising the calves, prefer the males that are victorious. Those with the longer and stronger necks will reproduce more frequently and keep their genes in the giraffe population for longer compared to the males with shorter, weaker necks.\nThere are about nine different subspecies of giraffe, with only small differences between them. When giraffes of two different sub-species breed, the young are called hybrids (mixed breeds). Of the nine sub-species of giraffe, only one, the Rothchild's, is endangered."}

The giraffes ancestors first appeared in central Asia about 15 million years ago, however, the earliest fossil records of the giraffe itself, from Israel and Africa, date back about 1.5 million years.\nMale giraffes are called \u2018Bulls\u2019, female giraffes are called \u2018Cows\u2019 and baby giraffe are called \u2018Calves\u2019.\nGiraffe Characteristics\nThe giraffe is the tallest living animal which is instantly recognizable by its exceptionally long neck. Adult males stand 15 \u2013 19 feet (4.6 \u2013 6.0 metres) tall, whereas females are shorter at 13 \u2013 16 feet (4 \u2013 4.8 metres) tall. Adult males weigh between 1,764 \u2013 4,255 pounds (800 \u2013 930 kilograms), while females weigh only 1,213 \u2013 2,601 pounds (550 \u2013 1,180 kilograms). The giraffe has the longest tail of any land mammal. Their tail can grow to be 8 feet (2.4 metres) long, including the tuft on the end.\nfunny pictures of Giraffe\nIn addition to its great height, the giraffe is also one of the heaviest land animals. Exceptionally large males may weigh up to 1,900 kilograms (about 4,200 pounds). Female giraffes are smaller, rarely reaching half that weight. Compared to other hoofed mammals the giraffe has a relatively short body, however, its legs are disproportionately long.\nA giraffes front legs are about 10% longer than their hind legs, a feature that contributes to the animals steeply sloping back. Mature giraffes have large hooves about the size of dinner plates, around 12 inches wide.\nGiraffe Habitat\nGiraffes can inhabit savannas, grasslands or open woodlands. Giraffes prefer areas enriched with acacia growth (a genus of shrubs and trees). Most giraffes live either in East Africa or in Angola and Zambia in southwestern Africa. Until the middle of the 20th century giraffes were also commonly found in West Africa, south of the Sahara. But populations there have fallen sharply and become increasingly fragmented."}

Aside from being the tallest animals in the world, what else is there to know about giraffes? Take a closer look at these creatures\u2019 diet, behavior, and other unique traits with these giraffe facts.\nQuick Facts Essential Facts Interesting Facts The giraffe\u2019s long neck can stretch more than 7 feet in length. The giraffe\u2019s neck makes up almost half of its overall height. Like humans, the giraffes have 7 vertebrae the neck. In general, an adult giraffe stands 14 to 19 ft. A giraffe\u2019s legs stand 6 ft tall. The Giraffe is the tallest creature in the animal kingdom. Giraffes can run as fast as 60 km/h. At a regular pace, giraffes walk 15 km/h. A giraffe\u2019s diet consists of the leaves and twigs of acacia, mimosa, and wild apricot trees. Giraffes in captivity lie down while sleeping. Giraffes have a lifespan of 25 years. Baby giraffes are called calves. Calves can stand and walk right after birth. Giraffes\u2019 main predators are lions, leopards, and hyenas. Many calves die early because they are the primary target of their predators. Giraffes give birth while standing up. Usually, giraffes also sleep while sitting or standing. A giraffe\u2019s neck is \u201ctoo short\u201d to reach the ground \u2013 they have to kneel or spread their front legs to drink water from the ground. Giraffes in the wild remain standing as a way to ward off predators. Most of a giraffe\u2019s water intake comes from the plants they consume, so they only need to gulp water once every few days.\nTable of Contents 01 Giraffes were once called \"camel-leopards.\" 02 Giraffes originated from the savanna areas in the Sub-Saharan region of Africa. 03 The West African Giraffe came close to extinction. 04 The Rothschild's Giraffe got its name from Walter Rothschild. 05 The giraffe's tongue is 20 inches long. 06 The Reticulated Giraffe is the \"most common\" in the world. 07 The Masai Giraffe is the biggest subspecies of Giraffe. 08 The Angolan Giraffe only exists in 4 African countries. 09 The South African Giraffe is only found in 5 African countries. 10 Necking is the most violent experience for giraffes. 11 A giraffe's spots are like human fingerprints. 12 Giraffes only sleep 30 minutes a day. 13 Giraffes make many sounds and noises. 14 A group of giraffes is called \"tower.\" 15 Giraffes consume over 35 kilos of food per day. 16 Calves drink milk from their mother for the first four to six months. 17 Giraffes are not territorial. 18 Male giraffes can fight with each other to get the right to mate with the females. 19 Giraffes are the third heaviest animals in the world. 20 A giraffe's heart weighs around 25 lbs. 21 A running giraffe may appear to be moving in slow-motion. 22 Giraffes are not entirely defenseless. 23 Giraffe horns are called ossicones. 24 Giraffe hooves are almost the same size as a dinner plate. 25 Some people eat giraffes. 26 The giraffe's individual numbers continue to plummet. 27 Giraffes are endangered due to 4 main reasons. 28 Male giraffes can test a female's fertility. 29 World Giraffe Day was established in 2014. 30 White giraffes are a product of rare pigmentation.\nGiraffes were once called \"camel-leopards.\" It may sound like the most unlikely combination of animals, but it\u2019s true: When the first giraffe was brought to Europe and presented to Julius Caesar in 46 BC, the Romans believed it was a combination of a camel and a leopard. Hence, the species name Camelopardalis. It comes from the Greek \u201cKamelos,\u201d which means \u201ccamel,\u201d and \u201cPardalis,\u201d which means \u201cleopard.\u201d Bet you didn\u2019t expect that for giraffe facts?\nGiraffes originated from the savanna areas in the Sub-Saharan region of Africa. Giraffes originated from the savanna areas in the Sub-Saharan region of Africa. Today, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recognizes the giraffes as one species with 9 subspecies. However, a 2007 study on the genetics of giraffes advised that there should be 6 species instead: the West African, Rothschild\u2019s, Reticulated, Masai, Angolan, and South African giraffe.\nThe West African Giraffe came close to extinction. Also known as the Nigerien giraffe, the West African giraffe is distinguished for its light-colored spots. The Nigerien giraffe population fluctuates based on seasonal migration within the drought-resistant lowlands of the Niger River valley and the drier highlands near Kour\u00e9.In the 1990s, its population went as low as 50 individual giraffes. However, with the help of the government\u2019s programs over 450 wild giraffes have been rehabilitated.\nRead also: 50 Incredible Moose Facts About The Worlds Largest Deer Species\nThe Rothschild's Giraffe got its name from Walter Rothschild. The Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe is named after Walter Rothschild, a British banker, politician, and zoologist. Distinguished for its unique coat, the Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe sports dark orange and brown patches with areas of beige, and no markings on its lower legs.\nThe giraffe's tongue is 20 inches long. The giraffe\u2019s tongue can reach up to 20 inches long. The giraffe tongue is usually colored black, blue or purple to protect against the sun\u2019s UV rays. Now that\u2019s one for giraffe facts that\u2019ll get you tongue-tied.\nThe Reticulated Giraffe is the \"most common\" in the world. Originating from a peninsula called the Horn of Africa, the Reticulated giraffe is the most common giraffe seen in zoos. The Reticulated giraffe\u2019s coat has large, polygonal, liver-colored spots outlined by a group of bright-white lines. The spots can often appear in deep reddish-orange, which can also cover their legs.\nThe Masai Giraffe is the biggest subspecies of Giraffe. The biggest subspecies of giraffe is the Masai giraffe. Found in Kenya and Tanzania, it has distinctive, jagged, irregular, star-like blotches that extend to their hooves. The Masai giraffe got its name in honor of Herr von Tippelskirch. He is a member of a German scientific expedition in East Africa.\nThe Angolan Giraffe only exists in 4 African countries. Found in Northern Namibia, South-western Zambia, Botswana, and Western Zimbabwe, the Angolan Giraffe subspecies has big brown blotches with edges that are relatively notched or have angular extensions. Its spotting pattern stretches down to its legs, but not the upper part of its face.\nThe South African Giraffe is only found in 5 African countries. The South African giraffe is also known as the Cape giraffe. As its name suggests, it is a subspecies of Giraffe native to South Africa, Mozambique, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. South African giraffes have spots with star-like extensions on a light tan base, all the way down to the hooves. The estimated population of South African Giraffe is at 31,500 individuals in the wild.\nRead also: 50 Thrilling Tarantula Facts That Are Too Big To Miss\nNecking is the most violent experience for giraffes. Necking is the proper term for \u201cgiraffe-fighting.\u201d In a giraffe\u2019s environment, it is the most aggressive experience they are most likely to get in. Necking usually comes with head-butts, jousting, kicking, and biting.\nA giraffe's spots are like human fingerprints. Aside from the fact that giraffes have seven vertebrae the neck like humans, its spots in the body are much like human fingerprints. All the colored-spots of the Giraffe have different patterns. How\u2019s that for cool giraffe facts?\nGiraffes only sleep 30 minutes a day. To protect themselves from predators, giraffes in the wild learn to sleep for only 30 minutes a day. If you think that\u2019s extreme, here\u2019s another one for giraffe facts: a giraffe\u2019s total sleeping time is spread throughout the day in quick naps. However, in captivity giraffes can snooze more than 4 hours a day.\nGiraffes make many sounds and noises. Contrary to the belief of many that giraffes don\u2019t make a sound or noise, giraffes do hiss, snort, make \u201cwhistle-like cries,\u201d as well as create low-frequency noises that can\u2019t be heard by the human ear. In other words, giraffes have vocal cords. Typically, young giraffes make most of these sounds since they are less cautious. Definitely one of the cooler giraffe facts.\nA group of giraffes is called \"tower.\" One of the giraffe facts you can\u2019t miss: A group of giraffes is called a \u201ctower,\u201d which is only fitting as it is the tallest animal on Earth.\nGiraffes consume over 35 kilos of food per day. Since adult giraffes can only get a few servings with each bite, they spend most of their time eating to meet their caloric need of around 35 kilos. Aside from their size, wild giraffes need so much food since they spend most of their time standing up.\nCalves drink milk from their mother for the first four to six months. Baby giraffes or calves only breastfeed for the first 4-6 months. From the 7th month onwards, the calves begin to eat leaves. However, if the calves still can\u2019t reach the leaves from the trees, their mothers will pull leaves off and feed them to them. Isn\u2019t that one for cute giraffe facts?\nGiraffes are not territorial. Giraffes are very social creatures, and they are not territorial at all. A tower of giraffes typically has 10 to 20 members without a dominant leader in their herd. Tower members are usually free to come and go as they wish.\nMale giraffes can fight with each other to get the right to mate with the females. Giraffes may be one of the most social animals on the planet, but they still fight with each other for their mates.\nGiraffes are the third heaviest animals in the world. A young giraffe can weigh more than 150 lbs. On average, an adult giraffe approximately weighs 1,765 lbs. After the elephants and rhinos, giraffes are the 3rd heaviest animals in the world, and in some cases, other species of Giraffe can be as massive as 4,255 pounds.\nA giraffe's heart weighs around 25 lbs. While the human heart only weighs around 300 grams, the heart of a giraffe can weigh 25 pounds, making it the biggest heart of any land mammal. The giraffe\u2019s heart pumps 60 liters of blood in their body every minute.\nA running giraffe may appear to be moving in slow-motion. If you observe a running giraffe in the wild, it may look like it\u2019s running in slow motion. However, since giraffes have the longest stride of all land mammals, its \u201cslow-mo\u201d movement reaches speeds of 60 km/h. Unlike horses, giraffes run by moving both legs on the same side of their body together, which makes them look like they\u2019re running in slow-mo.\nRead also: 40 Pomeranian Dog Facts That Are Too Adorable\nGiraffes are not entirely defenseless. The giraffe\u2019s gentle nature might make it seem like giraffes would run from an attack, but giraffes are not entirely defenseless. One kick from a giraffe\u2019s 6 ft legs can cause severe damage and even death for its pursuers.\nGiraffe horns are called ossicones. The horn of the giraffes are called ossicones (horn-like or antler-like bumps on the heads). Both males and females have ossicones which were formed from ossified cartilage covered in skin.\nGiraffe hooves are almost the same size as a dinner plate. With a diameter of 30 centimeters, a giraffe\u2019s hooves are almost the size of a dinner plate. Their big hooves protect them from sinking into loose sand, regardless of their massive weight.\nSome people eat giraffes. In some places in Africa, people kill giraffes for their meat. In those areas, natives would consume any kind of meat that they can find for survival. The giraffe has a natural sweetness that may not be to everybody\u2019s taste, and many say that it is not as tasty as other animals. Now that\u2019s one of the giraffe facts to chew on.\nThe giraffe's individual numbers continue to plummet. Thirty years ago, there were around 150,000 giraffes that roamed the savannas. However, as of today, the number of wild giraffes still roaming their habitats has been cut down by 40%-50%.\nGiraffes are endangered due to 4 main reasons. Human-wildlife conflict, meat consumption, illegal wildlife trade, and the expansion of human agriculture all contribute to giraffes\u2019 dwindling population.\nRead also: 30 Strange Flamingo Facts That You Never Knew About\nMale giraffes can test a female's fertility. The male giraffe can test a female\u2019s fertility by tasting her urine. In a phenomenon known as the Flehmen sequence, males would take mouthful of a female\u2019s urine to know if she\u2019d be a good mate or not. By doing so, the male giraffe can distinguish whether the female is in heat.\nWorld Giraffe Day was established in 2014. The World Giraffe Day is a yearly event and gathering initiated by the Giraffe Conservation Federation to celebrate the longest-necked animal on the longest day of the year: June 21st."}

They are well known for their long necks, long legs, and spotted patterns. Giraffes have small \"horns\" or knobs on top of their heads that grow to be about five inches long. These knobs are used to protect the head in fights.\nMale giraffes are larger than females. Males weigh between 2,400 and 3,000 pounds and stand up to 19 feet tall. Female giraffes weigh between 1,600 and 2,600 pounds and grow to be 16 feet tall.\nGiraffes can be found in central, eastern and southern Africa. They live in the savannas of Africa, where they roam freely among the tall trees, arid land, dense forests and open plains. Giraffe populations are relatively stable.\nTheir long necks help giraffes eat leaves from tall trees, typically acacia trees. If they need to, giraffes can go for several days without water. Instead of drinking, giraffes stay hydrated by the moisture from leaves.\nGiraffes are non-territorial, social animals. They travel in large herds that are not organized in any way. Herds may consist of any combination of sexes or ages. Female giraffes typically give birth to one calf after a fifteen-month gestation period. During the first week of its life, the mother carefully guards her calf. Young giraffes are very vulnerable and cannot defend themselves. While mothers feed, the young are kept in small nursery groups.\nGiraffes have spots covering their entire bodies, except their underbellies, with each giraffe having a unique pattern of spots. Giraffes have long necks, which they use to browse the leaves of trees. They also have slightly elongated forelegs, about 10% longer than their hind legs. Like nearly all mammals, a giraffe has seven neck vertebrae, which are extremely elongated. These bones produce bud like horns called ossicorns.\nModifications to the giraffe's structure have evolved, particularly to the circulatory system. A giraffe's heart, which can weigh up to 24 lb, has to generate around double the normal blood pressure for a large mammal in order to maintain blood flow to the brain against gravity. In the upper neck, a complex pressure regulation system called the rete mirabile prevents excess blood flow to the brain when the giraffe lowers its head to drink. Conversely, the blood vessels in the lower legs are under great pressure (because of the weight of fluid pressing down on them). In other animals such pressure would force the blood out through the capillary walls; giraffes, however, have a very tight sheath of thick skin over their lower limbs which maintains high extravascular pressure in exactly the same way as a pilot's suit.\nMale giraffes determine female fertility by tasting the female's urine to detect estrus in a multi step process known as the Flehmen response. Giraffe gestation lasts between 14 and 15 months, after which a single calf is born. The mother gives birth standing up and the embryonic sack actually bursts when the baby falls to the ground. Within a few hours of being born, calves can run around and are indistinguishable from a week old calf; however, for the first two weeks, they spend most of their time lying down, guarded by the mother. While adult giraffes are too large to be attacked by most predators, the young can fall prey to lions, leopards, hyenas, and African Wild Dogs. It has been speculated that their characteristic spotted pattern provides a certain degree of camouflage. Only 25 to 50% of giraffe calves reach adulthood; the life expectancy is between 20 and 25 years in the wild and 28 years in captivity.\nThe giraffe browses on the twigs of trees, preferring plants of the Mimosa genus; but it appears that it can, without inconvenience, live on other vegetable food. A giraffe can eat 140 lb of leaves and twigs daily. The pace of the giraffe is an amble, though when pursued they can run extremely fast. They cannot sustain a lengthened chase. Their leg length compels an unusual gait with the left legs moving together followed by right (similar to pacing) at low speed, and the back legs crossing outside the front at high speed.\nThe giraffe defends itself against threats by kicking with great force. A single well placed kick of an adult giraffe can shatter a lion's skull or break its spine. The giraffe has one of the shortest sleep requirements of any mammal, which is between 20 minutes and two hours in a 24 hour period.\nA giraffe will clean off any bugs that appear on their faces with an extremely long tongue (about 18 inches). The tongue is tough on account of the giraffe's diet, which includes thorns from the tree it is making a meal of. In Southern Africa, giraffes are partial to all acacias \u2014 especially Acacia erioloba \u2014 and possess a specially adapted tongue and lips that appear to be immune to the vicious thorns.\nGiraffes are thought to be mute. However, recent research has shown evidence that the animal communicates at an infrasound level.\nTHREATS TO GIRAFFES\nGiraffes are threatened by hunting for their meat, coat and tails. The tail is prized for good luck bracelets, fly whisks and string for sewing beads. The coat is used for shield coverings. Habitat destruction and fragmentation are also threats to giraffe populations.\nGiraffes are also victims of captivity for human entertainment. Even under the best of circumstances, captivity is cruel for giraffes. Confined to tiny areas and gawked at by crowds, animals in exhibits endure constant stress. They may suffer from temperature extremes and irregular feeding and watering. Without exercise, they become listless, their immune systems are weakened, and they become prone to sickness; many resort to self-mutilation in reaction to stress or boredom. Mental illness is rampant among confined animals. Torn from their families and deprived of all dignity, every part of their lives is controlled by their captors.\nWhile zoos and aquariums may appear to be educational and conservation-oriented, most are designed with the needs and desires of the visitors in mind, not the needs of the animals. Many animals in zoos and aquariums exhibit abnormal behavior as a result of being deprived of their natural environments and social structures. When the facility breeds too many animals they become \"surplus\" and often are sold to laboratories, traveling shows, shooting ranches, or to private individuals who may be unqualified to care for them."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe Facts", "url": "https://giraffeconservation.org/facts/what-are-the-main-threats-to-giraffe-why-are-their-numbers-declining/", "text": "The combined impacts of habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, habitat degradation, human population growth, poaching (illegal hunting), disease, and war and civil unrest threaten the remaining giraffe and their distribution throughout Africa. Many threats arise from direct, indirect or perceived competition for resources with humans and their livestock. Habitat degradation and loss is caused by an increasing human demand for agricultural land, pastoralism, and unsustainable timber and fuel-wood harvesting.\nHuman-giraffe conflict is not common, but can develop due to crop loss and damage, and potential disease transmission can result from habitat sharing with domestic livestock. The fragmentation and loss of giraffe habitat caused by human encroachment and infrastructure development often leads to the isolation of giraffe populations which, in turn, can limit the flow and exchange of genetic diversity between populations.\nThe interbreeding of giraffe species poses a potential threat as it could result in the loss of the genetic uniqueness of each individual species. Although there is essentially no evidence of species naturally interbreeding in the wild, the translocation of one species of giraffe to an area already occupied by a different species could create the risk of hybridisation \u2013a situation that is already occurring in South Africa.\nLimiting factors\nThe giraffe has a distinct advantage in that it seldom competes with other wild animals or, more importantly, domestic livestock for food. Although conflict does sometimes occur, they do not normally pose a threat to humans. Nevertheless, there are several factors that affect conservation initiatives throughout Africa.\nScientific\nThe existence of long-term studies, reliable historical and current data, and targeted conservation research concerning giraffe is limited. This lack of information remains one of the most limiting factors when it comes to improving their conservation and management, as well as their ecology and taxonomy. However, exciting advances are being made. GCF\u2019s collaborative Africa-wide genetic research has unravelled the mystery surrounding the giraffe\u2019s taxonomy, providing invaluable information for all four species\u2019 future conservation and management. Some of the current projects and studies in Africa are the first ever to be undertaken of giraffe in their natural environments.\nConservation translocation projects can be highly beneficial for establishing new or bolstering small existing giraffe populations, but they are a significant and challenging logistical undertaking. Conservationists go to great lengths in their efforts to secure giraffe populations, and success has already been achieved in southern Africa and more recently in Kenya, Malawi, Niger and Uganda. Despite the logistical challenges, GCF\u2019s conservation translocation programme, working closely with governments and other partners, has already increased and/or augmented over 7 million acres of giraffe habitat.\nGPS satellite tracking units have become an important aid for understanding giraffe habitat use, post-translocation monitoring, seasonal movements, and home ranges, be they in and around human settlements or across international borders. The information these devices provide is invaluable for supporting long-term species and land management plans for giraffe and other wildlife. GCF\u2019s Twiga Tracker initiative is the largest GPS satellite tracking programme ever conducted on giraffe. By understanding giraffe spatial ecology across Africa, GCF is developing innovative conservation strategies for protecting giraffe and their habitats. However, tracking giraffe using GPS satellite units require great investment in both time, innovation and resources; the cost of which is born largely by GCF and our partners. Additionally, the very nature of giraffe being such a uniquely built animal, this undertaking is something of a challenge!\nEcological\nGiraffe populations naturally fluctuate due to mortality through predation and disease, and this varies from population to population. Lion are giraffe\u2019s biggest natural predator. In some populations, lion are responsible for the mortality of more than 50% of calves in their first year. Giraffe are less vulnerable to leopard and spotted hyena and to an even lesser extent to cheetah and crocodile. Population growth is also limited by drought, which results in poor food quality and quantity and malnutrition, as well as diseases such as anthrax and, historically, rinderpest. Additionally, the poaching (illegal hunting) of giraffe by humans poses a threat throughout certain areas of their range.\nSocial\nWhen it comes to conservation, giraffe compete with more charismatic species such as African elephant and rhinos, particularly for funding. It is estimated that the current giraffe population is only just over a third of the African savanna elephant\u2019s. This discrepancy, and little-known fact by most in the world, leads many people to assume that giraffe are everywhere and do not face a conservation crisis \u2013 but the almost 30% population decline over the past three and a half decades clearly demonstrates that it does."}

For teaching and sharing purposes, readers are advised to supplement these historic articles with more up-to-date ones suggested in the Related Articles below.\nGiraffes \u2026 animals that stand out in a crowd\nby Lynn Hofland\nGiraffes truly do stand out in a crowd. At the zoo or in their natural habitat of Central Africa, they tower above other beasts, and are the second largest land animals alive today (the African elephant is the largest). The length of the giraffe\u2019s neck has intrigued observers down through the years. \u2018How did the giraffe get its long neck?\u2019, some ask.\nwikipedia.org\nOn witnessing a 3-metre (10 foot) shoulder high giraffe stretch its 2.5 metre (8 foot) neck to its limit, and then add almost another foot with its long grasping tongue for that seemingly out-of-reach branch high in an acacia tree, some might believe that the stretching process drove the growth process for the giraffe\u2019s neck. But really, is a giraffe capable of adding anything to its stature?\nIf one feature did change, would it not affect the whole? Let\u2019s consider the giraffe.\nThe giraffe is a mammal, therefore much of its anatomy is similar to that of other mammals. Like most other mammals, the giraffe has seven neck bones. What if it did not have seven bones between the shoulders and the base of the skull? Man\u2019s short neck supports a perfectly balanced head in the erect posture with very little effort. The giraffe\u2019s huge head must be held aloft at all times. When standing, nearly half of its approximately 225-kilogram (500 pound) neck muscles are in tension. The amount of muscle required is directly related to the number of joints that must be supported. Reducing the joints to just two, at the skull and at the chest, would reduce the weight considerably and require less energy for survival. If the shortage of food drove the neck to change, would not the number of neck bones and joints be changeable also by such evolutionary processes? Of course the problem with this design would be a loss of flexibility, and would severely increase breakability if the giraffe received a blow to the head or neck.\nIn the same respect, having a megajointed neck would require the exact opposite\u2014greater energy use and greater muscle mass to be supported. This would cause the giraffe\u2019s centre of gravity to shift ahead of the front legs when the head is extended straight forward, causing the hind legs to come off the ground\u2014assuming the front legs were strong enough. Seven neck bones is excellent design.\nWith the head being so high in the air, the huge heart of the giraffe must be capable of delivering sufficient oxygen-rich blood three metres (10 feet) up to the brain. This would be a problem (involving too high blood pressure) when the giraffe was head-down drinking water, were it not for a unique collection of reinforced artery walls, by-pass and antipooling valves, a web of small blood vessels (the rete mirabile, or \u2018marvellous net\u2019)1 and pressure-sensing signals that keep adequate blood flow to the brain at just the right pressure. Even to those who consider this as just \u2018adaptation to high gravitational pressures in its cardiovascular system\u2019, the giraffe is unique.2\nGravity-suits\nThe giraffe\u2019s heart is probably the most powerful among animals, because about double normal pressure is required to pump blood up the giraffe\u2019s long neck to the brain. With such high blood pressure, only special design features prevent it from \u2018blowing its mind\u2019 when it bends down to take a drink.\nEqually marvellous is the fact the blood does not pool in the legs, and a giraffe does not bleed profusely if cut on the leg. The secret lies in an extremely tough skin and an inner fascia that prevents blood pooling. This skin combination has been studied extensively by NASA scientists in their development of gravity-suits for astronauts. Equally helpful to prevent profuse bleeding is that all arteries and veins in the giraffe\u2019s legs are very internal.\nThe capillaries that reach the surface are extremely small, and the red blood cells are about one-third the size of their human counterparts, making capillary passage possible. It quickly becomes apparent that these unique facets of the giraffe are all interactive and interdependent with its long neck.\nBut there\u2019s more. The smaller red blood cells allow for more surface area and a higher and faster absorption of oxygen into the blood. This helps to retain adequate oxygen to all extremities, including the head.\nThe lungs work in conjunction with the heart to supply the giraffe with the necessary oxygen, but in a way that is unique to the giraffe. The giraffe\u2019s lungs are eight times the size of those of humans, and its respiratory rate is about one-third that of humans. Breathing more slowly is necessary in order to exchange the required large volume of air without causing windburn to the giraffe\u2019s rippled 3.6 metres (12 feet) of trachea. When the animal takes in a fresh breath, the oxygen-depleted previous breath cannot be totally expelled. For the giraffe this problem is compounded by the long trachea that will retain more dead air than man can inhale in one breath. There must be enough lung volume to make this \u2018bad air\u2019 a small percentage of the total. This is a physics problem that the giraffe has solved.\nBirth of giraffe\nTo add to the wonder, the birth of a newborn giraffe seals the case for an intelligent design. The new calf drops into life from 1.5 metres (five feet) up, as the mother is incapable of comfortably squatting to the ground, and to lie down during birth would be a sure invitation for a lion or other predator to attack the mother. As in all mammals, the head is disproportionately large compared to the rest of the body at birth, and it becomes a challenge to pass it down the birth canal.\nThe baby giraffe has the added challenge of having a very fragile long neck attaching it to the rest of its 70-kilogram (150-pound) newborn body. If the head came out first, the neck would surely break when the rest of the body fell on top of it. If the head came out last, the neck would surely break as the body weight attempted to jerk the head out of the mother. Such an apparent impasse is solved by the rear hips being much smaller than the front shoulders, and the neck is just long enough to allow the head to pass through the birth canal resting on the rear hips. The hind feet exit first to break the fall on the rest of the animal, The head is supported and cushioned by the rear hips, and the neck is pliable, allowing a sharp bend around the front shoulders.\nThis is a perfect exit, that would be impossible in any other combination or with any other new length of neck. Within minutes the new calf is gracefully standing between the mother\u2019s legs. From birth to adulthood in just four years, the neck grows from being one-sixth to one-third of the giraffe\u2019s total height. Such growth is required for the animal to overcome its leg height and to bend to get a drink of water. The calf\u2019s first year of food is almost exclusively its mother\u2019s rich milk, which can be reached easily.\nEcologically, the giraffe is perfectly matched to its environment. There is need of a tree trimmer to keep the fast-growing shade trees from overshadowing the ground and killing the much needed grass that provides food for the other savanna animals. There is also need of a sentinel that can see above the tall grass and observe the movements of the predator cats. The giraffe is not only tall enough for this, but has excellent eyesight and a curious disposition. After warning other animals with several swishes of the tail, the giraffe boldly strides out of harm\u2019s way. The great body height, tough skin layers, deadly rear hoof kick, and long, rapid stride make the adult giraffe an undesirable prey for any carnivore.3\nTo suggest that all of this could have evolved in one class of animal, lacking any conceivable close relatives, and becoming so developed solely due to a supposed lack of food at ground level, is preposterous. Should not others which feed at ground level, being vulnerable to big cats, and being bombarded by the same cosmic radiation, have achieved a more giraffe-like stature?\nInterestingly, there are others that do feed from trees. The gerenuk gazelle of Africa has the longest neck in the family of gazelles, has a long tongue, and eats leaves from trees while standing on its hind legs. The markhor goat of Afghanistan climbs trees as high as 25 feet to eat leaves from trees. Other mammals do desire the leaves of trees but none of them will ever become giraffes, and the giraffe most certainly did not come from any other \u2018less-than-giraffe\u2019 animal.\n\u2018We cannot know that conditions were the same in the past, but the \u201cneed to survive by reaching ever higher for food\u201d is, like so many Darwinian explanations of its kind, little more than a post hoc speculation.\u20194 The fossil record confirms this, and the unique and marvellous design seen in this animal verifies it. The praise, glory and honour goes to the giraffe\u2019s Creator."}

Video they posted on YouTube recently skyrocketed in popularity as viewers marveled over the rarity of seeing the pale animal.\nWhile many have been quick to label the giraffe as albino, it likely suffers from a genetic condition called leucism, which inhibits skin cells from producing pigment but allows other organs, like eyes, to be dark colored. Albinism, a congenital condition, inhibits the body from producing pigment in all organs, and animals with this condition often have pink eyes.\nThe condition, while rare, is not unheard of. It was last seen in a giraffe calf at Tanzania\u2019s Tarangire National Park.\n1:07\nDespite their inability to produce colorful pigment, giraffes and other animals with leucism don\u2019t face genetic disadvantages to their survival, but their color can attract unwanted attention.\nMore than half of all giraffes don\u2019t make it past six months of age, according to the Giraffe Conservation Foundation. They\u2019re targeted by predators such as lions and hyenas.\nIn the comment section of the Hirola Conservation Program\u2019s video, viewers also voiced concerns that widely circulating images of the animals and their location could make them more susceptible to poaching.\nFollowing the birth of a white giraffe in their refuge, the Tarangire National Park took care to ensure the giraffe was safe from poachers. Hirola has not announced any such security.\nHirola noted in a blog post that this was the first time many of the community rangers had seen a white giraffe. They anecdotally wondered if the genetic condition is becoming more common, but no studies revealed whether this could be true.\nGiraffes aren\u2019t the only animal to make headlines for unique, white fur. Earlier this month, a rare white moose was seen in Sweden walking through tall grass. White lions and white penguins have also been spotted with similar pigment conditions.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Masai giraffe - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masai_giraffe", "text": "Species of giraffe\nThe Masai giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi or G. tippelskirchi), also spelled Maasai giraffe, and sometimes called Kilimanjaro giraffe, is one of the nine subspecies of giraffe. It is native to East Africa. The Masai giraffe can be found in central and southern Kenya and in Tanzania. It has distinctive, irregular, jagged, star-like blotches that extend from the hooves to its head. The Masai giraffe is currently the national animal of Tanzania.\nTaxonomy [ edit ]\nThe IUCN currently recognizes only one species of giraffe with nine subspecies The Masai giraffe was described and given the binomial name Giraffa tippelskirchi by German zoologist Paul Matschie in 1898, but current taxonomy refers to Masai giraffe as Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi. The Masai giraffe was named in honor of Herr von Tippelskirch who was a member of a German scientific expedition in German East Africa to what is now northern Tanzania in 1896. Tippelskirch brought back the skin of a female Masai giraffe from near Lake Eyasi which was later on identified as Giraffa tippelskirchi. Alternative taxonomic hypotheses have proposed Masai giraffe may be its own species.\nDescription [ edit ]\nThe Masai giraffe is distinguished by jagged and irregular spots on its body. Its geographic range includes various parts of central, eastern, and southern Africa. It is the largest-bodied giraffe species, making it the tallest land animal on Earth. Bulls are generally larger and heavier than females, weighing close to 1300 kilograms and growing up to 5 and a half meters in height. In the wild, individuals can live to be around 25 years of age, and in most cases can live longer in captivity. The giraffes most famous feature, its neck, contains seven vertebrae and makes up roughly one third of its body height. Its long and muscular tongue, which can be up to 50 centimeters in length, is prehensile and allows it to grab leaves from tall trees that are inaccessible to other animals. The tongues darker pigment is believed to function as a natural sunscreen and prevent sunburn. On top of the head sit two bony structures called ossicones which are covered by thick skin and have dark hair on the tips. These can be used during fights to club its opponent. Bulls usually have an extra ossicone present that is located on their head in between the eyes. Although considered lanky, when galloping they have been recorded to reach speeds of almost 40 miles per hour.\nConservation [ edit ]\nMasai giraffes are considered endangered by the IUCN, and the Masai giraffe population declined 52% in recent decades due to poaching and habitat loss. Overall, the approximate number of all populations accumulate to 32,550 in the wild. Demographic studies of wild giraffes living inside and outside protected areas suggest low adult survival outside protected areas due to poaching, and low calf survival inside protected areas due to predation are the primary influences on population growth rates. Survival of giraffe calves is influenced by the season of birth, and the seasonal local presence or absence of long-distance migratory herds of wildebeest and zebra. Metapopulation analysis indicated protected areas were important for keeping giraffes in the larger landscape. In situ conservation of Masai giraffes is being done by several government agencies including Kenya Wildlife Service, Tanzania National Parks, Zambia Wildlife Authority; and non-governmental organizations including PAMS Foundation, and Wild Nature Institute. Community-based wildlife conservation areas have also been shown to be effective at protecting giraffes. Over 100 Masai Giraffe currently live under human care in AZA accredited zoos in the United States. At several zoos, Masai giraffe cows have become pregnant and successfully given birth. Masai giraffes have been known to suffer from giraffe skin disease (GSD) which is an undetermined disorder that etiologically causes lesion on the forelimbs of Masai giraffes. This disorder is being further investigated by scientists to better understand mortality rates in this species.\nGallery [ edit ]\nSee also [ edit ]"}

But sadly, due to many factors, they have fallen vulnerable to poaching and deforestation. In fact, giraffe population has decreased by 40% in the last three decades. According to the International Union for Conservation of nature, two giraffe subspecies have been listed as Critically Endangered. For more about why are giraffes endangered 2019 and how we as humans can help them, keep reading here at AnimalWised.\nGiraffe characteristics\nThe giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), as we\u2019ve already mentioned, is one of the most popular African animals. This is mainly thanks to its famous characteristic long and powerful neck, a result of centuries of evolution. In fact, a giraffe\u2019s neck is a key example of Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of natural selection. However, aside from its neck, giraffes also stand out for being the tallest terrestrial animal in the world, as well as one of the heaviest. Giraffes are herbivorous animals that feed mainly on leaves from trees. These gregarious animals live in groups. There are 9 recognized giraffe subspecies which are distinguish by fur pattern. The 9 giraffe subspecies include: Northern giraffe Kordofan giraffe\nNubian giraffe - CRITICALLY ENDANGERED\nRothschild\u2019s giraffe\nThe West African giraffe - CRITICALLY ENDANGERED Reticulated giraffe Also known as the Somali giraffe. Southern Giraffe Angolan giraffe\nSouth African giraffe Masai Giraffe Masai giraffe\nThornicroft\u2019s giraffe (Rhodesian giraffe) - CRITICALLY ENDANGERED For more about these fascinating animals, we recommend reading our article where we discuss why are giraffes a vulnerable species?\nAre giraffes endangered?\nGiraffes are currently in danger of extinction. According to data provided by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the giraffe population has been in declined since 1985. As a result, giraffe population has decreased 40% in the last three decades. Are black giraffes endangered? Yes, the black giraffe is also in danger of extinction. However, it is fundamental to point out that the black giraffe is not a subspecies. Black giraffes are distinguished by a spontaneous coat coloration that is present in some individuals by gene dominance. It\u2019s also important to note that many dominant male giraffes darken with age and are confused with black giraffes.\nWhy are giraffes going extinct?\nSo, taking into consideration this accelerated decrease of the giraffe species, how many giraffes are left in the world? According to the IUCN: it is estimated that in 1985 there were 163,452 giraffes worldwide, of which 114,416 were adults able to reproduce. However, at present, it is estimated that there are only 97,562 giraffes, of which 68,293 are mature giraffes. Giraffes are distributed over different parts of the African continent, but the variations of population are not stable. For example, there are some giraffes species that currently maintain a stable number of individuals, however, most of them are show a significant decline. For more about this wonderful species, we recommend taking a look at our article where we discuss giraffe habit and distribution.\nReasons why giraffes are endangered\nReasons why giraffes are endangered include: Loss of its habitat: human action within different ecosystems has been a predominant cause of this gradual deterioration. Giraffes have suffered habit deterioration due to livestock activities, mining, deforestation and human population increase, which brings about village expansion. War conflicts: African conflicts such as the Somali Civil War, the Chad-Sudan conflict, the Nigerian war, the South-Sudan civil war or the Second Libyan Civil War have all had a negative effect on giraffe population numbers. In addition, violent activity harshly affects the fauna and flora within these countries. Illegal hunting: illegal hunting and giraffe poaching is one of the greatest threats to wildlife worldwide. The hunting of giraffes has been carried out as a \"sport\" since the 19th century, although nowadays it is considered illegal. Giraffes are hunted for their skin, meat and bones. Keep reading to find out how to help giraffes.\nWhy are giraffes endangered and how can we help\nDue to the fact that giraffes are so worryingly endangered, there are many conservation programs working to save these wonderful animals. However, drastic measures need to taken for effectiveness. Many giraffe species need to be relocated to safer spaces so that they are no longer at risk of war or poaching. In addition, programs to recover soil and natural habitat must be implemented to reverse the effects of ecosystem deterioration. Similarly, education of the human population is required. Only by creating awareness of the importance of respecting wildlife will we be able to change the way in which people protect fauna.

Today, GCF estimates the current Africa-wide giraffe population at approximately 117,000 individuals. This is a drop by almost 30%, a slightly less bleak picture than previously portrayed in the 2016 IUCN Red List assessment that estimated giraffe at less than 100,000 individuals. However, this updated information is based more on improved data rather than on actual increases in numbers. Unfortunately, in some areas traditionally regarded as prime giraffe habitat, numbers have dropped by 95% in the same period.\nLimited conservation research has been undertaken on giraffe throughout Africa. While the IUCN Red List currently recognises one species of giraffe and nine subspecies, new findings by GCF and partners clearly show four species and five subspecies of giraffe.

Sorry, no. Putting your dog in a funny costume? Getting there, but still a ways off. An elderly couple walking down the street holding hands? Close, but no cigar. It turns out there is actually nothing more adorable than baby animals. Yup, that\u2019s right, NOTHING! And we consider ourselves authorities on this matter. This is part of why the internet exists: to brighten up your day with the miniature versions of full-grown beasties.\nSo, if the world has been getting you down a bit (or even if it hasn\u2019t) let\u2019s take a break from all the chaos and learn some charming facts about our favorite subject in the world: baby animals.\nBaby Animals Facts\n40. Alpha Betta Momma\nBefore they are even born, Siamese fighting fish need all the help they can get. For whatever reason, female fighting fish have an innate hankering for the taste of their own eggs (caviar anyone?), meaning that in almost every instance, the Siamese father must step in and fight their right to live a life aquatic.\nOk so that one was\u2026 maybe not so cute. But stick with us! It gets better from here on out.\n39. Parrot Names\nBaby parrots are all essentially given names at birth. After giving birth, a parrot will develop a particular call for its offspring, who will then adopt the same call, with some slight variation to make it its own.\nAdditionally, parrots experience a phenomenon common to most species of birds called \u201cimprinting\u201d, whereby new-born parrots latch on to the first moving/living thing they lay eyes on, and accept it as their parent. Most often, of course, this is their mom or dad\u2026 but if a parrot opens its eyes to see a human being, they\u2019ll often assume the person is their family.\n38. Consider us Lucky\n97% of the animal kingdom does not experience the privilege of a childhood under the care of both mom and dad. For the vast majority of creatures on Earth, the responsibilities of parenthood fall primarily on one gender.\nHowever, puffin babies are just like us in this regard: they almost invariably get the full benefits of two parents growing up.\nPuffins are monogamous maters and after childbirth\u2014the male will usually stick around to raise the child in tandem with the mother.\n37. Lizard Lunch\nBasically no-one on Earth spends enough time being thankful that they weren\u2019t born a Long-Tailed Skink Lizard. Heck, many of us don\u2019t even think about it at all. But, if you happen to have a spare 5 minutes right now, it might be worth saying a quick thanks to the universe for making you a person. It might not be all fun-and-games in a typical human life\u2026 but at the very least, most of us avoid being eaten by our moms.\nSee, unlike most lizards, skink moms do hang around long enough to ensure their babies grow up, if not happy, at the very least healthy and strong. So far, so good right? Well\u2026 not so much. When the going gets tough, the skink mom has basically only one trick up her sleeve: if their nest is threatened before the babies grow to maturity, they will waste no time in devouring children, presumably with the idea that consuming the extra calories will give them enough energy to make a successful escape.\nImagine if every time your mom got scared, she gave serious thought to eating you. Welcome to the wonderful world of the Skink.\n36. Cotton-Top Cooperative\nIf born as a baby cotton-top tamarin, the chances are that you are one of a pair of twins, as these monkeys have twins babies more often than single babies. After being born, babies are raised cooperatively by the entire group.\n35. It\u2019s Not a Contest\u2014Except for When It Is\nMale pipefish are held solely responsible for the carrying and birthing of their offspring. However, they don\u2019t receive female eggs from just one other pipefish, but many others as well. The babies that end up being born are those from the more attractive female. The male selects which embryos to nourish based on how attracted they were to their mother.\nLove is a cruel game for the lady pipefish.\n34. Helplessly Adorable\nA giant panda isn\u2019t so giant when it is a baby\u2014it\u2019s actually about the size of a stick of butter. They are also completely hairless and vulnerable, making them, somehow, even cuter.\n33. Baby Horns\nFully-grown rhinos are a confusing animal to behold, if only because they sit directly on the line between being adorable and fascinating\u2026 while they\u2019re simultaneously entirely capable of squishing you like a fly. If any animal is worthy of the description, \u201cbasically an actual tank\u201d, it\u2019s these guys.\nWhich may be why it\u2019s so surprising that baby rhinos aren\u2019t actually born with a horn. Instead, it takes the calves about five months for their horn to begin emerging from their snout. And in the meantime, they look like the most adorable, fat, and wrinkly little ponies that nature ever accidentally created.\n32. Practice Makes Elephants\nBaby elephants try to grow up fast. They spend their childhood days practicing all their mechanics in order to blossom once they reach adulthood.\nWhich, in case you\u2019re ever interested in losing 5 hours to a life-changing Youtube binge, makes for absolutely adorable videos. A baby elephant in the process of figuring out what their trunk is, makes for one of life\u2019s greatest little joys. \u201cWhy is there another arm on my face???? Who owns this thing????\u201d\nSign up to our newsletter. History\u2019s most fascinating stories and darkest secrets, delivered to your inbox daily. Making distraction rewarding since 2017.\n31. Bonobo Bonds\nBonobo babies learn the importance of community and kinship early on in their youth. They form emotional bonds through touch and the relationships they build will last long, throughout their youth into their adult life.\n30. No Smell Deer\nIn order to help their chances of survival (because that\u2019s the name of the game) baby deer do not have a scent.\nIt\u2019s a pretty cool trick of evolution. Given how much of animal hunting is based on smell, most hungry predators would find a fawn to be essentially invisible. That\u2019d be like if human babies were designed to be un-kidnap-able, by having the ability to camouflage themselves like chameleons.\nOnce again, we have proof that other animals get all the cool superpowers.\n29. Meerkat Kindergarten\nThe Meerkat social order is intensely co-operative. Seriously: if you\u2019re ever looking for a real team-building exercise, you might consider pretending to be Meerkats.\nThese little guys spend their entire lives working as a unit. And nowhere is this more evident than in the way their babies are raised. Meerkat parents essentially form collective clubs, in which the duties of raising and teaching the young are shared amongst the adults. Young ones are raised together as if they were in a school, as the pups learn all their skills through this upbringing.\n28. Gray Flamingo\nThat beautiful fluorescent pink flow of the flamingo must look incredibly on baby flamingos, right? Nope. When a flamingo is born it a small gray ball of feathers, like a tropical version of the old ugly duckling story.\n27. Arrested Development\nOf all the great apes, orangutan babies take the longest time to mature. It takes up to eight years for a baby orangutan to be weaned from their mothers and truly escape the bonds of childhood.\nAnd never has it been better for our reputation as a species to not be considered a \u201cgreat ape\u201d. We are simply regular apes\u2026 which might normally feel like a bit of an insult, but in this case might be for the best. Seeing as our transition out of childhood takes a cool\u2026 10 years longer than these guys? At the best? It\u2019s probably good that we\u2019re not comparing ourselves directly to them.\n26. Milking It\nGiven the outrageous amount of growing they\u2019ve got to do, a baby elephant must drink a ton of milk, right? Well, they actually, quite literally, drink over two tons of milk! As a calf, elephants drink as much as 2,200 gallons of milk from their mother.\nIf you are a lactose-intolerant baby elephant, life is really, really, really unpleasant.\n25. Color Doesn\u2019t Matter\nMany monkey babies are born a different color than their parents. The langur, for instance, is colored black, but their babies are orange.\nWhich is why the langur version of the Jerry Springer Show is so famously confusing. \u201cYou are\u2026 maybe the father? Honestly, we can\u2019t tell.\u201d\n24. Joey Beans\nBaby koalas, known as joeys, are particularly fragile babies. They\u2019re born blind, deaf, and almost the exact size of a jelly bean (although presumably less delicious).\nOnce bigger, they will stay with their moms by attaching themselves to her back.\n23. Teeth the Shell\nEver wonder how a baby reptile breaks out of their shell in order to actually be born? Many reptiles, including baby crocodiles, have what is called an \u201cegg tooth\u201d that allows them to crack the shell and break free into the world. Two months after hatching, this tooth will be resorbed back into its body.\n22. Big Babies\nLiving for up to as many as 75 years, ostriches are the world\u2019s largest bird. But it doesn\u2019t take them very long to grow up, as baby ostriches hatch larger than chickens and nearly reach full-grown height after only six months.\n21. Do You Wanna Build a Snowman?\nMacaques are playful animals, but in their youth, they take it to another level. When it snows, they will often roll up snowballs for fun and have a grand old time with them.\n20. Chimp Barbies\nOne way in which baby chimpanzees will get ready for when it is their time to raise their own offspring is by making dolls to play with as if they had babies of their own. They will gather together sticks and rocks to build their dolls and then raise them in reflection to their own parents.\n19. Not Rittens?\nDon\u2019t get confused\u2014baby rabbits are also called kittens! I mean, even if you were to confuse them, the result is still tiny adorable animal friends. It\u2019s a win-win situation.\n18. Limited Resources in Hotel California\nEagles are nothing to mess with, so it shouldn\u2019t be any surprise that neither are their chicks. After hatching, baby eagles will sometimes go to extreme measures in order to get privileged access to the resources their mother provides. \u201cWell that\u2019s not so bad,\u201d you might be thinking, \u201cafter all, what siblings don\u2019t squabble a little bit. Fair enough. But eagles do take it a little far. In this case, \u201cextreme measures\u201d means killing and maiming their brothers and sisters in the nest.\nOh\u2026\n17. Watching the Youth\nWhen elephants are still in their baby calf stage, other female elephants in the herd will often babysit them. Though all of the female elephants will look after the youth, it is mostly young females (who have yet to have any calves of their own) who will babysit. These babysitters are called \u201callomothers\u201d and the act proves to be beneficial for the entire herd.\nLittle did I know that my dream job title is Allomother. Now I\u2019ve got something to strive for.\n16. Trunk Comfort\nMuch like a baby human sucking its own thumb, baby elephants will wrap their trunk around and suck on it as a way to comfort itself.\n15. Poor Baby Earwig\nThe earwig is an animal that is all about survival\u2014after all, is there a human on Earth who wouldn\u2019t kill one on sight? After giving birth, the mother earwig will gravitate to the healthiest of her nymphs through scent, and nurture them with more care than the others. Because the earwig gives birth to as many as 60 children at a time, some babies will inevitably die, so it makes sense to give more attention to those who have a better chance at survival.\n14. Deadbeat Dads\nMale seahorses get a lot of credit for giving birth to their offspring, rather than the females. After birthing their babies and keeping them comfortable in his pouch until they are healthy enough to deal with the salinity of the surrounding water, the male disappears and leaves his seahorses babies to grow up fatherless.\n13. Water Wings\nDue to being born in the arid climate of Southern Africa, sandgrouse bird chicks aren\u2019t able to get much water. In comes dad to the rescue, who travels far distances in order to soak himself in water and then fly back to allow his babies to drink from his feathers which have coiled up water in them. Now that\u2019s how you father your kids, seahorses!\n12. Panda Survival\nSure, there are few things cuter than a baby panda, but each one who makes it actually only has a 50/50 shot at being raised by their panda mother. Though they often give birth to two offspring, the panda mother will focus exclusively on one of her children. As she has to expend an enormous amount of energy to raise her cub, she doesn\u2019t have much of a choice if she wants to ensure survival for her offspring.\n11. Like Man, Like Dog\nLike humans, dogs are born with fewer teeth. Puppies have only 28 teeth, but as they grow, so do their teeth, and they up with 42 in the mature adulthood.\n10. Straight From the Source\nDespite the whole \u201cliving their entire lives underwater\u201d thing, baby dolphins have to somehow drink their mother\u2019s milk\u2014remember, dolphins are mammals\u2014without getting any salt water in it.\nWhat to do?\nEvolution solved this one by fitting them with spines on the sides of their tongue, which mold into a sort of straw for them to drink their milk directly from their mother without any contamination.\n9. Babbling Marmosets\nWhat can be cuter than a baby pygmy marmoset? Listening to it babble! Much like how human babies babble themselves into oblivious in order to develop their language and communication skills, so too do infant pygmy marmosets.\n8. Pouch Life\nAll baby marsupials are born prematurely. This is why they all have pouches, ensuring that they can live in a safe, warm, comfortable place and be nurtured by their mother until they can fully develop into a strapping youth marsupial.\n7. Chivalrous Pups\nNot only are puppies the most adorable thing, boy puppies have an inner kindness. Whenever they play fight with girl puppies, they often allow them to win.\n6. Falling Into the World\nGiraffes don\u2019t go to the hospital to give birth. Nor do they lay down. When a baby giraffe is born, they come into the world with a sharp *THUD*. That\u2019s the sound of them hitting the dirt, after falling six feet from the birth canal. That\u2019s right, despite the obvious challenges the strategy presents to their babies, giraffes give birth standing up.\n5. Too Fluffy to Fail\nA baby sea otter is so covered with fluff that it couldn\u2019t drown even if it tried; they float like little furry beach balls.\nThe flip side of that extremely cute coin? They are also born with so much fluffy hair that they can\u2019t pull themselves out of the water. Meaning they must wait to learn how to dive (and therefore live alone) until they mature and lose some of their cuddle capacity.\n4. Baby\u2019s First Steps\nGiraffes don\u2019t need any time to walk! It only takes about 30 minutes for a baby giraffe to get to stepping and begin honing its long stride. Though it does take them some time to shake their adorable clumsiness.\n3. Playmates\nA pack of lions sticks together. One way their connection is maintained is in the way that they all give birth around the same time as each other, which allows for their cubs to grow up together and form bonds.\n2. Talking Through the Shell\nBefore they even hatch, baby chicks form a communication bond with their mothers by chirping through their eggshells. This process of tapping, chirping, and generally causing a ruckus, is called pipping or piping. Farmers recognize this stage in a chick\u2019s development as the moment the begin to learn how to breathe, and strengthen their lungs for a life outside the shell.\n1. No Squirrel Left Behind\nSquirrels look out for their own. If one squirrel has found an abandoned baby squirrel, it will adopt it and raise it as its own. I\u2019m not crying, you\u2019re crying.\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9"}

When you use our links, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more\nHave you ever wondered what a giraffe eats? Learn what giraffes eat, how much they eat, and when they like to eat. We\u2019ll also talk about what they are fed in zoos. And of course, we\u2019ll talk about the diet of a baby giraffe. Plus 5 facts about the giraffe digestive system (its stomach has 4 compartments)!\nWhat Do Giraffes Eat?\nGiraffes are herbivores, meaning that their diet consists mainly of plant matter. They typically browse on trees, bushes, and shrubs, with their favorite being the leaves of the Acacia. They also eat many other plants such as mimosa, myrrh, and bush willows.\nTheir diet is affected by what is available at the time. During the wet/rainy season, giraffes will feed on deciduous trees, vines, and shrubs. During the dry season, when food is less readily available, giraffes will gather around the available evergreen trees. They will also snack on the occasional fruit.\nWhen stressed, giraffes have been observed eating the bark off of branches.\nHow much does a giraffe eat?\nAn adult giraffe can eat up to 75 pounds (34 kilograms) of food per day. That sounds like a lot. But keep in mind that the average adult male weighs 2,628 pounds (1,192 kilograms), and the average female weighs 1,825 pounds (828 kilograms).\nGiraffes need to eat comparatively less than other herbivores because their food is rich in nutrients. They also have effective digestive systems.\nHow much time does a giraffe spend eating?\nGiraffes spend up to 75% of their day eating (18 hours). When they are not browsing for food and picking leaves, they are chewing their cud (more on that below).\nActual feeding is at its highest during the first and last hours of daylight, with the in-between hours being used for ruminating. Ruminating also takes place overnight, as a giraffe needs very little sleep. Eating each meal twice takes time!\nWhy do giraffes like eating Acacia leaves?\nThe leaves of the Acacia tree are high in calcium and protein, which are both needed in order to maintain a giraffe\u2019s huge body. But this tree also has other attractive properties.\nAcacia trees can grow very tall, meaning that the lanky giraffe has virtually no competition for food on its high boughs. And although the Acacia is thorny, the giraffe\u2019s tongue is uniquely designed to be able to safely eat from it.\nAre giraffes destructive when they eat?\nTrees that are frequented by giraffes have been known to develop a bit of a \u201cwaistline,\u201d but they are far less destructive than elephants. In fact, the nibbling of giraffes can produce some positive results for the tree. Just as cutting back a house plant can produce new sprouts, a tree that has been fed upon by a giraffe will produce new growth. Giraffes also help with pollination and seed distribution.\nTrees also have certain measures in place to avoid over-eating. For example, some trees have a symbiotic relationship with a species of biting ants. These ants ensure that a giraffe doesn\u2019t spend too much time browsing in the same place.\nDo giraffes eat meat?\nAlthough it is rare, if a giraffe can\u2019t obtain the nutrients that it needs from its normal food sources, it may be forced to look elsewhere. This can happen in the dry season when plant growth is limited.\nA giraffe is not a hunter, but they have been observed licking the meat off of dead carcasses.\nBut this action comes with risks.\nEven though a giraffe\u2019s neck is very long (6 feet/ 1.8 meters), it is too short to reach the ground. So if a giraffe wanted to reach anything on the surface, it would have to shuffle down by spreading apart its front legs.\nThis awkward position makes the giraffe vulnerable to attack from predators, especially lions. And if food is scarce, the predators will also be hungry.\nKeep reading: Do squirrels eat meat?\nDo giraffes drink water?\nYes, giraffes do drink water, but far less than you would expect. On average, an adult giraffe will drink 2 gallons (around 7.5 liters) of water per week. As mentioned above, getting their head down low enough to drink puts giraffes in a vulnerable position.\nTo avoid this, giraffes get most of the moisture they need from the leaves they eat. If needed, they can go for weeks without an actual drink of water.\nIf water is easily available, such as in a zoo setting without predators, giraffes will drink 10 gallons (38 liters) a day.\nWatch the awkward shuffle required to reach the watering hole\nWhy don\u2019t giraffes faint when they bend over?\nWhen a giraffe is standing upright, its heart has to work very hard to get enough blood circulating up the length of its neck to the brain. As a result, a giraffe has very high blood pressure, about 2.5 times that of a human. So you many wonder how they avoid fainting from the blood-rush to the head when they bend over for a drink.\nWhen a giraffe bends down, the jugular vein in its neck actually locks up. This prevents the rush of blood to the head. When it straightens out its neck by lifting its head, the vein opens up again. How cool is that?\nWhat are giraffes fed in zoos?\nGiraffe care will vary from zoo to zoo, but the aim is to provide them with the same nutrients that they would get if they were eating in their natural environment.\nThe San Diego Zoo feeds their giraffes with fresh acacia leaves which are placed in artificial food \u201ctrees\u201d at the proper height. They also get hay, carrots, and special biscuits.\nWhat does a baby giraffe eat?\nA newborn giraffe will suckle its mother\u2019s milk. This occurs within the first hour of its life. That\u2019s why they need to be so tall at birth (6 feet/ 1.8 meters)! A baby giraffe is weaned between 9 and 12 months of age.\nIn calves, esophageal grooves allow milk to bypass the first stomach compartment and enter straight into the second part. At around 4 months they will start to eat solid food. Their stomach will undergo changes at this time to allow them to start ruminating.\n5 Facts About the Giraffe\u2019s Digestive System\nGiraffes are ruminants: Just like cows, giraffes are ruminants. This means that they throw up their food and eat it a second time. They have special muscles in their neck to help them regurgitate: With such a long neck, regurgitated food has a long way to travel. To help with this, giraffes have strong oesophageal muscles to help them bring the food back up. A giraffe\u2019s stomach has 4 compartments: These sections are called the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum, and the abomasum. Microbes in the rumen create fermentation. After spending time in the rumen, the food is brought back up to the mouth to be chewed as cud. After entering the second stomach, the food is passed through the rest of the digestive system Giraffes have 70 feet (21.3 meters) of intestines. Their poop comes out in the shape of pellets.\nMore reading: Guide to all Giraffe Types and Species and 6 Sounds Giraffes Make\nYour Turn\nDid you learn something new?

These tall animals are identified by their long necks, equally long and spindly legs, and spotted coats. Most giraffes have a tan, white or yellow coats that are spotted with brown, square shapes.\nSize\nGiraffes are the tallest living animals in the world, according to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. A giraffe's neck alone is 6 feet (1.8 meters) long and weighs about 600 lbs. (272 kilograms). The animal's legs are also 6 feet long.\nFemales grow up to 14 feet (4.3 m) tall and weigh up to 1,500 lbs. (680 kg), while males grow up to 18 feet (5.5 m) tall and weigh up to 3,000 lbs. (1,360 kg).\nGiraffes have unusually skinny legs for such large animals, but specialized bone structure allows them to support immense weight. (Image credit: EcoView/Fotolia)\nWith such a massive body, it makes sense that the giraffes' organs and other body parts are equally huge. Their tongues are a substantial 21 inches (53 centimeters) long, and their feet are 12 inches (30.5 cm) across. According to the San Diego Zoo, a giraffe's heart is 2 feet (0.6 m) long and weighs about 25 lbs. (11 kg). Their lungs can hold 12 gallons (55 liters) of air. In comparison, the average total lung capacity for a human is 1.59 gallons (6 liters).\nHabitat\nGiraffes live in savannas throughout Africa. The tall creatures are native to Kenya, Cameroon, Chad, Niger, Uganda, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania, Angola and South Africa, according to the World Atlas (opens in new tab).They like semi-arid, open woodlands that have scattered trees and bushes, making the savannas perfect for these animals.\nHabits\nGiraffes are so social that they don't have territories. A group of giraffes is aptly called a tower, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Towers typically have 10 to 20 members. Who lives in the tower can vary. Some towers consist of all females and their young, or all male or mixed genders. Member are free to come and go as they please, according to the Animal Diversity Web.\nGiraffes only sleep around 20 minutes or less per day, according to PBS Nature. Staying awake most of the time allows them to be constantly on alert for predators. They usually get their sleep in quick power naps that last just a couple of minutes.\nEvery giraffe has two hair-covered horns called ossicones. Male giraffes use their horns to playfully fight with one another. They also spar by swinging their heads at one another and entwining their necks, which is called \"necking.\" [Images: Animals' Dazzling Headgear]\nDiet\nGiraffes are herbivores, which means they eat only plants. Their long necks allow them to reach leaves, seeds, fruits, buds and branches high up in mimosa and acacia trees. They can eat hundreds of pounds of leaves per week, according to National Geographic (opens in new tab).\nThough these animals eat a lot, giraffes can go without drinking for weeks at a time. They get most of their moisture from the vegetation they eat.\nOffspring\nThe new Rothschild's giraffe calf takes her first steps. (Image credit: Belfast Zoo.)\nAs in cattle, female giraffes are called cows, while the males are called bulls. After mating, the cow will have a gestation period of around 14 months. Baby giraffes are called calves. During birth, the calf will drop to the ground, since mother giraffes give birth standing up. The fall can be as far as 5 feet (1.5 m), according to National Geographic.\nNew calves are quite large, at 6 feet tall (1.8 m), 100 to 150 lbs. (45 to 68 kg), according to the San Diego Zoo. They are also agile. At just an hour after birth, they can stand up and walk around.\nGiraffe mothers often take turns watching over the calves. Sometimes, though, the mother giraffe will leave the calf by itself. When this happens, the infant will lie down and wait for its mother to return.\nCalves are weaned at around 12 months, according to the University of Michigan. At 3 to 6 years old, calves are fully mature. The animals can live 10 to 15 years in the wild and 20 to 25 years in captivity.\nClassification/taxonomy\nIn the Giraffidae family, there are two genera: Giraffa and Okapia. The okapi is sometimes called the forest giraffe. The Giraffa genus has recently had a shake-up after a recent study recognized four species, not just one.\nThe 2016 study was published in the journal Current Biology. Researchers from the Giraffe Conservation Foundation (GCF) collected and analyzed DNA from skin samples representing 190 giraffes from across Africa, the first such analysis to include data from all nine formerly accepted subspecies. [Related: 1 Long Neck, 4 Species: New Giraffe Diversity Revealed]\nThe new taxonomy of giraffes, according to the GCF, is:\nKingdom: Animalia Subkingdom: Bilateria Infrakingdom: Deuterostomia Phylum: Chordata Subphylum: Vertebrata Infraphylum: Gnathostomata Superclass: Tetrapoda Class: Mammalia Subclass: Theria Infraclass: Eutheria Order: Artiodactyla Family: Giraffidae Genus: Giraffa Species:\nGiraffa giraffa (southern giraffe), with two subspecies: G. g. angolensis (Angolan giraffe) and G. g. giraffa (South African giraffe)\nGiraffa camelopardalis (northern giraffe), with three subspecies: G. c. antiquorum (Kordofan giraffe), G. c. camelopardalis (Nubian giraffe) and G. c. peralta (West African giraffe)\nGiraffa reticulate (reticulated giraffe)\nGiraffa tippelskirchi (Masai giraffe)\nConservation status\nGiraffes crossing the road, safari, Kenya, East Africa, Ol Pejeta conservancy. (Image credit: Stock.xchng)\nRecognizing four distinct giraffe species should be a game changer for conservation plans, the GCF researchers said in the study.\nFewer than 100,000 giraffes remain in the wild, down from an estimated 150,000 that roamed the savannas 30 years ago. And because the species don't interbreed, population numbers for all African giraffes won't accurately represent whether each group is doing well. Using this new information about giraffe genetics, governments and biologists can create more focused efforts to ensure that all four species will be neck and neck in their race toward future success, the scientists said.\nGiraffe populations are challenged because of poaching and shrinking habitat. The animals' tails are made into good-luck bracelets, fly whisks and thread for stringing beads, according to the African Wildlife Foundation. As agricultural settlement expands, the giraffe's main source of food, the acacia tree, is being cut down.\nOther facts\nJust like human fingerprints and zebra stripes, the coat pattern of a giraffe is unique to that animal.\nThe pattern and the small hump on a giraffe's back are similar to those of a leopard. Years ago, many people thought the giraffe was a combination of a camel and a leopard, and they called these animals \"camel-leopards.\"\nYou will often see giraffes walking around with birds on their backs. These birds are called tickbirds, or oxpecker birds (Buphagus africanus). They eat bugs that live in the giraffe's coat and alert the animals to danger by chirping loudly.\nEven if you spent a lot of time with giraffes, you would never hear them make a noise. This is because giraffes communicate using noises that are too low for humans to hear, according to PBS Nature.\nThanks to their long legs, giraffes are very fast. They can run 35 mph (56 km/h) in short bursts and run for longer stretches at 10 mph (16 km/h), according to National Geographic.\nGiraffes are even-toed ungulates, which means they have two weight-bearing hooves on each foot, and are in the order Artiodactyla, which also includes antelopes, cattle, goats, sheep, caribou, moose, hippos and pigs.\nAdditional Resources\nThis article was updated on Sept. 15, 2020 to add the countries in Africa giraffes are native to."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Jungle Animals - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Jungle-animals.html", "text": "Jungle Animals\nJungle animals include some of the worlds largest and most unusual creatures, but just what is a jungle? And what is the difference between a forest, a rain forest and a jungle?\nThe word \"forest\" basically means an area with a large density of trees. Forests can occur in low or high elevation, can be relatively dry or very rainy, and can be of basically any temperature that still supports tree growth.\nA mature forest is one that may have very large trees and many species of plants and wildlife such as tropical rain forests, or may be limited in the number of species of both trees and wildlife, such as is the case with the coniferous forests found in the very cold taiga regions of the world.\nThe term \"rain forest\" refers to a forest that receives a minimum of about 60 inches of total rainfall a year. There are two types of rainforests, temperate rainforests with moderate temperatures and even some snowfall, or tropical rainforests which occur close to the equator and rarely dip below 60 degrees.\nRain forests are characterized by having such a thick upper canopy of growth, that little sunlight reaches the ground. This means that young trees must be able to grow with limited sunlight, and it also means that the undergrowth in a rain forest is not particularly dense. It is generally easier to walk through a rain forest than a jungle.\nThe jungle is an area of forest that combines warmer temperatures and dense vegetation. The tree canopy is not as thick in a jungle as it is in a rain forest, allowing sunlight to reach more of the ground.\nVines, shrubs, grasses and moss thrive in the lower third of a jungle making it very difficult to penetrate on foot. Jungles, then, are simply warm forests that are very densely vegetated at the forest floor. And here are some of the jungle animals that live there- Jungle Animals\ncheck out our youtube channel!\nIs the lion the king of the jungle?\nThe African lion is not a jungle animal. In fact, of the 20,000 lions that still live in the wild, only 250-300 highly endangered Asiatic lions live in the Gir jungle of India. These lions are smaller than the familiar African lion which lives ion the savanna grasslands.\nA number of other big cats call the jungle their home though. Bengal tigers, leopards and jaguars all live in the jungles of three different continents and are the apex predators in those environments. The most notorious jungle animal of all these cats, the leopard, is serenely at home in the trees, and although it too calls some dusty environments home, the jungle is where the leopard really shines.\nStealthy, quiet, incredibly powerful, the leopard can hunt in the trees and is agile enough to pursue monkeys and other arboreal creatures high above the jungle floor. The leopard is also adept at lying in wait on a tree branch and then dropping silently down on unsuspecting jungle inhabitants such as goats and antelope.\nThe leopard is most well known though, for its somewhat gruesome habit of hanging its prey from the limbs of trees. It does this to protect it from scavengers, and will return to large kills several times to eat on the same tree branch, safe and comfortable beneath its green jungle canopy.\nUneasy is the jungle visitor who comes upon the carcass of a wild boar hanging in a tree. It only serves as evidence that the true \"King of the Jungle\" lurks nearby....Jungle Animals Facts\nThe Great Apes\nAll of the non-human great apes are native to African jungles except the orangutan which is native to jungles in Borneo and Sumatra. The chimpanzee and the Eastern lowland gorilla live in the least heavily forested areas, and chimps can be found ranging into savanna regions as well. Eastern mountain, and Western gorillas all live in the jungles of central Africa.\nThe orangutan lives in jungles and rain forests in Borneo and Sumatra and is the largest arboreal animal in the world. The trees are vital to their existence. They are all harshly impacted by farming and deforestation and, tragically, all the great apes are endangered species except human beings.\nThe non-human great apes are some of the few animals, along with whales and elephants, that display an understanding of self similar to our own, and they are our closest living relatives.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

The more common African bush elephant roams the dusty savanna, but the forest elephant lives in remarkably dense brush of the African jungle.\nAbout 30% smaller than the typical African elephant, forest elephants rarely reach 8 feet at the shoulder but still must squeeze tight through thick underbrush on the jungle borders of the savanna. They live in smaller groups than their larger brush elephant cousins and have a different, more varied diet due to the richness of their jungle environment.\nThe forest elephant is vital to the development of the shrubs and trees in the jungle as they spend most of their days, distributing seeds while they forage for fruits. It is believed that they are the main distributor of seeds for several fruit species, and that without an active and healthy forest elephant population, conservationists believe there would be a huge impact on the environments they live in. In the typical circle of life, their dung also serves as healthy fertilizer for the jungle they call home. Forest elephants are elusive and have not been studied or photographed to anywhere near the extent that the bush elephants of the African plains have been. Much of their lives remains a mystery - Jungle Animals\na few more Jungle Animal facts\nAlthough some say there are no jungles in Australia, this may be a case of semantics with the word \"bush\" substituted for jungle, no matter, the edges of Australian rainforests, particularly along waterways would be considered a jungle environment in most cultures .\nAll the great apes except human beings are native jungle animals.\nThe majority of lions, also known as the \"King of the Jungle\" actually live in the savanna.\nThe jungle is a forest environment that has undergrowth so dense that it is hard to penetrate without cutting through it.\nThe word \"jungle\" is often used as a metaphor for any place that is unruly. - Jungle Animals"}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Rothschild Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi) - Giraffe Facts ...", "url": "https://www.giraffeworlds.com/rothschild-giraffe/", "text": "Rothschild Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi)\nGiraffa camelopardalis rothschildi\nThis giraffe is a subspecies of the Northern Giraffe and is also known as the Baringo or Ugandan giraffe. The name Rothschild\u2019s is in honor of the London zoologist Lionel Walter Rothschild who also maintains insects, birds, fish, spiders and numerous types of fauna with his family name.\nThe Rothschild\u2019s giraffe formerly considered a subspecies of the unique giraffe species now its taxonomic classification changed to an ecotype of the Northern giraffe and part of the Nubian species according to a new genetic research made just in 2016 which led to the taxonomy reorganization of the whole species.\nFamilia: Giraffidae\nGenus: Giraffa\nSpecies: Giraffa camelopardalis\nSubspecies: Giraffa camelopardalis camelopardalis\nFormer: Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi\nNow considered an ecotype of Giraffa camelopardalis\nThe Rothschild species is one of the tallest giraffes. They can be an astonishing 19 feet in height and weigh about 2,500 pounds with the males weighing more than the females by several hundred pounds. You will notice that the coloring of the Rothschild Giraffe is unique when compared to the other species.\nTheir coat consists of dark brown and dark orange patches and then areas of beige through them. Their markings stop at the top of the knee caps, below that area the spots disappear, and everything below that point down is whitish.\nRothschild\u2019s Giraffe Anatomy\nThe Rothschild\u2019s giraffe measures 16 to 19 feet height and reaches a weight of 1800 to 2500 pounds, with males being larger than females. It is an impressive height. However, it is not the highest giraffe.\nIt is often confused with the Masai giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi), but with careful observation of its coat design, can be distinguished from this and other species. The spots on its skin are large and with different forms, with a combination of two colors ranging from a chocolate brown in the center fading to a less intense brown color at the edges separated by a thick border. The background skin color is cream or yellowish, which makes these patches stand out and give it a very elegant appearance.\nIn the legs, the spot pattern fades until completely disappearing below the knees until the feet.\nThe distinction of the spots between the different giraffe species may seem complicated, but if compared and observed at the same time, you can notice the peculiarities of each design and learn to identify each species.\nRothschild\u2019s giraffe has a vertical mane of a dark brown hair which is visibly striking and beautiful. They are born with two ossicones, but due calcium accumulations, it can give the impression of having three or even five of them. Two in the same place as other giraffes, one in the center, and two behind those. However, these additional ossicones are smaller than the others.\nIt is hard to believe looking at it, but the neck of any giraffe has the same amount of vertebrae as humans, seven.\nThe body of these giraffes is designed to give it speed, power, and agility. There are very few animals this size that can move so swiftly. They have amazing sight, allowing them to see predators from far. They have a fantastic sense of smell and hearing too, so they are always alert to what is going on around them. They have a long tail that helps to keep pests such as flies away from them.\nRothschild\u2019s Giraffe Evolution\nGiraffes are related to deer and okapis. You may not think so looking at them, but history could indicate that these giraffes were once shaped more like deer. They grew their long necks out of necessity, and as a result, the rest of their body had to grow as well. Giraffes and okapis split from a common ancestor around 11.5 million of years ago.\nRothschild\u2019s Giraffe Distribution and habitat\nLike all other giraffes, the Rothschild\u2019s giraffe lives on the African continent. Specifically, they inhabit the hot woodlands, savannahs, and shrublands of Kenya and Uganda.\nLake Baringo in Kenya is the common area where these giraffes live. In fact, many of the people refer to them as the Baringo Giraffe. Most of them live on one of two wildlife refuges in Kenya like the Lake Nakuru National Park while other populations of this species inhabit in the Eastern parts of Uganda in the Murchison Falls National Park.\nRothschild\u2019s Giraffe Feeding\nThey are herbivores like all types of giraffes and feed on the leaves of tall trees such as the acacia or wild apricot. They also eat sprouts and fruits. Their great tongue helps them to reach the leaves whose stems are covered by thorns without hurting themselves. They spend several hours feeding during the day. Those thick lips, tongue, and throat are all adapted, so they can consume acacia trees and others that have thick thorns.\nThey consume a variety of other foods that are seasonally available like seed pods and apricots. Their tongues are about 18-20 inches long, and they are very powerful and prehensile. They can use them to wrap around things like we do with our fingers and then draw them to them mouth to feed on them.\nWhile these giraffes do have a home range, they continue to move along looking for food.\nRothschild\u2019s Giraffe Behavior\nWhile Rothschild Giraffes live in small herds, they have distinctions between the males and the females. They live separate from each other but remain in the proximity. The only time the two gender interact is when they are going to mate.\nThey are tolerant of other animals around them as long as they don\u2019t feel threatened. For the most part, they are very friendly, but the males are known to engage in fights for mating. Since this species can mate all year long, those battles seem to be frequent. However, they aren\u2019t as intense as those from other species.\nRothschild\u2019s Giraffe Reproduction\nReproduction can occur with these giraffes when they are about three-five years of age. The females tend to mate years sooner than the males because the latter have to prove among each other who is the strongest to earn the right to mate.\nAfter winning a battle neck to neck the males, finally, decide who will have access to the mating female.\nThis particular species does not have a season for mating and can happen all year long. Mothers have a gestation period that lasts from 14 to 16 months, and they give birth to a single calf of about six feet tall. When a mother gives birth, she and her offspring stay away from their groups from 10 days to a month and then return to the herd where the rest of the members accept the new member.\nThe females will nurse the young for the first year of life. They are excellent at caring for their young and use lots of non-verbal communication to teach them.\nGroups composed of females and offspring live separately from groups of males and only meet during breeding seasons. The bonds between mother and offspring are the strongest within the society, as they try to stay together and in the case of threats, the female attacks the enemies with deadly kicks.\nRothschild\u2019s Giraffe in Captivity\nSome individuals live in captivity and most of the time have success reproducing, although there is always the debate that a wild animal of such magnitudes should be released. Advocates of these facilities argument that thanks to their conservation efforts, some individuals of this African animal are safe.\nRothschild\u2019s Giraffe Threats\nThese giraffes have quite a few predators including hyenas, lions, crocodiles and leopards. These predators will mainly target the young and sick because full grown adults are too much of a risk as their powerful kicks can easily injure or kill such predators. However, while adults can be saved by their strong kicks, if they are the target of a herd of the carnivores mentioned above, their chances of survival are minimal.\nThe young are very vulnerable, and so there is a mortality rate of more than 50%.\nPoaching of the Rothschild Giraffe continues to be a severe problem. The future for the Rothschild Giraffe is in serious jeopardy at this time. Today there are only around 1500 individuals in the wild.\nPoaching, traditional hunting, and degradation of their habitat are primary reasons that took this species to an endangered conservation status (EN) according to the red list of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\nThe latest estimation in 2016 showed an increase in the population but still alarming numbers with an approximate population of 1,671 individuals left in the wild (Fennessy, S et al. 2016). From them, approximately 40% live in national parks and the rest, 60% live in Uganda.\nAlthough many are kept in protected areas for their preservation, the problems still prevail, and it is necessary to keep protecting this species, even, in those places where there is surveillance.\nReferences\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild%27s_giraffe\nBarbara Keevil Parker.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Okapi - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi", "text": "Species of mammal\nThis article is about the animal. For other uses, see Okapi (disambiguation)\nThe okapi ( ; Okapia johnstoni), also known as the forest giraffe, Congolese giraffe, or zebra giraffe, is an artiodactyl mammal that is endemic to the northeast Democratic Republic of the Congo in central Africa. Although the okapi has striped markings reminiscent of zebras, it is most closely related to the giraffe. The okapi and the giraffe are the only living members of the family Giraffidae.\nThe okapi stands about 1.5 m (4.9 ft) tall at the shoulder and has a typical body length around 2.5 m (8.2 ft). Its weight ranges from 200 to 350 kg (440 to 770 lb). It has a long neck, and large, flexible ears. Its coat is a chocolate to reddish brown, much in contrast with the white horizontal stripes and rings on the legs, and white ankles. Male okapis have short, distinct horn-like protuberances on their heads called ossicones, less than 15 cm (5.9 in) in length. Females possess hair whorls, and ossicones are absent.\nOkapis are primarily diurnal, but may be active for a few hours in darkness. They are essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. Okapis are herbivores, feeding on tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. Rut in males and estrus in females does not depend on the season. In captivity, estrus cycles recur every 15 days. The gestational period is around 440 to 450 days long, following which usually a single calf is born. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months.\nOkapis inhabit canopy forests at altitudes of 500\u20131,500 m (1,600\u20134,900 ft). The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources classifies the okapi as endangered. Major threats include habitat loss due to logging and human settlement. Illegal mining and extensive hunting for bushmeat and skin have also led to a decline in populations. The Okapi Conservation Project was established in 1987 to protect okapi populations.\nEtymology and taxonomy [ edit ]\nStrips cut from the striped part of the skin of an okapi, sent home by Sir Harry Johnston , were the first evidence of the okapi's existence to reach Europe\nAlthough the okapi was unknown to the Western world until the 20th century, it may have been depicted since the early fifth century BCE on the fa\u00e7ade of the Apadana at Persepolis, a gift from the Ethiopian procession to the Achaemenid kingdom.\nFor years, Europeans in Africa had heard of an animal that they came to call the African unicorn. The animal was brought to prominent European attention by speculation on its existence found in press reports covering Henry Morton Stanley's journeys in 1887. In his travelogue of exploring the Congo, Stanley mentioned a kind of donkey that the natives called the atti, which scholars later identified as the okapi. Explorers may have seen a fleeting view of the striped backside as the animal fled through the bushes, leading to speculation that the okapi was some sort of rainforest zebra.[citation needed]\nWhen the British special commissioner in Uganda, Sir Harry Johnston, discovered some Pygmy inhabitants of the Congo being abducted by a showman for exhibition, he rescued them and promised to return them to their homes. The Pygmies fed Johnston's curiosity about the animal mentioned in Stanley's book. Johnston was puzzled by the okapi tracks the natives showed him; while he had expected to be on the trail of some sort of forest-dwelling horse, the tracks were of a cloven-hoofed beast.\nIllustration from an original painting by Sir Harry Johnston, based on preserved skins (1901)\nThough Johnston did not see an okapi himself, he did manage to obtain pieces of striped skin and eventually a skull. From this skull, the okapi was correctly classified as a relative of the giraffe; in 1901, the species was formally recognized as Okapia johnstoni.\nOkapia johnstoni was first described as Equus johnstoni by English zoologist Philip Lutley Sclater in 1901. The generic name Okapia derives either from the Mbuba name okapi or the related Lese Karo name o'api, while the specific name (johnstoni) is in recognition of Johnston, who first acquired an okapi specimen for science from the Ituri Forest.\nIn 1901, Sclater presented a painting of the okapi before the Zoological Society of London that depicted its physical features with some clarity. Much confusion arose regarding the taxonomical status of this newly discovered animal. Sir Harry Johnston himself called it a Helladotherium, or a relative of other extinct giraffids. Based on the description of the okapi by Pygmies, who referred to it as a \"horse\", Sclater named the species Equus johnstoni. Subsequently, zoologist Ray Lankester declared that the okapi represented an unknown genus of the Giraffidae, which he placed in its own genus, Okapia, and assigned the name Okapia johnstoni to the species.\nIn 1902, Swiss zoologist Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major suggested the inclusion of O. johnstoni in the extinct giraffid subfamily Palaeotraginae. However, the species was placed in its own subfamily Okapiinae, by Swedish palaeontologist Birger Bohlin in 1926, mainly due to the lack of a cingulum, a major feature of the palaeotragids. In 1986, Okapia was finally established as a sister genus of Giraffa on the basis of cladistic analysis. The two genera together with Palaeotragus constitute the tribe Giraffini.\nEvolution [ edit ]\nDespite the vast difference in neck length, the okapi (left) and the giraffe (right) both have seven cervical vertebrae (as do all mammals except for manatees and sloths).\nThe earliest members of the Giraffidae first appeared in the early Miocene in Africa, having diverged from the superficially deer-like climacoceratids. Giraffids spread into Europe and Asia by the middle Miocene in a first radiation. Another radiation began in the Pliocene, but was terminated by a decline in diversity in the Pleistocene. Several important primitive giraffids existed more or less contemporaneously in the Miocene (23\u201310 million years ago), including Canthumeryx, Giraffokeryx, Palaeotragus, and Samotherium. According to palaeontologist and author Kathleen Hunt, Samotherium split into Okapia (18 million years ago) and Giraffa (12 million years ago). However, J. D. Skinner argued that Canthumeryx gave rise to the okapi and giraffe through the latter three genera and that the okapi is the extant form of Palaeotragus. The okapi is sometimes referred to as a living fossil, as it has existed as a species over a long geological time period, and morphologically resembles more primitive forms (e.g. Samotherium).\nIn 2016, a genetic study found that the common ancestor of giraffe and okapi lived about 11.5 million years ago.\nCharacteristics [ edit ]\nMale okapi displaying his striking horizontal stripes\nThe okapi is a medium-sized giraffid, standing 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) tall at the shoulder. Its average body length is about 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) and its weight ranges from 200 to 350 kg (440 to 770 lb). It has a long neck, and large and flexible ears. In sharp contrast to the white horizontal stripes on the legs and white ankles, the okapi's coat is a chocolate to reddish brown. The distinctive stripes resemble those of a zebra. These features serve as an effective camouflage amidst dense vegetation. The face, throat, and chest are greyish white. Interdigital glands are present on all four feet, and are slightly larger on the front feet. Male okapis have short, hair-covered horn-like structures called ossicones, less than 15 cm (5.9 in) in length, which are similar in form and function to the ossicones of a giraffe. The okapi exhibits sexual dimorphism, with females 4.2 cm (1.7 in) taller on average, slightly redder, and lacking prominent ossicones, instead possessing hair whorls.\nThe okapi shows several adaptations to its tropical habitat. The large number of rod cells in the retina facilitate night vision, and an efficient olfactory system is present. The large auditory bullae of the temporal bone allow a strong sense of hearing. The dental formula of the okapi is 0.0.3.33.1.3.3. Teeth are low-crowned and finely cusped, and efficiently cut tender foliage. The large cecum and colon help in microbial digestion, and a quick rate of food passage allows for lower cell wall digestion than in other ruminants.\nHead of a male okapi with damaged ossicones\nThe okapi is easily distinguished from its nearest extant relative, the giraffe. It is much smaller than the giraffe and shares more external similarities with bovids and cervids. Ossicones are present only in the male okapi, while both sexes of giraffe possess this feature. The okapi has large palatine sinuses (hollow cavities in the palate), unique among the giraffids. Morphological features shared between the giraffe and the okapi include a similar gait \u2013 both use a pacing gait, stepping simultaneously with the front and the hind leg on the same side of the body, unlike other ungulates that walk by moving alternate legs on either side of the body \u2013 and a long, black tongue (longer in the okapi) useful for plucking buds and leaves, as well as for grooming.\nEcology and behaviour [ edit ]\nOkapis are primarily diurnal, but may be active for a few hours in darkness. They are essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. They have overlapping home ranges and typically occur at densities around 0.6 animals per square kilometre. Male home ranges average 13 km2 (5.0 sq mi), while female home ranges average 3\u20135 km2 (1.2\u20131.9 sq mi). Males migrate continuously, while females are sedentary. Males often mark territories and bushes with their urine, while females use common defecation sites. Grooming is a common practice, focused at the earlobes and the neck. Okapis often rub their necks against trees, leaving a brown exudate.\nThe male is protective of his territory, but allows females to pass through the domain to forage. Males visit female home ranges at breeding time. Although generally tranquil, the okapi can kick and butt with its head to show aggression. As the vocal cords are poorly developed, vocal communication is mainly restricted to three sounds \u2014 \"chuff\" (contact calls used by both sexes), \"moan\" (by females during courtship) and \"bleat\" (by infants under stress). Individuals may engage in Flehmen response, a visual expression in which the animal curls back its upper lips, displays the teeth, and inhales through the mouth for a few seconds. The leopard is the main natural predator of the okapi.\nDiet [ edit ]\nThe long tongue of the okapi\nOkapis are herbivores, feeding on tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. They are unique in the Ituri Forest as they are the only known mammal that feeds solely on understory vegetation, where they use their 18-inch-long (46 cm) tongues to selectively browse for suitable plants. The tongue is also used to groom their ears and eyes. They prefer to feed in treefall gaps. The okapi has been known to feed on over 100 species of plants, some of which are known to be poisonous to humans and other animals. Fecal analysis shows that none of those 100 species dominates the diet of the okapi. Staple foods comprise shrubs and lianas. The main constituents of the diet are woody, dicotyledonous species; monocotyledonous plants are not eaten regularly. In the Ituri forest, the okapi feeds mainly upon the plant families Acanthaceae, Ebenaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Loganiaceae, Rubiaceae, and Violaceae.\nReproduction [ edit ]\nA female okapi with her calf at White Oak Conservation\nFemale okapis become sexually mature at about one-and-a-half years old, while males reach maturity after two years. Rut in males and estrous in females does not depend on the season. In captivity, estrous cycles recur every 15 days. The male and the female begin courtship by circling, smelling, and licking each other. The male shows his interest by extending his neck, tossing his head, and protruding one leg forward. This is followed by mounting and copulation.\nThe gestational period is around 440 to 450 days long, following which usually a single calf is born, weighing 14\u201330 kg (31\u201366 lb). The udder of the pregnant female starts swelling 2 months before parturition, and vulval discharges may occur. Parturition takes 3\u20134 hours, and the female stands throughout this period, though she may rest during brief intervals. The mother consumes the afterbirth and extensively grooms the infant. Her milk is very rich in proteins and low in fat.\nAs in other ruminants, the infant can stand within 30 minutes of birth. Although generally similar to adults, newborn calves have long hairs around the eye (resembling false eyelashes), a long dorsal mane, and long white hairs in the stripes. These features gradually disappear and give way to the general appearance within a year. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. Calves are known not to defecate for the first month or two of life, which is hypothesized to help avoid predator detection in their most vulnerable phase of life. The growth rate of calves is appreciably high in the first few months of life, after which it gradually declines. Juveniles start taking solid food from 3 months, and weaning takes place at 6 months. Ossicone development in males takes 1 year after birth. The okapi's typical lifespan is 20\u201330 years.\nDistribution and habitat [ edit ]\nThe okapi is endemic to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where it occurs north and east of the Congo River. It ranges from the Maiko National Park northward to the Ituri rainforest, then through the river basins of the Rubi, Lake Tele, and Ebola to the west and the Ubangi River further north. Smaller populations exist west and south of the Congo River. It is also common in the Wamba and Epulu areas. It is extinct in Uganda.\nThe okapi inhabits canopy forests at altitudes of 500\u20131,500 m (1,600\u20134,900 ft). It occasionally uses seasonally inundated areas, but does not occur in gallery forests, swamp forests, and habitats disturbed by human settlements. In the wet season, it visits rocky inselbergs that offer forage uncommon elsewhere. Results of research conducted in the late 1980s in a mixed Cynometra forest indicated that the okapi population density averaged 0.53 animals per square kilometre.\nIn 2008, it was recorded in Virunga National Park.\nThere is evidence that okapis were also observed in the Semuliki Valley in Uganda by Europeans, but later became extinct in the late 1970s. The Semuliki Valley provides a similar habitat to the Congo Basin.\nStatus [ edit ]\nThreats and conservation [ edit ]\nThe IUCN classifies the okapi as endangered. It is fully protected under Congolese law. The Okapi Wildlife Reserve and Maiko National Park support significant populations of the okapi, though a steady decline in numbers has occurred due to several threats. Other areas of occurrence are the Rubi Tele Hunting Reserve and the Abumombanzi Reserve. Major threats include habitat loss due to logging and human settlement. Extensive hunting for bushmeat and skin and illegal mining have also led to population declines. A threat that has emerged quite recently is the presence of illegal armed groups around protected areas, inhibiting conservation and monitoring actions. A small population occurs north of the Virunga National Park, but lacks protection due to the presence of armed groups in the vicinity. In June 2012, a gang of poachers attacked the headquarters of the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, killing six guards and other staff as well as all 14 okapis at their breeding center.\nThe Okapi Conservation Project, established in 1987, works towards the conservation of the okapi, as well as the growth of the indigenous Mbuti people. In November 2011, the White Oak Conservation center and Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens hosted an international meeting of the Okapi Species Survival Plan and the Okapi European Endangered Species Programme at Jacksonville, which was attended by representatives from zoos from the US, Europe, and Japan. The aim was to discuss the management of captive okapis and arrange support for okapi conservation. Many zoos in North America and Europe currently have okapis in captivity.\nOkapis in zoos [ edit ]\n1960 Dutch newsreel about okapis in Diergaarde Blijdorp\nAround 100 okapis are in accredited Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) zoos. The okapi population is managed in America by the AZA's Species Survival Plan, a breeding program that works to ensure genetic diversity in the captive population of endangered animals, while the EEP (European studbook) and ISB (Global studbook) are managed by Antwerp Zoo in Belgium, which was the first zoo to have an Okapi on display (in 1919), as well as one of the most successful in breeding them.\nIn 1937, the Bronx Zoo became the first in North America to acquire an okapi. With one of the most successful breeding programs, 13 calves have been born there since 1991. The San Diego Zoo has exhibited okapis since 1956, and their first okapi calf was born in 1962. Since then, there have been more than 60 okapis born at the zoo and the nearby San Diego Zoo Safari Park, the most recent being Mosi, a male calf born on 21 July 2017 at the zoo. The Brookfield Zoo in Chicago has also greatly contributed to the captive population of okapis in accredited zoos. The zoo has had 28 okapi births since 1959.\nOther North American zoos that exhibit and breed okapis include: Denver Zoo and Cheyenne Mountain Zoo (Colorado); Houston Zoo, Dallas Zoo, and San Antonio Zoo (Texas); Disney's Animal Kingdom, White Oak Conservation, Zoo Miami, and ZooTampa at Lowry Park (Florida); Los Angeles Zoo and Sacramento Zoo (California); Saint Louis Zoo (Missouri); Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden and Columbus Zoo and Aquarium (Ohio); Memphis Zoo and Nashville Zoo (Tennessee); The Maryland Zoo in Baltimore (Maryland); Sedgwick County Zoo and Tanganyika Wildlife Park (Kansas); Roosevelt Park Zoo (North Dakota); Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium (Nebraska); Philadelphia Zoo (Pennsylvania); Potawatomi Zoo (Indiana); Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden (Oklahoma); and Blank Park Zoo (Iowa).\nIn Europe, zoos that exhibit and breed okapis include: Chester Zoo, London Zoo, Marwell Zoo, The Wild Place, and Yorkshire Wildlife Park (United Kingdom); Dublin Zoo (Ireland); Berlin Zoo, Frankfurt Zoo, Wilhelma Zoo, Wuppertal Zoo, Cologne Zoo, and Leipzig Zoo (Germany); Zoo Basel (Switzerland); Copenhagen Zoo (Denmark); Rotterdam Zoo and Safaripark Beekse Bergen (Netherlands); Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Zoo (Czech Republic); Wroc\u0142aw Zoo (Poland); Bioparc Zoo de Dou\u00e9 and ZooParc de Beauval (France); and Lisbon Zoo (Portugal).\nIn Asia, three Japanese zoos exhibit okapis: Ueno Zoo in Tokyo; Kanazawa Zoo and Zoorasia in Yokohama.\nReferences [ edit ]"}

Lemurs are woolly-furred, long-tailed, arboreal animals that are found only on the island of Madagascar off the Eastern coast of Africa.\nThere are more than 30 different species and dozens of subspecies of lemurs, ranging in size from the 1 ounce mouse lemur, to the 20 pound Indri.\nThese creatures evolved undisturbed in an isolated environment for millions of years, and thrived in their island paradise until human beings came to Madagascar about 2000 years ago. Since then, people have destroyed over 90 percent of the natural forests, leaving the lemurs, as a group, the most endangered mammals in the world.\nMost lemurs are plant eaters that indulge in the tropical leaves, fruits, shoots and flowers of the island, while occasionally dining on insects, and possibly small reptiles and birds.\nThey are social, active animals with remarkable athletic abilities, who can leap 30 feet or more from limb to limb using their powerful, long legs and strong gripping hands and feet. The long, thickly furred tail is not prehensile, but acts like a rudder as they fly through the air, and a signalling device while on the ground.\nSome species, such as the large, exquisitely black-furred Indri, are almost exclusively tree-dwelling, while the most recognizable species, the beautiful ring-tailed lemur, spends as much as 70 percent of the time on the ground, even sleeping in big, furry, communal, heaps, right out in the open on grass or rocks.\nRing-tail lemurs are small animals, overall, at about 5 or 6 pounds fully grown, but they live in alert communities of 10 to 25 individuals, and use warning calls if danger approaches.\nA group of lemurs is called a conspiracy, and they will, in fact, conspire together against predators, occasionally using a technique called \"mobbing\", where the entire group will attack. This is seen most often against snakes, where families of lemurs will converge on a large ground boa and simply beat it to death.\nOnly Madagascar's largest predator, the awesome fossa, which looks like a small, brown, 25 pound mountain lion, but is actually related to the mongoose, regularly preys on ring-tailed lemurs, although buzzards, large boas, and domestic dogs are also an occasional threat.\nHunting has only recently become an issue, as some of the old customs and traditions of Madagascar change with the times. Lemurs were once considered a sacred animal that was honored and respected. The people believed that harming a lemur in any way would bring bad luck, disease, or even death. But the taboo has eroded, and in the last decade, people have been hunting lemurs for their meat and fur, and lemur dishes are served in local taverns, despite being illegal.\nBut the biggest danger for lemurs is deforestation. With a new president elected in 2014, the government of Madagascar announced a new initiative to save their most iconic citizens. Madagascar's unique wildlife, if preserved wisely, can help the nations ecotourism trade blossom, and with over 200,000 tourists per year and growing, the thousands of species of plants, reptiles, and of course, lemurs, exclusive to this one island, must somehow survive.\nare lemurs monkeys?\nwhite-ruffed lemur\nPrimates are broken into 2 groups, wet-nosed primates like lemurs, lorises, and galagos, and dry-nosed primates like monkeys and apes. (including us).\nThe wet-nosed primates are called prosimians, because they evolved separately from, and millions of years before the monkeys. In fact, the word prosimian literally means \"before monkeys\".\nThe differences between monkeys and prosimians goes beyond the wet, dog-like noses that lemurs and lorises have.\nProsimians don't have the flexible, expressive faces of monkeys, and their eyes and orbital sockets are angled differently from monkeys, with a little more emphasis on peripheral vision, and less on stereoscopic focus.\nMore of the prosimian brain is dedicated to the sense of smell, than to the sense of sight, not surprising, since the dog-like, wet nose is extremely adept.\nAnd prosimians have two very unique features, the tooth comb and the toilet claw, that monkeys lack.\nThe toothcomb is a specialization of the front teeth in the lower jaw. These teeth are long, slender, and perfectly parellel with narrow, even spaces between them. They project horizontally from the mandible, and are used in grooming the fur, just like a barber's comb.\nThe most unusual part of this adaption is the sublingua, or \"under tongue\". It is a small, serrated, secondary structure beneath the tongue, but it doesn't have taste buds or salivary glands, it is specifically designed to clean the toothcomb.\nIn the case of lemurs, the \"toilet claw\" refers to the second toe of the foot, which has a claw, rather than the usual nail, and is used primarily for scratching an itch. The digit that has this adaption, varies among the prosimians, but monkeys do not have this anatomical feature. - Lemur Facts\nlemur lifestyle\nSome lemurs are almost completely arboreal, and able to live the majority of their lives off the ground, high in the trees. Nocturnal lemurs like the aye-aye are mostly solitary animals, while diurnal species like the Indri and Sifaka are very social, living in groups and communicating with numerous calls.\nThese animals are incredibly athletic, and employ a vertical position while climbing. They leap from tree to tree by thrusting against the tree trunk with their long, powerful, frog-like legs that unfold like springs to launch them as far as 30 feet in a single bound. But they come down to the ground in the morning hours to sun themselves, sitting like little Buddhas, hands on their knees, palms up, with their bellies and chests exposed to the warmth.\nOne of the most familiar lemurs is the ring-tailed lemur. The ring-tailed is in it's own genus, differing from other lemur species in a number of ways. They spend more time on the ground than any other species - up to 80% of the time, depending upon their habitat. They are quadrupedal, walking and running on all-fours just like dogs, but will occasionally take a few steps on their hind legs.\nAlthough they eat mostly leaves and fruits found in trees and shrubs, they are the only lemurs that occasionally feed on the ground, and will actually lower their heads like cows to graze on leafy plants and mosses. They live in the largest groups, with 30 or more individuals in a troop, although 12 to 20 is most common.\nRing-tailed lemurs are extremely expressive and vocal animals, with approximately 28 separate calls. They bleat like baby lambs, purr like cats, click and croak like frogs, they make high wails and loud whoops, and regularly engage in group vocalizations, like a pack of wolves howling together.\nThey are also the only lemurs with rings on their tails, an adaption that reflects their more terrestrial lifestyle. The highly visible black rings, usually 13 or 14 on a tail, and always with a black tip, help them keep together, track one another and judge each others moods.\nThe tail plays a big part in their lives. About 15% longer than the lemurs entire body, it is held straight up vertically as they walk, the tip sometimes curled over. Tails wave gracefully like feathers when all is calm, but straighten out tense, hairs on end, like a frightened cat tail during moments of conflict.\nThe tail is not prehensile, but it is expressive, even used as an exhibit of aggression known as a \"stink fight\". The stink fight is a ritualistic battle where males will rub their tails against scent glands on their chests and wrists, and then wave them at each other, projecting their special smell. They will even do handstands thrusting their tails over their heads for impact. It's not really clear how the winner is decided.\nRing-tailed lemurs have a matriarchal society, with a fairly clear order of dominance that is established and maintained by mildly aggressive behaviors like staring, lunging, and pushing. Females are dominant over males, and one mature female is usually in charge, deciding when the group travels, eats or rests.\nEven the lowest ranked female is dominant over all the males in the group. If there is unrest between two neighboring groups of ring-tails, the females will engage each other, not the males, but conflicts are rarely serious.\nDuring their lives, females stay with the group they were born into, while males will leave and integrate into neighboring groups when they are 3 to 5 years old.\nMale ring-tailed lemurs have scent glands on their chest, rumps and wrists. The wrist glands have a spur-like fingernail that is known as the horny spur. They will use this spur to rake at the trunks of sapling trees with their wrists leaving a gash in the tree that is filled with their scent. This is both a visual and olfactory marking of territory.\nLemurs have opposable thumbs and big toes, but they don't display any tool use in the wild, and don't usually handle or play with inanimate objects as monkeys do. During research experiments using touch screens, they do not use their fingers as monkeys do, instead touching the screen with their noses.\nStill, lemurs at the Duke University primate center have displayed the ability to learn tool use, solve intricate problems and to discriminate quantities - in effect, to count. - Lemur Facts\nRed-ruffed Lemur\nlemur reproduction\nlemur babies\nring-tailed lemur mother and babies\nFemale ring-tailed lemurs come into season once a year, for only about 24 hours, during which she may mate with multiple partners. The ring-tailed lemurs mating season is from late April to early June, which means births coincide with the beginning of the rainy season, sometime between August and September. This insures that nursing mothers will have plenty of food sources to carry them through the stress of rearing youngsters.\nFemale lemurs have anal scent glands that indicate when they are in season. The male lemur has special scent glands on his chest and wrists that release a chemical blueprint of his health and fitness. He pulls his tail against his chest and rubs these glands against it, and then waves his tail in the females direction, luring her with his odor. Males will wave their tails at each other too, in mock battles called \"stink fights\".\nFemales ring-tails are pregnant for 135 to 145 days, and give birth to one, or sometimes two infants. The newborn lemur has thick fur, open eyes and a clasping instinct that gives it the ability to cling to it's mothers chest just moments after birth.\nBabies will travel underneath their mother, sometimes held by her, but capable of staying on all by themselves, for 2 weeks, and then they start migrating to her back, where they will ride like a tiny jockey, and cling on tight as she flies through the forest.\nOnce the baby lemur has reached about three weeks old, it will start to venture off it's mother's back, just for brief moments, and then hop right back on.\nBoth male and female adults in the troop interact with infants, and may babysit briefly as the mother rests or forages. If a baby is orphaned, the troop will take over it's care, and another nursing mother may adopt it.\nBecause lemur reproduction is strictly seasonal, all the babies are born at the same time of year, between late August and early September, and grow up together.\nBy six weeks or so, they are playing together in excited little nursery groups, cuddling, wrestling and bouncing through the trees. They are weaned at 8 to 10 weeks, and stop riding on their mother's backs after 12 to 14 weeks.\nThe youngsters are independent by eight months, but stay close to their mothers. Females will remain with the same troop for life, while young males will move to other troops at 3 to 5 years old, and may switch groups every few years. This insures genetic diversity within the species. - Lemur Facts\nCrowned Sifaka mother and infant\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

This tiny, wide-eyed creature is the tinyest living primate at only 5 inches from head to tail. Mouse lemurs are nocturnal, and feed mainly on insects. They hunt at night, using their incredible night vision and powerful sense of smell, plucking insects from tree limbs, and rustling through undergrowth for beetles and grubs.\nThe aye-aye is a startling and strange looking animal, with rough-textured, shaggy grey fur, huge eyes and ears, and curious specialized fingers. Like nocturnal woodpeckers, they use their long bony finger to tap on branches, locating grubs under the bark and spearing them out with their specialized claws. Aye-ayes make large nests in the crooks of trees and sleep all day, out of the suns glare.\nThe Indri is the largest lemur species at up to 25 pounds. They are called \"Babakoto\" which means \"little father\", because the locals believe they are our direct ancestor. Indi live in small groups of 6 to 12 individuals, who routinely call across the forest to each other with loud, eerie, whale-like sounds.\nFinally, nine species of lemurs known as sifakas, are iconic creatures in Madagascar. They have beautiful coats of contrasting colors, and are famous for their hopping gate.\nAmazing climbers and incredible leapers, the sifakas have slender, elongated limbs and torso. They bounce effortlessly through the woods, pushing off tree trunks with their long, frog-like back legs, like little Parkour runners.\nBut when they come down to the ground to sun themselves, and to move between tree groves, or cross man-made obstacles like roads and railroad tracks, they hop along on their hind legs in big, sideways bounds, their hands held out wide for balance. It looks like a dance of joy, and certainly is delightful to watch. - Amazing!\nhow does the sifaka cross the road?\na few more lemur facts\nLemurs are only found on the island of Madagascar and tiny neighboring Comoro islands\nLemurs are primates, but they are not monkeys\nLemurs have lower front teeth that are fashioned into a comb for grooming\nRing-tailed lemurs spend the most time on the ground\nThe aye-aye has a special, long, boney finger, for hunting insects\nNatives believed whoever the aye-aye pointed its finger at was doomed\nThe lemur has a wet nose, like a dog, and a great sense of smell\nScientists think lemur ancestors drifted to the island of Madagascar on clumps of floating vegetation"}

Therefore, the divergences may not be very clear on many occasions. However, they vary in color and the pattern of their spots. Today, we'll talk about nine different giraffe species.\nIt\u2019s the tallest animal of all, and it can reach heights of 20 feet. The giraffe stands out for its long neck and beautifully patterned fur, and only lives in the wild in different regions of Africa. Many are unaware that there are actually a number of different species in this mammal family, each with its own distinctive spot pattern. Today, we\u2019ll help you discover nine different giraffe species!\nHow many different giraffe species exist?\nFascinating and beautiful at the same time, you can admire giraffes during those typical Africa safaris through a wide variety of national parks. Basically, you can differentiate between them by the patterns on their fur and the color of their spots.\nThese different species are able to mate among one another\u2013a phenomenon known as hybridization or cross-breeding. As a result, they produce new subspecies. It can be difficult to distinguish between these subspecies, given that the differences between them can be very slight.\nWith their long legs and extra large necks, these mammals walk and gallop, depending on the occasion. They can reach the highest branches in search of leaves and tender buds, and then spend several hours ruminating.\nThe known giraffe species in existence are the following:\n1. Nubian giraffe\nThe Nubian giraffe lives in Ethiopia and Sudan. It stands out from other giraffes because its spots have an irregular square shape. They\u2019re dark brown with a light background, and don\u2019t appear on the belly, inner thighs, or below the knees.\n2. Kordofan giraffe\nThis particular species is not very common, as its population is very small and spread out over Congo, Sudan, Chad, and the Central African Republic. In comparison to other giraffes, the Kordofan is relatively small and its spots become more irregular on its belly and legs.\n3. West African giraffe\nThe West African giraffe is endemic in the region and its habitat includes three countries: Burkina Faso, Chad, and N\u00edger. In the past, it also lived in Nigeria. It\u2019s now in danger of extinction and stands out for its reddish spots with a yellow background.\n4. Rothschild giraffe\nThis giraffe gets its name from the British zoologist Walter Rothschild and lives in protected areas in Kenya and Uganda. While it\u2019s not at risk of extinction, the decrease in pure specimens due to hybridization is alarming.\nThis species stands out from the rest thanks to its dark spots and because it can develop five \u201chorns\u201d. These include the two typical horns that all species possess, as well as another set behind its ears. And, finally, it can have one more horn in the middle of its head.\n5. Reticulated giraffe\nOriginating from Somalia, Kenya, and Ethiopia, this giraffe is one of the most well-known. Its appearance is characterized by large, polygonal, liver-colored spots against a bright white background.\nIt\u2019s also one of the tallest among the different giraffe species. The males of this species perform a ritual known as \u201cnecking\u201d, in which they hit their necks against one another in order to determine who gets the females in the herd.\n6. Masai giraffe\nThis is the largest among all of the giraffe species. While it used to live throughout the entire African continent, it now resides only in Kenya and Tanzania. The spots on its body are jagged and irregular. Another characteristic that distinguishes the Masai giraffe is its ability to kill predators with a single kick if attacked when their young are near.\n7. Rhodesian giraffe, more commonly known as Thornicroft\u2019s giraffe\nThe Rhodesian, also known as Thornicroft\u2019s giraffe, lives only in Zambia, specifically in the South Luangwa National Park. The spots on its body are dark and have a very light background. In males, the spots are darker than in females.\n8. South African giraffe\nThis species lives in the southern region of the African continent, in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa. Their round and star-shaped spots set them apart from other giraffes. They even have these spots on their legs and hooves.\n9. The Angolan giraffe\nThe Angolan or Namibian giraffe extends throughout Angola, Zambia, Botswana, and Namibia. One of the particularities of the species in comparison with other species is that its spots are irregular and jagged. What\u2019s more, their color fades toward the edges and they have the shape of a tree leaf on the back of their bodies. You can see these giraffes in Etosha National Park in Namibia."}

Most of them get around 10 minutes to two hours of sleep per day.\nThe patterns on a giraffe are totally unique \u2013 no two giraffes are ever the same!\nGiraffes used to be known as \u2018camel leopards\u2019, due to their tall structure and leopard-like pattern. The scientific name today has not changed \u2013 Camelopardalis.\nThe name was given to these creatures by Julius Caesar, who received a giraffe as a gift and was thrilled with it! After showing it off to the people of Rome, he ended up feeding it to the lions.\nTheir tongues can be as long as 45cm, allowing them to get their lunch from very tall trees!\nBetween their pregnancies, female giraffes only have a two-week window in which to get pregnant.\nGiraffes conserve water very well, mainly because they don\u2019t sweat or pant when hot. Adult giraffes only need to find water once a day.\nThey can run up to speeds of 35 miles per hour, outrunning most horses. Their long legs mean that they can cover plenty of space in a short amount of time, making their average walking speed around 10 miles per hour.\nA giraffe\u2019s sharp 12-inch hooves can cause a lot of damage, and could even kill a lion if necessary.\nA giraffe\u2019s tongue is blue-back to protect it from sunburn in hot climates.\nEver wondered what sound a giraffe makes? These animals often snort and hiss, but can also make very low sounds which are impossible for humans to hear.\nGiraffes are able to drink up to 10 gallons of water each day, and also get water from the plants they eat, including acacias.\nA giraffe\u2019s heart weighs around 11kg, compared to a human heart which weighs between 0.2-0.45kg.\nOf all land mammals, the giraffe boasts the longest tail. Adult giraffes can have tails up to 8 feet long.\nWhen females need to go and hunt food, one of them will stay behind and babysit the young giraffes.\nBaby giraffes play together in a cr\u00e8che for the first five months of their lives. Their mothers will usually be out hunting food.\nA giraffe can move at only two speeds \u2013 walk and gallop.\nEven though a giraffe has a longer neck than all other mammals, it still only has seven vertebrae in its neck, which is the same amount as other animals.\nGiraffes have amazing eyesight, which means that they can wander away from one another but find their way back very easily.\nMale giraffes and female giraffes eat from different parts of the same tree. This is to prevent competition between the males and females. Do you know the fact that giraffes were often depicted as creatures of great power and strength in In ancient Egyptian art. And until these days, this animal have been still greatly loved and honoured by humans. Here are some more great other facts about this wild animal for you to know!"}

Interesting facts about Giraffe reproduction you might didn\u2019t know. The Giraffe breeding season can occur at any time during the year. However, births in the wild usually happen during the dry season and births in captivity can happen all year round. Giraffes reach sexual maturity in captivity at around 3 \u2013 4 years old, however, in the wild, males do not usually breed until they are 6 \u2013 7 years old. In contrast to the male breeding age, females must be physically larger to carry offspring.\nWhen male giraffes are ready to breed, they begin the ritual combat over mates. Giraffes are non- territorial and a successful male giraffe will mate with receptive female giraffes whenever and wherever it finds them. Gestation period is usually 13 \u2013 15 months and when a pregnant female giraffe is ready to give birth, she makes her way to a calving area that she will use throughout her life. The moment of birth is dramatic, with the mother giraffe standing on all fours and the calf tumbling onto the ground. Remarkably, the calf is rarely injured by its fall.\nNewborn giraffes are often on their feet within 20 minutes and are soon feeding on their mothers milk. Calves can walk about an hour after birth and can run within 24 hours of birth. Giraffe calves are about 2 metres (6 feet) tall at birth and weigh 104 \u2013 154 pounds. Giraffe calves grow about 3 centimetres tall each day during the first week and double their height in their first year.\nBy the age of one year giraffe calves can measure 10 feet tall. Giraffe calves are weaned at one year and become fully independent by 15 months of age. Female giraffe calves are fully grown by age five and male giraffe calves by the age of seven.\nBaby giraffe may suckle for up to a year, however, they start to sample plants just a few weeks after birth. Giraffe calves are ready to leave the protection of their mother after 15 \u2013 18 months of development.\nAdult giraffes generally have no predators other than lions and humans, as their huge hooves are very effective in defending against predators. Giraffes are more vulnerable when they are lying down or drinking, because this gives lions the opportunity to leap up and seize them by the nose or throat. Newly born calves are at much greater risk. Despite their mothers best efforts to protect them, over 50 percent of all giraffe newborns are killed by hyenas and big cats such as lions and leopards during the first month of their life.In captivity, giraffes have lived over the age of 30 years, however, their maximum life span in the wild is about 25 years."}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Rhino Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Rhino-facts.html", "text": "rhino Facts\nPortrait of a White Rhino\nThe rhino is the second largest land animal after the elephant. They have thick, bare skin, which is sometimes arranged over their bodies like plates of armor, barrel-like bodies, gigantic heads, and incredible horns protruding from their faces.\nThe mass is supported by short, stout legs and wide feet that have three both front and rear. Each individual toe ends in a hoof, which leave a footprint that looks like the Ace of clubs.\nThese animals have remained unchanged for thousands of years, so the resemblance to dinosaurs like triceratops is intriguing, but their closest relatives are actually tapirs and horses.\nThere are 5 species of rhinoceros, 3 living in Asia, and 2 in Africa. All rhino species are endangered, except for one subspecies of white rhino, which has recently been brought back from the brink of extinction.\nThe most familiar rhinoceros species are the black rhino and the white rhino, but both of these animals are actually grey in color. The term \"white\" stems from a misinterpretation of the word \"wide\" describing the shape of the white rhinos mouth, and the black rhino is so called because it is often the color of the mud it covers itself with.\nThe African rhinos can be 6 feet tall at the shoulder and average about 3000 pounds. They have massive, low-slung heads that feature unusually forward eye placement, and long, sharp, dramatic looking horns.\nThe word rhinoceros basically means \"nose horn\" in Latin.\nThe white, black and Javan rhinos have two horns, while the Indian (also known as the greater one-horned) and Sumatran, (also known as the hairy rhinoceros), have one. These horns are made of keratin, like human nails, and grow out of the skin in a similar fashion.\nRhinos are intimidating looking creatures, and will charge when confronted or threatened, but they are not generally aggressive towards humans, and only 2 or 3 attacks are reported a year. In comparison, fatalities from elephant attacks number 400 to 500 a year, and hippos kill about 2,900 people annually!\nThe Asian rhinos in particular, are shy, reclusive, and even timid.\nThe rhinoceros is strictly vegetarian, grazing on grasses or browsing trees and shrubs for leaves, shoots and fruits. They are mostly solitary, especially when feeding, since their food intake of 40 to 80 pounds of vegetation a day, requires them to spread out.\nSmall social groups do form, consisting of females and their young, or young males banding together, and herds of as many as 30 individuals may be created near water sources during drought conditions.\nWallowing in mud is somewhat of a social event as well, and favorite spots may attract large numbers of rhinos at a time, but generally, they are not gregarious. - Rhino Facts\nrhino lifestyle\nwhite rhinoceros\nblack rhinoceros\nThe white rhinoceros and the black rhinoceros live in small pockets of grasslands on the floodplains of Southern and Eastern Africa. Because of their size they require a home range of about 5 square miles that is rich in resources.\nAbundant vegetation is vital to survival, but unlike many African animals who regularly go for many days without drinking, the water from the plants rhinos eat is not sufficient for them, and they will visit watering holes multiple times a day, drinking heartily.\nDuring drought, they may have to walk up to ten miles between their water source and their food source.\nWet areas also supply them with muddy banks that they will wallow and bathe in, coating their sensitive skin with mud as protection from heat and insect bites.\nRhinoceros skin is a paradox. It can be an inch thick in some areas to protect them from battles with other rhinos, but it is actually very soft, and subject to sores and sunburn.\nThe black rhinoceros is particularly prone to inflamed red areas of skin called \"rhino sores\". Usually forming in the region of skin behind the front legs, rhino sores are parasitic infestations of tiny worms living just below the skin.\nRhinoceroses spend over 12 hours a day foraging and grazing across their territory. They are both nocturnal and diurnal, being most active at dawn and dusk, and alternating a few hours each of feeding and resting throughout the day and night. During the hottest seasons, they will feed mostly at night, and rest and wallow in the heat of the day.\nThe white rhino is by far the most social species, often seen in small communal herds of 5 to 10 individuals, and it is believed that loss of territory is forcing them to become more and more tolerant of each other.\nBlack rhinos are far less gregarious, and are also the most pugnacious of the rhino species. Adult male black rhinos can be quite territorial and may battle to the death.\nAlthough the rhinos within a given area may not see or socialize with each other much, they use communal dung heaps that act as message boards. Both males and females will relieve themselves in these areas, usually kicking around in the pile to spread their scent.\nRhinos have very poor eyesight, but excellent senses of smell and hearing. They are fairly vocal as well, with approximately 10 to 12 specific snorts and calls of warning, greeting, excitement, anger and delight.\n- Amazing Rhino Facts\nrhino reproduction\nblack rhino mother and baby\nwhite rhino mother and baby\nDominant male rhinos establish territories by marking the perimeters with urine and dung, and actively defending the area against other aggressive males.\nA large number of male rhinoceroses, although sexually mature, take a subordinate role in rhino society, and are tolerated by dominant males so long as they display submissive behavior. These males may never even attempt to establish a territory, and will never have the opportunity to mate.\nThe female rhinos home range may overlap several male rhinos territories. She and her youngsters freely move throughout these areas, and females themselves are not generally territorial with other females.\nShe comes into estrous several times a year, and males can detect her condition through the scent of her urine.\nDominant males will follow and court her, attempting to herd her into their territory. Once there, the male may try to keep her close until she is willing to mate. At this time, males may become extremely aggressive with each other, and violent fights may occur.\nWhite, black and Indian rhinos have courtship rituals that involve males and females sparring with each other. The Javan and Sumatran rhinos are so shy and rare, that very little is known about their reproductive habits.\nOnce the female accepts a males overtures, the pair may stay together for a few days or even weeks, even sleeping in close contact. Or, the mating may be over in just a few hours, and she may go on to mate with other males during the same period.\nThe female is pregnant for approximately 16 months. When she is close to delivering she will drive off any youngster she currently has.\nThe birth may take place standing or lying down, and the newborn rhino is gigantic, weighing anywhere from 75 to 150 pounds.\nThe baby is born without a horn, which begins to grow within a few weeks, but is otherwise a miniature adult.\nTheir eyes are open, they are vocal, and they stand and nurse within minutes. Rhino calves begin to sample solid foods at just a week or two old, and are generally weaned at 2 years. They grow very quickly over the first few months of life, gaining as much as 5 pounds in a day!\nWhen traveling, white rhino calves usually walk in front of their mother, probably because, with her poor eyesight, she can keep track of it better. Black rhino calves, however, always follow behind. This may be because the black rhino lives in heavier vegetation, and the mother must clear the way for her calf.\nYoung rhinos are raised by their mothers only, and will stay with her for 2 to 5 years, until she is ready to give birth to a new baby.\nJuveniles that have been driven off by their mothers may band together in pairs or little groups until they reach sexual maturity at 3 to 6 years. Females usually have their first birth at 5 or 6 years old. Most males will not attempt to claim their own territory until they are at least 10 years old.\nRhinos reach full size, including full horn length, at about 8 years old, but males may continue to fill out for another 3 to 4 years, sometimes reaching 15 feet in total length, and weighing 6,000 pounds at the high end for white rhinos. - Rhino Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Many more are fined or imprisoned. But the trade remains a healthy one, and international efforts may not be enough to save the rhino in the wild.\nThe rhinoceros horn, like a human nail, will grow back in a few years if cut off, so some groups are choosing to tranquilize and de-horn adult rhinos. The operation is done with a chainsaw, and a large amount of the horns base, where nerve endings are still present, must remain in order not to harm the animal.\nWhile most poachers kill rhinos outright in order to remove the horn, even if they were to tranquilize, they will not leave any priceless horn material behind, and the animal would still die.\nFurthermore, in areas where dehorning is carried out by conservation groups, the poachers will kill de-horned individuals anyway, so that they don't waste time and resources tracking the same animal again. - Rhino Facts\nrhinos!\nThe white rhino\nsouthern white rhino\nThe largest of all the rhinos, the white rhino can reach over 6 feet at the shoulder, 15 feet in length and 6,000 pounds! But the white rhino isn't white, it is grey.\nThe assumption is that the term \"white\" came from a misinterpretation of the word \"wide\", referring to the animals wide, squared-off lips. The species is also known as the square-lipped, or wide-lipped rhino, and the lip shape is the easiest way to identify the species\nThis is a grazing animal, built with a gigantic, downward dangling head, that is just long enough to mow the ground, with methodical, side to side sweeping motions. The top lip is soft and mobile while the bottom lip is stiffer and serves to shear grass blades very close to the ground.\nThe head of the white rhinoceros is proportionately larger than that of the other species, allowing it to comfortably graze for hours on end, and there is a corresponding shoulder hump of powerful muscles to support it.\nWhen turning around in tight spots they will rotate their rear ends around their front legs in a movement reminiscent of a tractor trailer, but out in the open, and when moving in a straight line, they can be quite swift, with a powerful, and even graceful trotting gate.\nThere are two subspecies of white rhinoceros. At an estimated 20,000 wild individuals, the Southern white rhino is the most populous of all rhino subspecies, while the Northern white rhino is extinct in the wild, and is, as of 9/16, represented by only 3 captive individuals.\nThese 3 precious animals, 1 male and 2 females, are kept under armed guard at Ol Pejeta Conservancy, a sanctuary in Kenya.\nAttempts are being made to save the Northern white rhinoceros through in-vitro fertilization, but time is running out.\nWhite rhinoceroses live on the grassy plains of Africa, and are specialized eaters. They mow grass blades close to the ground, massive mouth fulls at a time, with their broad muzzles and strong lip pads.\nThey are a bit more social than other species, and confrontations tend to be more ritualized and less violent. Dominant males maintain territories but allow submissive males to pass through without much incident. Females move through the territories of numerous males, and females with young will occasionally travel together.\nAdult white rhinos have no natural predators, but juveniles may be taken by lions, hyenas and crocodiles. - White Rhino Facts\nthe black rhino\nblack rhinoceros covered with mud\nThe third largest of all rhino species, the black rhino can be 5 1/2 feet at the shoulder, 12 1/5 feet long and over 3,000 pounds.\nThe origin of their name isn't really understood, because, like the white rhino, the black rhinos skin is also grey. In fact, there really isn't any difference between their average skin color of the black and white rhinos, but it is possible that the mud black rhinos cover themselves with is darker, overall, in the areas that they live, occasionally making them appear black, or ashy in color.\nBlack rhinos are mostly solitary, with adult males staying almost exclusively by themselves, and females co-mingling mostly just with their own offspring.\nThe individuals in a particular range are called a \"clan\", and the dominant males will maintain territories whose boundaries overlap. When two males meet, they may engage in ritualistic horn wrestling, which allows for a test of strength, without the risk of injury or death.\nBlack rhinos are designed for foraging, not grazing. They don't require open grasslands, but instead live in more rugged terrain, often hilly, rocky or wooded. They make trails throughout their range that tunnel directly through the brush, and will simply crash through vegetation when no trails are present.\nBlack rhinos have much smaller heads than the white rhinos, and so don't have a prominent shoulder hump. They have a more forward head placement that puts their mouths in line with the low shrubs and bushes they feed on.\nA pointed, prehensile upper lip, that almost resembles a birds beak, curls around shoots, leaves and fruits, and pulls them into the mouth. Because of this feature, the black rhinoceros is often referred to as the \"hook-lipped\" rhino.\nThe black rhino has a reputation for being a far more dangerous animal than the white rhino, but its habitat may be part of the reason, since most rhino attacks occur when the rhino is startled, and the black rhino lives in much denser areas where visibility may be limited.\nThe adult black rhinoceros has no natural predators, but elephants will often run them off, and mature female elephants, for whatever reason, are often intolerant of them.\nViolent confrontations between black rhinos and African elephants have been documented, with fatalities reported on both sides. - Black Rhino Facts\nthe indian rhino\nIndian Rhinoceros\nThe Indian rhino is more recently being referred to as the \"Great one-horned\" or \"Great Indian one-horned\", or simply \"One-horned\" rhinoceros. In the past, it was regularly referred to as the Asian rhino.\nThis is the second largest rhino species, but is sometimes considered the largest. Indian rhinos are, on average, taller than white rhinos, often at 6 1/2 feet at the shoulder, but white rhinos tend to be heavier, and the largest individuals recorded are white rhinos.\nThe Indian rhino has a single horn on its muzzle, and incredible, thickly folded skin, that absolutely looks like a full coat of armor. The skin even has numerous warty bumps, called tubercles, across the shoulders and flanks that look like rivets, and the effect is positively amazing.\nDespite its aggressive appearance, the Great one-horned rhino is a relatively peaceful creature, with very little of the territorial jousting that occurs among the more familiar black and white rhinos of Africa.\nIn fact, the Indian rhino doesn't even use its single 2 foot long horn in battle. If they do have confrontations, they use their large, tusk-like lower incisor teeth, to bite or jab their opponent.\nIndian rhinos eat both grass and brush, and so their lips are less pointed than the black rhino, but still have a small prehensile tip. They spend evenings and mornings feeding, and hot afternoons wallowing in swampy areas.\nThe indian rhino is mostly solitary, only coming together to mate. Babies are particular large, and are rarely under 125 pounds at birth.\nThis is an endangered species that has experienced an amazing comeback over the last several decades. With population estimates at less than 600 individuals in 1975, they have regained a solid foothold with well over 3,000 animals as of 2016.\nThe citizens and governments of Nepal and Indian have achieved an unprecedented conservation success, and continue to monitor and defend these incredible animals in the wild. - Indian Rhino Facts\nthe sumatran rhino\nSumatran Rhinoceros\nThe Sumatran rhino is the smallest of the five rhino species, with individuals rarely reaching 10 feet in length or more than 4 1/2 to 5 feet at the shoulder.\nThese rhinos have a reddish brown color, and can have quite a bit of hair, particularly on the legs and belly. The hair tends to disperse as the animals mature, and older Sumatran rhinos also tend to loose the reddish tinge.\nSumatran rhinos are solitary and secretive, living at higher elevations than the other species, in tropical rainforests of Sumatra and Borneo. They have been recorded at altitudes of up to 6,500 feet, but logging ventures have depleted their available territory, and the future looks bleak for these fascinating creatures.\nThey are very critically endangered with only 80 to 100 individuals believed living in the wild as of 2016. There are some specimens living in Zoos, but they do not thrive in captivity, and many have perished, even under expert care.\nSumatran rhinos are rather primitive, and are most closely related to the extinct whoolly rhino, a common ancestor of the Asian rhino species.\nSumatran rhinos live in heavily forested and hilly terrain, and are remarkably adept climbers, pushing through the gnarliest brush, and straight up slopes too steep for a person to climb except on all fours.\nThey create tunnel like pathways through the thickest undergrowth, that remain for other animals to utilize.\nThey are far more likely to be heard in the wild than seen, because of the impenetrable nature of their jungle environment, and because they are reported to be very vocal, snorting, chirping and chortling to themselves as they go about their day. - Sumatran Rhino Facts\nThe Javan Rhino\nJavan Rhinoceros\nWith its single horn and heavily pleated skin, the Javan rhino, also known as the Lesser one-horned rhino, looks and acts very much like the Indian rhino.\nThe Javan rhino has a small head by rhino standards, and the horn is also small, rarely reaching more than 10 inches. Females don't usually develop a pronounced horn at all, but the base is present.\nThe Javan rhino is one of the rarest large mammals in the world. In 2016 less than 50 individuals survive in Indonesia\u2019s Ujung Kulon National Park, on the island of Java. These few are the only population left in the world, and none exist in zoos.\nThe Javan rhinoceros once existed throughout Cambodia, Sumatra, Thailand and Vietnam, but the last wild individual outside of Java was poached in Vietnam in 2010.\nVietnam is the largest consumer of rhino products, for medicinal, spiritual and ritualistic purposes, which are not only made from the horn, but from hide, hooves, blood and urine. Even rhino ears and tails are highly prized in Vietnam, so the Javan rhinos small horn, or the lack of a horn on Java rhino females, did not protect them from extreme poaching.\nOne encouraging point about poaching in Nepal and throughout Asia, is a trend since the late 1980's towards the use of liquid and powdered rhinoceros urine in place of rhino blood, for medicines to treat asthma, lung ailments and fever.\nSome zoos and nature preserves collect the urine and supply it for free, which may have an impact on poaching. - Javan Rhino Facts\na few more rhino facts\nWhite rhinos and Black rhinos are both actually grey in color\nWhite rhinos are probably called \"white\" due to a misinterpretation of the word for \"wide\" referring to their wide, straight lips.\nThe Black rhino may be called black because they often cover themselves with very dark mud.\nThe largest rhino horns can be over 4 feet in length!\nRhinoceros skin is over an inch thick in some parts of the body\nRhinos are not nearly as dangerous as they look, and only about 3 attacks a year are reported.\nIt is occasionally suggested that rhinos have \"extra ribs\", but they actually have 18 pairs, which is the same number of ribs that horses have.\nWhite Rhino Mother and Calf"}

On average, okapi weighs between 440 and 700 pounds. They can be up to 6.5 feet tall and reach 8.1 feet in length.\nOkapi has dark purple or reddish brown velvety fur, with white horizontal stripes on their front and hind legs.\nOkapi slightly resembles to zebra because of the stripes, but it shares much more similarities with giraffe. It has long skull, large black eyes and very long, purplish tongue, just like giraffe.\nOkapi's tongue is 18 inches long and it can reach both its eyes and ears.\nOkapi's tongue is prehensile, which means that is used for stripping the leaves and buds from stems of various plants. Besides leaves, okapi eats fruits, grasses, ferns and twigs.\nOkapi is mostly active during the afternoon and in the early evening. It often travel 0.5 to 2.5 miles per day while searching for food.\nOkapi is a ruminant, just like cow. It swallows and regurgitates its food for additional chewing several times.\nOnly male okapis have horns which are covered with skin. Females have bumps on their head instead of horns. Horns are short to prevent tangling with dense vegetation in the rainforest.\nOkapi has large ear and excellent sense of hearing which is used for detection of potential danger. Okapi also has excellent sense of smell.\nLeopard is the only natural enemy of the okapi in the wild.\nOkapis are solitary and territorial animals. They produce tar-like substance and release urine to mark their territory.\nFemale okapi vocalizes when she is ready for the mating. Males and females spend few weeks together, which is enough for females to become pregnant.\nPregnancy lasts between 14 and 16 months and it ends with one calf. Young okapi looks like an adult animal, except it has a fringe of hair along its spine. It disappears at the age of one year.\nCalf spends first few weeks of its life hidden in dense vegetation. It does not defecate for the first 4 to 8 weeks because it is too weak and it can be easily detected (sniffed out) by predators."}

Tigers also hiss, growl, moan, and chuff.\n2. Dogs\nDogs have been loyal and useful companions to humans through the ages, providing physical and emotional security as loving pets.\nThere are about 400 million+ dogs in the entire world.\nDogs are quite useful as they carry out farm work, provide security, hunt, and even play guides to the visually-impaired. They are wonderful companions for children and the elderly, due to their ability to give care and unflinching love.\nThe most popular breeds of dogs include Labrador, Golden Retriever, Bulldog, German Shepherd, Greyhound, St. Bernard, Great Dane, Chihuahua, etc.\nDue to the strong emotional connect dogs form with humans as pets, they are known as \u201cman\u2019s best friend\u201d. They are extremely loyal and are known to spend their entire lifetime with their masters.\nDogs have a terrific sense of hearing as compared to humans and can hear sounds at four times the distance.\nThe average life of a dog depending on the breed can vary from 10 to 14 years.\nDue to their amazing sense of smell, dogs are capable of differentiating and recognising odours. For this reason, they are used to sniff out drugs and weapons by anti-terrorist squads and police departments all over the world.\nAs per the available scientific evidence, dogs are known to have been domesticated about 15000 years ago.\nDomesticated dogs are omnivores, as they can eat grains, vegetables, and meat as a part of their diet.\nDogs are incredibly emotional and actually get jealous when they see their master getting friendly with another human or animal.\n3. Dolphin\nDolphins are blessed with powerful eyesight and hearing, which they use along with echolocation to find the right location of objects.\nDolphins use whistling, clicking and other sounds to communicate with each other.\nThe Killer Whale or Orca is actually a type of a dolphin.\nMale dolphins are called bulls, females as cows and young dolphins are known as calves.\nThe most common type of dolphins found is Bottlenose dolphins.\nDolphins have a blowhole located at the top of their heads which they use to breathe.\nA group of dolphins is known as a pod or a school which consists of a dozen of these intelligent animals.\nDolphins are known to be extremely intelligent creatures and can interact with humans. They have a playful attitude which they display by riding waves and jumping in and out of the water, thus making them popular with kids and adults alike.\nDue to the use of nets, a large number of dolphins are killed every year and many species have become extinct.\nDolphins are meat-eating (carnivores) mammals.\nDolphins are incredibly social, and easily make friends with other dolphins,. In fact, they are said to create several \u2018social networks\u2019.\n4. Elephants\nElephants are the world\u2019s largest mammals living on land.\nThe African Elephant and the Asian Elephant are the two types of elephants, with Bush Elephant and Forest Elephant being sub-types of the African Elephant.\nThe elephant\u2019s trunk is entirely made up of about 100,000 muscles and no bones. A full-grown elephant\u2019s trunk can weigh about 140 kilograms and measure up to 2 metres.\nThe elephant uses its trunk to know the size, shape, and temperature of objects. It is used to suck in water or pick up food and put it into its mouth.\nAn adult elephant needs to drink more than 200 litres of water every day and it uses its tusks to dig the earth for this purpose.\nThe huge, thin ears of an elephant are made of blood vessels which help them to regulate their body temperature.\nElephants use their trunks to breathe when they swim in deep waters.\nElephants spend more than 16 hours every day uprooting twigs, leaves, and roots for their nourishment.\nMale elephants leave their herds when they reach 13 years of age, while females live in their herd for their entire lifetime.\nFemale elephants can get pregnant after 11 years of age and the pregnancy duration in elephants is 22 months.\nElephants are the most intelligent mammals, after the great apes (humans, gorillas, chimpanzees, etc.)\n5. Giraffe\nA full-grown male giraffe can weigh up to 1400 kilograms\nThe length of a giraffe\u2019s neck measures between 1.5 to 1.8 metres.\nA giraffe\u2019s tail is made up of hair that is about 10 times thicker than human hair.\nHorns are present on male and female giraffes, with males having up to three horns.\nThe female giraffe delivers her baby while standing up and the baby falls about six feet without injuring itself.\nA male giraffe fights using its neck, by swinging it from one side to the other.\nThe spots on a giraffe\u2019s body act as camouflage for protection against predators.\nA giraffe has four stomachs, which speeds up the digestion process.\nGiraffes are most vulnerable while bending down to drink water, as they cannot see an approaching predator.\nA giraffe\u2019s tongue is coated with bristly hair, which helps them to eat leaves from thorny trees like Acacia.\nJust like human fingerprints, no two giraffes have the same pattern on their body.\n6. Lion\nA male lion weighs around 180 kilograms, while an average female lion can weigh up to 130 kilograms.\nA lion\u2019s roar is so powerful, that it can be heard from eight kilometres away.\nThe heaviest lion ever weighed was at a mind-boggling 375 kilograms.\nThe responsibility of hunting mostly lies with female lions, as they are better hunters than males.\nLions are known to rest for around 20 hours a day.\nMales who possess darker manes are more likely to attract lionesses (female lions) for mating.\nLions do not possess a lot of stamina, due to which they can run only in short bursts.\nCountries like Singapore, Ethiopia, England, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, and Albania have named the lion as their national animal.\nLions have a lifespan of about 12 years.\nThe breeding of lion and tigers gives birth to off-spring known as ligers and tigons.\nLions are the most sociable animals in the cat family and live in prides of up to 25 individuals.\n7. Sharks\nA shark possesses an amazingly sharp sense of smell and can detect even a single drop of blood in the water.\nA shark\u2019s skeleton is made up of cartilage that is tough and has flexible tissues. There is not a single bone in their bodies.\nThey possess powerful hearing too, because of which they can hear a fish thrashing around even 500 metres away.\nSharks have a set of smaller teeth behind the front teeth. The smaller teeth move forward and the front teeth then fall off.\nSharks have to keep moving to get oxygen into their bloodstream, as the water passes over the gills.\nGreat whites can cut through the water at a speed of 30 km/ h and are the deadliest of all.\nThe whale shark can grow up to a massive length of 14 metres when fully developed.\nSome shark species lay eggs instead of living pups.\nA baby shark has to fend for itself right from birth, as its own mother could eat it up.\nThe great white has to eat large quantities of meat to keep its body temperature regulated.\nEach shark species has a different set of teeth\n8. Whales\nThere are about 80 different species of whales with different shapes and sizes.\nCreatures like sea lice and barnacles stick to the whale\u2019s skin and live there all their lives.\nWhales use a sing-song voice to call others and can sing a different tune, too.\nScientists use a wax plug in the whale\u2019s ear that has a pattern on it to determine its age.\nMost whales do not have teeth and use a comb-like fibre to filter tiny creatures from the water.\nWhale groups either consist of only male or only female whales and both almost never mix.\nThe migration of whales from the Northern and Southern hemisphere is timed such as to never meet each other in breeding areas.\nThough experienced, whales can lose their way during migration.\nA baby whale is known as a calf and is cared for by the entire group.\nThe \u201csmiling\u201d face of a whale is due to the lower arched lip it possesses.\nEven though the Blue Whale hunts in deep waters, it must come up to the surface of the water to breathe.\n9. Camel\nWhile providing desert animals information for kids, camels feature quite prominently in it.\nCamels have a life of 40 to 50 years.\nThere are two types of camels i.e. Dromedary (single-humped) and Bactrian (two-humped)\nCamels measure about seven feet up to their hump and six feet up to their shoulders.\nCamels are a good source of milk, wool, and meat and are used for transportation or carrying heavy loads, too.\nCamels have a thick coat on their body, provides protection from extreme heat and cold, making them suitable for deserts.\nCamels can survive up to six months without water or food due to the fatty tissues stored in their humps.\nThe fatty tissues in a camel\u2019s hump can be converted into energy or water, as and when required.\nCamels can drink 113 litres of water within 13 minutes and are the fastest mammals to re-hydrate.\nCamels have long legs, which help them stay above the hot desert surface.\nDromedary camels weigh between 300 to 600 kg, while Bactrian camels can weigh up to a maximum of 1000 kg.\nCamel milk has more Vitamin C and iron than cow\u2019s milk, and is widely available in Arab countries.\n10. Cheetah\nThe cheetah is the fastest animal to roam the earth, with top speeds of 113 km per hour.\nA cheetah can go up to speeds from 0 to 113 km /hour in a matter of seconds.\nThough fast, cheetahs tire very quickly and need to rest before they burst into top gear again.\nCheetahs weigh between 45-60 kilograms and are amongst the smallest members of the cat family.\nCheetahs have great eyesight and are able to sight their prey from five kilometres away during the daytime.\nCheetahs are the only members of the cat family unable to roar. However, they can purr quite loudly, especially when they are in a group or during one of their grooming sessions.\nAs opposed to other cat family members like lions and leopards who hunt at night, cheetahs are able to hunt only during the day.\nCheetahs have blunt claws and a light body weight, which makes them vulnerable to their enemies. They generally give up if larger animals confront them during a fight or a hunt, due to these physical restrictions.\nCheetahs have a poor night vision, which prevents hunting at night. They are also unable to climb trees due to their blunt claws, giving them a distinct disadvantage during hunting.\nA cheetah is recognisable by its dark lines, known as tear lines, that run from each eye towards the mouth. These tear lines protect the cheetah from the sun and give it long-distance vision that\u2019s necessary during hunting or protection from other predators.\nCheetahs don\u2019t stalk their prey. They simply creep up on them and chase them, which lasts for 20- 30 seconds.\nAs a parent, you may want to teach your child about the abundant flora and fauna on our planet. You may also want to help your child develop a keen interest in the world around \u2013 how things work, how people react, and so on. Stories are a wonderful way to do this. Another way for you to ensure your child\u2019s overall development is through subscription boxes designed for kids. Not only that, you can try DIY activities as well to help your toddler learn about and explore the world around, making him \u201cintelligent\u201d and aware, even before he goes to school!\nAlso Read: 25 Animal Stories for Children"}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe | Oregon Zoo", "url": "https://www.oregonzoo.org/discover/animals/giraffe", "text": "The Oregon Zoo is home to representatives of two subspecies, the reticulated giraffe and the Masai giraffe.\nReticulated giraffes live in open woodlands and wooded grasslands in Somalia, northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia. \"Reticulated\" refers to the net-shaped pattern of their skin, which camouflages them in dense, dry vegetation.\nMasai giraffes range in the savannahs across central and southern Kenya and throughout Tanzania. They have jagged markings that look like grape or maple leaves. Masai giraffes are the tallest of the giraffe subspecies.\nThe life of a giraffe\nThe giraffe is the tallest land-based mammal in the world. Males stand up to 18 feet tall and females up to 15 feet tall. A giraffe's necks account for more than half of its height. A giraffe has the same number of vertebrae (neck bones) as humans and other mammals do, but each is more than 10 inches long. The joint that connects the top vertebra to the skull allows the giraffe to tilt its head upward until it is almost perpendicular to the ground. This makes it easy for the giraffe to reach high into the trees for food.\nBeing tall has its challenges! To get blood up to their heads, giraffes have massive hearts that pump at 2 or 3 times the pressure of a healthy human. Sleeping is usually done standing up because lying down means having to stand up again\u2014an awkward, time-consuming process.\nOn the other hand, the slow-moving giraffe can gallop 35 miles an hour if needed, and its long front legs are surprisingly sturdy. One kick from a giraffe's hind leg has been known to kill a lion. Large eyes and strong eyesight combines with their great height to allow giraffes to see threats coming from long distances\u2014and to act as natural lookouts for smaller animals like zebras and wildebeest.\nGiraffes live in loose herds of 10 to 200 animals. Females with new calves tend to live together, and the calves play together in groups. Young males form roaming bachelor herds. To establish hierarchy and access to females, males spar with each other by standing side by side and thumping their heads into the other male's body. These fights range from gentle to fierce and can end with a giraffe being knocked unconscious.\nGiraffes browse on flowers, fruits, herbs, leaves, seeds, new shoots and vines. Using their very long, black tongues and tough lips, they eat up to 75 pounds of browse each day. They get moisture from their diet, but drink every two or three days if water is available.\nFemale giraffes usually become pregnant for the first time in about their fourth year. Pregnancy lasts 13 to 15 months. They give birth while standing up or walking, so newborn calves drop 5-6 feet to the ground. At birth, a calf is over 6 feet tall from the ground to its shoulders, and can begin to run with its mother about 10 hours later. Calves are weaned at about a year, but stay with their mothers for at least 22 months.\nGiraffes live an average of 10-15 years in the wild and 25 years in zoos.\nGiraffe conservation\nScientists estimate that over the past two decades, giraffe numbers have dropped across Africa by about 40%. This is due to habitat loss, disease transmitted by livestock, civil war and unrest, and poaching.\nGiraffes as a whole are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, but the zoo's two subspecies of giraffes \u2013 reticulated and Masai \u2013 are listed as endangered.\nGiraffes at the Oregon Zoo\nThe Oregon Zoo's giraffes live in the Africa Savanna habitat."}

They have a special valve in their neck that stops the blood rushing to their head when they bend down to drink.\nYou can tell Rothschilds apart from other types of giraffe because they have no markings on their lower legs. They\u2019re also the taller than other giraffe species. Their name comes from the founder of the Tring Museum, Lionel Walter, the 2nd Baron Rothschild.\nThey live in the open woodlands, savannahs and grasslands of Uganda and Kenya where they live in small herds, with males and females only mixing for mating. It takes up to sixteen months for a baby giraffe to gestate and mothers usually birth just one baby at a time.\nGiraffes necks are long, but they actually contain the same number of bones (vertebra) as humans (seven). Males use their strong neck as weapons to fight over females!\nTheir large hooves are covered in a thick keratin coating and they use them to kick chasing predators. A single kick can kill a lion!"}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe Species - Giraffe Conservation Foundation", "url": "https://giraffeconservation.org/giraffe-species/", "text": "Long-term research by GCF and partners has clearly identified four distinct species of giraffe in Africa \u2013 Masai, Southern, Northern and Reticulated giraffe, with several subspecies.\nAll four giraffe species and their subspecies live in geographically distinct areas throughout Africa and there are only a total of approx. 117,000 giraffe remaining in the wild.\nWhile some of these species have been reported to hybridise in zoos, there is very little evidence that this occurs readily in the wild.\nThe four species concept is based on a long-term effort, spearheaded by GCF in collaboration with Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (BiK-F) in Germany and other partners, to unravel the mystery of giraffe genetics and taxonomy. GCF and partners have collected over 1,000 DNA samples from all major giraffe populations across Africa. These new findings will be invaluable in informing future giraffe conservation throughout Africa."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe | Kids Answers", "url": "https://answersingenesis.org/kids/animals/giraffe/", "text": "by Kay Davis and Buddy Davis\non July 29, 2014\nThe giraffe is the tallest of all land animals. Its heart can be over two feet long and is engineered with a network of bypasses and anti-pooling valves that allow the giraffe to raise and lower its 500-pound (227 kg) neck and head without fainting. NASA scientists have studied the giraffe\u2019s uniquely created anatomy to help them develop gravity suits.\nA giraffe has only seven vertebrae in its neck, as do all mammals. The neck was designed so this animal could feed from the high branches of trees. Giraffes have a unique pattern of spots. No two are the same.\nAll giraffes have outgrowths of bone on their heads, called ossicones, that look like horns. Even baby giraffes have them. When the baby is born, the horns are gristle and lie flat, but as the giraffe matures, the horns turn to bone and are covered with hair.\nGiraffes are herbivores and feed on leaves and buds of trees, their favorite being the acacia. Females feed on the lower branches while the males reach the higher ones. They have a tongue that extends their reach by as much as 20 inches (51 cm). Like the cow, a giraffe has no incisors on its upper jaw, but has a pad that it uses to bite and tear. It does have jaw teeth that it uses to chew its cud like a cow.\nSocial animals that travel in herds ranging from 2 to 40, giraffes have excellent eyesight and hearing. They have few enemies; however, lions will attack babies and even some adults. Giraffes can be a poor choice for a lion\u2019s meal, since they have been known to kick the head off of a lion with their powerful hind kick.\nThe giraffe is silent most of the time but can make a wide variety of sounds, including mooing, bleating, bellowing, snoring, whistling, grunting, and coughing.\nThe giraffe\u2019s gestation period is 15 months and she gives birth in a special area designated for calving. Within an hour the calf is able to wobble about and may even run a short distance. The calf stands about six feet tall (2 m) and weighs 150 pounds (68 kg) at birth.\nMan is the only threat to the giraffe. It is hunted still for food although it is against the law. Giraffes have long been a favorite in zoos around the world and have been given as rare and valuable gifts from one king to another in Europe and Asia.\nGiraffe\nArtiodactyla \u2022 Giraffadae \u2022 Giraffa camelopardarlis\nHeight: 18 feet (5.5 m)\nWeight: 1,765 to 4,200 pounds (801\u20131,905 kg)\nLength: 5 feet (150 cm)\nLife Span: 25 years\nSpecial Design Feature: The giraffe has a large heart to allow it to raise and lower its head without fainting.\nDid You Know? The giraffe has the same number of vertebrae in its neck (seven) as humans do."}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "How Giraffes Stand on Their Spindly Legs | Live Science", "url": "https://www.livescience.com/46746-how-giraffe-legs-support-weight.html", "text": "Giraffes have unusually skinny legs for such large animals, but specialized bone structure allows them to support immense weight.\nA giraffe's skinny legs look like they could collapse at any second under the animal's immense weight.\nBut new research has revealed what makes their stems sturdy enough to support a 2,200-lb. (1,000 kilograms) body. Besides having elongated leg bones, giraffes are equipped with pieces of connective tissue, called suspensory ligaments, to help hold them up.\nRelying on a suspensory ligament \u2014 which is made of elastic tissue, not muscle \u2014 allows giraffes to conserve energy: They don't have to engage as much muscle to support their weight. The researchers also think the ligament prevents the foot joints from overextending and collapsing. [In Photos: See Cute Pics of Baby Giraffes]\nTo test giraffe legs' strength, the researchers used donated limbs from giraffes that died in captivity in European zoos or were euthanized for reasons unrelated to the research. The legs were set into a frame, and a hydraulic press dropped about 550 lbs. (250 kg) to simulate the body weight that each leg is responsible for holding. All the limbs remained sturdy and upright without the support of any living muscle, and could even support heavier weights without collapsing.\nThe ligament may provide some insight into how giraffes evolved from small, antelopelike creatures into the huge, long-legged species they are today.\n\"I'd like to link modern giraffes with fossil specimens, to illustrate the process of evolution,\" Christ Basu, lead investigator of the study from the Royal Veterinary College, said in a statement. \"We hypothesize that the suspensory ligament has allowed giraffes to reach large sizes that they otherwise would not have been able to achieve.\"\nGiraffes are the tallest animals in the world \u2013 males can grow up to 18 feet (5.5 meters) tall, and their legs alone stand about 6 feet (1.8 m) high. Their unusually long legs are also one reason giraffes can support so much weight.\nIn humans, the bones that make up the feet and hands, called metatarsals and metacarpals, are small. But in giraffes, these bones are elongated and actually account for half the length of their legs. The long bones have a groove that links to the suspensory ligament. The same ligament is also present in other large, long-legged animals like horses, but this is the first time it's been studied in giraffes.\nThe research was presented July 2 at the Society for Experimental Biology meeting in England.\nFollow Kelly Dickerson on Twitter.

Science Proves They Can", "url": "https://www.treehugger.com/think-giraffes-cant-swim-science-proves-they-can-4858080", "text": "It's long been thought that giraffes, with their tall necks and spindly legs, were incapable of swimming \u2013 unlike virtually every other mammal on the planet. But thanks to a team of researchers, who are strangely curious about such things, it's been proven once and for all that giraffes can indeed handle a dip. Figuring out giraffes possessed this surprising aquatic ability was actually a lot easier than you might think, requiring no special water wings or pool \u2013 in fact, not even a giraffe. Two university professors, Dr. Donald Henderson and Dr. Darren Naish, decided to test the long-held belief that the long-necked animals could not remain upright in the water or float due to its odd weight distribution. As the professors note in their study, \"we sought to test the hypothesis that giraffes exhibited a body shape or density unsuited for locomotion in water.\"\nBut rather than plop a real giraffe in a pool to observe what would happen, the researchers used computer-generated models.\nGiraffe Simulations\nGroblerduPreez / Getty Images\nAfter plugging in a few details of the animal into a computer, such as weight and mass, they let the digital giraffe take the plunge, and guess what \u2013 it floats! Still, it's unlikely they'll win any dog-paddling competitions, say the researchers.\nGiraffes, they discovered, would become buoyant in around 9 feet of water, but their shape would make the experience awkward for the animal. Because of their generous front limbs, the giraffe's body angles forward in the water which would make keeping their head above water a bit tricky.\nDr. Naish explains:\n\"Our models show that while it's feasible for a giraffe to swim, it is much harder than it is for a horse. It is fair to say that giraffes might be hesitant to enter the water knowing that they are at a decided disadvantage compared to being on solid ground.\"\nA Safe Research Approach\nTimon Schneider / Getty Images\nNaish and Henderson's study, while not likely to earn them a Nobel Prize, is noteworthy for its approach to using digitally modeled animals in place of the real things \u2013 a fact I'm sure the giraffes would appreciate. Just don't expect to see any giraffes out at the pool or on the beach this summer even though we know they can swim, however \u2013 they'll have a hard enough time finding a swimsuit that doesn't make their neck look big."}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Masai Giraffe | Franklin Park Zoo", "url": "https://www.zoonewengland.org/franklin-park-zoo/our-animals/mammals/hoofed/masai-giraffe", "text": "Appearance:\nGiraffe are extremely tall, with long legs and flexible necks for reaching treetop leaves. Like humans, giraffe have seven vertebrae in their necks. However, each giraffe vertebra can be over 10 inches long!\nTheir tails are long with a tassel at the end used to swat insects. On top of their head are two horn-like structures called ossicones.\nThe Masai giraffe tends to have a darker coat than other giraffe subspecies, but like them its coat is yellowish with jagged-edged, brown patches. These spots can act as camouflage, especially for calves. Dominant males' spots are often darker than those of the rest of the herd. They have long tassled tails, large even-toed hooved feet, two horn-like structures (ossicones), prominent eyes and ears, and blue-black tongues. Prehensile (grasping), tough tongues help them eat thorny leaves. Thick, gooey saliva coats any thorns swallowed.\nLike cows, giraffe are ruminant animals, meaning they have more than one stomach to help them digest their food. Giraffe stomachs have four compartments. They have large hearts (about the size of a basketball, weighing up to 25 pounds) to generate the high blood pressure necessary to maintain blood flow to the brain. Their upper neck has a special regulation system that prevents excess blood flow to the brain when giraffe lower their head to drink.\nSize:\nWeight: Males 3,000 pounds; females 1,500 pounds\nHeight: Males 18 feet; females 14 feet\nDiet:\nMasai giraffe dine mainly on leaves, bark, twigs, flowers, and fruits. Giraffe especially like leaves from the acacia tree. They use their long, flexible neck to reach the treetops and their long, slick, prehensile tongue to strip the leaves. Giraffe feed and drink primarily in the morning and evening. They are ruminants and wait until the hottest part of the day to chew their cud. Because their legs are longer than their necks, giraffe have to splay their front legs to lean forward in order to drink or graze. Because this puts them in a vulnerable position, trips to the water hole occur in groups. The giraffe take turns watching for predators.\nReproduction:\nGiraffe don't have a distinct breeding season. Female giraffe (called cows) mate with the locally dominant male. Females become sexually mature at about 4 years of age.\nGestation:\nAfter a gestation period of 14 to 15 months, the mother gives birth to a single calf while standing up, relying mostly on gravity to facilitate delivery. A newborn calf is about 6 feet tall, weighs 100 to 150 pounds, and is on its feet within an hour of birth. The calf is weaned at 13 months and typically stays with its mother for a year and a half. Sexual maturity is reached at about 4 years of age.\nBehavior:\nMasai giraffe tend to separate by sex. Female giraffe live in social groups of up to 20, which can include a few young males. Males live in bachelor herds, or as they get older, solitarily. Males often engage in \u201cnecking\u201d behavior when they swing their necks around and strike each other with the side of their head. Necking contests determine hierarchy and can also be used to show affection. Surprisingly, necking rarely results in physical harm.\nGiraffe are quiet, but they can make a variety of sounds including grunts, hisses, coughs (by courting males), bellows (by females calling their young) and whistles. They have very short sleep requirements, averaging only 1.9 hours per day. Giraffe rest on their feet.\nTo defend themselves or to escape, giraffe can kick with deadly force. They can run up to 30 miles per hour by \"pacing,\" which involves the front and back legs on the same side moving forward together and allows the legs on the adjacent side to move forward correspondingly.\nHabitat/Range:\nMasai giraffe live in savannahs, grasslands and open woodlands--preferably near abundant sources of acacia trees. They range throughout Tanzania and southern Kenya.\nMedian Life Expectancy:\nMales: 13.5\nFemales: 19.5\nConservation:\nGiraffe, an iconic species of Africa, have been going through a silent crisis. In just the past few years, their numbers in the wild have dropped dramatically with little notice. Giraffe numbers have decreased by approximately 40 percent, and there are less than 100,000 giraffe left throughout Africa. Threats include habitat loss, habitat degradation, habitat fragmentation, population growth and poaching. Despite these alarming figures, giraffe have received a surprisingly small amount of research, particularly when compared to other large animals including elephants and rhinos.\nA 2016 report published in Current Biology uncovered some unexpected findings on the status of giraffe. Up to this point, only one species of giraffe, comprised of several subspecies, had been known to exist. Taking into account skin biopsies on 190 giraffe throughout Africa, this study found that there are, in fact, four very distinct species. These four species include northern giraffe, southern giraffe, reticulated giraffe, and Masai giraffe. It's been reported that the differences among giraffe species are as great as those between polar bears and brown bears.\nWith these new findings, the hope is that giraffe conservation will gain new attention on the global map. AZA- accredited zoos and their partners are working collectively to help save giraffe through education, scientific research, field work, public awareness and action.\nFun facts:"}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "The Giraffe - DesertUSA", "url": "https://www.desertusa.com/animals/giraffe.html", "text": "Giraffe\n(Giraffa camelopardalis)\nRange\nAncient Romans and Greeks thought the giraffe was a mix between a camel and a leopard - thus the scientific name camelopardalis.\nA pair of French biologists wrote in the late 18th century that the giraffe was \u201cmagnificent in appearance, bizarre in form, unique in gait, colossal in height and inoffensive in character.\u201d\nGeneral Description\nThe giraffe is a member of the giraffidae family. The only other animal in this family is the okapi. With large, irregular brownish to black spots and yellow fur and a very long neck, the giraffe is indeed bizarre in form. The giraffe is the tallest living animal. A long neck consisting of seven vertebrae enable the giraffe to reach trees and shrubs that are out of reach of other animals. Their long 18\" tongue and their ability to extend their head vertically gives them an even longer reach above their towering height. This gives the giraffe an advantage when it comes to survival.\nHorns\nLong neck with seven vertabrae\nFour legs with the front legs being taller than the back legs\nMane\nNarrow muzzle\nLong 18\" tongue\nTail approx. 8 feet long\nAdult male average weight 2,630 lbs, females average 1830 lbs\n14' to 17' tall\nLargest eyes of land mammals\nMales are called bulls and females are called cows.\nRange\nAfrica, south of the Sahara.\nHabitat and Diet\nThe habitat of the giraffe is dry savannah, grasslands or open woodlands. They will move into wooded areas with denser vegetation in search of food. Acacia is the main component in the giraffes\u2019 diet. They occasionally eat grasses, and fruit on trees, but Acacia and Combretum trees are their favorite. Giraffes need about 75lbs of leaves per day to maintain their body weight. This requires that they spend at least 12 hours a day grazing or browsing for food. The trees the giraffe eat are often far apart and their herds tend to wander in a loose formation when foraging.\nThe giraffe lives in very dry areas and will drink large quantities of water when they can to survive. They tend to drink water every couple of days and consume an average of 10 gallons on days that they drink. They also obtain water through their diet of Acacia leaves and foilage, enabling them to survive longer in dry areas where water is sometimes scarce.\nPredators\nThe only viable predator an adult giraffe has is the lion. Giraffes have very powerful legs and they use their legs to defend themselves. A strategic kick by a giraffe to the skull of a lion can kill it. Young giraffes have more predators due to their smaller size. Lions, hyenas and leopards often prey on giraffe calves. Approximately one fourth of all giraffe calves survive their first year of life.\nBehavior & Reproduction\nThe giraffe is not a territorial creature. They live in herds that are open with no obvious leader. The social behavior of giraffes is very informal and the individuals in the herds are often changing. Their need to spend a large portion of their day foraging for food makes them more independent than most herd animals.\nFemales tend to associate with other females when they have calf groups. The calves will move and play with each other, forming durable peer groups. The advantage of the mother-calf groups is substantial protection from predators for the young. Males will stay with their maternal herd until around the age of 3, when they may move to another herd consisting of bachelors. Sexual maturity occurs around the age of 3 or 4, though males seldom successfully breed until the age 8 or older.\nMales start competing to mate at the age of 7. Older bulls rarely fight about mating rights as their rank is established in the herd. Males may build dominance over other males by \u201cnecking\u201d, a process of rubbing and entwining their necks and throwing their heavy heads at one another. This behavior is described as having a rhythmical grace due to the great length of the giraffes' necks. Though blows can be heard from quite a distance, rarely is a giraffe injured this way. The males have regular contests to prove their strength and rank. When males are part of the bachelor herd they often fight using their horns, neck and heads. The stronger bull wins and achieves higher rank in the herd.\nReproduction\nA cow can conceive when she is 4 years old. Gestation ranges from 14 to 14.5 months. There is usually a break of about 1 to 1.5 years between calves. A cow returns to the same area each time she gives birth to a calf. The newborn calf lies out for a good part of the day and most of the night during the first 5 to 7 days. The cow guards her calf, protecting it from predators. The cow stays close to her calf, but will leave it in a cr\u00e9che, a group of young calves guarded by one or more cows, when she needs to find water or forage for food.\nCalves are approximately 6' tall when born and they can grow as much as 1' per day. When the calves reach 2 months of age they are eating leaves, and they near independence by 6 months of age. The typical lifespan of a giraffe is approximately 20 to 25 years.\nCommunication\nGiraffes are normally silent and don\u2019t make much vocal noise. The calves make a bleat sound and mewing call, the cows will call their young with a bellowing sound and the bulls may cough to send out a message to other giraffes. Some have made whistling sounds, but for the most part these giants are silent.\nThe Gait\nA giraffe has two gaits: walking and galloping. When walking the right legs move together and the left legs together. When galloping, the giraffe uses its front legs together and its back legs together. The walk has an ambling rhythm with the neck working in synchronicity to keep the body in balance.\nInteresting Facts\nTallest male giraffe measured stood 20' tall.\nWhen being pursued the giraffe can reach speeds up to 35 mph.\nThe giraffe has only 7 vertebrae, the same as man, yet their necks are significantly longer.\nTo drink, the giraffe has to bend its front legs or straddle them\nA giraffe\u2019s heart is 24 lbs and approx. 2' in length\nAverage live span is 20 - 25 years\nThe average sleep time for a giraffe is 5 to 30 minutes per day\nA giraffe\u2019s age can be told from the darkness of its spots\nClick here for more about animals."}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe populations are rising, giving new hope to scientists", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/giraffe-populations-rising-giving-hope", "text": "Giraffe numbers have increased across Africa, new research shows, a rare spot of good news in the conservation world.\nAccording to a recent analysis of survey data from across the African continent, the total giraffe population is now around 117,000, approximately 20 percent higher than it was thought to be in 2015, when the last major survey was published.\nThis rise is a result of genuine growth in some areas, but also stems from more accurate census data, says Julian Fennessy, executive director of the Giraffe Conservation Foundation, based in Namibia. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see these numbers increasing,\u201d says Fennessy, a co-author of the new research.\nGiraffes were once considered a single species. But recent genetic evidence shows there are likely four species of giraffe, three of which have increased considerably in number: northern, reticulated, and Masai giraffes. The fourth, southern giraffes, have remained relatively stable.\nData were collected during the last few years across 21 countries, by governments, researchers, nonprofits, and even citizen scientists. Fennessy and six co-authors then analyzed this vast trove of information and published the results in December 2021 in the peer-reviewed research volume Imperiled: The Encyclopedia of Conservation.\nEven so, populations remain relatively small, considering that there were a million of these animals a couple hundred years ago, and their numbers have decreased for decades in what some scientists call a \u201csilent extinction.\u201d (Read more about efforts to save giraffes.)\nThe animals are threatened by habitat degradation and fragmentation, climate change, and poaching\u2014so their plight remains urgent, Fennessy says.\n\u201cBut there is positive news, too, and too often conservation focuses on the negative,\u201d he says.\nPutting the puzzle together\nFinding and making sense of all the data was a monumental effort, involving considerable collaboration, outreach, and cooperation. \u201cWe can now be more confident in how we assemble this complicated and dynamic puzzle,\u201d says co-author Michael Brown, an ecologist with the Giraffe Conservation Foundation and Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Virginia.\nField research has also become more accurate. Historically, researchers have often surveyed populations of wild giraffes from airplanes. But this can undercount the total in certain areas where the long-legged herbivores can remain hidden under trees and vegetation. One new, more robust approach involves intensive photographic surveys, wherein computer programs scan images and recognize individuals based on their unique spot patterns.\n\u201cWhile advanced survey methods may be the reason for some of the increase in population estimates, there has been very positive indicators that conservation programs on the ground are also having a profound impact,\u201d says Jenna Stacy-Dawes, a biologist not involved in the current paper, who studies giraffes at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. (Learn more: A bold plan to save Africa\u2019s shrinking giraffe herds.)\nNorthern giraffes, the most threatened species, live in isolated populations across Central and West Africa, as well as Uganda and parts of Kenya. The new paper estimates there are more than 5,900 of this species, a significant increase from 2015, when there were 4,780.\nSeveral efforts to move, or translocate, these animals into new areas without existing giraffe populations\u2014for example, into reserves within Niger, Chad, and Uganda\u2014have boosted the species\u2019 numbers, Fennessy says. For example, 15 giraffe were moved to Uganda\u2019s Lake Mburo National Park in 2015. The population has already grown to a total of 37, Fennessy says.\n3:33\nThe second least-populous species is the reticulated giraffe, whose stronghold is in northern Kenya. The authors estimate there are just shy of 16,000 of these animals, nearly double the estimated count in 2015. But this increase is likely largely accounted for by better data, and not due to massive growth, Brown says.\nMasai giraffes, found mostly in Tanzania and southern Kenya, have an estimated population of 45,000, a 44 percent increase from seven years ago. The most populous species, the southern giraffe, roams throughout Namibia, Botswana, South Africa, and beyond. There are now thought to be 48,000, roughly the same as in 2015.\nThere are still some areas without good population data, such as South Sudan, though due to the civil unrest in the region, many fear that poaching has gone up. Population estimates in Ethiopia and Somalia are also unclear. There are also places where numbers are declining, such as for northern giraffes in the Central African Republic or southern giraffes in Zimbabwe.\nRenewed hope\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature, which determines species\u2019 conservation statuses, has not finished evaluating new genetic data on giraffes, and still considers them to be one species, classified as vulnerable to extinction, with nine subspecies.\nThe IUCN does regard two subspecies of northern giraffes to be critically endangered, and two others\u2014Masai and reticulated giraffes\u2014to be endangered. (Read: Masai giraffes declared endangered.)\nIllegal hunting for the animals\u2019 meat, hide, bones, and tails remains a big problem in certain areas. But Jared Stabach, a researcher with Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, says his main concern is unsustainable development, including drilling for petroleum and road construction. \u201cThat\u2019s what keeps me up at night,\u201d he says.\nOne example is the expansion of oil and gas exploration around Uganda\u2019s Murchison Falls National Park, which threatens to fragment and damage habitat for the area\u2019s large population of critically endangered northern giraffes.\nEven so, in places where governments, citizens, researchers, and conservationists have come together to protect the world\u2019s tallest animal, there\u2019s hope populations can thrive.\n\u201cWhen conditions are good for giraffes, they can rebound in incredible ways,\u201d Brown says. \u201cAll they need is a chance.\u201d"}

Even buffalo cows kept in captivity refuse to be milked.\nSeeing how widespread common domestic cattle and horses are, if they coulda been, they woulda been, and sometimes you will see an individual who has given in to a saddle or cart, but as a species they are wild to the bone.\nRock on wild animals!\nWhat's the difference between wild animals and domestic animals?\nWild animals have survived in their native habitat for the entire existence of their species. They have never been selectively bred for the purposes of human beings.\nThat being said, nearly every species of animal, reptile, even fish and insects, have been held in captivity at one time or another.\nThe question is, how well do they take to that captivity, and have they been altered by it.\nThe tiger and the lion may be the first animals that comes to mind when we talk about a wild animal, but there are generations of lions and tigers that have been bred in captivity not just in zoos, where their wild behavior may be somewhat retained, but in circuses and in the pet industry.\nIn these situations, it isn't the most powerful and fearsome male that reproduces, it is the most amiable and tractable individuals, and occasionally, those with unique coat color.\nGenerations of big cats bred with tameness in mind has not made them pussycats, but in most cases it has created individuals with calmer demeanors, and even significantly smaller fangs!\nWhat is a domestic animal?\nTrue domestic animals have lived thousands of generations in captivity, and differ significantly from their wild ancestors both physically and psychologically.\nBut tameness and domestication are not the same thing.\nTameness is a degree of calm, a manageable demeanor, and a lack of aggression and fear.\nBut there are many creatures, such as silkworms, honey bees that are completely domesticated and certainly wouldn't be considered \"tame\" in the sense that we think.\nAnd the wildest of the wild, the animals we think of when we say \"wild animal\", lions and tigers, have been kept and bred in zoos, circuses and by the pet trade for centuries.\nNaturally, the most powerful and dominant of these animals is not being reproduced, and they have acquired a more docile demeanor.\nThe fangs of these big cats are even significantly smaller than their wild cousins, but are they domestic animals?\nThere are definitely alot of grey areas here, but the species that has been most clearly altered by it's relationship with human beings is, of course, the domestic dog.\nDomestic dogs are so completely engulfed in our world that they instinctively choose the company of human beings over their own species right from birth.\nThey are drawn to and transfixed by human beings, and some breeds have an incredible desire to please.\nMost domestic dogs are even born understanding the uniquely human gesture of pointing.\nSomething that the smartest animals on the planet, apes and whales, must be patiently taught to comprehend.\nDomestic horses are able to completely suppress their instincts and desires as prey animals, in order to carry us into war, on patrol, or on parade.\nAnd the domestic cat is born with a specific vocabulary word hardwired in it's brain that it only utters to human beings - yes, it seems cats only \"meow\" to people.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Why?\nWell, first because they are more closely related to smaller cat species, like bobcats and even domestic cats, than they are to the big cats, and second, because they cannot roar.\nYes, the mountain lion can growl, snarl, and even purr, but does not roar.\nThere are six sub-species of cougars ranging all throughout South and Central America, as well as Mexico, Western North America, and Florida.\nThis is a solitary, stealthy cat that is most active at dusk and dawn, and sneaks through the shadows largely undetected.\nThey live in many completely different habitats, from snow covered mountains, to tropical forests to swamps.\nBecause the places they live are so different, so too, are what cougars eat.\nIn the Rocky mountains of the Western United States, where they are called \"mountain lions\", their diet is mule deer, elk, moose and rocky mountain goats.\nIn the jungles of South America where they are called \"pumas\", they dine on wild boar and monkeys.\nIn the swamps of Florida where they are called \"panthers\", they eat baby alligators, snakes and pigs.\nIn the deserts of Mexico where they are called wildcats, they hunt jackal and hares.\nThe cougars skeleton is lightweight, and the body is extremely well muscled.\nThe paws are very large, and the hind legs are longer than the fronts, allowing the cougar to coil up and pounce on prey with devastating accuracy.\nThey are ambush hunters, hiding behind rocks or atop a tree limb, waiting for their victim to get close enough, then going in for the finish with a kill bite to the back of the neck.\nThe cougar is capable of a 15 foot vertical leap, and has been reported to clear horizontal distances of 30 feet.\nThe cougar is a serious carnivore and an excellent hunter consuming meat exclusively and hunting and killing almost everything it eats.\nIf the prey is large, such as a moose or elk, they will drag it to a secluded area and return to feed over several days.\nCougars rarely, if ever, scavenge, except in populated areas and campgrounds.\nCougars can be a menace for cattle ranchers and can easily take down a full grown cow.\nBecause of this, they have been tracked down and hunted out of existence across many square miles of range land.\nBut they are not endangered, except for the very rare Florida panther sub-species, and many cougars live in remarkably close proximity to human beings without us even knowing they are there.\nSpotting a mountain lion in the wild is extremely rare, but hikers often find clues of their presence like scat, recent kills, and scratches left on trees.\nCougar attacks on humans do occur, but are very rare, in fact, less than 30 people have ever been reported as being killed by mountain lions\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

And what are these unique tools that help these desert animals survive?\nWell the adaptions of desert animals isn't as simple as handling the extreme heat, because although extreme temperatures occur, the definition of a desert is an environment with a lack of precipitation, a lack of water, not high temperatures. In fact, it can get very cold in the desert - and it can even snow!\nHere are just some of the incredible animals that live in the desert, and call places like the Mojave, the Sahara and the Gobi their home...\ncheck out our youtube channel!\nwhat is a desert?\nThe word \"desert\" may make you think of sand dunes and excruciating heat, but only about 1/4 of the world's deserts are covered in sand, and parts of Antarctica engulfed in freezing ice and snow actually qualify as desert. The factor that truly determines a desert is how dry it is, not how hot it is.\nThere are two common explanations for what a desert is. The most common is an area that receives less than 10 inches of rain annually.\nThe other, and perhaps more technical and scientifically accepted explanation of what a desert is, involves evaporation. According to the Koppen system of climate classification, a desert is any area where more water is lost through evaporation than is gained through precipitation.\nUltimately, the amount of rain or snow varies greatly in deserts.\nSome, like the Chihuahuan desert, which makes up a large part of the South West United States and Northern Mexico, has a summer monsoon season of heavy rains, but the rest of the year is nearly completely dry.\nSome areas like Cairo, Eqypt have very meager rainfall scattered throughout the year, with slight, seasonal peaks and valleys.\nAnd some areas, like Dry Valleys, Antarctica, have not had any precipitation in about 2 million years.\nGenerally, low rainfall means limited growth potential for plant-life. Because there are less roots in the soil, the landscape becomes less permanent, and hills and dunes may be formed, moved and made to disappear by strong winds.\nAnother idea about deserts is that they are barren, and unable to support life, but actually many people and animals live and thrive in many desert environments, having adapted in various fascinating ways to their special home.\nAnd consider that human civilization was born in the deserts of the Middle East.\nDoes it snow in the desert?\nBactrian camels in the snow\nRemember, temperature is not the factor that decides whether a region is desert or not, and some of the coldest places on Earth are desert. So yes, it certainly does snow in the desert.\nIn fact, it snowed 3 years in a row in Saudi Arabia from 2013 to 2015. Some arctic deserts are so cold that snowfall hasn't melted in thousands of years, and one of the most famous of all desert animals the Bactrian camel, (the one with 2 humps!) is native to the mountains of the Gobi desert, where snow is fairly common.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Why Do Poachers Kill Giraffes? - Anti-Poaching Charity", "url": "https://www.iapf.org/news/giraffes", "text": "Why Do Poachers Kill Giraffes?\nPoaching is destroying African wildlife and habitats. Poaching is the illegal trapping, shooting or taking of animals where such actions are forbidden. In Africa, animals are often poached for illegal wildlife trade. Their body parts \u2014 including teeth, hooves, claws and tails \u2014 are sent to various countries to be used in jewelry, medicines and more.\nGiraffes are currently being poached for their tails, and this has pushed some species closer than ever to extinction. The International Anti-Poaching Foundation (IAPF) is doing everything we can to stop giraffe poaching in Africa.\nWhy Do People Poach Giraffes, and What Are Giraffes Poached For?\nUnfortunately, giraffes are poached for a number of reasons. Giraffe tails are coveted in many parts of Africa, and their hairs are also used in fly whisks, bracelets and sewing. Giraffes are killed for their meat and hides as well as their brains and bone marrow, which herbal medicine practitioners claim can protect people from HIV/AIDS. These claims have increased the price for giraffe parts, incentivizing poachers to kill more of these beautiful animals.\nThe giraffe poaching facts and statistics are shocking. In fact, the overall giraffe population has plummeted 40% in the past 30 years. An estimated 68,000 giraffes now remain in the wild. These remaining herds are constantly under threat, and some are more vulnerable than others. The population of Nubian giraffes has declined 98% in the past roughly 40 years. Some subspecies of giraffes are currently considered critically endangered, while others remain \u201cvulnerable.\u201d\nThe Impact of Giraffe Poaching\nPoachers target giraffes and other precious African wildlife because their body parts amount to profit. This makes poaching difficult to stop, as some local communities rely on selling these items to feed their families. However, giraffes will quickly become extinct if we don\u2019t fight against poaching in Africa.\nGiraffes were once found across Africa in a variety of ecosystems and regions. Giraffes are essential to keeping African ecosystems balanced. Their 6-foot-tall necks help them reach foliage that other animals cannot. This allows for superior growth of foliage that other animals to eat. Additionally, giraffes are known for foraging on Acai trees, and some seedlings will not germinate unless they have been digested by a giraffe. Without giraffes, African habitats could lose a variety of other flora and fauna, too.\nHelp Fight Giraffe Poaching\nYou can take steps today to help stop giraffe poaching now and in the future. One of the easiest ways to stop giraffe poaching is to refrain from using any products made with giraffe parts. Additionally, poaching must be stopped at the source. You can support conservation efforts by donating to IAPF and other reputable African wildlife conservation organizations. We must also push governments and politicians to join the fight against giraffe poaching around the world.\nYou can help stop giraffe poaching right now by discussing the topic, \u201cWhy are giraffes poached,\u201d with friends and family. The more individuals understand the dangers giraffe populations are facing, the faster actions against poaching will be taken.\nWhat IAPF Is Doing?\nThe IAPF is taking a community-led approach to eliminating wildlife poaching in Africa. For example, our Akashinga and LEAD Ranger programs are empowering locals to defend giraffe habitats and arrest poachers without violence. You can learn more about the Akashinga anti-poaching program by watching the \u201cAkashinga -- The Brave Ones\u201d film.\nReady to take a stand against giraffe poaching?

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Rothschild's giraffe - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild%27s_giraffe", "text": "Rothschild's giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi) is a subspecies of the Northern giraffe. It is one of the most endangered distinct populations of giraffe, with 1,669 individuals estimated in the wild in 2016.\nTaxonomy and evolutionary history [ edit ]\nThe IUCN currently recognizes only one species of giraffe with nine subspecies. Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi is named after the Tring Museum's founder, Walter Rothschild, and is also known as the Baringo giraffe, after the Lake Baringo area of Kenya, or as the Ugandan giraffe. All of those living in the wild are in protected areas in Kenya and Uganda. In 2007, Rothschild's giraffe was proposed as a separate species from other giraffe. In 2016, Rothschild's giraffe was proposed as conspecific with the Nubian giraffe (elevated to full species), but that taxonomy has not been widely adopted.\nCharacteristics [ edit ]\nThe Rothschild's giraffe is easily distinguishable from other subspecies. The most obvious sign is in the coloring of the coat or pelt. Whereas the reticulated giraffe has very clearly defined dark patches with bright-whitish channels between them, Rothschild's giraffe more closely resembles the Masai giraffe. However, when compared to the Masai giraffe, the Rothschild's ecotype is paler, the orange-brown patches are less jagged and sharp in shape, and the connective channel is of a creamier hue compared to that seen on the reticulated giraffe. In addition, Rothschild's giraffe displays no markings on the lower leg, giving it the impression of wearing white stockings.\nAnother distinguishing feature of Rothschild's giraffe, although harder to spot, is the number of ossicones on the head. This is the only Giraffa phenotype to be born with five ossicones. Two of these are the larger and more obvious ones at the top of the head, which are common to all giraffes. The third ossicone can often be seen in the center of the giraffe's forehead, and the other two are behind each ear. They are also taller than many other populations, measuring up to 5.88 metres (19.3 feet) tall. They can weigh up to 2,500 pounds.\nMales are larger than females by a few hundred pounds and their two largest ossicones are usually bald from sparring. They usually tend to be darker in colour than the females, although this is not a guaranteed sexing indicator.\nHabitat and distribution [ edit ]\nIsolated populations of Rothschild's giraffes live in savannahs, grasslands, and open woodlands of Uganda and Kenya. They are possibly regionally extinct from South Sudan and northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nEcology and behavior [ edit ]\nRothschild's giraffes mate at any time of the year and have a gestation period of 14 to 16 months, typically giving birth to a single calf. They live in small herds, with males and females (and their calves) living separately, only mixing for mating. The Rothschild's giraffes are tolerant of other animals around them as long as they don't feel threatened. For the most part, they are very friendly, but the males are known to engage in fights for mating. Since this species can mate all year long, those battles seem to be frequent.\nThreats and conservation [ edit ]\nAs of 2018, Rothschild's giraffe is classified as near threatened. Very few locations are left where Rothschild's giraffe can be seen in the wild, with notable spots being Lake Nakuru National Park in Kenya and Murchison Falls National Park in northern Uganda. Their predators are hyenas, lions, crocodiles, and leopards.\nTwo dwarf giraffes standing only 9.5 feet (2.9 m) tall have been spotted in Murchison Falls National Park. Scientists speculate their dwarfism may have been caused by inbreeding due to species decline.\nThree Rothschild's giraffes were electrocuted by low-hanging power lines in Soysambu conservancy in Nakuru, Kenya.\nIn captivity [ edit ]\nVarious captive breeding programmes are in place \u2013 notably at the Giraffe Centre in Nairobi, Kenya \u2013 which aim to expand the gene pool in the wild population of Rothschild's giraffe. As of January 2011 , more than 450 are kept in ISIS (international species information system) registered zoos (which does not include the Nairobi Giraffe Centre), making both it and the reticulated giraffe the most commonly kept phenotypes of Giraffa."}

Masai giraffe are found in the southern half of Kenya and Tanzania.\nHabitat: They prefer dry, open savannas and open woodlands, avoiding the closed canopy forest.\nDiet: Giraffes browse high in the trees - higher than any other animal. They prefer the leaves and twigs of the acacia trees, mimosa, and wild apricots, but will eat other vegetation. They feed and drink mainly in the evening. They are often seen to be chewing their cuds, since they are ruminants with four chambered stomachs. Giraffes get most of the water they need from their food, and need to drink only once every couple of days.\nGiraffes are found throughout sub-Saharan Africa.

They are often seen to be chewing their cuds, since they are ruminants with four chambered stomachs. Giraffes get most of the water they need from their food, and need to drink only once every couple of days.\nReproduction: Bull giraffes compete to mate with the cows. They do this by \"necking\" or wrestling using their heads and necks to test each other's strengths. This mainly occurs amongst the young bulls, or when there is a new bull in the area. Generally only the high-standing males are permitted to mate. In some parts of Africa, such as Zambia, breeding may occur throughout the year. However, the young tend to be born in the dry months between May and August. During mating season, the male giraffe nudges the females behind to induce urination. He then tastes the urine to see if the female is in heat.\nGiraffes are sexually mature at three to five years old. Females come into heat every 12 - 15 days and give birth approximately every two years. The average gestation period is 457 days. The number of offspring is almost always one, though twins are known to occur. Birth takes place with the female standing so the calf has almost two metres to fall to the ground. At birth the young weigh 47 - 70 kg and are already 1.7 - 2.0 m in height. They are born with their horns, which gradually turn to their upright positions. The young are able to stand on their wobbly legs about 20 minutes after birth and begin to suckle within the hour. The calf may nurse for up to 13 months, but at two to three weeks the calf begins to supplement its milk diet with leaves. The calf grows rapidly in the first year (about one metre) and growth continues until full size is attained at about five years for females and seven years for males. The young stay with their mother for about a year and a half. Females are capable of reproducing until at least 20 years of age. Life spans in the wild reach up to 25 years; in captivity they can live to be over 30 years of age.\nBull giraffes compete to mate with the cows.

Life spans in the wild reach up to 25 years; in captivity they can live to be over 30 years of age.\nAdaptation:\nThreats to Survival:\nThe giraffe is the tallest animal in the world. These majestic animals have elongated necks, shoulders and skulls, steeply sloping backs and long stick-like legs with large heavy feet and a long thin tail with a tuft of long thick hairs, useful to flick off the flies. Their bodies are covered with a thick hide, sporting a pattern of splotches ranging in colour from a yellowish/tan to dark brown or almost black. The Masai giraffe has a very irregular pattern of fuzzy-edged splotches. The pattern never changes, but may vary in colour depending on age or season, darkening as the animal gets older. Their ears are large, as are their dark brown eyes which are shaded by long, elegant eyelashes. They can close their nostrils at will. Their lobed canine teeth are used as combs to strip off the leaves from trees. Their thin lips are very mobile, and the incredible flexible tongue can measure up to 45 cm in length. It is blue/black in colour.Two short, skin covered horns are permanent and present in both sexes, although they are better developed in males. These ossicones are formed as cartilage and turn to bone from the tips downward. Males have horns that are thick and bald on top, while females have thinner, tufted horns. The giraffe also bears a smaller horn on the forepart of the frontal bones, situated more or less between the eyes. The neck is 1.5 m or more in length with seven vertebrae, typical of most mammals. The vertebrae are elongated and are attached to one another by a ball and socket joint, which makes the neck flexible. The heart is massive, weighing 11.5 kg and pumping approximately 60 liters of blood per minute.They range in height from 3.8 to 5.5 m. They can weigh up to two tonnes. Generally males are taller than females.The senses of smell, hearing and vision are acute. However, among the African big game species, the giraffe is believed to have the keenest eyesight, and its height gives it the greatest range of vision. Their very long necks are an adaptation to feeding at high levels in the treetops. Their prehensile tongues allow them to draw their food into their mouths, and their specialized teeth can remove the leaves and buds. This allows them to get past the long thorns on the acacia trees and get to the succulent leaves that they want to eat. Their saliva contains an antiseptic to help heal any wounds that the thorns might cause to their tongues.Their hearts are adapted to be able to pump blood under great pressure to the brain when the animal is upright, but when the animal is bent to drink, special valves and neck veins (rete mirabile) regulate blood flow to prevent brain damage or black outs. In order to drink or pick up food from the ground, the giraffe spreads its forelegs far apart and well to the front or bends at the knee until its head can reach the ground. In less than two seconds they can regain their upright position. While standing quietly, the neck is usually 50 - 60 degrees to the ground, but when they are angry or annoyed, the head and neck are lowered to almost a horizontal position.Giraffes are good jumpers, but cannot swim. They can run for long distances without tiring and can travel up to 56 km/h. While a giraffe is running, the hind feet are swung forward of the forefeet, the head and neck swing widely, almost in a figure eight, and the tail is raised over the back. However, when walking, the giraffe carries both feet on a side forward simultaneously. They move directly from a walk to a gallop. When one giraffe is seen running, this provides a signal to other animals that there may be danger and all take flight.They rest in a standing position, although when secure or young, they do sit for short periods. They sleep for only a few minutes at a time. Their legs are strong enough to kill a lion with a well-placed kick. Giraffes are non territorial and home ranges of different groups tend to overlap so that there may be up to twenty-five individuals in one area. The groupings change continually, but hierarchy within a group of males is established by necking, or neck wrestling. The male has an extra reinforcing bone over his skull to protect him when \"necking\" with other males. Each of the nine subspecies of giraffe has a different pattern of splotches, but the individual giraffe within the group will have its own pattern for life - like a fingerprint. It may be a way for them to recognise individuals. Giraffes do vocalize, communicating with moaning or snorting noises, especially as a warning of danger. Females may bellow to locate their calf.The primary threat to giraffes is habitat loss as a result of the expanding human population. Within the National Parks, poaching is a serious threat. Jewelry and fly swatters are made from the tail hairs. Whips, sandals, shields, and drums are made from the hide and strings for musical instruments. Bowstrings and thread are made from the tendons of the leg muscles. Natural predators include lions, leopards, hyenas, and sometimes crocodiles, which prey on giraffe when they are most vulnerable - when they are drinking."}

You might think its neck has a lot of bones, but in reality it has just seven - the same as most other mammals. The giraffe's neck bones just happen to be much longer!\nWorld Record Holder\nThe giraffe is the tallest living land animal. Males can reach a height of 16 to 18 feet while females are somewhat smaller at 14 to 16 feet.\nGiraffes are known for their spotted coats. Different subspecies (types) of giraffes have different patterns of spots. Reticulated giraffes (the kind we have at the Saint Louis Zoo) have large brown spots separated by cream-colored lines. Males are darker than females.\nTreetop Treats\nThese animals have no competition when it comes to finding food. Their long neck helps them browse in a place that other animals can't reach: the treetops. Trees - including acacia, mimosa, and wild apricot - provide giraffes' favorite foods: leaves, fruits, and seedpods. Giraffes spend many hours each day feasting on treetop treats.\nSince leaves provide a lot of moisture, giraffes don't need to drink very often. They can go without water for many weeks, even months, at a time. Lucky thing - ever see a giraffe drink from a pond? They have to spread their legs very, very wide to stoop low enough to drink!\nSharp Senses\nGiraffes have extremely keen eyesight and can see great distances: they can spot a moving person a mile away! They also have excellent hearing. These sharp senses help giraffes stay alert for predators - like lions!\nGentle Giants (and Their Babies)\nMales will spar, gently, for the attention of a potential mate. These sparring matches are called \"neck-knocking\" because - you guessed it! - they knock necks. The males rarely bite or kick during these bouts, and injuries are rare.\nAfter a male and female pair up and mate, they have a while to wait for the birth of their baby: about 15 months! There is almost always only one baby born at a time, but twins occur on rare occasion.\nMother giraffes are very affectionate and protective toward their babies, touching and licking them frequently. When the calves are a month old, they join a \"nursery\" group made up of several mothers and their calves. The young are always being watched over by one of the adult females. The mothers may browse at a distance, but they return often to nurse their babies. The young giraffes stay in these groups until they are a year old.\nNeck and Neck (and Neck and Neck and\u2026)\nWhile female giraffes live together in family groups, males live in bachelor groups. Each bachelor group has a number of young males led by an older, larger bull.\nEven though they live in herds, giraffes usually don't stay in the same herd forever. Individuals may come and go, so the makeup of a group is always changing.\nSaving Their Necks\nReticulated giraffes were recently listed as an endangered species.. They suffer from two main problems: habitat loss and hunting. As the human population grows and settlements expand, giraffes are crowded out of their habitat. At the same time, the animals are being poached for meat and for their body parts: hair for making bracelets and thread, skin for shield covers, and sinew for bowstrings.\nWhat can you do to help giraffes and other wild animals? Don't buy products made from their body parts, and encourage others not to buy them either.\nFun Facts\nGiraffes are fast runners, reaching speeds of 35 miles per hour. That's about as fast as a good horse!\nEvery giraffe has a unique pattern of spots, much like a human fingerprint.\nClass: Mammalia\nOrder: Artiodactyla\nFamily: Giraffidae"}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Why Are Giraffes Endangered and How Can We Help? - Greentumble", "url": "https://greentumble.com/why-are-giraffes-endangered/", "text": "Giraffes are curiously ungainly animals. They are very well-known in the Western world, thanks their presence at zoos and the popularity of toys like Sophie the giraffe or Geoffrey the Giraffe, the mascot of the now-defunct chain, Toys \u2018R Us, or April, the perpetually pregnant giraffe whose live birthing garnered millions of online viewers.\nThey are instantly recognizable. It is therefore surprising that people know so little about them, or that their survival in the wild is so threatened.\nGiraffes may look all the same, but in the wild, there are actually four species of giraffes:\nthe Northern giraffe\nthe West African giraffe\nRothschild\u2019s giraffe\nthe reticulated giraffe\nThough it has been reported that giraffes have cross-bred in zoos, all of these species and their subspecies live in very geographically distinct areas across the continent of Africa, and very infrequently overlap in the wild.\nOne thing that is clear is that giraffes are the world\u2019s tallest mammals. Even their legs are six feet tall; taller than most humans.\nTheir physiology \u2014 their height and long necks \u2014 is so interesting that it has inspired centuries of scientists, trying to figure out what environmental events caused the giraffe to end up looking like it does. Not every scientist got it right, however.\nFamously, early evolutionary biologist Jean Baptiste Lamarck used giraffes as an example of his theories, that, if an animal needed to adapt to suit its environment, it could do so within its own lifetime. So, if a giraffe was trying to reach leaves that were too high, it would be able to stretch and eventually lengthen its own neck to reach them.\nIn actuality, it was his theories that were a bit of a stretch.\nWhy are giraffes important to the environment?\nGiraffes are a keystone African herbivore. They have the ability to completely change the habitats around them.\nWhile traversing the landscape to feed all day, they are in actuality pruning and distributing seeds across the terrain, helping to keep the habitat managed for other wildlife to use.\nAcacia trees and their seeds, a favorite food of giraffes, are not favored by other species so seed germination of this iconic African tree would be stymied without the germination effects of giraffes\u2019 consumption.\nGiraffes are also believed to be pollinators, as they go from tree to tree, blossom to blossom, across large distances.\nIt is also believed that giraffes\u2019 tall vantage point and excellent vision help them to spot danger early, and gives other herbivores in the area the \u201cheads up\u201d when carnivores are coming.\nFun facts about giraffes\nTheir legs and neck are not the only thing about the giraffe that\u2019s huge \u2013 their tongues can be up to two feet long!\nThe hooves of an adult giraffe are approximately the size of your dinner plate.\nA group of giraffes is called a \u201ctower.\u201d\nBaby giraffes are born already six feet tall.\nFemale giraffes give birth standing up, so infants are born, falling about five feet to the ground.\nGiraffes are the world\u2019s largest ruminant \u2014 that means that they chew and swallow their food, partially digest it, then regurgitate some of it to chew on as cud.\nStandard giraffe pregnancies last 15 months, but the period of time is not set as it is for humans.\nGiraffes eat about 140 pounds of food every day, all consisting of leaves.\nThe complex blood pressure system that the giraffe uses to regulate its gangly body has actually been used as inspiration by NASA in their development of human space suits.\nGiraffes have the biggest eyes among terrestrial mammals \u2014 their peripheral vision extends so wide that they can see behind themselves! Excellent for keeping a lookout for lions.\nWhy do giraffes have such long necks?\nIf you explained it through the application of a basic Darwinian methodology, the giraffes developed a unique ecological niche through the evolution of a long neck by experiencing gradual anatomical changes that allowed them to reach resources, in this case, leaves, that were higher and unattainable to other species.\nThe theory rests on the idea that the ability to not rely on high competition vegetation that was lower to the ground gave the giraffes with longer necks the ability to be be healthy, reproduce, and transmit those long-necked genes to their offspring.\nYet in nature, there is no other animal that seems to have used this same technique; no other species with an elongated neck. Additionally, giraffes don\u2019t actually have more cervical vertebrae in their necks than, say, humans. Each one of their cervical vertebrae is just longer.\nThere is a newer hypothesis that addresses these questions and also reminds us that the ability to find a mate is not always reliant on our ability to feed ourselves, but to be attractive to the opposite sex. In the case of giraffes, we know that males have longer necks than females, and also engage in a male-male fighting over mates, referred to as \u201cnecking.\u201d\nFemales, according to researchers, also seem to prefer larger males with longer necks. Giraffes with a longer neck also typically get to enjoy a higher rank within the social hierarchy, allowing them to dominate other males and, statistically, mate more frequently, giving them a \u201cleg up\u201d on transmitting those long-necked genes.\nSpecific physiological adaptations of giraffes\nHaving such a long neck isn\u2019t all easy, though.\nA giraffe\u2019s heart has to generate nearly double the normal blood pressure of other mammals to give the giraffe\u2019s brain adequate blood supply.\nThe blood vessels in the giraffe\u2019s lower legs bear a huge weight, and the giraffe has developed a complex pressure regulation system to keep all these factors in check.\nA giraffe\u2019s blood pressure is extremely high \u2013 twice that found in a healthy human, and its heart beats up to 170 times per minute. Thankfully this complex pressure regulation system can manage these wild extremes \u2014 and can prevent too much blood flow to the brain when the giraffe has to bend all the way down to drink water.\nThough it was thought that the giraffe has a \u201chuge\u201d heart to accomplish all this pumping and beating, it actually has a relatively small heart. Where its power derives is in the thickness of the muscles around its heart, which can be measured getting thicker as the size of the giraffe increases and its blood supply demands grow.\nHaving a long neck may make giraffes seem really cool on the outside, but the physiology underneath, helping it all work, makes it even more exceptional!\nWhy do giraffes have spots?\nIt may seem like all giraffes have the same mosaic-like patchwork pattern on their skin, but giraffe experts know that each one of the species of giraffe has their own design.\nBut why, since most species of giraffes live in similar landscapes?\nGiraffe\u2019s spots are most importantly for camouflage, but they also house a sophisticated system of blood vessels that help the giraffe to release heat.\nSo, as giraffes are distributed closer and further from the equator within Africa, they can be more specialized to withstand the direct sunlight they are subjected to during their long periods of open grazing.\nAre giraffes going extinct?\nYes, giraffes are, sadly, going extinct.\nIn 2016, all four species of giraffe were upgraded by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to \u201cVulnerable\u201d and two species in particular, the West African giraffe and the Rothschild\u2019s giraffe, are now listed as \u201cEndangered.\u201d\nIn the 1980s, it was estimated that about 150,000 total giraffes lived in the wild, but today, not even 40 years later, that number has dropped by 40 percent Africa-wide.\nSome parts of Africa have experienced a drop in giraffe population of more than 95 percent.\nGiraffes have already become extinct in seven African countries, so, while it is hard to believe that such a well-known species could be removed from an ecosystem, it has already happened in many places.\nCurrent populations of the four species of giraffes are widely scattered and fragmented, and each population is subject to a variety of threats specific to its region.\nPart of the reason why giraffes have suffered from such a drastic decline is simply because no one was really paying attention. They were such an iconic part of the African landscape that it was assumed they were in no danger and little focus was paid to research and protection.\nTheir extinction would be tragic enough by itself, but if the reason was that no one was looking hard enough, it would not only be tragic but shameful.\nWhy is the giraffe population decreasing?\nGiraffes, large-bodied grazing mammals, need 140 pounds of leaves each day, necessitating their traverse over huge distances daily in order to get enough to eat. It\u2019s not just one thing which contributes to such a decline but a combination of complex factors which must be considered together to understand the full picture.\nBut as human population numbers rise, and settlements are established that require the cutting of trees, habitat loss becomes a huge threat to all species of giraffe.\nGiraffes occur in countries with the highest fertility rates in the world, so human encroachment is a threat that will only continue to grow.\nMany giraffe populations are already severely fragmented, in addition to being at least 50 percent smaller than reported half a century ago in many regions.\nEast Africa\u2019s giraffes have lost 70 percent of their habitat within the last thirty years alone.\nIn the wild, giraffes have few predators aside from humans. Their size, particularly their legs and feet, give them a mighty kick that can deter even big cats like lions and leopards. Though they have been known to be victims of crocodiles, it is not a common occurrence. Giraffe babies, or calves, often fall prey to herds of carnivores, but, for the most part, giraffes are safe within their natural ecosystem.\nPoaching also plays a major role in the decline, particularly in Tanzania, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and which actually forms a more disturbing part of a wider issue.\nIn West Africa, giraffes are hunted for their tails, their pelts, and their meat. Many animals are killed in order to feed those who hunt, but the demand from other countries for bush meat is also high (and much of which is actually exported to Europe and elsewhere). And, as human populations rise, the demand for meat will only cause further detriment to giraffe populations living in proximity.\nGiraffes are susceptible to poaching as they are largely docile animals that are easy to kill and provide a lot of meat.\nSadly, it\u2019s not just the meat that is in high demand.\nAround ten years ago, a belief in the healing power of giraffe bone marrow and brains sprang up, with practitioners touting their ability to protect and cure people of HIV/AIDS. Severed giraffe heads and bones can fetch up to $140 each, making this a highly tempting option for potential poachers.\nGiraffe conservation status\nGiraffes can still be found in 21 African countries, and in zoos in almost every part of the world.\nIn the wild, they can be found in a number of differently protected areas, from government-run national parks to private or communal lands.\nDespite an increased focus on giraffe conservation in many of these zones, the wide distribution of giraffes across Africa makes their conservation plan complex at best.\nHow can you help giraffes?\nThough many governments are enacting new habitat management and protection for giraffes through conservation initiatives and improved law enforcement, community awareness is still struggling to keep up.\nMany zoos have robust giraffe-specific conservation programs, and need support in particular because these species are not on the public\u2019s radar as one that is in danger of going extinct.

It is hard to imagine that they are not equally abundant in the wild, but the assumption that they are and the subsequent lack of public support for conservation programs to save them is putting the survival of the giraffe across Africa in jeopardy.\nAs an iconic animal of Africa\u2019s savannah, it would be heartbreaking to lose the symbol of the wild \u2013 that silhouette of the giraffe on the sunset horizon of the savannah, yet it could be a strong possibility if action is not taken soon.\nReferences https://giraffeconservation.org/faqs/\nhttps://www.giraffeworlds.com/northern-giraffe-giraffa-camelopardalis/\nhttps://www.awf.org/wildlife-conservation/west-african-giraffe\nhttp://www.girafferesearch.com/rothschilds-giraffe/4568194194\nhttps://www.giraffe.org/about-us/giraffe-faq\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/g/giraffe/\nhttps://www.huffingtonpost.com/wray-herbert/why-do-giraffes-have-long_b_4310113.html\nhttps://www.giraffeworlds.com/why-giraffes-have-such-a-long-neck/\nhttps://animals.mom.me/facts-information-about-giraffes-12456546.html\nhttp://theconversation.com/giraffes-the-long-and-the-short-of-their-survival-as-a-species-54080\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/science/our-understanding-of-giraffes-does-not-measure-up.html"}

They often cover remaining scraps of kills and also bury their excrement, meaning they could be living right under your porch and you might not even know. Coyote Facts\nwiley coyotes\ncoyote reproduction\ncoyote pair\ncoyote mother and pups\nGenerally coyotes spend allot of their time alone, but will come together in casual packs when and where the hunting is good, and pair up once a year for mating.\nIt is believed that coyotes may actually have the same partner for life, spending time apart for several months of the year and finding each other in the late winter.\nThey will mate together over the course of several days, and will stay a pair for a few months a year, raising the family together.\nWhen the female is a few weeks into her two month long pregnancy, she will dig a den. She will give birth to 3 to 8 puppies who are blind and helpless.\nThe male will stay close by, bringing small kills back to the den, or regurgitating food for both mother and pups. As soon as they can walk, the puppies are actively seeking foodstuffs, stalking insects, and sniffing for rodents.\nThey begin to break away from mom by winter, but parents and their offspring may visit eachother and live together off and on, throughout their flexible and fascinating lives. -Coyote Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Where Do Giraffes Live? Habitat and Distribution - AnimalWised", "url": "https://www.animalwised.com/where-do-giraffes-live-habitat-and-distribution-1194.html", "text": "Giraffes reside in savannas, open woodlands or grasslands. This is because those areas are rich in acacia growth. What is an acacia? It is a genus of shrubs and trees which giraffes feed on, and which forms part of their staple diet. Giraffes are mostly found in East Africa and Southwestern Africa, especially Angola and Zambia. Until the middle of the 20th century, giraffes were commonly found in West Africa, to the south of the Sahara. As habitat destruction has occurred, the population of giraffe in this area has become fragmented and the different giraffe species have become vulnerable. Are you wondering where do giraffes live exactly? Stay with us at AnimalWised and discover all about their habitat and distribution.\nGiraffes: Natives of Africa\nGiraffes run wild in the grasslands of the open planes of Sub-Saharan Africa. They also survive in woodlands and savannas, but in general these animals will move to areas which are plentiful in food. Giraffe habitat comprises dry open woodlands, savannas, and other regions where vegetation and foliage are relatively dense. Giraffes feed on mimosas and apricot leaves besides the acacia. Treeless grasslands with less flora are not suited as a habitat for the giraffe. However, it is commonly assumed that giraffes live in dense forests because they must be feeding on tree leaves high up. In fact, this is not so. Giraffes are extremely tall, so they need a lot of room to maneuver. There are eleven different giraffe species and subspecies, and of course they inhabit different regions: Northern giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis): Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Niger, South Sudan and Uganda.\n(Giraffa camelopardalis): Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Niger, South Sudan and Uganda. Reticulated giraffe (Giraffa reticulata): Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia.\n(Giraffa reticulata): Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia. Southern giraffe (Giraffa giraffa): Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe.\n(Giraffa giraffa): Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe. Masai giraffe (Giraffa tippelskirchi): Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia.\nThe shrinking habitat of the giraffes\nThe necessary home range for a giraffe is between eight and fifty square miles. Areas of the habitat for giraffes overlap with that of humans. The result of this is that their natural habitat will shrink further due to humans making roads and clearings. The home range for the giraffes is therefore decreasing. Because of their shrinking habitat, giraffes are pushed back to the same areas for feeding before there is a chance for food sources to replenish. Many habitats around Africa where giraffes are protected from humans have been converted into wildlife safaris.\nGiraffes in a hot spot\nGiraffes thrive in areas where the temperature is high. Enjoying wide spaces that allow them to see at a large distance, giraffes graze for food in a gradual way, although they can also move quickly if they require. One of the biggest threats for the giraffe is the rinderpest, also called the cattle plague. This virus affects bovids like cattle and buffaloes, but also giraffes; entire herds have been wiped out by it.\nIs the giraffe population decreasing?\nGiraffes existed throughout Africa once. Nowadays it occurs in the wild in specific, fragmented regions of the continent from Mali to northern South Africa. The most worrying thing is that giraffe populations are far smaller than they used to be. Herds are becoming smaller in number too. Herds once comprised 100 animals; now, they range from 2-10.\nHas the distribution of giraffes changed?\nExcessive poaching, hunting and climate change has also caused changes in the distribution and number of giraffes in historical time, not only recent habitat destruction. Giraffes disappeared in Egypt around 2600 BCE, although they survived in Morocco till 600 CE. The present situation is such that parts of western and southern Africa are home to the largest numbers of giraffes. The largest populations of giraffes are currently found in Tanzania and surrounding areas. Even there, the local giraffe - the West African or Niger giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis peralta) is classified as endangered by the IUCN in Western Africa.\nDo giraffes migrate?\nGiraffes move around rivers and waterholes in the summer season when it is dry. During the rains, they can be found moving into deciduous woodlands. The giraffes' migration covers a range of around 20 to 30 km. The availability of water is crucial for their survival, but they can look for it for weeks without becoming dehydrated. Giraffes are active during the night and cooler times, and they rest during the hot day. But another fascinating fact is that they sleep less than 2 hours in a day!\nWhat is the African savanna like?\nAs we pointed out above, giraffes live in Sub-Saharan Africa from Niger to Zimbabwe and Botswana. The largest concentration is in central-east Africa, mostly Tanzania and Kenya. The ecosystem in which giraffes can be found is the savanna. The African savanna is a rolling grassland that has high temperatures throughout the year. During the dry months, the temperature is around 70\u00ba F (21\u00ba C) to around 85\u00ba F (29.5\u00ba C) in the wet season. With a hot, humid and wet season from May to November with fifteen to twenty-five inches of rain per month, the African savanna provides nutrition to wild herds of giraffes and more. Savannas are midway between tropical rain forests and deserts. The climate is, therefore, a blend of both \u2013 too dry for woodlands but wet enough to sustain vegetation. The African savanna is like arid Colorado in the dry season; giraffes can go without water for a while, but trees need hydration to survive.\nThe Giraffe Conservation Foundation (GCF) has estimated that 80,000 giraffes exist in the wild, which is half the numbers in 1999 when the IUCN estimated their population to be over 140,000. Poaching, human growth and development, urban encroachment and loss of habitat to degradation are the reasons behind the loss of the giraffe's habitat.

They have greyish to muddy-brown skin, which fades to a pale pink colour underneath.\n2) They are considered the second largest land animal on Earth (first place goes to the elephant!). Males measure around 3.5m long and 1.5m tall, and can weigh up 3,200kg. That\u2019s as much as three small cars!\n3) To stay cool in the blistering African heat, hippos spend most of their day in rivers and lakes. Their eyes, nose and ears are located on the top of their head, which means they can see and breathe whilst submerged in the water. What\u2019s more, these super-cool creatures sweat an oily red liquid which helps protect their skin from drying out \u2013 and acts as a sunblock, too! Cool, huh?\n4) These magnificent mammals were once found throughout all sub-saharan Africa. Sadly, populations have declined due to habitat loss and hunting. Today, they are largely confined to protected areas in East African countries.\n5) Hippos are most active at night, when they forage for food. They are herbivores, and eat mostly grass \u2013 and boy do they eat grass! In just one night, they can guzzle down up to 35kg of their favourite grub!\n6) Despite their enormous size, hippos are great swimmers and can hold their breath for up to five minutes underwater. When completely submerged, their ears and nostrils fold shut to keep water out.\n7) Hippos usually live in groups (or \u201cherds\u201d) of around ten to 20 individuals, led by one large dominant male. The other members are females, their young and a few young non-breeding males.\n8) Dominant males are very protective over their group. To warn off rival males, they open their huge mouths and display their long, curved canines! They also make loud grunts and aggressive splashes in the water.\n9) Female hippos, called cows, give birth every two years, usually to a single calf. Soon after birth, the mother and her baby join up with other cows and calves for protection against predators, such as crocodiles, lions and hyenas.\n10) In the wild hippos live for around 40 years. In captivity, they tend to live longer and may reach up to 50 years old.\nPhotos: Hippo family: Sergey Uryadnikov, Dreamstime. Hippo with jaws open: Johannes Gerhardus Swanepoel, Dreamstime."}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Zarafa (giraffe) - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zarafa_(giraffe)", "text": "Study of the Giraffe Given to Charles X by the Viceroy of Egypt (1827) by Nicolas Huet II (1827) by, also showing the groom who would look after her for eighteen years\nZarafa (January 1824[a] \u2013 12 January 1845) was a female Nubian giraffe who lived in the Jardin des Plantes in Paris for 18 years. A gift from Muhammad Ali of Egypt to King Charles X of France, she was one of three giraffes Muhammad Ali sent to European rulers in 1827. These were the first giraffes to be seen in Europe for over three centuries, since the Medici giraffe was sent to Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence in 1486. She didn't receive the name \"Zarafa\" until 1985.\nBackground [ edit ]\nThe giraffe known today as Zarafa was one among a series of diplomatic gifts[b] exchanged between Charles X of France and the Ottoman Viceroy of Egypt, Mehmet Ali Pasha, to enhance their relationship.\nBiography [ edit ]\nThe young Nubian giraffe was captured by Arab hunters near Sennar in Sudan and first taken by camel, then sailed by felucca on the Blue Nile to Khartoum. From there she was transported down the Nile on a specially constructed barge to Alexandria. She was accompanied by three cows that provided her with 25 litres of milk each day.\nFrom Alexandria, she embarked on a ship to Marseilles, with an Arab groom, Hassan, and Drovetti's Sudanese servant, Atir. Because of her height, a hole was cut through the deck above the cargo hold through which she could poke her neck. After a voyage of 32 days, she arrived in Marseilles on 31 October 1826. Fearing the dangers of transporting her by boat to Paris around the Iberian peninsula and up the Atlantic coast of France to the Seine, it was decided that she should walk the 900 km to Paris.\nThe Passage of the giraffe near Arnay-le-Duc (1827) by (1827) by Jacques Raymond Brascassat , showing Zarafa with entourage en route to Paris\nShe over-wintered in Marseilles, where she was joined by the naturalist \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire for the walk. He ordered a two-part yellow coat to keep her warm, and shoes for her feet. She set out on 20 May 1827, already 15 cm taller than when she arrived in Marseilles. She was accompanied by her cows and Saint-Hilaire, then aged 55, who walked with her. The trip to Paris took 41 days. She was a spectacle in each town she passed through, Aix-en-Provence, Avignon, Orange, Montelimar and Vienne. She arrived in Lyon on 6 June, where she was greeted by an enthusiastic crowd of 30,000.\nShe was presented to the King at the chateau of Saint-Cloud in Paris on 9 July 1827, and took up residence in the Jardin des Plantes. Now standing nearly 4 m high, Zarafa's arrival in Paris caused a sensation. Over 100,000 people came to see her, approximately an eighth of the population of Paris at the time. Honor\u00e9 de Balzac wrote a story about her; Gustave Flaubert (then a young child) travelled from Rouen to see her. La mode \u00e0 la girafe swept the nation; hair was arranged in towering styles, spotted fabrics were all the rage. The Journal des Dames reported that the color known as \"belly of giraffe\" became extremely popular. Porcelain and other ceramics were painted with giraffe images. She was painted by Nicolas Huet, Jacques Raymond Brascassat and many others.\nZarafa remained in Paris for a further 18 years until her death, attended to the end by Atir. Her corpse was stuffed and displayed in the foyer of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris for many years, before being moved to the Museum of Natural History of La Rochelle, where it remains.\nNames [ edit ]\nThe stuffed giraffe known as Zarafa, in the Museum of Natural History of La Rochelle, France\nAccording to Saint-Hilaire, she was called le bel animal du roi (\"The Beautiful Animal of the King\") during her trip from Marseille to Paris and she was dubbed la Belle Africaine (\"the Beautiful African\") by contemporary press. La Gazette referred to her as \"her Highness\" (pun intended).[c]\nThe name \"Zarafa\" was given to her by American author Michael Allin in his 1998 book Zarafa: A Giraffe's True Story, from Deep in Africa to the Heart of Paris. Zarafa, meaning \"charming\" or \"lovely one\" in Arabic, is a phonetic variant of the Arabic word for giraffe: zerafa.[d][e] Olivier Lebleu, author of the new preface to the second edition (2007) of the French journalist Gabriel Dardaud's book Une giraffe pour le roi (the first modern full-length work about France's first giraffe) has taken up the name \"Zarafa,\" as have several other recent authors, including Lebleu himself in his 2006 book Les Avatars de Zarafa. In addition, the eponymous 2012 French animation film, Zarafa uses the name; and even the museum in La Rochelle, where her mounted remains still greet visitors, now refers to her by the name Zarafa.\nOther giraffe gifts by Muhammad Ali [ edit ]\nMuhammad Ali Pasha also sent two other giraffes as gifts in 1827, one to George IV of the United Kingdom in London and the other to Francis I of Austria in Vienna. Like the giraffe sent to France, both inspired giraffe crazes in their respective cities. The Austrian giraffe joined the Emperor's menagerie at Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace but survived for less than one year. Nevertheless, it lived on in the form of Giraffeln pastries, served until the beginning of the First World War, and Giraffentorten (giraffe cakes) which still can be found. The English giraffe (or \"cameleopard\", echoing the terminology used by Pliny) joined the embryonic London Zoo in Regent's Park. It was painted as The Nubian Giraffe in 1827 by Jacques-Laurent Agasse, in an image that includes Edward Cross and, in the background, the giraffe's milk cows from Egypt. The English giraffe survived for less than two years, and was stuffed by John Gould.\nReferences [ edit ]\nNotes\n^  \u00ab On a vari\u00e9 sur son \u00e2ge compt\u00e9 en nombre de lunes; cependant on est parvenu \u00e0 concilier quelques renseignemens contradictoires et \u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu'elle avait pris vingt-deux mois en novembre 1826 \u00bb (Various accounts on her age, expressed in lunar months, have been given; however we managed to conciliate contradictory information and to establish that she was 22 months old in November 1826), \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire ^ [ citation needed ] Including an obelisk, later exchanged with the Luxor Obelisk ^ l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 \u2014 the treason of looking down upon a king, the monarch of the great nation; but her Highness is unbendable by nature, and she has a quality very rare and estimable in the female sex, as all married men will allow; she is mute.\"[ better source needed ] \"Her Highness was to be presented to his Majesty! how little the king must have looked by a lady 14 feet high!

The 400-470 day growing period makes sure the calf is developed enough to quickly stand up and move around \u2013 an important ability when you share your savannah habitat with lots of hungry predators.\nGiraffes give birth standing up\nNewborn giraffes enter the world in a sort of \u2018superman\u2019 position: front legs and head first, followed by their body, and then back legs. Because of the extreme size of their offspring, giraffe mums give birth standing up so as to not damage their babies\u2019 lengthy necks. This is something that one of our female giraffes, Kinky, unfortunately knows all about! When her mother gave birth to her she was sitting down, squashing Kinky as she entered the world and giving her the kink in her neck by which she gets her name! Surprisingly, the two-metre fall from their mother\u2019s womb to the ground below doesn\u2019t hurt baby giraffes, but rather helps them by snapping their short umbilical cords and tearing the amniotic sack. The shock of the landing also helps stimulate the little giraffe to take its first breaths. Amazing!\nNewborns are huge!\nWhile newborn giraffes may look tiny when next to their incredibly tall mothers, the not-so-little bubs are actually born as tall as a human adult. Standing at around six feet, or 1.8 metres, tall and weighing around 50 to 70kg, these calves are anything but small. What\u2019s more, baby giraffes grow up to 2.5cm every day during the first week of their lives, and will have roughly doubled in size by the time they celebrate their first birthday.\nBabies are up straight away\nBeing born is exhausting business but unfortunately a giraffe calf doesn\u2019t have very long to relax after it enters the world. Within hours of leaving the safety of their mum\u2019s womb, young giraffes can stand, feed, and walk, which is particularly important when they need to follow their herd away from the threat of ferocious carnivores.\nThe herd has lots of babysitters\nThey say it takes a village to raise a child, and the same can be said for the offspring of these lofty mammals. Mother giraffes will often move and browse together with their calves in nursery herds. The babies love to hang around together and play, so they are watched by singular females in an area known as a cr\u00e8che. This gives the other mums a chance to feed and drink in peace, knowing their little ones are safe from harm before they later take over the babysitting duties themselves.\nNow that you know all about how giraffes spend their first moments in life, race into Monarto Zoo soon to see the little ones for yourself!"}

When giraffes snort, bellow, hiss, etc, they make flute-like or low pitch noises beyond the range of human hearing.\nFact #8\nBefore mating, the female giraffe will first urinate in the male's mouth.\nGiraffe couple in love\nFact #9\nGiraffes are ruminants. This means that they have more than one stomach. In fact, giraffes have four stomachs, the extra stomachs assisting with digesting food.\nFact #10\nDrinking is one of the most dangerous times for a giraffe. While it is getting a drink it cannot keep a look out for predators and is vulnerable to attack.\nFact #11\nMale giraffes sometimes fight with their necks over female giraffes. This is called \u201cnecking\u201d. The two giraffes stand side by side and one giraffe swings his head and neck, hitting his head against the other giraffe. Sometimes one giraffe is hit to the ground during a combat.\nFact #12\nA giraffe's habitat is usually found in African savannas, grasslands or open woodlands.\nFact #13\nThe hair that makes up a giraffes tail is about 10 times thicker than the average strand of human hair.\nFact #14\nGiraffes have a great sense of sight and smell and are able to run at speeds up to 35 miles per hour.\nFact #15\nHowever, a baby giraffe in the wild is vulnerable because it has a shorter gait and is unable to keep up with the herd if a predator is detected. In the days and weeks following a birth, a mother giraffe will sometimes leave her baby hidden in tall grass for a few hours while she eats and roams."}

This relative isolation has created an ecology like no other.\nThe vast majority of Australian animals are marsupials - animals whose young develop in a pouch instead of a placenta. Australia is also home to the only egg-laying mammals in the world, the amazing echidna and the extraordinarily odd duckbill platypus.\nBats and dingos are the only placental mammals to have reached Australia on their own.\nDingos arrived from China via the Indonesian land bridge about 12,000 years ago and are the largest carnivores on the continent. Other dogs, cats, horses, cows, sheep and rabbits were all imported by human beings.\ncheck out our youtube channel!\nwhat is a marsupial?\nThere are three subclasses of mammals, placental mammals which carry their young in a womb with a placenta, and deliver a relatively full-formed infant, marsupials which do not have a placenta and deliver a relatively un-formed infant that continues its development inside an external pouch, nourishing itself with milk from the mothers mammary glands, and monotremes which lay eggs.(check them out).\nThe majority of animals native to Australia are marsupials, but what exactly is a marsupial, and how do they differ from other animals?\nSimply put, the embryo of a marsupial starts out life in the mothers womb, receiving nourishment from its egg sac, but is delivered very early and continues its development outside the mothers body.\nInstead of having a womb lined with a placenta that the egg attaches itself to and gains nourishment from, marsupials have no placenta and the baby must leave the womb, while still in a nearly embryonic state, to get nourishment from breast milk.\nThe baby, called a \"neonate\" at this stage, is born after only 12 to 28 days of development in the womb. It may be a fraction of an inch long in some species, is hairless, blind and has poorly developed rear legs.\nThe nostrils are open and the fully developed sense of smell is critical to the neonate finding its way. Its forelimbs are strong too, and raging instinct sets the neonate on a manic climb, unaided by the mother, across the sea of its mothers belly fur to reach the pouch.\nThis journey may be a distance of as much as 15 inches and require six minutes of continuous struggle. In a miracle of pure instinct, the almost imperceptible newborn arrives at the pouch, where it will attach itself to a teat and continue to develop for another 2 to 6 months.\nThe kangaroo\nAn icon of Australian wildlife and the nation itself, the kangaroo is the epitome of a marsupial.\nKangaroos are macropods, belonging in the family macropodidea, which literally means \"big feet\".\nThere are over 65 species in the family including red and grey kangaroos, wallabys, and pademelons. These animals are all designed with huge, powerful hind limbs and muscular tails that aid them in locomotion.\nWith its spacious, forward-facing pouch, curious hopping style of locomotion and a variety of other uniquely endearing features, the kangaroo sets the tone for all Australian wildlife.\nThe red kangaroo is the largest marsupial, and also the largest animal in Australia, with mature males weighing in at over 200 pounds and standing 6 feet tall. - Australian Animals\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

It is the only member of the family Phascolarctidae, the \"arct\" part of the family name from a Greek word meaning \"bear\", and there is definitely a \"bear-like\" quality to koalas, particularly in their lumbering movements and well-rounded, tailless bodies.\nPlush, fuzzy-eared, and with a sweet expression, koala bears are the darlings of Australian animals. They are tree-dwelling marsupials, who live the majority of their lives high in the limbs of eucalyptus forests.\nThey have a very limited diet that consists of the eucalyptus leaves of several different species of eucalyptus trees.. Eucalyptus leaves are toxic to many animals, but the koala has a section of intestine called the caecum which breaks down the toxins in its favorite food.\nBecause their diet is so limited and provides little nutrients, the koala bear is extremely sedentary, spending no more than 10 minutes a day in full-bodied exertion of any kind.\nThe koala bear is not social in the wild, and they are only seen in groups in preserves, zoos and game parks. The koala bear also has one of the smallest brains, percentage wise, of all mammals.\nthe tasmanian devil\nThe Tasmanian devil is a carnivorous marsupial with an epic reputation.\nThis is a very unique creature who has a lifestyle and manner of going about things that is entirely unique, not just among Australian wildlife, but among all animals.\nWildly vocal, the Tasmanian devil emits a constant deluge of guttural, gurgling, wailing and growling noises with little, if any, instigation.\nThe devil has an enormous head and neck which make up a full 25% of its total body mass. A relatively small animal at under 25 pounds, even the areas largest carnivore and apex predator the tough as nails dingo will not entertain any confrontation with a devil unless numbers are well in its favor.\nCompetition with the dingo for food, and attempted extermination of them as pests, has greatly impacted the devils population.\nAs of the early 1900's the devil can no longer be found on the continent of Australia , but now only exists on the island it is named for - Tasmania.\na few more australian Animals\nThe variety of Australian wildlife doesn't stop at koalas and kangaroos.\nThere are over 250 species of marsupials in Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand and the surrounding islands, the vast majority of which exist nowhere else in the world.\nThe bandicoot and bilby are local favorites and are comparable to squirrels and raccoons found in other parts of the world. The bilby is such a charismatic and popular little animal that Australians celebrate Easter with chocolate replicas of bilbys instead of rabbits.\nThe only egg-laying mammals in the world - the wildly bizzare duck billed platypus and the almost equally weird echidna exist only in Australia. These animals make up an entire subclass of mammals which lay leathery eggs instead of bearing live young.\nFinally, the beautiful dingo is the largest carnivore in Australia and the only placental mammal other than bats to have navigated to Australia naturally.\nDingos are the only large predator on the continent other than human beings and literally enjoy top-dog status among Australian animals. - Australian Animals Facts"}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffes For Sale", "url": "https://www.exoticanimalsforsale.net/giraffe-for-sale.asp", "text": "If for whatever reason you have your heart set on owning a giraffe and hopefully don't live in an apartment, you should be advised that as an exotic animal there some states that either outright prohibit their ownership or seriously restrict them. Nine states (Idaho, Alabama, Nevada, Missouri, Ohio, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, and Wisconsin) prohibit owning any exotic pet without a permit.\nTwelve states (Delaware, Arizona, Maine, Indiana, Montana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Rhode Island, and Texas) require a permit to own any exotic pet. Finally, there are nine states (Florida, Arkansas, Illinois, Louisiana, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Virginia, and Nebraska) where there is a partial ban on exotic animals, which means a giraffe would be illegal. In the remaining 20 states, owning an exotic animal is totally illegal.\nThat said, if you live in a willing state and you still have your heart set on a giraffe, there are a few things that you should know in order to make yourself, your giraffe, your neighbors and the authorities happy.\nOverview of giraffes\nThe first thing you should know about owning a giraffe is that even getting one is very difficult. First, there are only about 20 breeders in the United States who offer giraffes, and most of these will only do business with zoos and other institutions. In fact, most experts point out that there are only about 350 giraffes in the United States today, and most of those are owned by zoos. There are only a few individuals who own giraffes, and these raise them so that eventually they can be purchased by a zoo.\nWhy such a hassle? Simply put, giraffes are not only wild animals, but they can grow to more than 16-20 feet tall and weigh an average of 2,628 lbs. They are native to mid-continent Africa, from the area of Somalia on the north and the northern tip of South Africa in the south. This area where they are native is largely plains, which is a good thing since a giraffe can sprint up to 37 mph over a short distance, and up to 31 mph over several kilometers.\nThe spots amd patterns of the giraffe help the animals blend into their natural environment and blend into the trees and other surroundings to help the giraffes from predators\nHow much does a giraffe cost?\nPurchasing a giraffe is no small endeavor either even if you do have the money required, which range on average from $40,000-$80,000 that would be required to acquire a healthy, giraffe. And at this price, you would probably have to deal with a \"going out of business sale\" at a zoo, since and younger giraffe would probably set you back more than that.\nHow much space does a giraffe need?\nOne of the prime drawbacks to owning a giraffe privately is, of course, their size and the area they would need to occupy if owned. This problem is minimized when a giraffe is young, but once it grows to about four months old it would be necessary to move it to a larger area where it can live in a space that they would be more accustomed.\nWhat do Giraffes eat?\nGiraffes are ruminants, eating almost exclusively leaves and grain, although they have been known to lick the meat off of dead carcasses in the wild. Regardless, they will usually eat about 75 lbs of foliage daily. For the most part, giraffes eat during the first and last hours of the day. Between these hours, they ruminate, which is just generally doing nothing but chewing their cud and watching out for predators. Giraffes normally live long lives, especially considering that they are ruminants, up to 25 years. Considering their size and the potential effect of their powerful kicks, giraffes have few predators.\nGiraffe Breeding\nGiraffes live largely in groups of as many as 32 individuals. This is primarily done for feeding and breeding purposes. The most stable members of these groups are the females and their young, while males will move about frequently, sometimes many miles from where they normally spend their lives. Giraffes are largely polygamous, and their gestation period is 400\u2013460 days, after which a single calf is born.\nVeterinary Care\nNeedless to say, it would require not only a veterinarian with a unique skill set to work on a giraffe, he would also need a very specialized work space to accommodate these rather tall and large patients. If for no other reason than their size, veterinarians who work with these types of animals normally don't work in private practice. Instead, they work for the institutions where their animal patients live and work on the premises.\nAll of this is a long way around saying that unless you have been entrusted with some very unique circumstances, perhaps you should consider owning something a lot smaller, as well as traditional, like a dog."}

However ,a moving group of Giraffes is called a journey.\nThe social interaction, which you are most likely amongst these animals when on an African safari, is necking.\nThis occurs during courtship, when it involves a gentle, stroking action.\nYoung adult males spar by neck wrestling when it is a test of strength - each trying to wrestle the other slightly off balance.\nTo understand dominance hierarchies amongst them look for the dominant animal, which will stand with its head held high.\nA submissive one holds its head low and at an angle to its neck and drops its ears.\nWhat do giraffes eat?\nThese long-necked browsers can exploit a feeding niche in their habitats that is only shared by elephants.\nTheir height enables them to reach food, which no antelope can get at.\nThey feed mainly on the Acacia trees.\nGiraffes are very selective feeders and only chooses the most nutritious leaves.\nThey do this by pulling leaves and small twigs into its mouth with its lips and tongue.\nThey sometimes spit out thorns and tough twigs.\nThese African animals have a very efficient digestive system.\nThis means that they can survive on less than half the browse you would expect of an animal of this size.\nThe presence of thorns on acacia trees slows down this process, which means they have to spend at least 11, and up to 20, hours a day feeding.\nIn habitat areas where the soil is poor in calcium, they obtain these minerals by chewing bones.\nDo you know how to see the difference between a male and female giraffe from a distance?\nYou can differentiate between the sexes because of their different feeding styles.\nMales tend to feed at full stretch, reaching up to 5, 8 m from the ground.\nFemales feed lower with their heads tipped downwards and their necks angled forward to reach the tops of low bushes.\nThis means that bulls and cows do not have to compete for food.\nHow tall is a giraffe?\nThe maximum head height of males is 5,5 meters and 4,5 meters for females.\nThe shoulder height of males is 3,3 meters and it is 2,8 meters for females.\nHigh-ranking bulls intimidate subordinates by standing with their necks vertical to exaggerate their height and bulk.\nWhy do Giraffes have horns?\nThey have a pair of short, thick horns on the top of their head.\nScientists think this add weight to the head of the male giraffe. This allows them to deliver heavier blows on the body of the opponent with its head during contests.\nWhy are Giraffe tongues black?\nThe tongue is up to 45 cm long which together with the dextrous upper lip allows them to get in between the thorns and strip the leaves.\nFun Fact: Giraffes eyelashes allow them to sense when they are getting too close to thorns from prickly acacia trees on which they feed. Eating from a tree with big thorns can be dangerous because you can get your eye poked.\nHow fast can a giraffe run?\nThey can gallop at up to 34 miles per hour (56 km/h).\nWhen you are on African safari lookout for the very distinctive walking gait of this African animal.\nBecause its legs are so long a walking they move both right legs forward and then both the left legs.\nWhen they gallop, this changes, and they simultaneously swing the hind legs ahead of and outside the front legs.\nHow do they groom themselves ?\nSomething you will probably notice when in the bush is that the build of this animal makes it difficult for it to groom itself.\nThat is the reason they are usually peppered with ticks.\nWhen you see them scratching against trees it is because they are trying to rid itself of these parasites.\nHow do giraffes fight?\nWhen giraffes fight the bulls swing their heads like medieval maces.\nNotice in the giraffes fighting below how the one animal lands a thundering blow on the body of the opponent with its head.\nThe neck is so long that the swing looks slower than it is and the blows less hard but the sounds of their impacts can be heard from 100 meters away.\nBroken jaws and necks and combatants being knocked unconscious have been recorded.\nA bull rides the blows of the opponent by jumping slightly at the moment of impact.\nThey cannot jump and swing at the same time so the two opponents give the impression that they are taking turns to give and receive blows.\nFights like this can go on for more than half an hour.\nAfter the fight - the winner will emphasize his dominance by briefly mounting the loser.\nHow do giraffes defend themselves against predators?\nGiraffes defend themselves against predators by kicking with either the fore or hind feet.\nTheir large and heavy hooves can break the back of a lion.\nSomething interesting information about their vulnerability to predators relates to their feeding habits.\nBulls tend to feed at full stretch with their heads tipped upwards.\nThis makes them less able to keep watch for predators while feeding.\nAn interesting giraffe fact shows that in the Kruger National Park lions kill 1,8 times as many bulls as cows.\nCan giraffes be dangerous?\nGiraffes aren't among the most dangerous or aggressive creatures in Africa.\nLike all wild animals, they cab be unpredictable. If they feel nervous, and they're known to be easily startled.\nThe animal's elevated vantage point allows them to notice humans approaching from a distance. It is therefore unlikely that they can be surprised by an approaching person.\nGenerally giraffes are harmless creatures.\nWhy are giraffes vulnerable when they are drinking water?\nThey don\u2019t need to drink a lot of water, because they get most of their water from the plants they eat.\nTo reach water, it has to splay its front legs and bend its knees before bending its neck to get its head down to ground level.\nAny wildlife animal in this position is very vulnerable.\nIt will always look around carefully and make sure it has a firm footing before bending.\nWhen they raise and lower their heads its brain is protected by a special system of elastic blood vessels in the neck.\nThis system is effective in getting blood and oxygen to their heads, as well as to prevent blackouts when they lower their heads.\nThey have enormous hearts, which weigh close to 25 pounds, and large lungs to effectively circulate air through the 6 to 8 feet long windpipe.\nTheir jugular veins have a series of one-way valves that prevent them from getting a rush of blood to their brains when they bend down.\nHow do Giraffes sleep?\nThe giraffe is always very vulnerable to predators.\nBecause it is not easy for them to lie down or get up quickly, sleeping is a huge inconvenience in their lives.\nGiraffe needs very little sleep. They have brief naps that last from 5 to 30 minutes.\nAdult giraffes sleep standing up but hardly ever sleep for longer than five minutes at a time.\nCan giraffes jump?\nInterestingly they can hardly jump at all.\nThe highest fence a giraffe has been recorded clearing was only 1 meter high.\nHow do Giraffes mate?\nA wandering bull tests the reproductive condition of females he encounters by sniffing her urine.\nGiraffe gestation period: Giraffe cows are pregnant for about 15 months.\nA female that becomes receptive for mating will be approached by a series of increasingly high ranking bulls.\nA higher-ranking challenger displaces each suitor.\nBy the time the female is receptive the top bull will be courting the female.\nCopulation is very brief.\nCows leave the herd to give birth in cover.\nIn the Serengeti, nearly all the calves are born in traditional calving grounds to which a female will return.\nA female gives birth standing up, or even while walking.\nAt first, the mother chases other giraffes away so that her calf bonds only to her.\nThe calf can stand within an hour and lie hidden for 1-3 weeks.\nWhile it is still wobbly on its legs its mother guides it with nudges of her head and forelegs.\nCalves in the same herd establish social bonds by playing with each other.\nThe baby Giraffe first eats solid food at two weeks.\nBaby Giraffes are weaned between 12 and 14 months and leave the mother at 15 to 17 months.\nCalves suffer heavy predation and the first-year mortality is 48% in the South African Lowveld.\nWhy are Giraffes endangered?\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species reveals that Giraffes are in danger.\nSurveys show that giraffe populations have declined by 30-40% during the last 30 years (called a silent extinction).\nSadly the main reason for this is human population growth which results in habitat loss and illegal hunting.\nNot many people realize that the United States provides a market for the trade-in giraffe parts. It is estimated that 21 000 bone carvings, 3 000 skin pieces ,and 3 700 hunting trophies were imported into the United States during the last 10 years.\nGiraffe tails are also used as fly swatters in parts of Kenya and the DRC.\nDid you know that these graceful African animals are already extinct in seven African countries?\nPlease create awareness of these facts by sharing this page with your social media friends."}

In general, foxes are small members of the dog family, the largest of which is the typical red fox.\nMost other species are considerably smaller.\nThe red fox is the most wide-spread carnivore in the world, living in every region of the Northern Hemisphere including Central America, and having been introduced by humans to Australia, where they are so successful they are considered a major pest.\nThe red fox in particular is extremely skilled at adapting to almost any environment. They have succeeded and thrived in close proximity to human beings and there are even some sub-species of red fox that live in heavy urban environments, taking advantage of their naturally nocturnal tendencies.\nMany other fox species are endangered or threatened, unable to adapt to human encroachment, while the red fox enjoys healthy populations all over the world.\nFoxes live in small groups, or alone. They don't have the kind of intense social structure we connect with other canines like the wolf and the dog.\nThey are solitary hunters even if living in a family group, and they are notorious for killing extra prey and burying it for later. This activity is probably how the \"sly\" signature got attached to the fox, although, foxes, in general, are very bright, inquisitive and intelligent animals.\nThere are unusual names applied to male and female foxes as well, the male being known as a \"reynard\" and the female, naturally, a \"vixen\"\nThere is no doubt of the beauty of these animals, (they've paid the price being regularly trapped for their fur). and there is no doubt why the term \"fox\" is often used to describe attractive people too! - Fox Facts\nwhat does the fox say?\nThe fox says allot, actually. Although they are members of the canine family, fox species don't bark like domestic dogs do.\nThey have a warning bark of their own that is very short, high-pitched, and usually singular, definitely not a \"bow-wow-wow\" type sound.\nThey do, however, make an amazing variety of noises- up to 20 different calls it is believed.\nFox vocalizations include chilling nighttime \"screams\", coyote-like howls, whimpers, \"snuffing\" noises, and a happy call that sounds like a human baby crying. But the most distinct sound most foxes make is a chuckling type noise called a \"gekker\".\nFoxes will gekker when they are fighting or playing. They will also gekker out of excitement and nervousness, and as most foxes are rather nervous creatures, the sound is emitted quite often.\nA litter of kits play-fighting will roll around gekkering for hours at a time. And a vixen defending her den will gekker an intruder right out of her territory. -Fox Facts\nfox reproduction\nfox vixen and kits\nThe fox family dynamic is very varied, with some animals forming fairly strong pair bonds, while others are more independent, and live in very loose family structures.\nThe red fox usually lives in a small family unit with a dominant pair, and two to five other individuals, usually maturing offspring. Similar to wolves, it is generally only the dominant female who will have kits, and the other family members will often assist in the raising of the kits.\nOccasionally, a father fox has been known to rear young on his own, after the demise of the mother. Red foxes and many other fox species dig simple, but roomy dens when the babies are about to be born, and the family will stay close by for up to three months while the young kits grow. The whole family takes care of the kits.\nThe rest of the year, foxes usually live basically out in the open, bedding down by turning in a tight circle to tamp down a little bed for themselves, just as we see domestic dogs do on the living room rug.\nAs the kits mature, they may leave to form their own family units, usually at about 10 to 18 months, or, sometimes will stay with their parents for life. When youngsters stay on, they often remain subordinate to the parents and help with the raising of the next generations of kits without producing offspring themselves.\nMother, father and siblings will regurgitate food for young kits and bring food back to the den. It has long been a belief that foxes live alone, and some do, but perhaps it is because they spread out and hunt alone, and if they are seen at all, it is when they are stalking prey or seeking their next meal. - Fox Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Within just a few generations the foxes not only became quite content with human contact, but sought it out and took comfort and even joy from being petted and played with.\nThe psychological changes were interesting for sure, but the physical changes were astounding.\nThe foxes changed color and began to develop patches in their coats, sometimes their tails turned curly and their ears flopped down. It seemed the traits that pushed towards a tamer animal perhaps had strong chemical influences as well.\nMost suggest the domesticated version has less adrenalin, and perhaps less testosterone. DNA research done on the foxes showed that major changes had taken place,and that this was basically a new animal, with strong hints of our domestic dog.\nToday, the study is no longer funded, and only continues with the sale of the foxes as pets. These domestic foxes, once a form of red fox but now known as \"silver foxes\" actually make sweet and lovely pets for many in Russia.\nmany beautiful little beasts\nfox species\nThere are twelve species of foxes in the genus \"vulpus\" which are known as the \"true foxes\". Among these, the red fox is the largest and most common, and is also the most wide spread carnivore in the world.\nThe grey fox, very similar to the red, is also quite large and fairly numerous.\nThe other species are smaller, ranging from the cat sized cape fox to the chihuahua sized fennec fox. There are also numerous species outside of the \"vulpus\" genus that are still referred to as foxes.\nMany of these are quite rare, and several are severely endangered.\nThe fox is somewhat fragile in the wild. Even the amazingly capable red fox which can live to 10 years old has a surprisingly short life expectancy of perhaps only 4 years in the wild.\nHunted, trapped, poisoned, hit by cars, pursued by larger predators, domestic dogs and the occasional birds of prey, too many of these little gems are struggling to hang on. - Fox Facts\nthe arctic fox\narctic fox pair\nThe stunning arctic fox may weigh only about seven pounds, and most of it is fur.\nLiving in some of the harshest conditions on earth, the little arctic fox blends in perfectly for 9 months of the year in glorious snowy white, and then quickly sheds and replaces its coat with brown fur for the few short spring and summer months .\nAmazingly suited to the snow and ice, it has snowshoe like fur on its paws to navigate wintry terrain, and uses its large tail as a muff while it sleeps.\nThe arctic fox can hear small rodents moving beneath the snow and pinpoint their location.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Okapi: Facts About the Forest Giraffe | Live Science", "url": "https://www.livescience.com/56233-okapi-facts.html", "text": "Though sometimes called forest giraffes, this creature doesn\u2019t look like a giraffe. It does have a long tongue, but it has the body of a horse and its legs have stripes, like a zebra. Males also have two small horns on the tops of their heads that are covered with skin. Okapi are part of the Giraffidae family, according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS), which does make them relatives of giraffes.\nSize\nOkapi are about 5 feet (1.5 meters) tall. Females are typically a little heavier at 495 to 770 lbs. (225 to 350 kilograms) while males weigh 440 to 660 lbs. (200 to 300 kg).\nHabitat\nThese animals are found in the African rainforest where trees are dense. They are native to the Democratic Republic of Congo and are typically found within the Ituri Forest, according to the Rainforest Alliance.\nHabits\nOkapi are solitary and territorial. They have scent glands on their feet that spread sticky, tar-like territory markings to alert others of their region. Males also mark their territory with urine. On rare occasions, okapi join together to eat in small groups. During this time okapi may groom each other and play together.\nThey are most active during the afternoon and evening, spending this time in search of food, according to the San Diego Zoo. They follow paths worn through the forest foliage by other okapi who have trod before them. Males tend to have a larger territory and may travel up to 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) a day.\nDiet\nOkapi are herbivores, which means they eat only vegetation. They will reach up into trees with their tongues, pull down a branch and rake off the leaves with their mouths as they let go of the branch.\nThey also eat twigs, buds, fungi, fruits and other vegetation that can be found in the rainforest\u2019s understory. Clay from riverbeds is also important to their diet. The clay gives them minerals and salt that they may not be getting from vegetation. An okapi can eat between 45 and 60 lbs. (20 and 27 kg) of vegetation each day, according to the Rainforest Alliance. Like a giraffe, the okapi has to spread its long legs to get close enough to the ground to get a drink of water.\nOffspring\nFemale okapis typically only give birth to one baby at a time. Birth comes after a gestation period of 14 to 16 months, and the young is born in a nest on the ground.\nBaby okapis are called calves. They are about 2.6 feet (80 centimeters) tall when they are born and weigh about 35 lbs. (16 kg). Calves triple in size by the time they are 2 months old.\n(Image credit: Ken Bohn, Sand Diego Zoo)\nCalves can walk 30 minutes after birth. They don\u2019t defecate until they are between four and eight weeks old, according to the San Diego Zoo. This is a defensive maneuver. Without the smell of feces, it is harder for predators to track the vulnerable newborn.\nOkapis become mature around 2 to 3 years old and live 20 to 30 years.\nClassification/taxonomy\nHere is the classification of okapi, according to ITIS:\nKingdom: Animalia Subkingdom: Bilateria Infrakingdom: Deuterostomia Phylum: Chordata Subphylum: Vertebrata Infraphylum: Gnathostomata Superclass: Tetrapoda Class: Mammalia Subclass: Theria Infraclass: Eutheria Order: Artiodactyla Family: Giraffidae Genus: Okapia Species: Okapia johnstoni\nConservation status\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the okapi as endangered. This is because the rate of population decline is estimated to have exceeded 50 percent over the past 24 years.\nThe population is continuing to decrease. According to the San Diego Zoo, only 25,000 are believed to be alive in the wild. IUCN lists human habitation of the okapi\u2019s home area and hunting as causes for the population decline.\nAncestry\nThe common ancestor of the okapi and giraffe lived about 16 million years ago. This ancestor, known as Canthumeryx, had an elongated neck, according to a 2015 study published in the journal Royal Society Open Science. After Canthumeryx, the family tree split into two branches, with the ancestors of the giraffe on one side and the precursors to the okapi on the other.\nWhile the giraffe ancestors' necks lengthened over time, the animals on the okapi side developed shorter necks.\nBefore the 2015 study was published, experts suspected that the okapi was \"more primitive\" than modern giraffes, because it had a shorter neck, Nikos Solounias, a professor of anatomy at the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) College of Osteopathic Medicine, told Live Science. But now, scientists know that the okapi shared a long-necked common ancestor with the giraffe, and it developed separately on a different branch of the family tree.\nAn ancestor of the giraffe split into two evolutionary branches, one leading to the okapi with its short neck and the other branch leading to the giraffes. (Image credit: by Karl Tate, Infographics Artist)\nOther facts\nThe okapi wasn\u2019t discovered by Western scientists until 1900, according to the Rainforest Alliance.\nOkapi have thick, oily fur that keeps them dry when it rains.\nIn addition to being a great utensil for eating, their tongue is also used for grooming. It is so long they can reach their eyes and ears with it.\nAdditional resources"}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Reticulated Giraffe - Your Guide to the Animal Kingdom", "url": "https://thebigzoo.com/animals/reticulated-giraffe/", "text": "Scientific Name\nGiraffa camelopardalis reticulata\nDescription\nAlso known as the Somali Giraffe, the Reticulated Giraffe is a subspecies of giraffe that is native to the Horn of Africa. The reticulated giraffe is tall, with males towering at 19 feet and weighing between 2400 \u2013 4250 lbs. The female reticulated giraffe is approximately 17 feet tall and weighs between 1540 \u2013 2600 lbs. Its extreme height and weight is largely from its very long neck which spans at least 8 feet and weighs approximately 500 lbs and its legs which are about 6 feet long. The giraffe is the tallest living land animal on Earth.\nDespite having an incredibly long neck compared to humans, the giraffe\u2019s neck is only made up of 7 bones, which is the same number of bones found in the human neck.\nThe giraffe has two strong and sharp horns that are made of bone and covered with skin. The bones are primarily used for sparring between the males. Like other giraffes, the reticulated giraffe is well known for its beautiful spots. Just like fingerprints are unique to human beings, these spots are also unique to giraffes. The Romans actually called it \u201ccamelopardalis\u201d, which means a \u201ccamel market like a leopard.\u201d\nHow long is a giraffe tongue?\nGiraffes\u2019 tongues are up to 20 inches long and are black and pink in color. The long tongue helps it easily grab leaves from trees.\nInteractive 360 Degree Camera of Reticulated Giraffes Click to play this video and use your mouse or finger to move the camera around and get an immersive 360 degree view of these giraffes in their enclosure!\nFood\nThe reticulated giraffe is a herbivore. It mainly feeds on Acacia as well as Combretum trees. The giraffe is also known to eat at least 100 different types of plants as part of its diet. Thanks to its incredibly long neck, this giraffe is able to easily reach at least 6 feet of foliage above the ground compared to most animals. Using its long tongue and strong upper lip, the giraffe strips leaves, flowers, vines, and shoots of the trees. It needs to eat up to 75 pounds of vegetation on a daily basis and will drink water 2-3 days, although it\u2019s not unusual for it to go for weeks without drinking any water. It quenches its thirst by eating leaves and leaves with dew. The giraffe can drink at least 12 gallons of water at a go. It has four stomachs, just like a cow which provide enough space for such a huge amount of water.\nHabitat\nThe reticulated giraffe is native to Africa. The giraffe is found in the Horn of Africa, which include Somalia, Northern Kenya, and southern Ethiopia. Approximately 8500 reticulated giraffes are said to live in the wild in these regions. They are commonly found in habitats like woodlands, savannas, rainforests, and seasonal floodplains.\nPredators\nWhile adult giraffes are too huge to be killed by predators, the young giraffes are often more vulnerable to predators like lions, leopards, African wild dogs, and hyenas. Usually, the mother giraffe fiercely protects her young ones against predators. It throws powerful kicks to the predators but sadly, the calves risk getting killed by their own mothers through these kicks. Still, young giraffes aren\u2019t often lucky as research indicates that at least 50 to 70 percent of giraffes are usually killed within their first few months by predators. The surviving giraffes have an estimated life-expectancy between 20 to 25 years.\nWhen pacing, the giraffe moves like a camel by moving the legs on one side at the same time. But sometimes it must run from predators in a sort of gallop. When it gallops, the giraffe\u2019s front legs pushes it forward while the back legs reach forward on the outside of the two front legs. The head and long neck also propels it. With this unique style of movement, the giraffe can run for miles.\nHow fast can a giraffe run?\nFor short distances, the giraffe can run 35 miles per hour. And for long distances, it can maintain speeds up to 10 miles per hour. However, if the giraffe is subjected to a very long distance high-speed chase, it can have a heart attack.\nThere are circumstances under which the giraffe\u2019s speed will be impeded. If the giraffe is sick, it cannot cover as many paces as healthy and strong animals. A giraffe might be sick from giraffe skin disease (GSD), encephalitis, etc. If the giraffe is malnourished, it can lead to weakness and even sickness. Malnourished giraffe\u2019s do not have the stamina needed for long-distance races. Another reason why a giraffe might not be able to run fast is old age. When old, it\u2019s strength and stamina diminishes.\nPredators of the giraffe, lions and hyenas, usually target the old, weak, and sick animals. When they give a chase, they look out for the ones that cannot run as fast as the others and go after them.\nWhy Do Giraffes Run?\nThere are several reasons why a giraffe would run. A giraffe can run for fun. While roaming the zoo and having a feel of its environment, it is not uncommon to see a giraffe break into an abrupt race. Giraffe\u2019s tend to move in small groups of six, more or less. While playing among themselves, they may run, walk, or just make sudden movements.\nThe giraffes can also run from predators. The main predators of the giraffe are the lion and the hyena. The lion runs faster than the giraffe, covering up to 50 miles per hour. The hyena can run 35 mph \u2013 about the same as an adult giraffe.\nSocial Structure\nUnlike most animals, the reticulated giraffes do not have a very rigid social structure. Herds may either consist of all males, a mix of females and their young ones, or a mix of all. Unlike other herds, a 20-giraffe herd usually doesn\u2019t have a leader. Because of their huge size, they don\u2019t necessarily need to stay together in tight social groups. It\u2019s not uncommon for a single herd to be spread out over half a mile. And thanks to their height, they are always able to keep an eye on each other over a distance.\nDuring mating, male reticulated giraffes engage in fights using their strong necks and horns to deliver strong blows to their opponents. The dominant male often mates with the female after winning the mating contest. Once the dominant males have been established, the giraffes often live peacefully and harmoniously with each other.\nBirth & Offspring\nThe mother usually takes care and guards her calf who usually spends most of its time lying down. In cases where a herd as many calves, one female may take care of all the young ones until they are old enough.\nFemale giraffes give birth standing up, causing the baby giraffe to fall over 5 feet to the ground! In order to flee from a dangerous environment, baby giraffes can stand up just 30 minutes after being born and can even run after being alive for only 10 hours.\nGiraffe Gestation Period\nThe gestation period of a reticulated giraffe is usually between 14-15 months, after which a large baby giraffe is born.\nHow tall is a baby giraffe?\nBaby giraffes are typically around 6 feet tall and weigh 110 \u2013 154 lbs.\nSenses\nThe reticulated giraffes have a powerful sense of hearing and smell. Their eyesight is pretty good too \u2013 combined with their height, giraffes are able to see predators up to a mile away! it allows it to keep an eye on the other herd members. The giraffes are normally silent most of the time which causes people to assume that they are mute. However, they do produce varying sounds like grunts, growl, bleat, moo, snort, sneeze, and even cough. They also have scent glands that emit pungent odor."}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Starting Life - Giraffe Conservation Foundation", "url": "https://giraffeconservation.org/facts/starting-life/", "text": "What is the gestation period of a giraffe?\nThe average gestation period for giraffe is 453-464 days or approximately 15 months.\nWhere and when do giraffe give birth?\nRecent research points to some giraffe giving birth in a \u2018calving ground\u2019, a dedicated calving area. Some giraffe cows have been observed to return to where they were born to have their own calves. This is exciting news and more research will provide greater insight into these amazing creatures.\nGiraffe have no formal breeding seasons as they are able to adjust feeding patterns seasonally to maintain a high nutrient diet throughout most of the year. It has been observed that calving can be synchronised in herds to provide safety in numbers against predators.\nGiraffe give birth standing up, requiring the newborn to fall just under 2 metres (6 feet) to the ground! Designed for such an abrupt entry into the world, a newborn calf can stand up and run within an hour of being born.\nWhat is a baby giraffe called?\nA baby giraffe is called a calf. Also note, that while people often refer to a tower of giraffe or a journey of giraffe (when they are walking), scientifically, we call it a herd of giraffe.\nHow big are giraffe calves at birth?\nThe average height at birth is about 1.8 metres (6 foot) with a tendency for the females to be slightly smaller than the males. A newborn calf weighs about 65 kilograms. Newborn calves grow very quickly and can nearly double their height in the first year. Usually a giraffe will only have one calf although twins have been recorded.\nFor how long will a giraffe rely on its mother\u2019s milk?\nA newborn giraffe will suckle its mother\u2019s milk as soon as it can stand up \u2013 that\u2019s why they need to be so tall at birth. Calves are reliant on their mother\u2019s milk for up to 9-12 months. They start eating solid food (leaves) from about 4 months at which time they also start to ruminate.\nWhat is the biggest threat to a baby giraffe and how can a mother protect her calf?\nThe first few months of a giraffe\u2019s life are the most vulnerable. Predators such as lion, hyena, wild dog, crocodile and leopard all see a baby giraffe as prey. Giraffe mothers are extremely protective and will meter out a powerful kick to any other animal that comes too close. Over 50% of giraffe calves don\u2019t survive their first year in some populations.\nDuring the first few days a newborn giraffe will often be left sitting in high grass, while the mother goes off to feed, but after a few weeks the youngster is introduced to the rest of the herd. Nursery groups, where one mother will keep watch while the others have a chance to go and find food, have been observed in the wild.\nWhen do giraffe \u2018leave home\u2019?\nMale calves will leave their mothers from about 15 months and often join all-male groups. The female juveniles, however, often stay in the same herd as their mothers. If they do leave, they leave at about 18 months old and often stay in the same areas as the family herd they grew up in."}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffes: Testimonies to God\u2019s Design - Answers in Genesis", "url": "https://answersingenesis.org/mammals/giraffes-towering-testimonies-to-gods-design/", "text": "Life as a Giraffe\nTowering tall over the African savanna, the giraffe looks as if it belongs in the circus. It strolls on stilt-like legs, and its neck parades high in the sky. But the giraffe is no comic freak of nature. It displays divine design.\nSince the giraffe gives birth standing up, the newborn calf falls more than five feet to the ground. Within 15 minutes after the calf is born, it stands up on those gangly legs. In short order, the nearly six-foot calf conquers the two distinct giraffe gaits.\nThe first gait is a slow pace as the giraffe alternately moves its left legs and then its right legs. When fleeing from predators like lions, the giraffe can gallop for a short time at speeds up to almost 40 miles per hour. A giraffe is most at risk to a lion attack when spreading its front legs apart and bending down to lap up water.\nAlthough giraffe patterns might look identical, each giraffe has unique markings.\nBeing vulnerable to predators, half of giraffe calves do not survive their first year. The other half, however, may live 20 years in the wild. Adult giraffes usually thwart predators by their high vantage point, swift gallop, and powerful kick, which can kill a lion. The giraffe\u2019s brown and cream pattern camouflages it from predators. Although giraffe patterns might look identical, each giraffe has unique markings.\nParasites and disease are often more deadly to the giraffe than predators. Giraffes ward off parasites by producing chemicals, which give a smelly scent to their fur, and tick birds make their living off giraffes by eating bugs like ticks.\nGiraffes forage among acacia trees, using their 20-inch tongues to pluck off the leaves. Since their blackish tongues are prehensile, they can clutch things in their tongues. As ruminants, giraffes chew their cud halfway between the food\u2019s travel through the four-chambered stomach.\nA giraffe wields its long neck to communicate. It shows submission by stretching its neck straight and tall with nose pointed up. To show aggression, the giraffe swoops down its neck parallel to the ground. Male giraffes use their necks to fight for dominance by necking\u2014basically an arm wrestle with their necks\u2014and sparring\u2014flinging their necks and ossicones (horns) into the opponent.\nGiraffes are mostly silent creatures besides a few sounds like grunting and bellowing. But scientists have picked up low-frequency sounds, called infrasound waves, which giraffes may use to communicate, even at distances greater than a mile.\nSnapshot\nAs the tallest land animal, male bull giraffes tower to around 18 feet. The female giraffes, called cows, are a bit shorter and weigh less than the sometimes 3,000-pound males.\nGiraffes live in herds with the female and calf herds separate from the male herds.\nNine subspecies of the giraffe family have been identified in different areas across Africa, based on skin shade differences. Scientists are labeling some of these subspecies as distinct species.\nThe only other member of the family Giraffidae is the okapi, an elusive animal with some zebra stripes.\nTo send sufficient oxygen way up to the brain, giraffe lungs are eight times larger than human lungs.\nThe giraffe sports the longest tail of the land animals at up to nearly eight feet long.1\nGiraffes average only about two hours of sleep a day.\nDivine Design\nBut today, through a greater understanding of heredity, we know that a giraffe with a stretched neck from reaching wouldn\u2019t pass on that characteristic to its offspring.\nJean Lamarck and later Charles Darwin proposed that a giraffe evolved a long neck by inheriting traits acquired through use and disuse. Darwin thought a drought could have led to early giraffes needing to stretch their necks to reach leaves in tree tops. But today, through a greater understanding of heredity, we know that a giraffe with a stretched neck from reaching wouldn\u2019t pass on that characteristic to its offspring.\nA modified idea suggests that the long neck evolved through mutation and natural selection, which favored those giraffes that could reach higher branches. Such an idea raises the question: What did the younger giraffes eat, and why do giraffes even today often eat at shoulder height and below? More importantly, the proposed progression from short to long-necked giraffes is absent from the fossil record.2\nEvolutionists also encounter a design dilemma for the evolution of a long neck. That six-foot neck requires an intricate blood vessel system to maintain proper blood pressure between the heart and brain. A giraffe bending its neck down to drink water is a marvelous display of design. The 25-pound heart that pumps blood way up that neck against gravity suddenly pumps down with gravity, which should cause the delicate brain to explode. But the blood vessels are uniquely designed with reinforced walls, bypass valves, a cushioning web, and sensor signals to moderate the pressure when the giraffe bends its neck down.\nThe reverse of this intricate system happens when the giraffe raises its head so that the pressure is regained and the giraffe doesn\u2019t pass out. In addition, the tight skin on giraffe legs has been compared to an astronaut\u2019s G-suit, because it prevents high blood pressure from pressing blood out of the capillaries.\nKen Ham penned the problem for evolutionists:\nHow many giraffes blew their brains to pieces when bending down\u2014how many passed out as they lifted their heads, becoming food for the lions\u2014until the special features somehow evolved? It\u2019s obvious that the very first giraffes had to have these special features right from the beginning. If not, they wouldn\u2019t have survived to pass them on to their offspring!\nThe next time you visit the zoo, stop by the giraffe exhibit. With people gawking around you, discuss how the giraffe displays God\u2019s handiwork. Look up that long neck, but don\u2019t stop there. Draw your gaze up to the Creator and praise Him."}

Their Diet Explained - AZ Animals", "url": "https://a-z-animals.com/blog/what-do-giraffes-eat-their-diet-explained/", "text": "Giraffes are herbivores that eat a diet heavy in acacia trees A-Z-Animals.com\nGiraffes are the tallest animals in the world and inhabit the Subsaharan of Africa. Weighing up to 3,000 pounds the giraffe is the eighth heaviest land mammal and is covered with a beautiful decorative spot pattern on its body. Being so big they are constantly eating and foraging.\nIn a land filled with predators like lions and hyenas, the giraffe is strictly a herbivore. They fall into the category of even-toed ungulates which also include sheep, deer, cattle, and their other relatives. Let\u2019s take a look at what a giraffe eats and how they find their food.\nWhat Do Giraffes Eat?\nA giraffe eating leaves Koverninska Olga/Shutterstock.com\nGiraffes are herbivores and have a plant-based diet. The leaves of the acacia and mimosa tree are their favorite food but they will also eat other leaves, seeds, buds, branches of trees, and occasionally grass. In fact, academic research shows that giraffes can eat up to 85% of new acacia shoots!\nThey are considered browsers, not grazers, which means they mostly consume higher vegetation instead of grass and low vegetation. A giraffe\u2019s diet is simple but they have evolved to be efficient in how they eat.\nGiraffes will also eat and chew on bones of other animals to get the nutrients their body lacks. This is called osteophagy, and the bones are chewed and sucked on until they get enough nutrients, then spit out.\nHow Does A Giraffe Eat?\nA giraffe showing off its long tongue NAPA/Shutterstock.com\nOne of the most interesting things about the giraffe\u2019s diet is the way its eats. They have many traits that help them with eating as they spend around 18 hours a day finding food. Giraffes have evolved to be efficient eaters, which helps them eat over 75 pounds of food a day. In general, giraffes eat between 1.6% and 2.1% of their body weight per day.\nSome of the things that help giraffes eat are:\nLong dark tongue\nTall height\nThe lack of upper front teeth\nA giraffe\u2019s long tongue helps it reach high up foods along with its height. The tongue has a dark purple coloring to protect it from the sun and is thick to protect it from thorns. Giraffes also lack upper front teeth which help them chew and rip leaves off branches.\nA Complete List of What Giraffes Eat\nGiraffes eat foods that include:\nAcacia trees\nMimosa trees\nLeaves\nSeeds\nBuds\nBranches of trees\nFruits\nVegetables\nFlowers\nGrass\nDo Calves of Giraffes Eat?\nA baby giraffe with its mother iStock.com/miroslav_1\nBaby giraffes are dropped into the world and expected to walk within the hour.\nWhen born they are lightly kicked by the mother until they are able to stand. Babies\u2019 giraffes have a height of around six feet at birth, which they need to reach their mother\u2019s milk. Calves drink milk from their mother until 9 to 12 months. At around 3 months they are introduced to leaves, and will slowly start replacing the milk for solid food."}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "16 Zebra Facts - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/zebra/", "text": "Zebra Profile\nZebras (subgenus Hippotigris) are well-known for their distinctive stripes. They are members of the group Equus, which contains horses and asses.\nThere are three living species of Zebra: the Grevy\u2019s zebra (Equus grevyi), the plains zebra (Equus quagga), and the mountain zebra (Equus zebra).\nZebra Facts Overview\nHabitat: Grasslands, woodlands, savannahs, and mountainous areas. Location: Eastern and Southern Africa Lifespan: Around 25 years Size: 120 \u2013 140cm at the shoulder Weight: Grevy\u2019s zebra: 350-450kg, the Plain zebra: ~400kg, and the mountain zebra: ~280kg. Color: Black with white stripes Diet: Herbivores, mainly grass Predators: Lions, cheetahs, leopards, spotted hyenas, brown hyenas and Nile crocodiles. Top Speed: 68.4 km/h (42.5 mph) No. of Species:\n3 Conservation Status:\nGrevy\u2019s Zebra: endangered, mountain zebra: vulnerable, plains zebra: near-threatened.\nZebras are native to the continent of Africa, specifically eastern and southern parts such as Kenya and Botswana. Favoured habitats include grasslands, woodlands, savannahs, and mountainous areas.\nThey are grazers, feeding mainly on grasses. They are well evolved for this with strong front teeth to pull up the grass and large molars in the back of their mouths for grinding.\nThey are the favourite prey of lions but are also hunted by leopards, cheetahs, spotted hyenas, brown hyenas, and Nile crocodiles.\nAccording to the IUCN only the Grevy\u2019s Zebra is endangered, while the mountain zebra is vulnerable, and the plains zebra is near threatened.\nInteresting Zebra Facts\n1. Their stripes are unique.\nZebras are iconic for their stripes, which are actually unique to each individual, like a human\u2019s fingerprint. Scientists have even developed a way to read their stripes like bar codes to be able to identify specific zebras in a heard!\n2. No one is completely sure why they have stripes.\nThere have been lots of theories, including that the stripes help confuse predators. Some theories suggest that the stripes work to keep them cooler, while others show that biting flies don\u2019t like to land on stripes. It\u2019s likely to be a combination of all these things!\n3. They are black with white stripes.\nThe age-old question of whether or not zebras are white with black stripes or black with white stripes has finally been answered with science. They are in fact black with white stripes!\n4. Different zebra species have different social structures.\nThe plains and mountain zebras stay in family groups, with a dominate male, females and their foals (baby zebras). These groups usually integrate into larger herds. However, the Grevy\u2019s Zebra lives primarily alone, or in loose herds.\n5. Plains Zebra migrate and form super herds.\nPlains zebra are known for their long migrations, moving to different areas in search of water and grass. Multiple family groups come together to form herds. Often as herds are migrating, they form \u2018super herds\u2019 with thousands of zebras. Other herd animals join in too, such as wildebeest and antelope.\n6. Plains Zebra mass migrate in Botswana twice a year.\nThey move from north to south to reach the rainy season in the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, before returning back to reach the northern deltas again as the rainy season there returns. This migration is around 300 miles and the moving herds contain up to 30,000 zebra.\n7. Plains zebra have the longest recorded migration of any African mammal.\nOne group of plains zebra was recorded migrating 500km from Namibia to Botswana, which is actually the longest land migration of any African mammal.\n8. They are well adapted for grazing and staying alert for predators.\nThey have long front teeth (incisors) which act like scissors to cut the grass at the root, while their large back teeth (molars) work to grind down the grass. They also have eyes high up on the sides of their heads. This means that as they bend down to eat grass they can still watch for lions or other predators.\n9. They bite and kick.\nZebras can actually be quite aggressive. This is usually when defending themselves from prey, defending their young or when males are fighting over a female. Their primary tactics are biting and kicking, as you can see in this video:\n10. They defend each other.\nThe social species of zebra will protect their members from predators. They have been seen forming defensive circles around injured members of their families, often biting and kicking approaching predators.\n11. The Grevys Zebra is solitary.\nUnlike the plains and mountain zebras, the Grevy\u2019s Zebra lives primarily alone in semi-arid grasslands. The males have territories which they protect from others, while females and their foals move freely between these territories.\n12. The Grevy\u2019s zebra can go 5 days without water.\nThese zebra are well-adapted to the semi-arid grasslands they live in and can go 5 days without drinking.\n13. There are two subspecies of mountain zebra.\nThere are the Cape mountain zebra (Equus zebra zebra) and Hartmann\u2019s mountain zebra (Equus zebra hartmannae). Both prefer to live in mountainous areas in Angola, Namibia, and South Africa.\n14. The mountain zebra nearly went extinct.\nIn 1930 there were as few as 100 cape mountain zebra, however thanks to conservation efforts their numbers have increased dramtically.\n15. The Quagga went extinct in the 19th century.\nThe quagga (Equus quagga quagga) was a subspecies of the plains zebra. Sadly, European colonists hunted them to extinction in the 19th century. The last one died in Amsterdam zoo in 1883.\n16. They are important culturally.\nThey are well known internationally but are also important locally. They can be seen in art going back millennia, including in rock art from roughly 20,000 years ago.\nZebra Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification"}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Masai giraffe subspecies declared endangered - Animals", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/masai-giraffes-subspecies-declared-endangered", "text": "Scientists have declared a subspecies of giraffe endangered.\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the global authority on the conservation status of wild animals and plants, announced Thursday that Masai giraffes, a subspecies spread throughout Kenya and Tanzania, are now endangered, primarily because of poaching and changes in land use.\nThere are an estimated 35,000 Masai giraffes remaining, but their population has fallen by nearly 50 percent in the last three decades. Africa\u2019s overall giraffe population has decreased by up to 40 percent in that same timeframe.\nMasai giraffes are iconic, says Tanya Sanerib, international legal director for the Center for Biological Diversity. Given that they\u2019re one of the largest subspecies of giraffes, they\u2019re the \u201cquintessential\u201d animal you likely think of when you think giraffes. For this subspecies to be declared endangered is a wake-up call, Sanerib says.\n\u201cThis was devastating news...It really sounds the alarm bell,\u201d she says. \u201cIt really indicates that we need to be doing more for giraffes internationally and with whatever tools are available.\u201d\nIncreased threats\nThis is the first time the Masai subspecies (Giraffa camelopardalis ssp. tippelskirchi) was assessed on its own\u2014previously, it was included as part of the IUCN Red List\u2019s general giraffe listing (Giraffa camelopardalis), which considers giraffes \u201cvulnerable,\u201d a step further away from extinction than \u201cendangered.\u201d Of the nine subspecies of giraffes, Masai and reticulated giraffes are endangered, and Nubian and Kordofan giraffes are critically endangered.\nHunting giraffes is illegal in both Kenya and Tanzania, but they are poached for their hide, meat, bones, and tails. An estimated 2 to 10 percent of the population is hunted illegally every year in Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, according to the IUCN. Poaching has increased because of civil unrest and emerging markets for giraffe parts, including tail-hair jewelry and bone carvings. There\u2019s even a belief among some that giraffe bone marrow and brains can cure HIV and AIDS, Tanzanian media have reported. (Learn more about how giraffes in central Africa are being poached for their tails.)\nGiraffe deaths have also increased because human populations have grown and expanded into what used to be wildlands, leading to increased incidents of crop damage and vehicle strikes. Hunting for bushmeat is also a threat.\n8:30\n\u201cThe forgotten megafauna\u201d\nGiraffes historically have been understudied compared to other threatened species. While thousands of scientific papers have been written on white rhinos, only about 400 cover giraffes, according to giraffe researcher Axel Janke. There are fewer giraffes than elephants left in Africa.\n\u201cThey\u2019re the forgotten megafauna, so to speak,\u201d says Julian Fennessy, co-director and co-founder of the nonprofit Giraffe Conservation Foundation. \u201cThey\u2019ve sort of slipped away, sadly, while more attention has been given to elephant, rhino, lion, and other species.\u201d (See more photos of how scientists are working to save giraffes.)\nWe have so much to learn about giraffes, Sanerib says, it would be a shame to lose them. For example, they have complex circulatory systems that could have implications for understanding human\u2019s high blood pressure. Researchers have also found that they hum at night, and they have no idea why.\n\u201cWe have this species that\u2019s going extinct, and we have these phenomenal, really fascinating things about them that we don\u2019t know the answers to,\u201d she says enthusiastically.\nAlthough for years there\u2019s been a consensus that there\u2019s one species of giraffe with nine subspecies, evidence of genetic differences has emerged in recent years, suggesting that there are actually four species of giraffe and that the Masai is its own species. Though Masai giraffes aren\u2019t widely recognized as a unique species, Fennessy says categorizing them as their own could reap more conservation benefits. For example, the United States\u2019 Endangered Species Act grants protections to animals at the species level, which means giraffes are not considered endangered by U.S. standards, even though several subspecies clearly are.\nBut overall, Fennessy says this new assessment shines a light on the plight of these animals.\n\u201cBy identifying that they are endangered, hopefully now collaboratively with governments and partners, we can turn the tide before it\u2019s too late,\u201d Fennessy says."}

These spots may act as camouflage for wild giraffes.\nMales and females have two ossicones, or hair-covered horns, on their heads. Male giraffes butt these horns together during play. A giraffe\u2019s neck is approximately 6 feet long and weighs as much as 600 pounds. Each of a giraffe\u2019s legs is also 6 feet long.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Rare white giraffes poached in Kenya - Animals", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/rare-white-giraffes-poached", "text": "Kenya had three rare all-white giraffes. Two of them have been killed.\nWildlife officials announced in a statement Tuesday that a female and her seven-month-old were found \u201cin a skeletal state after being killed by armed poachers\u201d in a nature conservancy in Ijara, northeastern Kenya, likely four months ago. A third white giraffe, the young male offspring of the dead female, is believed still to be alive.\n\u201cThis is a very sad day for the community of Ijara and Kenya as a whole,\u201d said Mohammed Ahmednoor, the manager of the Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy, in a statement.\nThe animals had been well-known since 2017, after rangers spotted them while on patrol in the conservancy and posted a video to YouTube, which subsequently went viral. Some viewers left comments at the time sharing prescient concerns that their newfound fame could put the giraffes at risk for poaching.\nThe tragedy highlights a paradox of how we navigate our connection with nature in the digital age: Social media allows people to experience the joy and wonder of the planet\u2019s rarest creatures\u2014a valuable connection amidst the extinction crisis\u2014while simultaneously putting animals at increased risk. Rarity and exclusivity are among the driving factors of the illegal wildlife trade, so unusual animals are more likely to be targeted by poachers.\nThe comments section on the original video has now transformed into a tribute wall, as hundreds of people express sorrow as well as anger at the poachers\u2014and at the role the viral video may have played in putting a target on the animals\u2019 backs.\n\u201cHauntingly beautiful. So much magic in this world,\u201d reads one comment on the video from two years ago. Below it, a comment left this morning: \u201cIt\u2019s so sad. I don\u2019t understand. WHY?\u201d\nNational Geographic was among a number of media outlets that reported on the rare giraffes in 2017. It\u2019s delicate\u2014navigating how to report on unique animals without helping to put a target on their backs. When we report on wildlife crime, we typically don\u2019t disclose specific locations for that reason.\nRare beauty\nThe giraffes likely had a genetic condition called leucism, which inhibits skin cells from producing pigment but allows other organs, like eyes, to be dark-colored. This differs slightly from albinism, which inhibits the body from producing pigment in all organs. Despite their inability to produce colorful pigments, giraffes and other animals with leucism don\u2019t face genetic disadvantages to their survival.\nThe condition, while rare, is not unheard of. It was also spotted in a giraffe calf at Tanzania\u2019s Tarangire National Park. Following the birth of a white giraffe in their refuge, the Park announced that it had taken steps to ensure the giraffe was safe from poachers. To date, Hirola had not announced any security measures.\nGiraffes are under threat globally. Their populations have declined by more than 40 percent over the past three decades, to just under 16,000, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the global authority on the conservation status of wild animals and plants. Poaching of giraffes, which are killed for their hide, meat, bones, and tails, has increased across Africa. And as human populations grow and expand into former wildlands, giraffes have also fallen victim to retaliatory killings for crop damage, vehicle strikes, and hunting for bushmeat."}

Check out our ten top zebra facts!\nFast zebra facts\nPhylum: Chordata\nFamily name: Equidae\nClassification: Mammal\nIUCN status: Plains zebra: Least Concern. Grevy\u2019s zebra: Endangered. Mountain zebra: Vulnerable\nLifespan (in wild): 25 years\nWeight: 200-450 kg\nBody length: 2.2-2.5m\nTop speed: 65km/h\nDiet: Herbivore\nHabitat: Grassland\nRange:\n1) Our planet is home to three different species of zebra, the plains zebra, Grevy\u2019s zebra and mountain zebra, all three species are native to Africa.\n2) The most common species is the plains zebra, which roams grasslands and woodland of eastern and southern Africa. The Grevy\u2019s zebra can be found in dry, semi-desert areas of Kenya and Ethiopia, and the mountain zebra lives in mountainous and hilly habitats in Namibia, Angola and South Africa.\n3) Closely related to horses, zebras have thick bodies, thin legs, a tufted tail, and a long head and neck sporting a short mane. And their most famous feature? Their brilliant black-and-white striped coat, of course!\n4) So why do zebras have stripes? Well, scientists aren\u2019t entirely sure. Their stripes perhaps serve to dazzle and confuse predators and biting insects, or to control the animal\u2019s body heat. Because each individual\u2019s stripes are unique, their stripes may also have a social purpose, helping zebras to recognise one other.\n5) These cool creatures are herbivores and spend most of their day eating grass, and sometimes leaves, shrubs twigs and bark, too. Their teeth are well adapted for grazing, with sharp incisors at the front of their mouth to bite the grass, and large molars at the back for crushing and grinding.\n6) Zebras are constantly on the move for fresh grass to eat and water to drink. Super stealthy creatures, they\u2019ll travel thousands of kilometres in search of green pastures where they can fill their bellies and quench their thirst!\n7) Zebras are social animals and live together in large groups, called herds. As they migrate to new feeding grounds, \u2018super herds\u2019 may form consisting of thousands of individuals. They may team up with other grazers on their travels, too, such as antelope and wildebeest.\n8) Within a herd, zebras tend to stay together in smaller family groups, made up of a dominant male, several females (called \u2018mares\u2019) and their young (called \u2018foals\u2019). When they are between one and three years old, males (or \u2018stallions\u2019) leave to join \u2018bachelor herds\u2019 (all-male groups), where they stay until they\u2019re old enough and strong enough to compete for females.\n9) As elegant and peaceful as they are, don\u2019t be fooled \u2013 zebras can be aggressive animals, too! Stallions fight for females with piercing bites and powerful kicks that are strong enough to cause serious damage \u2013 and sometimes even kill!\n10) Their fierce fighting skills and strong social bonds help to protect zebras from predators, which include lions, leopards, hyenas and cheetahs. When under threat, these awesome animals form a semi-circle facing the attacker, and prepare to strike if need be. And if one of the group is wounded or injured, other zebras will circle around and attempt to drive off the hungry attacker. All for one and one for all!\nCredits \u2013 Close up of zebra: Medford Taylor. Zebra herd: Chris Johns. Zebra mother and foal: Beverly Joubert. Close up of zebra tail: Joel Sartore."}

When you buy through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.\nGiraffes, those majestic, beautifully spotted creatures of the land, are definitely a sight to see when you go to a safari in Africa- these animals are a widespread scene in pastures and open groves in East Africa, where they can be glimpsed in reserves such as Tanzania\u2019s Serengeti National Park and Kenya\u2019s Amboseli National Park. Before we get to why you\u2019re really here, which is to know why the giraffes have horns, let\u2019s quickly have a glance at the physical characteristics of these gigantic animals- their height, weight, etc.\nGiraffe, (genus Giraffa), any of four ancestries in the genus Giraffa of gigantic-necked cud-chewing hoofed mammals of Africa, with tall legs and a coating structure of jagged brown putters on a pale background are gigantic of all soil animals.\nThe males may overstep 5.5 meters (18 feet) in length, and the massive females are approximately 4.5 meters in height. Utilizing prehensile tongues nearly half a meter long, they can examine foliage about six meters of the ground.\nIsn\u2019t that surprising? Giraffes, by the age of about four, grow roughly to their enormous size; however, bulking and gaining of weight doesn\u2019t happen until seven to eight years of age. The adult male giraffes weigh up to 1,930 kg (approx 4,300 pounds) while the females weigh up to 1,180 kilograms (approx 2,600 pounds). They have a long black cluster on edge, and the bottom may be a meter in height; there is also a small ebony mane.\nBoth sexes have a couple of horns, though males also possess other bony lumps on the dome. But why do giraffes have horns, anyway? We\u2019re not completely sure- although there are a couple of reasons why giraffes may have horns- the major ones are defense and fighting in necking wars. It is also possible that the giraffe horns are the remaining outcroppings of their ancestors that were believed to possess much larger horns (antlers), much like antelopes and deer of the existing age.\nWhy do giraffes have horns?\nGiraffe horns are not known as horns, but ossicones and both female and male giraffe possess them, and both female and male giraffes have a whole set of ossicones. Ossicones are structures that are cropped up from ossified cartilage and are enclosed in a membrane- Giraffes are born with these ossicones, and these aren\u2019t structures that develop later in order to help the giraffe adapt to its surroundings; however, the ossicones aren\u2019t completely fixed to their skull and are not fastened to the crown to stave off damage at the time of birth- they only link with the head later in life.\nWhile female ossicones are often delicate and tufted, male giraffes commonly have rawer ossicones that become barren on top as an outcome of periodic necking. In some species, males grow an additional set of ossicones behind the first pair, as well as distinguished ossicones in front of the directing battalion. The additional set of ossicones on the giraffe allocates them into diverse species- the male adult Northern and Reticulated giraffe have regular median ossicones while the Masai and Southern giraffes don\u2019t.\nWhat\u2019s the purpose of the ossicones on the giraffe?\nThe ossicones on the giraffe\u2019s head may be there for several reasons; however, we aren\u2019t completely sure why.\nOssifications on male giraffes\u2019 head enhance weight, which often improves with age, facilitating them to transmit ever more enormous bangs during necking wars. Aforementioned, it is believed by the biologists that the giraffe\u2019s ancestors possessed antlers that have now been reduced to merely ossicones in the giraffes of the existing era since the antlers are of no use to the giraffes anymore (it is believed that the ancestors used antlers to defend against even bigger and powerful animals, possibly dinosaurs).\nAntlers are composed of projections of bone that fall off (in a way) and regrow every year. However, the giraffe\u2019s \u201chorns\u201d are not antlers \u2013 they are continual outcroppings of bone from the skull, referred to as \u201cossicones.\u201d Giraffes\u2019 ossicones are wrapped with hair (besides the adult males, whose coat of hair degenerates at the end and the bare ossicones are visible at the end).\nThe good guess is that the giraffe\u2019s \u201chorns\u201d originally aided patterns for their antlers \u2014 sockets that benefited the vast receptacles which deer encounter so conveniently during the coupling season in their trials of vitality and authority.\nGiraffes joust by draping their necks around each other and thumping the back of their skull, and sometimes their forehead, into the head of their partner because the brutal frontal onslaughts with horns could have been way more lethal and hazardous (also unnecessary) since giraffes have a thin neck and as the neck gets thin with their growing height, it also becomes weak and more vulnerable.\nThus, giraffes further have bony protrusions above their eyes and at the back of their heads. But this technique of combatting antlers at the top of the head is not that useful- there\u2019s a strong chance that it was partly because of this that giraffes lost their horns. But it is feasible that the bone structures which assisted those horns were not forfeited so effortlessly \u2013 arising in ossicones.\nSpandrels provided confirmation of evolutionary by-products, information that creatures are not constructed from the floor up but modified and changed course over time. Sometimes, spandrels discover a fresh, secondary purpose. It may be possible that the ossicones of the giraffe are present on the head for none of the reasons above but a different purpose altogether, which is yet to be discovered and understood by the biologists.\nHowever, it also may be that they are evolutionary debris \u2013 examples of the unusual side-effects generated as evolution fiddles with a limited thousand genes to make the vicious variation of biological aspects we call life.\nWhat do we call the horns of giraffes?\nThe actual name is \u201cOssicones.\u201d The term ossicone implies \u201cbony cone.\u201d It\u2019s a bony tissue, but it\u2019s sluggish than the severe type of bone we would uncover inside a limb or the neck.\nThey are also referred to as:\nHorns\nAntennas\nAntlers\nBumps\netc.\nPeople don\u2019t really say ossicones because not a lot of animals possess it while it is also hard to pronounce, so it\u2019s much susceptible to call them horns or antlers.\nHow do you pronounce the word \u201cOssicones.\u201d\nThe initial part of the word is pronounced like the word \u201cOssi,\u201d and the latter part is pronounced like \u201cJones\u201d with a \u201cC.\u201d\nSo when plopping the two words jointly, you assert it as \u201cossicones.\u201d\nWhat are the \u201chorns\u201d made of, and what do they feel like?\nOssicones are constructed from ossified cartilage and are wrapped in skin. Giraffes are born with their ossicones; however, they lie steady and are not affixed to the skull to avert destruction at birth. They only mesh or link with the head later in life.\nBoth female and male giraffes have a prominent pair of ossicones. While female ossicones are often tiny and tufted, male giraffes naturally have broader and larger ossicones that become barren on top as an outcome of systematic necking. In some species, males develop a second pair of ossicones behind the first pair, as well as distinguished ossicones in front of the steering squad.\nThe horns are composed of cartilage, which is more adaptable than bone, but it\u2019s still firm. It also originates inside the mortal ears. So it\u2019s not an antler, and it\u2019s not horned either. The cartilage element is not generally found inside horns but inside ears and delicate portions of the body.\nOutside the ossicones, you find an excellent layer of skin and fur just like we see it on the rest of the giraffe\u2019s body. It\u2019s intriguing why the giraffes all have skin growing outside these ossicones, and it may be a clue hidden here.\nThe ossicones are not rigid like horns and are coated with a membrane, so they are not like antlers. They are carved up of soft bony tissue, and as the baby giraffe grows taller, they will affix to the skull. When the giraffe is born, however, the ossicones are not connected to the crown. We speculate the rationale for this is to safeguard them from smashing and doing harm to the little baby\u2019s head.\nWhen you feel ossicones, they are soft and steady, precisely like the legs of the giraffe. This is also one of the significant distinctions between the ossicones of the giraffe and real horns. Because they are enclosed with a membrane and are sluggish; they are not like the original horns at a\nWhich other animals have ossicones?\nSivatherium\nClimacoceratids\nClimacoceras\nAs you can easily assert from these names that these animals are defunct, so biologists did not really care to provide them with original characters and titles.\nThe Sivatherium certainly looks like the excellent combination between an okapi and a giraffe, only with much larger horns than both of these animals that share its resemblance. This might be the substantial reason why giraffes have horns- because this antique relative did have long horns or antlers, and when it formulated into a giraffe, the horn didn\u2019t fade away. Instead of degenerating completely, they only grew smaller and look like the ones we locate on the top of the giraffe\u2019s head today.\nWhat are giraffes related to?\nGiraffes are not the only creature with ossicones. Guess we have others in the group as well. The nearest relative to the giraffe is the \u201cokapis.\u201d They have tiny horn-like antlers at the semblance of its head. Other than that, it\u2019s not really susceptible to confide that this creature is the closest relative to that giraffe. It\u2019s a lot tinier and looks more like a horse or maybe a short deer.\nThe male okapis also have ossicones on their skull. The female okapis do not have these horns on their heads, unlike the giraffes. For the giraffes, however, you will recognize them from the males as well as the females. Nobody really comprehends why we will not discover them horns on the female okapis.\nBesides the two horns, the okapi and the giraffe also have something else in common: A very long dark-colored tongue. They both have a relatively standard language, which feels comic. You might have discerned it in the zoo when the giraffe juts out its long tongue to clutch food from your hand.\nHow do giraffes protect themselves?\nGrown-up giraffes\u2019 size frightens many probable buzzards, so young and ignorant giraffes are more susceptible to danger. The giraffe\u2019s chief potent defensive asset is a mighty kick it puts on with its front feet, with pressure powerful enough to slay a lion. Giraffes have no claws, sharp tusks, but they have edged antlers to safeguard themselves. Any creature that resides in the violence in such circumstances has modifications that enable them to withstand the dangers and survive in their habitat. Giraffes utilize these antlers or ossicones to uphold and protect themselves from intruders and, sometimes, their legs. These are the fundamental and most dominant ammunition that protect them from death\nDuring assaults, male giraffes swivel their heads at each other, attempting to get their foe to waive and run away from the area. These ossicones (horns of giraffes) started up as cartilaginous structures; however, over time, the cartilage is rehabilitated by bone, and the horns become very tough and reliable. Giraffes are the only gigantic living terrestrial animals, and some of the widest specimens reach approximately 20 feet in height. Giraffes have developed long necks to see predators from a tremendous distance and to get their favorite food sources. Giraffes eat up a wide variety of plant species, but the famous diet for giraffes is the fresh, tender leaves in the caps of acacia trees. Giraffes need vast and potent hearts to pump blood up to their necks and into their brains.\nThe giraffe can certainly swivel it\u2019s long neck rapidly and whack any animal. It can even blow out big cats to protect itself, so they become inanimate or senseless for a bit of time. This enables the giraffe to take flight before the predator wakes up again. As the giraffe swings his head, these tiny horns reinforce additional weight (and therefore different speed) to the swing. So it might be a benefit for the giraffe to have them even though they might look silly and not seem crucial. We don\u2019t speculate the giraffe utilizes the little horns promptly to protect itself. They are enclosed with membrane and are not spiked like antlers and real horns. So we can\u2019t really wield them to injure another animal.\nRead More\nCan Komodo Dragons be Pets"}

The subspecies are thus divided: Angolan giraffe (G. c. angolensis), Kordofan giraffe (G. c. antiquorum), Masai giraffe (G. c. tippleskirchi), Nubian giraffe (G. c. camelopardalis), Reticulated giraffe (G. c. reticulata), Rothschild\u2019s giraffe (G. c. rothschildi), South African giraffe (G. c. giraffa), Thornicroft\u2019s giraffe (G. c. thornicrofti), and West African giraffe (G. c. peralta).\nHowever, the Giraffe Conservation Foundation (GCF), together with its partner Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (BiK-F), has performed the first-ever comprehensive DNA sampling and analysis (genomic, nuclear and mitochondrial) of all major natural populations of giraffe throughout their range in Africa. As a result, an update of the traditional taxonomy now exists. This study revealed that there are four distinct species of giraffe, and several subspecies. The four distinct species are Masai giraffe (G. tippelskirchi), Northern giraffe (G. camelopardalis), Reticulated giraffe (G. reticulata) and Southern giraffe (G. giraffa). The Angolan giraffe (G. g. angolensis) and South African giraffe (G. g. giraffa) are the two subspecies of the Southern giraffe. Nubian giraffe (G. c. camelopardalis), Kordofan giraffe (G. c. antiquorum) and West African giraffe (G. c. peralta) are the three subspecies of the Northern giraffe. Rothschild\u2019s giraffe is genetically identical to the Nubian giraffe. As the nominate species, Nubian giraffe takes precedence and Rothschild\u2019s giraffe is thus subsumed into it. The Luangwa giraffe (also known as Thornicroft\u2019s giraffe, G. t. thornicrofti) and Masai giraffe (G. t. tippelskirchi) are both subspecies of the Masai giraffe.\nIn all of GCF\u2019s conservation work and publications, based on this research, we use the updated giraffe taxonomy of the four species, while the IUCN still refers to the traditional concept of one species and nine subspecies.\nAll four giraffe species and their subspecies live in geographically distinct areas throughout Africa.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Animal Facts \u2013 Highlands Wilderness", "url": "https://highlandswilderness.net/animal-facts/", "text": "Buffalo\nBuffalo prefer open savannas characterised by tall grass. They avoid trampled areas. Shade and wallows are necessary habitat features.\nFood preference: Buffalo mainly eat grass and prefer species such as Themeda triandra, Panicum coloratum, Panicum maximum and Digitaria species. Occasionally trees and bushes of Grewia, Dichrostachys and Combretum species are browsed.\nWater requirements: 31 liter per day, water dependent.\nGroup size: Eight individuals, consisting of three males and five females.\nReproduction: Mating usually takes place from March to May, followed by a gestation period of 330 days. Single calves are born throughout the year, peaking during February month.\nLife span: 15 years (Smither\u2019s 2000)\nPopulation grow/year: 20 to 35 percent (Smither\u2019s 2000)\nHome range: Buffalo can adapt to a wide range of habitat from dense woodland to open plains. It is seldom far from water.\nMinimum viable goup size and sex ratio: 12 and 1 : 6 (ECOCAP)\nDescription: Both sexes carry horns, which are massive with a broad base. The buffalo is a very large, oxlike animal with short neck and broad, naked muzzle, large ears and a long tail ending in a tuft. The colour of males is blackish. Cows and calves are reddish-brown.\nRecommendation: On Highlands Wildeness Game Ranch, Buffalo can serve as a very important ecological role since it will prefer grassland area on the game ranch. Currently there are no bulk feeders on the ranch except zebras. Their numbers should be maintained at the recommended stocking densities, because of limited suitable habitat. Buffalo is considered one of the most effective non-selective grazers, with little preference shown for specific grass species; aggressive behaviour, range limitations and economic considerations usually exclude this animal from introduction onto small game areas. Highlands Wilderness Game Ranch has excellent buffalo habitat, especially on the eastern section, but before introducing buffalo certain regulations will have to be met. Holding facilities need to be constructed, as the animals require quarantine and adaptation time prior to release on the ranch. Regulations concerning foot and mouth disease, corridor disease, bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis need to be considered, and transport as well as holding permits will have to be acquired from provincial and national veterinary services. Furthermore, fences need to be adapted, if necessary, according to the regulations for buffalo ranching of the Limpopo Department of Environment and Tourism. The purchase of certified disease free animals is recommended as diseases can be transmitted to neighbouring properties. Moreover, certified disease free animals are of higher value, which is of interest when selling surplus animals. The best alternatives to stocking buffalo are either, Burchell\u2019s zebra, white rhinoceros or cattle. On Highlands Wilderness Game Ranch the number of buffalo will depend on the number of other bulk grazers, especially zebra.\nBlesbok Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi\nHabitat requirements: The blesbok is found in open grassland with permanent water (Stuart and Stuart 2001).\nFood preference: The blesbok prefers grasses but will browse occasionally (Stuart and Stuart 2001). The blesbok prefers short grass, especially growth flushed by fire. They select for species in older grass and for growth stage in short grass (Smither\u00b4s 2000). Themeda triandra and Eragrostis curvula are the main grass species utilised by the blesbok (Bothma, Van Rooyen, and Du Toit 2002).\nWater requirement: The blesbok is water dependent and utilises approximately 3 litres a day (Smither\u00b4s 2000 and Du Toit 2002).\nGroup size:2 to 25 adults (Stuart and Stuart 2001).\nReproduction: Most blesbok lambs are born between November and January with a peak in December. Gestation period is approximately 240 days and the lamb has a mass of 6 to 7 kg at birth. The lamb can run with the mother within 20 to 30 minutes after birth (Stuart and Stuart 2001). The lambs wean at 4 months. Females are sexually mature at 2 to 3 years (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nLife span:13 years (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nPopulation grow/year: 20 percent (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nHome range: The home range of a territorial ram is about 2.5 hectare (Bothma, Van Rooyen and Du Toit 2002).\nMinimum viable group size and sex ratio: 10 and 1: 9 (ECOCAP).\nDescription: Both sexes carry the horns which are rather small, heavily ringed, evenly curved backwards and outwards; their tips recurved upwards. The blesbok is similar to the bontebok except that it is smaller, slighter and less richly coloured. The white facial blaze is broken by a dark, narrow band between the eyes. The rump patch is pale.\nGeneral: Blesbok usually nod their heads a great deal due to the irritation caused by botfly larvae which inhibit their nasal passage.\nRecommendation: Blesbok can do damage to the environment, especially on the sensitive vegetation in the western part of management unit 1. Blesbok can over-utilise preferred vegetation areas in management unit 1 and should therefore be monitored. Their numbers should be maintained at the recommended stocking densities, because they are in completion with wildebeest.\nBlue duiker Cephalophus natalensis\nHabitat requirements: Blue duiker requires thickets, savannas and woodlands that provide shade and cover they preferably occur ecotones. (Stuart and Stuart 2001).\nFood preference: Blue duikers are browsers. They feed on twigs, flowers and fallen fruit, especially Solanum species.\nOccasionally blue duikers feed on grasses and forbs(Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nOccasionally blue duikers feed on grasses and forbs(Smither\u00b4s 2000). Water requirements: One litre per day, not water dependent but will drink when water is available. (Du Toit 2002).\nGroup size:6 to10 animals. They sometimes found in small groups and pairs and are mainly solitary.\nReproduction: A single calf is born at any time of the year but mostly in summer. The gestation period is approximately 115 to 125 days (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nLife span: 6 years (Smither\u00b4s).\nPopulation grow/year: 15 to 30 percent (Bothma, Van Rooyen and Du Toit 2002).\nHome range:Because of their secluded habitat, the little is known of their habitat. Mostly nocturnal, they spend the day in the deepest parts of thickets. Secretions from their facial glands are used to mark territory (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nMinimum viable group size and sex ratio: 2 and 1 : 1 (ECOCAP).\nDescription: Both sexes carry the horns as a rule (though they may be absent in some females). The horns are short, straight, strongly ringed and point backwards. This is a very small antelope with dark, slately-grey coat, darker on the back where it has purplish gloss. The naked line of glands on the face is curved. The crest between the horns is short. The tail is bushy, dark brown above and white below. The blue duiker is the smallest of all the antelope in southern Africa.\nBlue wildebeest Connochaetes taurines\nHabitat requirements: The blue wildebeest shows a preference for open savanna woodland and open grassland. The access to drinking water is essential (Stuart and Stuart 2001).\nFood preference: The blue wildebeest is an essential grazer, showing preference for short green grass (Stuart and Stuart 2001). They prefer fresh growth less than 10 to 15 cm high and do not select for species or parts (Smither\u00b4s 2000). A blue wildebeest eats a mean of 3.7 kg of dry plant matter per day (Bothma, Van Rooyen, and Du Toit 2002).\nWater requirements: Access to drinking water is essential (Stuart and Stuart 2001). The blue wildebeest can survive without water by eating wild melons such as tsamas Citrullus lanatys (Smither\u00b4s 2000). The blue wildebeest requires 9 litres of water a day (Du Toit 2002).\nGroup size:12 to 30 (Smither\u00b4s 2000). (Up to thousands during migrations)\nReproduction: The mating season is usually from March to June, with most of the calves being born from mid-ovember to the end of December. A calf weighs about 22 kg and is born after a gestation period of approximately 250 days. The calf is able to run with the mother a few minutes after birth (Stuart and Stuart 2001). The calf is weaned after 8 months. Females have their first calf at 2 years and breed annually (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nLife span: 15 years (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nPopulation grow/year: 20 percent (Bothma, Van Rooyen and Du Toit 2002)\nHome range:The home range of a calf and cow in the Kalahari with no access to permanent water was 2700 km\u00b2, compared to 917 km\u00b2 for one with access to water. Home ranges are three times larger during droughts. Males have smaller home ranges than females, 38 to 420 km\u00b2 (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nMinimum viable group size and sex ratio: 12 and 1: 11 (ECOCAP).\nMinimum viable group size and sex ratio: 12 and 1: 11 (ECOCAP). Stocking density: Must not exceed 10 animals per 100 ha (ECOCAP).\nDescription: Both sexes carry the horns which sweep outwards and then sideways and upwards. Large, dark grey-brown animals with darker vertical stripes on neck, shoulders, and body, they have a dropping black mane along the back of the neck to the withers; a \u201cbeard\u201d below the chin, and a long, cow like black tail; sloping back, thin legs. Calves are reddish-brown, with shaggy coat and more or less upright horns.\nGeneral: Inquisitive animals, they will stand snorting, shaking their heads and whisking their tails before galloping off only to stop, wheel round and stare again.\nRecommendation: Blue wildebeest on Highlands Wilderness Game Ranch are already posing a threat of patch over-utilisation. Preferred areas within the herd\u2019s territory are being utilised intensively and are often similar to blesbok\u2019s preferred grazing spots. There are only a certain number of suitable habitat areas for blue wildebeest on the ranch and these areas are Sporobolous pyramadalis \u2013 Hyparrhenia hirta short closed grassland and Hyperrhenia filipendula \u2013 Eragrostis rigidior tall closed grassland sub-communities in management unit 1. The blue wildebeest does not depend on shade during the hot time of the day like most other game species.\nBurchell\u00b4s Zebra Equus burchelli\nHabitat requirements: The zebra is found on open woodland, shrub and grassland (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nFood preference: The zebra prefers short, green grass but will take readily take tall, coarse growth. They occasionally browse and will eat the fire-scorched leaves and twigs of mopane Colophospermum mopane. Being an unselective bulk feeder, zebras are less sensitive to food quality than other large herbivores and can maintain body condition on very poor forage (Smither\u00b4s 2000). The zebra eats a mean of 7.8 kg of dry plant matter a day (Bothma, Van Rooyen and Du Toit 2002).\nWater requirements: The zebra is strictly dependent on water and rarely moves more than 12 km away from it (Smither\u00b4s 2000). The zebra requires 12 litres of water a day (Du Toit 2002).\nGroup size: 4 to 6 (family unit) (Stuart and Stuart 2001).\nReproduction: A single foal with a mass of 30 to 34 kg is born in summer after a gestation period of 375 days (Stuart and Stuart 2001). A foal stands within 10 minutes, walks after half an hour and can run after an hour. They start eating grass within a few days and are weaned at 11 months (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nLife span: 35 years (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nPopulation grow/year:20 percent (Bothma, Van Rooyen and Du Toit 2002).\nHome range:Home ranges cover 110 to 220 km\u00b2 in Kruger National Park (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nMinimum viable group size and sex ratio: 7 and 1: 6 (ECOCAP).\nStocking density: Must not exceed 4 animals per 100 ha (ECOCAP).\nGeneral: Zebra leads the migratory succession by grazing on parts with very fibrous plant material. The zebra takes in large amounts of fibrous materials, and in doing so, the less fibrous plant material in the underlying layers of the herbaceous layers is exposed or given chance to grow. This provides better food for the wildebeest and other ruminants, which follow where zebra has been. In the end, the herbaceous layer is sufficiently exposed for the smaller ruminants which do not consume fibrous food stuffs (McNaughton 1976).\nRecommendation: On Highlands Wilderness Game Ranch, zebra should play a bigger part in the grazing ecology of the ranch. Zebra being bulk feeder, they can utilise coarse vegetation better than selective grazers. Their number should be kept low considering that zebra do consume large amount of coarse fodder (Furstenburg 2002c). During the study period, zebras were mostly sighted in management 5 and 4, which is suitable habitat. The amount of rainfall in Highlands Wildernis Game Ranch is most suitable for Burchell\u00b4s Zebra.\nEland Tragelaphus oryx\nHabitat requirements: prefer mesic to open savannas (Stuart and Stuart 2001).\nFood preference:The most important trees utilised by eland are Acacia species, Albizia harveyi, Colophospermum montane, Combretum apiculatum, Grewia species, Sclerocarya birrea, Terminalia sericia species, and Ximenia caffra. Grasses are preferred in the wet season. Preferred grass species are Chloris virgata, Schimidtia papphroides and Urochloa mosambicensis. Aristida species are utilised only seldom, eland also eat fruit and use their hooves to dig bulbs and tubers and their horns to break off branches (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nWater requirements: Eland requires 23 litres of water a day, not water dependent (Du Toit 2002).\nGroup size:20 individuals (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nReproduction: A single calf is born at any time of the year but mostly in spring. The gestation period is approximately 270 days. After 3 to 4 weeks in hiding the calf begins to follow the mother and joins the herd (Stuart and Stuart 2001). The calf is weaned at 6 to 9 months and females give birth for the first time when they are 2 years old (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nLife span: 15 years (Smither\u00b4s).\nPopulation grow/year: 20 to 35 percent (Bothma, Van Rooyen and Du Toit 2002).\nHome range:Elands usually gather in huge herds, sometimes associates with other species (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nMinimum viable group size and sex ratio: 12 and 1 : 6 (ECOCAP).\nMinimum viable group size and sex ratio: 12 and 1 : 6 (ECOCAP). Description: Both sexes carry the horns although those of the cows are slender and sometimes longer. This huge, cow like animal is the largest of all antelopes. The general colour is fawn, turning blue-grey with age. Juveniles and young cows have narrow, lighter vertical stripes. Eland have humped shoulders, a prominent dewlap, a black stripe along the back and a short mane. The ears are narrow and pointed. The tail is long and black-tufted. Bulls have a matt of dark hair on the forehead. The cows are smaller and more slightly built.\nRecommendation: The eland population on Highlands Wilderness Game Ranch is currently estimated to be at maximum number of animals that can be sustained. It is recommended that minimum ranch size to stock eland is 3000 ha (Furstenburg 2003). A small group of animals do occur on management unit 2 and 5. However, only small number of animals can be sustained in management unit 2 without degradation of the environment. According to the game ranch manager, the numbers of eland are increasing exponentially. Their numbers should be maintained at the recommended stocking densities, because they are in competition with Kudu, impala, springbok, and red hartebeest.\nGemsbok Oryx gazella\nHabitat requirements: The gemsbok occurs in arid areas northwest of the sub region, extending north into Angola (Stuart and Stuart 2001). They also occur in semi-arid open grassland and shrub open woodland penetrating into savanna woodland (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nFood preference:They are primarily grazers but will browse if grass is not available and dig for roots, bulbs and tubers. The gemsbok obtains minerals by eating soil and salt encrustations at water holes (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nWater requirements: The gemsbok can survive without surface water and eats tsama melons Citrullus lanatus and gemsbok cucumber Acanthosicyos naudianus for their water content (Smither\u00b4s 2000). The gemsbok requires 9 litres of water a day (Du Toit 2002).\nGroup size:8 to 15 animals (Stuart and Stuart 2001).\nReproduction: A single calf is born after a gestation period of approximately 264 days, usually in summer. The calf hides and will move with the mother at night to a new resting place. A calf is usually 3 to 6 weeks old before joining the rest of the herd (Stuart and Stuart 2001). Females are sexually mature at 2 years, males also at 2 years but they do not breed until 5 years old (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nLife span: 20 years (Bothma, Van Rooyen and Du Toit 2002).\nPopulation grow/year:25 percent (Bothma, Van Rooyen and Du Toit 2002).\nHome range:Mature bulls hold territories of 14 to 45 vertical m\u00b2 in the southern Kalahari. The female\u2019s ranges average 248 km\u00b2 in wet years and 1000 to 2750 km\u00b2 in droughts. Home ranges are smaller if permanent water is available (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nMinimum viable group size and sex ratio: 12 and 1 to 11 (ECOCAP).\nStocking density: Must not exceed 10 animals per 100 ha (ECOCAP).\nDescription: Both sexes carry the very long, straight and deeply-ridged horns. A large animal with a distinctive black and white face pattern. The neck and the body are a pale, fawn-grey. A narrow, vertical black stripe is visible down the throat and there is a slight dewlap. A broad black band separates the flank from the white belly and a dark spinal stripe widens at the rump to form a dark patch. The upper parts of the legs are black and the lower parts white. The tail is long and tufted. Females are similar but smaller with longer, more slender horns.\nGeneral: Calves are hidden by their mothers for some months before being brought back to join the herd. Calves are born with horns a few centimetres long.\nRecommendation: The habitat for gemsbok is marginally suitable on Highlands Wildernis Game Ranch. The minimum viable group size of at least 12 can be introduced. The management unit 2, 3, and 5 should not be considered for the introduction of gemsbok because of the habitat being mountainous and stony. Since sex differentiation is not that easy with gemsbok, sex ratios could easily be skewed without the management being aware. In such a case the reproduction rates would be inhibited and unnecessary deaths due to bulls fighting for dominance could occur.\nGiraffe Giraffa camelopardalis\nHabitat requirements: Dry savanna woodland.\nFood preference:Giraffes are browsers, only rarely eating grass. Their long necks and legs give them access to a food supply beyond a reach of all other browsers. Although they feed from a fairly wide range of trees and bushes they are very selective in what they eat. Twigs are pulled into the mouth by the lips and the long prehensile tongue, which may reach 45 cm in length, and the leaves are shredded of into the mouth. Between 15 and 20 hours of each day is spent feeding (Stuart and Stuart 2001).Acacia trees are the most important source of food (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nWater requirements: Independent of water if fresh green food is available (Smither\u00b4s 2000). The giraffe requires 40 litres of water a day (Du Toit 2002).\nGroup size:12 to 60 animals (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nReproduction: Calves weighing at about 100 kilogram may be born at any time of the year after a gestation period of 450 days. The newly born calf can stand and walk within an hour after birth but remains isolated from the herd for up to 3 weeks (Stuart and Stuart 2001). Social bonds between mother and calf persist past weaning until the next birth. Giraffe calves suffer heavy predation in their first year (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nLife span: Up to 20 years (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nPopulation grow/year:18 percent (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nHome range:Home ranges are about 25 km\u00b2 in the lowveld and 80-120 km\u00b2 in less productive areas (Smither\u00b4s 2000) .\nMinimum viable group size and sex ratio: 3 and 1 : 2 (ECOCAP).\nStocking density: Must not exceed 1 animal per 200 ha, minimal ranch size of 1500 ha (ECOCAP).\nRecommendation: Giraffe generally feed at height of between 2.5 and 5.5 m, thus not competing with other browsers. Stocking density should not exceed one animal per 200 ha. The available habitat on Highlands Wildernis Game Ranch, not more than two animals can be sustained on management unit 4.\nImpala Aepyceros melampus\nHabitat requirements: The impala occurs in open or light savanna woodland. They avoid grassland unless there is scattered bush cover (Stuart and Stuart 2001).\nFood preference:They prefer short grasses and browse and are very selective. The impala consumes also flowers, fruits, pods, bark and fallen leaves. 80 percent of feeding is below 40 centimetres (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nWater requirements: The impala is dependent on water (Smither\u00b4s 2000). The impala requires 2.5 litres of water a day (Du Toit 2002).\nWater requirements: The impala is dependent on water (Smither\u00b4s 2000). The impala requires 2.5 litres of water a day (Du Toit 2002). Group size:15 to 20 (sometimes 50-100) animals (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nReproduction: lambs are born in summer after a gestation period of 196 days. The lamb weighs 5 kg (Stuart and Stuart 2001). The lambs stay hidden for a day or two. The females have their first lamb at age 2. Males are sexually mature at 13 months, but do not breed until they are 4 to 5 years old (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nLife span:12 years (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nPopulation grow/year:35 percent (Bothma, Van Rooyen and Du Toit 2002).\nHome range: The range size of o herd varies from 2.5 to 7.0 km\u00b2, depending on veld condition and population density (Bothma, Van Rooyen and Du Toit 2002).\nMinimum viable groupsize and sex ratio: 24 and 3 : 21 (ECOCAP).\nStocking density: Must not exceed 12 animals per 100 ha (ECOCAP).\nDescription: Only the males carry the slender, graceful lyrate horns. Impala are the extremely graceful handsome, medium-sized antelopes with a glossy, bright rufous coat and a distinctly two tone side to their body, lighter below and becoming white on the under parts. The chin and the upper throat are white as is the rump which has two vertical black stripes. Above the hooves on the hind legs are characteristic black tufts of stiff hairs, hiding a scent gland. Females are more slightly built and unhorned.\nGeneral: impala are the finest jumpers of all antelopes; leaps of 10 metres long and more than 3 m high have been recorded. Young are able to stand almost immediately after birth and play within hours. After a day or two they join the herd.\nRecommendation: Impala is a very popular biltong and sport-hunting animal with high possibilities for venison production. On Highlands Wildernis Game Ranch impala make an important contribution by utilising a broad spectrum of the vegetation and plant types. Many of the shrubs utilised by impala are not utilised by other game species. Impala therefore, contribute to making the ranch\u2019s ecological system more productive.\nKudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros\nHabitat requirements:The kudu is an antelope of wooded savanna. They may occur in arid areas but only where there are stands of bush that provide cover and food. They do not occur in open grassland or forest. In many areas they show preference for rocky areas and acacia woodland (Stuart and Stuart 2001).\nFood preference:The kudu is a predominantly browser but does occasionally graze. They eat a wider variety of browse species than any other antelopes occurring in South Africa (Stuart and Stuart 2001). In Kruger National Park 148 species are eaten including aloes and euphorbias. Acacia and Combretum species are favoured (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nWater requirements:Independent of water as long as green food is available (Smither\u00b4s 2000). The kudu requires 9 litres of water a day (Du Toit 2002).\nGroup size:3 to 12 animals (Stuart and Stuart 2001 and Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nReproduction: Calves are born throughout the year but most births take place in the summer months. The kudu moves away from the herd to give birth to a single calf, which weighs about 16 kilogram. The gestation period is approximately 210 days. The calf hides for a few days until they are strong enough to keep up with the herd (Stuart and Stuart 2001). The calf is weaned at 6 months and horns start growing at 5 months. Males are sexually mature at 3 years and first breed at 6 years. Females first calve at 2 or 3 years (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nLife span: 15 years (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nPopulation grow/year: 20 to 30 percent (Bothma, Van Rooyen and Du Toit 2002).\nHome range:Kudu\u2019s are not territorial and have home ranges of 360 to 520 hectare in Kruger National Park. Bulls wander more widely than cows but return to a fixed core area (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nMinimum viable group size and sex ratio: 8 and 2 : 6 (ECOCAP).\nMinimum viable group size and sex ratio: 8 and 2 : 6 (ECOCAP). Stocking density: Must not exceed 4 animals per 100 ha (ECOCAP).\nDescription: Only the males carry the magnificent, spiral horns. Large, very elegent antelopes. The body colour is a bluish-grey to brownish-grey with 7 to 10 light, vertical stripes on sides, a white chevron between the eyes; a fringe down the neck and a bushy tail with a white underside. The female is smaller and has no horns.\nGeneral: Kudu run heavily and clumsily, showing the white underside of their bushy tails. They are very wary and when hiding in the shelter of a bush become almost invisible, only the flick of an ear giving their position.\nRecommendation: Kudu browse a wide range of plants but Acacia and Combretum species are favoured. It is advised that an area with as wide range of vegetation types as possible be provided as range area, which will ensure that kudu will have access to both deciduous and evergreen trees, grasses and forbs. This will ensure sufficient food availability during dormant periods when food is scarce. Kudu are prone to tannin poisoning during times of dry season, especially if the stocking density of an area is too high (Bothma 2002). Fence should be checked regularly because Kudu are powerful jumpers, they can clear normal fences\nNyala Tragelaphus angasii\nHabitat requirements: Thickets in savanna woodland, including forest patches on old termite hills, and dense riverine bush. Nyala benefit from shifting agriculture where abandoned fields and overgrazing cause bush encroachment (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nFood preference:Nyala browses and grazes according to seasonal and local availability of grass and broad-leaved plants. It takes a wide range of grass species and will eat both fresh and fallen leaves, shoots, fruit, flowers, and bark (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nWater requirements: Not dependent on water as long as there is green food (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nGroup size:Nyala are gregarious, with herd sizes varying from two to five, but with a mean size of 4.1 animals (Bothma et al. 2002).\nReproduction: Breeds throughout the year. Calves of 4.2 to 5.5 kg are born after a gestation period of 220 days. Females first lamb at 2 to 3 years (Smither\u00b4s 2000). The lamb remains hidden for up to 18 days before it follows the ewe around (Bothma et al.2002).\nPopulation grow/year: 20 to 30 percent (Bothma, Van Rooyen and Du Toit 2002).\nHome range:The ranges of males and females overlap, and may vary in size from 6.5 ha for adult females to 39 ha for adult males (Bothma et al. 2002).\nMinimum viable group size and sex ratio: 3 and 1 : 2 (ECOCAP).\nStocking density: Limited distribution (ECOCAP).\nDescription: Only the males carry the magnificent, lyre-shaped horns (black with ivory tips). The males are large, slender, and very narrow-bodied with a shaggy slate-coloured coat. The sides of the body have 8 to 14 vertical stripes (sometimes indistinct) and there are a number of white dots on the body, and a white chevron between the eyes. A thick crest on the neck and back may be raised when the animal is alarmed or afraid. There is a heavy fringe from under the chin down the neck and along under the body. Orange \u201csocks\u201d are found on the lower legs. The females are much smaller and have an orange-brown with a black stripe down the back. They have more distinct side stripes and spots and no chevron.\nGeneral: Young males may be confused with bushbuck, but the yellow \u201cstockings\u201d are distinctive.\nRecommendation: The nyala is aggressive and drive even large antelopes such as sable out of their habitat. This species is suitable for introduction onto Highlands Wildernis Game Ranch and is a valuable trophy, tourism and live sale animal. They form small herds of about 6 to 20 animals. Dense bush in management unit 3 is a suitable habitat for nyala.\nRed hartebeest Alcelaphus buselaphus\nHabitat requirements: The red hartebeest occurs in open grasslands and semi-arid bush savanna. They avoid denser woodland except when passing through (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nFood preference:The red hartebeest is a selective grazer and browser. They select for species and for leaf over stem (Smither\u00b4s 2000). They will also eat the seedpods of the camel-thorn Acacia erioloba. The red hartebeest is the first animal to lose physical condition when the veld deteriorates (Bothma, Van Rooyen and Du Toit).\nWater requirements: Drinking water is not essential but will drink when water is available. If not the red hartebeest eats melons and digs for tubers (Stuart and Stuart 2001 and Smither\u00b4s 2000). The red hartebeest requires 5.5 litres of water a day (Du Toit 2002).\nGroup size:Up to 20 (larger groups up to thousands during migration) (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nReproduction: A single calf is born away from the herd, after a gestation period of approximately 240 days. The calves are born usually in early summer. They remain hidden until it is strong enough to keep up with the other animals (Stuart and Stuart 2001). The calf starts grazing at 2 weeks and is weaned at 7 to 8 months. Cows first calve when they are 3 years old (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nLife span: 15 to 16 years (Smither\u00b4s 2000). \u00b7\nPopulation grow/year: 20 percent (Bothma, Van Rooyen and Du Toit 2002).\nHome range:Females have home ranges of 320 km\u00b2 and males 230 km\u00b2. The home ranges are five times bigger during droughts (Smither\u00b4s 2000). \u00b7\nMinimum viable group size and sex ratio: 10 and 1 : 9 (ECOCAP).\nDescription: Both sexes carry heavily-ridged horns which are V-shaped when viewed from the front, but which curve forwards, outwards and then sharply back. It is a large, high shouldered, awkward looking animal with a long, narrow face accentuated by the dark, vertical blaze and the horny pedicle on the top ot the head from which the horns emerge. The coat is glossy reddish-brown, with dark marks on the legs and tail.\nRecommendation: Red hartebeest could have a valuable contribution to the ecological system on Highlands Wildernis Game Ranch since they are mixed feeders and are very adaptable to a wide range of veld types. It is a low impact grazer of intermediate, more roughage type of grass species (Fursrenburg 2003d). Red hartebeest will not necessary compete with other selective feeders like blesbok and wildebeest.\nReedbuck Redunca arundinum\nHabitat requirements: Tall grass cover or reedbeds are preferred but not open veld or bush encroached areas. Cover is a vital habitat requirement (Stuart and Stuart 2001).\nFood preference: Reedbuck is a mixed feeder, and almost exclusively a grazer. It will also eat small quantities of herbs when grasses such as Panicum maximum, Heteropogon contortus, Chloris gayana and Cenchrus ciliaris are not available. They are primarily nocturnal, but will feed diurnally when conditions are harsh (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nWater requirements: Drinking water is not essential but will drink when water is available. (Du Toit 2002).\nGroup size:20 individuals with a master ram, females and immature (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nReproduction: After a gestation period of 225 days a single young is born. Young lie up for up to 3 months and therefore cover is essential habitat requirement. Males are usually mature at 2 years and the females can conceive first at between 15 and 18 months of age (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nLife span: 8 to 9 years (Smither\u00b4s).\nPopulation grow/year: 20 to 35 percent (Bothma, Van Rooyen and Du Toit 2002). \u00b7\nHome range:Reedbuck is very territorial and can be found in monogamous occupying a home range which the male defends against any other males. The male advertises the territory with his \u201crocking horse\u201d canter and \u201cproud\u201d posture display. Although not gregarious, reedbucks do form pairs or family pairs that may aggregate when habitat conditions are locally limiting. Females leave the family in the second year after they reached maturity, but the male live till third year (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nMinimum viable group size and sex ratio: 4 and 1 : 3 (ECOCAP). \u00b7\nDescription: Only the males carry the horns which are nearly straight and vertical, parallel to each other and ringed only at the base. This is a small antelope with a rust coloured coat and slender neck. The ears are very long, pointed, and narrow. The underside is hardly paler. The tail is short, bushy and has a white underside. The female is similar but slightly smaller and unhorned.\nRecommendation: The habitat on management unit 3 and 4 is suitable for reintroducing more reedbuck according to ecological capacity. The species is considered good for trophy hunting, and increasing species number could be considered where higher species diversity is sought.\nSable antelope Hippotragus niger\nHabitat requirements: Sable antelope prefer open savannas with scattered low shrubs bordering vleis, medium to tall grassland. It is never found far from water (Stuart and Stuart 2001).\nFood preference:Sable antelope prefer grass that is 80 to 140 mm tall. Of the sable antelope prefer grass species only Panicum maximum and Brachiaria nigropedata, Eragrostis jeffreyi, Themeda triandra and Urochloa bolbodes. However, sable antelope occasionally feed on browse. (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nWater requirements: Sable antelope requires 9 litres of water a day (Du Toit 2002).\nGroup size:7 to 9 animals are recommended if kept in a 200 hectare camp (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nReproduction: A single calf is born at any time of the year but mostly in summer. The gestation period is approximately 270 to 280 days. After 3 to 4 weeks in hiding the calf begins to follow the mother and joins the herd (Stuart and Stuart 2001). The calf is weaned at 6 to 9 months and females give birth for the first time when they are 2 years old (Smither\u00b4s 2000). \u00b7\nLife span: 11 years (Smither\u00b4s).\nPopulation grow/year: 15 to 25 percent (Bothma, Van Rooyen and Du Toit 2002).\nHome range: Sable live in herds, usually of between 10 and 40, led by a master bull, accompanied by females, young and immature animals. Bulls often become solitary or form small parties (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nMinimum viable group size and sex ratio: 6 and 2 : 4 (ECOCAP).\nDescription: Both sexes carry the large, ridged horns which rise upwards and sweep backwards in a pronounced curve. Horns in the female are smaller and much less curved. This is a large antelope with conspicuous black and white head markings. The general colour of the males is a glossy black with white under parts, and a mane of stiff hairs. The ears are big and narrow, white inside and not tufted. The females are paler than the males, tinged with a dark chestnut colour, and the calves are fawn-coloured.\nRecommendation: Sable antelope are very expensive, as well as being very sensitive towards their environment. Sable antelopes are sought after photographic, trophy and live sale animals. For breeding purposes it is advised to keep the animals in smaller enclosure under semi-intensive conditions. Increased parasite load and therefore, increased risk of disease with the confinement of the animals in camps has to be kept in mind. Sable antelopes will chew on bones and ingest soil to obtain minerals (Apps 1996). Supplementary feeding should therefore be provided. Sable antelope are especially susceptible to anthrax. Transport permits are required. This animal species is considered suitable for introduction, either as free roaming or for intensive breeding purposes on either management unit on Highlands Wildernis Game Ranch. For free roaming purposes it is recommended that a breeding herd of approximately 5 to 10 females and two males (breeding bull and sub-adult) be introduced from a similar area. Combining two different groups of females in the same area is dangerous as alpha females from two different groups could fight and inflict serious wounds on each other and could even kill one another. The same could happen if two adult breeding bulls are introduced into the same area without enough space to range away from each other. These bulls could easily kill one another with serious financial implications.\nWaterbuck Kobus ellipsiprymnus\nHabitat requirements: The waterbuck is associated with water and prefers areas with reed beds and tall grass as well as woodland. They will utilise open grassland adjacent to cover (Stuart and Stuart 2001).\nFood preference:The waterbuck is mainly a grazer with a preference for long grass. They sometimes browse when the grass is low in protein (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nWater requirements: The waterbuck requires 9 litres of water a day (Du Toit 2002).\nGroup size:6 to 12 animals (up to 30) (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nReproduction: A single calf is born at any time of the year but mostly in summer. The gestation period is approximately 280 days. After 3 to 4 weeks in hiding the calf begins to follow the mother and joins the herd (Stuart and Stuart 2001). The calf is weaned at 6 to 9 months and females give birth for the first time when they are 2 years old (Smither\u00b4s 2000). \u00b7\nLife span: 11 years (Smither\u00b4s).\nPopulation grow/year: 13.4 percent (Bothma, Van Rooyen and Du Toit 2002).\nHome range:Male territories vary from 90 hectare to 660 hectare. Nursery herds have home ranges overlapping male territories (Smither\u00b4s 2000).\nMinimum viable group size and sex ratio: 6 and 2 : 4 (ECOCAP).\nDescription: Only the malescarry the imposing, heavily-ridged horns which rise base. This is a large, level-backed antelope with a coarse, greyish-brown coat, marked by a characteristic white ring round the rump. Waterbuck have white markings around the eyes, muzzle and throat. The tail is moderately long with a black tip. The cow, with its long, floppy ears and no horns looks almost mule-like.\nRecommendation: On Highlands Wildernis Game Ranch, waterbuck can serve a very important ecological role since it preferred different vegetation types that occur on the ranch. Waterbuck is a popular after trophy and tourism species and are as popular on live sales \u2013 especially trophy animals. Waterbuck are adaptable to various savanna habitats as long as ample water is available. They generally do not mind grazing in the mountain slopes near streams or dams where they prefer longer more nutritious grasses. If fed, they become very tame and become very popular on photographic safaris in game ranches. Warthogs and their young ones were not introduced in the ranch but are present in the game ranch. Habitat requirement for warthogs is open savannas, grasslands, vleis and flood plains with short heavily utilised grass. The boar has four facial warts, two beneath the eyes and two above the mouth. The two warts beneath the eyes can be up to 120 millimetres long beneath the eyes. Two small, lower vestigial warts may occur in the sow, but this is rare. The tusk of an old sow curves further around the snout than those of an old boar. Warthogs are mostly selective grazers, preferring short, tufted or stoloniferous grasses, but also eat roots and bulbs, especially in the dry season. They dig extensively for the rhizomes of the grasses. These animals are well known of crawling underneath or through the fence and cause potential escape route for valuable animals. Porcupines are common on Highlands Wildernis game ranch (about three pairs plus their immature offspring). Most Burkea africana saplings bear porcupine feeding scars 2 to 5 cm in diameter just above the root collar. Porcupines preferentially eat the basal bark of young specimens of Dombeya rotundifolia, Burkea Africanaand to a lesser extent, Terminalia sericea in the late dry season.\nDarting the Giraffe\nWhile we had the chopper there for the game count we arranged with Marius (the Vet) to do the honours and play it safe on the Giraffe.\nFor those wondering how it works:\nFirstly the medication needs to taken from the ice packs and injected into the darts used.\nThe rifle has a normal .22 bolt rifle base, but the bullets used are actually ballistic charges (A green one for the Hilty people). As the shot is fired the gasses from the ignition feeds up into a second barrel on top of the normal one where it uses the gas power to blow out the dart. The green barb to the tip of the dart acts to let the dart stay on the skin of the animal for a short while. In doing so the shooter can see if and where the dose has been delivered. The impact of the shot uses the momentum of the shot to execute the injection.\nLoading the rifle therefor implies 2 loads. One in shotgun style to add the dart on top and the second a normal bolt action to load the ballistic charge. A range finder scope is uses.\nSix giraffe in four minutes speaks of professional practice!\nI looked the giraffe up the next day and they were merrily munching away and they were not spooked at all.\n10/10 for this round \ud83d\ude42"}

Typically it takes place around the end of the year in November or December.\nFollowing a successful mating the female will find a spot on the sandy bank of their river home and dig a hole which may be up to 50cm (19.7in) deep. Once this nest site is established the female will use the same site each year. In to this hole she will deposit anywhere between 16 and 80 eggs. These are then covered over with sand.\nThe female remains by the nest to guard against predators while the eggs incubate. This process takes around 90 days and depending on the temperature at which the eggs incubate the hatchlings will either be male or female. Females are produced in cooler weather and males in warmer periods.\nJust before they are ready to hatch the hatchlings will start to call. At this point the female will dig them up and if any eggs have difficulty hatching she will place them gently in the mouth to crack them open.\nWhile females work to defend the nest they must return to the water at times to cool off. When they do this opportunistic scavengers such as hyenas and lizards may eat the eggs.\nOnce the crocodiles emerge from the nest the mother will gather them in her mouth and carry them to the water.\nAfter entering the water the crocodiles will spend the next 6-8 weeks swimming together for safety before starting to disperse.\nSexual maturity is tied to size and can be reached at different ages. Males reach maturity at 3.1m (10.2ft) while females reach this at 2.6m (8.5ft).\nBehaviour\nWhen Nile crocodiles are warm they will sit on the banks of a river with an open mouth. This open mouth will help lose the excess heat through the mouth lining.\nNile crocodiles have a social structure with larger individuals being more dominant. In times where they hunt together the most dominant crocodile will take the most food.\nA group of crocodiles is known as a Bask, Congregation, Float, or Nest.\nIf their water source drys up the Nile crocodile may move to a new water source or estivate. To estivate they dig a hole in the wet mud on the banks which then drys around them and helps to protect from extreme temperatures. In this time they will not eat or drink. Once it rains they will emerge.\nNile crocodiles are capable of walking on land and they stand up on their legs to achieve this. While mostly slow they are capable of reaching 15km/h (9mph) for short periods."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Brachiosaurus: Facts About the Giraffe-like Dinosaur", "url": "https://www.livescience.com/25024-brachiosaurus.html", "text": "Brachiosaurus was an unusual dinosaur that lived 155.7 million to 150.8 million years ago during the mid- to late Jurassic Period. Specimens have been found primarily in the fossil-rich Morrison Formation in North America, but the dinosaur did not resemble any of the others that roamed the region. Its long neck made it look like a giraffe, and its forelegs were longer than its hind legs. The name Brachiosaurus, in fact, means \"arm lizard.\"\nBrachiosaurus was likely a warm-blooded animal. Some models suggest Brachiosaurus and other sauropods (long-necked dinosaurs) were gigantotherms \u2014 animals whose enormous size allowed them to keep high body temperatures. Calculations based on this theory indicate a body temperature of up to 113 degrees Fahrenheit (45 degrees Celsius) for Brachiosaurus. In 2011, however, researchers were able to directly calculate the dinosaur's temperature to be 100.8 F (38.2 C), by measuring the ratios of certain isotopes (atoms of elements with a different number of neutrons) in Brachiosaurus teeth. The study, published in the journal Science, suggests Brachiosaurus had behavioral or bodily mechanisms to keep cool despite their large size, such as having a lower metabolism during adulthood.\nIt's unclear just how large Brachiosaurus really was because most size estimates for the dinosaur come from fossils of what was thought to be its African form, B. brancai. But in a 2009 study in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, paleontologist Michael Taylor reanalyzed the fossils of B. brancai and B. altithorax (the North American species), and determined that B. brancai should belong to its own genus, reclassifying it as Giraffatitan brancai. Taylor later estimated that B. altithorax was about 82 feet (25 meters) long, though the dinosaur may be even larger than this, as the fossils of both G. brancai and B. altithorax came from specimens that weren't fully grown. Additionally, Brachiosaurus may have weighed about 62 tons (56 metric tons), according to 2014 study in the journal PLOS Biology.\nAt the time of its discovery in 1903, Brachiosaurus was declared the largest dinosaur ever, but other sauropods are now believed to have been bigger and heavier than Brachiosaurus.\nPaleontologists once believed that Brachiosaurus lived mostly in the water, due partly to its nostrils being at the top of its egg-shaped head. But this likely was not the case for several reasons. For one thing, sauropods had air-filled pockets inside their bodies, which would have made them quite buoyant and unstable if they entered deep water, according to a 2004 study in the journal Biology Letters.\nInstead, Brachiosaurus and other sauropods stuck to land, and probably even preferred flat land due to the high energetic cost of climbing hills with their incredibly large bodies, according to a 2014 study in the Journal of Theoretical Biology. \"They're not going to climb hills unless by climbing it they are accessing a really good source of energy,\" said study co-author David Wilkinson, a biologist at Liverpool John Moores University in the United Kingdom, who adds that the energetic cost is only part of the story. \"Clearly, a big animal on steep ground is more likely to fall over and lose its footing.\"\nUnlike most other other sauropods, Brachiosaurus had long forelimbs that caused its back to incline. If its neck exited its body in a fairly straight line, as is currently believed, this would have resulted in it pointing upwards, though the exact angle and flexibility of its neck continues to be debated.\nBrachiosaurus Skeletal Reconstruction (Image credit: \u00a9 Scott Hartman / All rights reserved)\nWhat did Brachiosaurus eat?\nThe dinosaur's skull had a wide muzzle and thick jawbones that housed spoon-shaped teeth, which were perfectly suited for stripping vegetation.\nBrachiosaurus probably fed on coniferous trees, gingkoes and cycads. Adult sauropods, including Brachiosaurus, likely had to eat up to 400 kilograms (880 pounds) of dry plant matter every day, according to a 2008 study in the Proceeding of the Royal Society B. Scientists believe that Brachiosaurus swallowed vegetation whole, as its teeth were suited to stripping vegetation but not breaking up large chunks of plants.\nBrachiosaurus are thought to have traveled in herds, moving on after they had exhausted the vegetation in a particular area. While it is believed that they stripped trees of their vegetation (\"high browsing\"), it is likely that they supplemented their diets with vegetation at lower levels (\"low browsing\"), especially as the food supply dwindled.\nIn 2011, Wilkinson and his colleague Graeme Ruxton sought to determine if low browsing was an energetically attractive option for sauropods, as it would have allowed them to feed on a larger swath of food without needing to move their whole body to a new area. For Brachiosaurus, with its approximately 30-foot (9-meter) long neck, low browsing reduces the overall cost of foraging by 80 percent, compared with dinosaurs with shorter necks, according to their study in the journal Biology Letters.\nHowever, this doesn't necessarily mean the dinosaurs were dedicated to low browsing instead of (or in addition to) high browsing. \"It's very difficult to figure out if they are high browsers or low browsers,\" a determination that would likely require soft-tissue analysis, Wilkinson said.\nUnlike its portrayal in the movie \"Jurassic Park,\" paleontologists do not believe that Brachiosaurus could rear up on its hind legs. In an analysis published in \"Biology of the Sauropod Dinosaurs (opens in new tab)\" (Indiana University Press, 2011), paleontologist Heinrich Mallison argued that, compared with other sauropods, the odd body shape and limb lengths of Brachiosaurus made this feat difficult and very energetically costly.\nResearchers using a laser to create a 3D copy of the Berlin Brachiosaurus skeleton. (Image credit: Bill Sellers)\nFossil finds\nThe first Brachiosaurus (B. altithorax) fossil was found in Grand River Valley in western Colorado in 1900. The paleontologist who discovered this partial skeleton, Elmer Riggs, named this new find Brachiosaurus in 1903.\nBrachiosaurus is one of the rarer sauropods of the Morrison Formation. Interestingly, though Riggs may have identified the new dinosaur species, his find was technically not the first discovery of a Brachiosaurus fossil. In 1883, Othniel Marsh discovered a Brachiosaurus skull near Garden Park, Colorado, which he thought belonged to his \"Brontosaurus\" (Apatosaurus) skeleton. It wasn't until 1998 that scientists correctly identified it as a Brachiosaurus skull (though the exact species is unknown).\nAdditional remains of the giraffe-like dinosaur have been discovered in several sites in North America, including Utah, Oklahoma, Wyoming and Colorado.\nKim Ann Zimmermann contributed to this article.\nLearn about Brachiosaurus, the Jurassic-era giant planet-eating dinosaur.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Pig Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Pig-facts.html", "text": "pig Facts\nPortrait of a Pig\nOne of the most useful pig facts is that pigs do not have many sweat glands, so the term \"sweats like a pig\" is quite inaccurate! All pigs and pig species are descended from a rabbit-sized, plant-eating creature called diacodexis, which could be found about 50 million years ago throughout Europe, Asia and North America.\nToday, there are 10 different species of pigs that can be found on every continent except Antarctica, including the amazing looking warthog found in Africa, and the wild boar, also known as the Eurasian wild pig, found throughout much of Europe and Southern Asia.\nThe domestic pig is a direct descendant of the wild boar, and they can still inter-breed. Among domestic pigs there are about 80 different breeds, most developed for their meat.\nDomestic pig species range in size from about 60 pounds full grown, to over 2,000 pounds, and everything in between. There are even species being bred for extreme small size, called \"mini\" or \"micro pigs\", claimed to only reach 30 or 40 pounds full grown.\nPigs were domesticated between 9,000 and 12,000 years ago in the Middle East and China. Theoretically, wild boars, which will eat practically anything, were attracted to the garbage created from human settlements. Domestication most likely occurred within communities that were permanent and not nomadic, because pigs, unlike goats and cattle, are not herd animals, and can be difficult to move from place to place.\nVietnamese potbelly piglets\nPigs live in large social groups and enjoy close interaction. When first introduced they will fight for social status, which is usually established within a few minutes or hours. Pigs in the wild are most active at dawn and dusk, and may even be somewhat nocturnal.\nPigs don't ruminate and don't chew cud like cows. They have a single chambered stomach, and require more nutrition than just a grass or hay diet can provide. They will graze on grasses, but they also forage for fungi, tubers, bulbs, vegetables, and an assortment of small insects, reptiles and animals. They search through soil, mud and sand, using their blunt, disc-shaped snout to dig.\nThey do not actively hunt, but will eat carrion when available, and are opportunistic predators, killing and eating young, small, or injured animals they may come upon, up to and including animals as large as young deer. Feral pig species in Australia have been reported to persue and consume small animals, particularly lambs.\nThe pig has a reputation for gluttony, sloth and uncleanliness, but if given free range they are active creatures that spend hours and walk long distances in search of food stuffs.\nWallowing in mud is something all pig species enjoy, when the opportunity presents itself, but many pigs live in forest and even near-desert conditions and may go for days without doing so. Wallowing can help regulate body temperature, since pigs can't sweat, but the mud can also act as a sun screen, and a layer of dried mud may reduce bug bites and also remove ticks and other parasites.\npigs are not smarter than dogs\nDespite wide-spread reports, pigs are not \"smarter\" than chimps, dolphins, 3 year olds and dogs.\nThe source of this suggestion seems to be a study that was done in 1997 by Dr. Stanley Curtis, who ran the department of Dairy and Animal Science at Penn State University. His research addressed practical problems with the care of livestock, but he focused mainly on pigs, which he admitted to being very fond of. Like Temple Grandin, many of his behavior-based approaches were responsible for improved animal equipment and facility designs, and a better quality of life for many farm animals.\nThe study in question involved whether pigs could use a joystick, manipulated with the snout, to maneuver a cursor on a computer screen. One or more perimeters of the screen would turn blue, and when the pigs moved the cursor into the blue area they received a treat. Only 2 pigs were used in the experiment, and Dr. Curtis himself stated that \"the pigs are still far from being very accurate, but the work is promising. If the animals reliably develop the use of this system, down the road I think some really interesting stuff could be coming out of this.\"\nChimps, bonobos and other apes have been taught to play a variety of actual video games, including Pacman, and will happily play without any food rewards, and with a full understanding of the rules. But anyone who actually believes pigs are as smart as chimps needs to take a look at some of the evidence of chimp intelligence, which is boundless.\nAs for pig intelligence rivaling that of a chimp or a dolphin, there simply is no evidence.\nCheck out this peer-reviewed paper, which sites numerous studies.\nThough it is often quoted that \"pigs recognize themselves in mirrors\", there is absolutely no evidence of this, no study that indicates this, and no individual video evidence to support the claim.\nIf you take a look at the experiments that are supposed to prove that \"pigs use mirrors to find food that they otherwise can't see\", you will find that the food bowls can in fact be seen, if the pig peeks around the wall, and of course, simply follows its nose.\nYes, pigs can be trained to respond to humans pointing gestures. This was proved fairly conclusively in a 2015 study involving 30 piglets, which is a very reasonable number of subjects. However, researchers found that \"the domestic pigs we used in this experiment did not seem to share the spontaneous abilities of dogs to follow the human pointing gesture to find a hidden reward\"\nDogs not only understand pointing gestures without special training, they also demonstrate numerous other qualities considered markers of intelligence. Take a guide-dog for example.\nWhen trained to guide the blind, dogs must use their ability to generalize as they apply the skills they learned. In other words, they are trained to safely guide someone across an intersection, and then must apply that skill to hundreds of different intersections during the course of their very productive lives. And they do, every day.\nGuide dogs also have to learn to look up, for obstacles that might impact their human, and in doing so must understand the concept of scale, the art of anticipation. Think about that. Once they detect an obstacle, they must solve the problem by re-charting a safe course, and they may accomplish all of this in the middle of a bustling street, with hundreds of distracting sights, sounds and smells.\nAnd although pigs have been used by truffle farmers for years to lead them to the hidden fungus, dogs are now the animal most often employed for the task.\nI have personally worked with and handled domestic pigs in a farm situation, pet pigs in households, and one wild boar that had been bottle-fed as a newborn and had appeared in numerous movies and commercials. The boar, named Jonnie, was quite bright, knew his name, would stay on a spot and move on queue, would squeal on command and would play dead with just a hand signal. He was 100% housebroken, and was a very affectionate and thoroughly pleasant animal. He wasn't even close to being \"smarter\" than a dog, in my humble opinion, in fact, I've known horses, parrots and goats that were at least as intelligent.\nMost of the insistence that pigs are smarter than dogs seems to be an attempt to save them from being eaten, and the headlines are just rehashed without any independent verification of the statements.\nRidiculous headlines like \"9 ways a pig is smarter than your honor student\" found in the Huffington Post. Absurd, completely unsubstantiated claims like \"pigs outperform 3-year-old human children on cognition tests and are smarter than any domestic animal, and animal experts consider them more trainable than cats or dogs\" - a statement quoted as \"fact\" on PETA's website, and which appears at the top of Google searches on the subject.\nNot wanting these awesome animals to come to harm is perfectly understandable - we love pigs too - but when you create and disseminate misinformation as fact, you may jeopardize your chances of being taken seriously on more important issues.\nIt is astonishing the number of videos, newspaper articles and even documentaries that make these claims, with no evidence, and no independent verification whatsoever. So I repeat -\nPigs are NOT smarter than dolphins. Pigs are NOT smarter than chimps. Pigs are NOT smarter than dogs.\nhandsome pig\npig lifestyle\nPigs are social, adaptable, and will eat virtually anything. In fact, throughout China people once employed something called a \"pig toilet\" which delivered human feces straight to the pig pen for consumption.\nPigs are also called hogs and swine, and anything associated with pigs is often referred to as \"porcine\".\nPigs have large heads, short necks, barrel-shaped bodies and strangely slender legs. The tail can be straight and held high as in the warthog, or curled and held close to the rump as in most domestic pigs, but the most distinctive feature of the pig is its remarkable snout.\nPigs spend the bulk of their time rooting and foraging for food, which involves them digging in mud, soil and sand for anything edible. The pig has a highly specialized nose just for this purpose. The muzzle ends in a blunted upper lip which is a flexible disc encircling the two nostrils. The disc is made of cartilage and is covered with skin that has a high density of tactile receptors. The nose is also strengthened by the prenasal bone, and can dig right into soil, moving rocks and roots out of the way with ease.\nIn addition to excavating, the nose can detect odors up to 7 miles away, and also scents hidden deep within the ground. Pigs may smell something tasty 3 feet deep, and dig it up in a matter of minutes.\nThe ability of pigs to smell through soil encouraged the Israeli military to try to train them to sniff out landmines. The project failed, and the pigs were replaced by giant African pouched rats.\nSpecial pigs known as \"truffle hogs\", were also employed in France and Italy to sniff out truffles, a rare and expensive mushroom that can sell for $4,000 a pound. Amazingly, truffles produce a scent that mimics the sex hormones of a boar, so female pigs are used to find them.\nSmelling like something that a pig wants to find insures the truffles survival, because they need to be eaten by the pig and then spread about in the pigs feces to reproduce. This is a process called mycophagy.\nBut lady pigs aren't the only ones that find the scent of truffles intoxicating, it is said to be an aphrodisiac for people too. In the last few decades, dogs have started to replace pigs in the task of truffle hunting, because the pigs were quite reluctant to give up what they found.\nPigs are so driven to dig around and search their surroundings that they can get depressed without a stimulating environment. Farmers provide them with straw to shovel through which reduces their stress levels and provides them with hours of interesting activity.\nPigs are extremely vocal while they root about, and have a vast vocabulary of snorts, grunts and squeals. Mothers have specific calls for piglets, pigs make special noises when being fed, while resting together, or while waiting to come in or go outside. They communicate with eachother constantly, and may call to eachother across distances of miles if separated.\nThe squeal of a pig is said to be almost as loud as a jet engine, and people who work with them in large quantities sometimes wear ear protection to prevent hearing loss.\npig!\npig facts on reproduction\npig mother and baby\nPigs are social animals that live in groups called sounders. A sounder is made up of several mother pigs and their offspring, which may stay with the sounder for life, or in the case of males, will leave in a few years to live alone or in a bachelor group.\nAdult males, called boars, generally join the sounder for a few days at a time when females are in season. Female pigs, called sows, or gilts if they are under a year old and have not been bred, have an estrus cycle of about 25 days, and are capable of having 2 complete litters a year.\nMost large hoofed mammals, like horses, cows, and deer, have only one offspring, sometimes twins, but pigs have large litters of piglets, averaging between 6 and 12.\nThe female is pregnant for about 115 days and gives birth, also called \"farrowing\", lying down, in a nest that she prepares a day before. Piglets are precocious, born with eyes open, stand and walk within minutes, and may leave the family to relieve themselves in the appropriate corner at just a few hours old.\nPiglets have \"assigned teating\" - the first teat they start with will be the one that they always use, and they will fight to get back to it. This is an advantage to piglets at the first 3 or 4 rows of teats, because they actually have the most milk.\nThere are almost always one or two runts in the litter, and they may be pushed aside by their siblings, which may make their condition worse.

Habitat loss and fragmentation, coupled with poaching, have mostly driven the decline, but because there have been no long-term conservation efforts, it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s really happening.\nMaking matters worse, scientists know very little about giraffe behavior: how they live, the space they need to survive, where they move, and even why their necks are so long. (See 14 incredible pictures of giraffes.)\nAccording to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, all giraffe belong to a single species, which are divided into nine subspecies. But a study published in 2016 challenges his notion, suggesting there may be four distinct species, each of which live in a different part of Africa.\nIf that\u2019s the case, the northern and reticulated giraffe species may each have fewer than 10,000 individuals left on Earth.\nKnown for their unmistakable patterned hides, reticulated giraffe live predominantly in northern Kenya, with some remnant populations possibly living in southern Ethiopia and Somalia. The reticulated giraffe has dropped in number by 80 percent in recent decades due to habitat destruction and poaching. (Related: \"Giraffes, Zebras Face Surprising Top Threat: Hunting.\")\nDavid O'Connor, a conservation ecologist with San Diego Zoo Global; Julian Fennessy, executive director of the Namibia-based Giraffe Conservation Foundation; and the Northern Rangelands Trust, a group of northern Kenyan community conservancies and The Nature Conservancy are all working to untangle the mystery behind their rapid decline.

During the recent fieldwork, Kenyan Wildlife Service veterinarian Mathew Mutinda darted the shoulder or hindquarters of a reticulated giraffe from both a car and a helicopter. As the drug took effect, the giraffe would start \"high-stepping\"\u2014resembling the movements of a Lipizzaner stallion. Four men would then quickly and quietly run a rope around the giraffe's legs to bring it down safely. After about 10 minutes, the experts would attach the trackers and release the animal.\nThese GPS trackers will gain critical insight into reticulated giraffes' preferred habitat, their home ranges, and more.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Buffalo Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Buffalo-facts.html", "text": "Buffalo Facts\nPortrait of an American Buffalo\nThe American buffalo is one of the icons of the United States of America and, along with the bald eagle, can be found depicted on various coins and flags throughout the nations history.\nIn recent times it is considered by some to be more accurate to refer to the New World buffalo as a bison, since it is not in the same genus as the two buffalo of the Old World.\nThe argument is debatable however, because the old world buffalo do not share a genus either, and there is a fourth animal called the gaur or \"Indian bison\", which belongs in yet another separate genus, with different lineage.\nThe fact is, there is little confusion in identifying the animal, particularly when the term \"American buffalo\" is used, and just as we commonly say \"dog\" and \"cat\" instead of \"Canine\" and \"feline\", the common term should not be considered incorrect.\nThe animal has been referred to as a \"buffalo\" - which is a form of a French word \"boeuff\", simply meaning \"large cow\", and from which the word \"beef\" also comes - throughout its history, and the word \"buffalo\" has been used in reference to the American animal as far back as 1635.\nThe American buffalo is not found to be referred to as a bison until 1774. When people speak of the American bison and the American buffalo they refer to the same animal.\nThere is a European bison as well, that, although separated by oceans, looks very much like the American bison or buffalo, and is basically considered to be the same animal.\nThe Old World \"buffaloes\" are the Cape buffalo of Africa, and the domesticated water buffalo of Asia. The most obvious difference is that they lack the thick, woolly fur of the American buffalo, and are usually black in color.\nThe horn shape is different as well, with the Old World buffaloes having longer horns that curve back in towards each other.\nFinally, all of these animals are bovines from the subfamily bovinae, which are all basically cow-like animals with cloven hooves and multi-chambered stomachs.\nThe American buffalo once numbered over 65 million strong across almost the entire continent of North America. By the end of the 1800's their numbers were reduced to a few hundred.\nNow, with organized conservation efforts, the number of wild bison roaming the open range is about 16,000, and there are close to 500,000 individuals living in large, privately owned herds.\nnative americans and the american buffalo\nThe American bison or American buffalo once roamed the continent of North America in such mass, that a galloping herd would leave a black swathe of trodden soil in its wake.\nNative people, particularly the Dakota, Lakota and Nakota Sioux, were indebted to the buffalo for their very lifestyle. These tribes followed the buffalo and planned each year around the migrating herds.\nThey hunted buffalo in several fascinating ways.\nBefore they had horses, they would drape themselves in wolf hides and crawl close enough to use a bow and arrow. This technique worked only with herds of \"bachelor\" males who did not fear wolves. The Indians found they could approach within yards of the herd when wearing wolf skins which hid their scent, where the buffalo would flee if they caught the scent of the Indians approaching. Herds with females and youngsters were wary of wolves and could not be hunted with this technique.\nIndians in the Dakotas employed a very dramatic hunting style, which involved stampeding a buffalo herd over a cliff. This was called a \"buffalo jump\" and there is a particular site in South Dakota where thousands of buffalo bones and hundreds of Indian arrowheads can be found at the foot of a steep cliff.\nThe native Americans had great respect for the buffalo, and some believed in a deity with the head of a buffalo called Tatanka. The word was also used as the word for buffalo in many Sioux native American societies.\nIn the mid 1800's the United States Government attempted to wipe out the buffalo, not because they wanted to be rid of buffalo, but because they wanted to wipe out the Indians.\nBecause of the plains Indians dependency on the buffalo for their survival, the animals were hunted down by the U.S. Cavalry in numbers so great that the army could not use all the meat and hides.\nThey literally burned thousands of carcasses after slaughtering them, so that they could not be utilized.\nIn the Indian culture, almost every part of the precious animal was harvested and put to use. Hides for clothing and tepees, bones for tools, each edible part used for different recipes and tonics. The tongues, eyes, horns and hooves all put to use.\nFor the Native American, the sight of their precious buffalo slaughtered and burned, must have been simply horrible..\nKinder hearts prevailed in the last years of that century, and the preservation of the species can literally be traced to several small groups of individuals moved to areas of the country where they would be protected. - Buffalo Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

The herd is led by a wise matriarch who chooses grazing areas and napping sites and schedules throughout most of the year.\nWithin the herd are females and their youngsters, the females having a well-defined hierarchy which is helpful for cooperation and keeping the peace.\nMales live in smaller groups called \"bachelor herds\" and occasionally will move about in solitary until the mating season. In July, females begin to come into season and the males will start their attempts to attract willing females.\nDominant males will bellow, charge and head- but other males to keep them away from their females. These battles are not generally serious and the less aggressive or smaller male will simply find another female to tend or wait till later in the season.\nMating season will last until September, and then the males will recede back into their own herds. Males have nothing to do with the rearing of calves.\nThe calves are born a much lighter color than the adults. They have thick wool, and small tabs on their heads called \"buttons\" where their horns will soon start to grow. The females raise their calves in their maternal herd where the excitable youngsters frolic together in little \"kindergartens\" that are watched over by all the mothers.\nWhen calves are young, they may fall prey to bears or mountain lions, but wolf packs pose the greatest danger.\nWolf packs are particularly skilled at hunting buffalo, and use their classic \"tag-team\" hunting approach to run the herd until the weakest fall behind.\nThe gift of speed and the ability to run is critical to the survival of the young buffalo, and newborns are up and running with the herd within 20 minutes of birth.\nwhy aren't there domestic buffalo?\nThe buffalo is basically a very large cow - a ruminant which has a four-part stomach for breaking down food that would be undigestable by many other creatures.\nIt spends long hours chewing and re-chewing the grass of the plains. With their short necks they only can bend their head down and eat comfortably to a height of about six inches, and by leaving that amount of grass, the plant survives and regenerates.\nBuffalo usually drink by walking into the stream or river till they can comfortably reach the water.\nTheir incredibly plush fur sloughs off in the summertime in sheets, in a process, called \"moulting\", which leaves mounds of discarded hair throughout the valley.\nAttempts to domesticate the buffalo have failed miserably, and often resulted in injuries, because along with its immense size, the buffalo has a wild heart and has been described by those who tried, as being an animal that simply can't be tamed.\nEven buffalo cows raised in captivity refuse to be milked.\nhuge bison\na few more buffalo facts\nThe American bison and the American buffalo are the same animal\nThe name \"bison\" is more commonly accepted and is the name of the animals zoological genus and zoological species\nThere were once an estimated 65 million buffalo roaming free in North America\nThe buffalo is the largest land animal in the New World\nNovember 2nd is National Bison Day!\nin the 1800's the buffalo was almost hunted to extinction by the U.S. Government in an attempt to starve out the Native Americans\nBoth male and female buffalo have horns\nThe European bison lives in Poland and looks almost exactly like the American bison - Buffalo Facts!\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Artiodactyla\nFamily Bovidae\nSubfamily Bovinae\nGenus Bison\nSpecies bison\nBuffalo Facts - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT bull cow calf group GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD herd North America plains,\nsome forest grass ENEMIES ENDANGERED TOP SPEED GENDER DIFFERENCE wolves threatened 37 mph both have horns AVG.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Albino Animals | Animal Pictures and Facts | FactZoo.com", "url": "https://www.factzoo.com/albino-animals.html", "text": "chimp\nAlbino animals are extremely rare and unusual. They have all the characteristics of others of their species except they are all white in color. Not one inch of their natural coloring comes through as their bodies are unable to produce a pigment known as melanin. Melanin creates the normal pigmentation and coloring in an animal\u2019s skin, fur or scales. This lack of melanin generally results in the animal looking bleached all over, appearing white or pink.\nBeing white doesn\u2019t mean an animal is albino. The true test is in the eye coloration. All albino animals have pink/red eyes whereas white animals with blue eyes are called leucistic, which means they may have a reduced amount of pigmentation in relation to a normal specimen of their species but it is not as severe as albinism. We have some of both pictured here.\nAlbinism is an inherited trait and is passed from adult to young. An albino offspring is formed from a specific combination of genes coming together in any species. Albinos are rare because the genes which cause albinism are recessive and rarely occur.\nApproximately three hundred species across North America have albino members. There have been sightings of albino snakes, racoons, frogs and deer. It\u2019s believed for every 10,000 mammals born, 1 will be albino and this shows how rare the condition really is.\nSome famous albino animals include:\nSnowflake \u2013 the world\u2019s only known albino gorilla kept in Barcelona Zoo. Snowflake lived 39 years and passed in 2003 after suffering with skin cancer. It\u2019s widely believed that Snowflake was the world\u2019s most photographed animal.\nOnya-Birri \u2013 a koala-bear kept at the San Diego Zoo. His name means \u201cghost-boy\u201d in an aboriginal language.\nLightning \u2013 a deer born in Stirling in Scotland. Named Lightning because of his color and because he was born during a storm.\nWhite Diamond \u2013 the world famous albino alligator who called the Serengeti park in Germany his home.\nThese animals are an exciting rarity that we should always feel privileged to witness.\ncobra\npeacock\nracoons\nzebra\nalligator\nbat\ndeer\ndolphin\nfish\ngorilla - Snowflake\ngreat horned owl\nhedgehog\npygmy hedgehog\nkangaroo\nkoala\nsquirrel\nturtle\nblack bear cub\nmoose\ngiraffe missing spots\nhorse\nmacaque\notters\npython\nturtle\nvulture\nwhite cloud buffalo\ndeer\njackdaw\nlion\ntiger\npygmy marmosets (Callithrix pygmaea)\nRatfish\ncrested porcupine\nTwo tawny frogmouths you can tell which one has pigmentation"}

Rabbits, on the other hand, are born blind, naked, and remain in a fur-lined nest for the first days of their lives.\nJackrabbits, which belong to the genus \u201cLepus,\u201d have been clocked at speeds of 45 miles per hour.\nStories abound about the prolific reproductive nature of rabbits and so it is not surprising that the rabbit should have become a symbol of fertility in many cultures and religions. As the Christian influence spread, this symbol became associated with Easter.\nRabbits are meticulously clean animals and are easy to house break and train. Much like a dog, a pet rabbit can be taught to come to his/her name, sit in your lap, and do simple tricks.\nHappy rabbits practice a cute behavior known as a \u201cbinky:\u201d they jump up in the air and twist and spin around!\nA baby rabbit is called a kit, a female is called a doe, and a male is a buck. A group of rabbits is called a herd.\nRabbits are herbivores, eating a diet entirely of grasses and other plants. Because their diet contains so much cellulose, they pass two different kinds of feces to completely break down their food. While other grazers will chew and swallow their feed, then \u201cburp\u201d it back up (as cows chew cud), rabbits will re-ingest their feces on the first pass to get all of the nutrients they need.\nThe average size of a rabbit litter is usually between 4 and 12 babies, which results after a short 30-day gestation. Male rabbits can reproduce as early as 7 months of age, and females as early as 4 months. This means in one year a single female rabbit can produce as many as 800 children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren!\nA rabbit\u2019s life span is about 8 years, though sterilized rabbits (those who are spayed/neutered) can live as long as 10-12 years.\nA rabbit\u2019s teeth never stop growing! Many people believe they need to chew to keep their teeth short. While they do enjoy chewing, it\u2019s the normal wear from where their top and bottom teeth meet that keeps a rabbit\u2019s teeth short.\nCan you guess what other domestic animal is similar to rabbits? A horse! They have similar eyes, teeth, and ears (those belonging to many prey animals), as well as a similar diet and behavior. Clearly, their size is much different\u2026\nA rabbit symbol is often used to show that a product was not tested on animals. This is because rabbits have traditionally been used in product safety testing.\nBunnies cannot vomit, so it is super important to feed them only healthy, fresh, appropriate food."}

I mean, you take some cells, combine them with some other cells, let them sit for nine months, and somehow, they turn into a human being who will cries and poops, and will eventually think, learn, and complain about social media? It's damn near magical (and also slightly terrifying) to contemplate.\nBut humans don't have a lock on the magical-yet-terrifying aspects of reproduction. Not by a long shot, buddy. The 11 animal species profiled below all experience conception, pregnancy, and birth in extremely different ways \u2014 the only real common factor is that all these animals conceive and birth their young in ways that will pretty much blow your mind. Some of these facts will warm your heart, some will bum you out, and some will make you say, \"Go home, Nature, you're drunk\" \u2014 but all of them will make you reflect on the fact that it is pretty frickin' complex to bring another living thing into this world.\nSo, are you ready to ruin your next cocktail party by going on and on about duck vaginas? That's the spirit! Then read on, and learn about 11 of the most bizarre, cool, confusing, and all-around interesting reproductive practices in the animal kingdom. Who cares about your dumb cocktail party friends anyway? I'll be your friend now! We can text each other fun facts about marsupial genitals (and trust me, there are many).\n1. Elephants Are Pregnant For Nearly 2 Years\nElephants have the longest pregnancies of any mammal \u2014 an African elephant stays pregnant for a truly brain-melting 22 months \u2014 and when they give birth, their entire pack huddles around them, to protect the mother and baby from predators like lions. Elephant babies are able to walk moments after being born \u2014 also likely as a defense against predators who go after baby elephants.\nAlso, in case you were not yet dying by cuteness today, know that baby elephants suck their trunks, just like human babies suck their thumbs. See? Life isn't completely horrible!\n2. Dogs Can Experience False Pregnancies\nAlthough the actual facts of dog reproduction are covered very thoroughly in the noted documentary film 101 Dalmatians, dogs do have one unusual reproductive feature that you may not know about: unspayed female dogs sometimes experience false pregnancy.\nAfter a female dog \"goes into heat\" and experiences a fertile period, even if she has not actually mated, she may experience pregnancy symptoms like vomiting, fluid retention, enlargement of the mammaries, and even milk production. She may also begin engaging in typical pregnancy behaviors, like nesting and feeling restless. On occasion, dogs experiencing a false pregnancy will even go through a false labor, and fixate on a small toy or other item afterwards, protecting and caring for it as if it were a young puppy.\nSo why do dogs become convinced that they're with pup, even if they haven't been anywhere near a male dog who could impregnate them? Turns out that the female dog's ovaries produce hormones designed to ready the uterus for pregnancy as soon as a dog is finished going into heat. In a pregnant dog, these hormones continue to flow for almost the rest of her pregnancy; for a dog who isn't pregnant, these pregnancy hormones continue to flow through her body for over a month, and their fluctuations lead to pregnancy-like bodily changes. So the next time your dog won't give you back one of your socks, cut her some slack \u2014 she may be going through an extremely confusing time.\n3. Orangutans Nurse For Six Years\nOrangutans spend almost their entire lives in trees \u2014 they're the only great ape to be considered primarily arboreal. They spend their days climbing, traveling, and eating in the trees, and building nests each night high in the forest canopy to sleep \u2014 and giving birth is no different. Female orangutans give birth to their young alone, like most apes, in nests built near the tops of some very high rain forest trees.\nFemale orangutans also devote seven years to raising each of their babies, who nurse until they are six \u2014 which is why they typically only give birth once every eight years, meaning that most orangutans only have four or five children in their lifetimes. That's the longest any animal (besides the human animal) spends raising its young.\n4. The 6-Foot Drop Of Being Born Is What Severs The Giraffe's Umbilical Cord\nGiraffes can only give birth standing up. According to Animal Planet's Growing Up Giraffe, if a giraffe mother were to sit or lie down while giving birth, \"the baby could be crushed.\" The standing birth also serves another function: a newborn baby giraffe drops out of a standing mother's vagina, which is typically about six feet in the air \u2014 a drop which severs the umbilical cord.\nBut while a seated giraffe birth can be risky, so can the drop \u2014 on occasion, newborn baby giraffes become fatally injured during their fall to the ground. But most giraffe babies successfully make it to the ground.\n5. Spiders Can Choose Which Sperm To Use\nCertain species of female spiders are able to engage in a practice called \"sperm dumping\" \u2014 basically, when these spiders mate, sperm doesn't flow directly into their reproductive organs; rather, it enters a sac, which the female spider can decide about later \u2014 she'll either expel and dispose of the sperm, or use the sperm to conceive. This system is thought to exist so that these species of female spiders can mate with multiple males during a period of fertility, and then choose the mate most likely to yield successful offspring.\nAnd spiders are far from the only creatures to engage in forms of sperm dumping \u2014 mammals like zebra and ducks (more on them below) also have techniques for keeping unwelcome sperm from their wombs.\n6. Octopus Mothers Die After After Their Eggs Hatch\nTypically, octopus mothers guard their eggs for several months, a period of time where they don't eat or really move \u2014 and after their young hatch, the mothers die. Researchers have found one deep sea species of octopus who sat guarding her eggs and barely moving for 4.5 years \u2014 the longest documented gestation time for any animal (and also an impressive span of time for an octopus, whose lifespan is typically only a year or two).\n7. Kangaroos Have 3 Vaginas\nHave you ever been so busy and overworked, you were just like, \"Man, I wish I had three vaginas!\" (You know, just so you could actually get something done.) Well, kangaroos feel you \u2014 because female kangaroos have three vaginas. The outer two are for collecting sperm from sexual encounters, while the central vagina is exclusively for giving birth. All the vaginas connect within the kangaroo's body, funneling whatever goes into them to one of the female kangaroo's two uteruses. This setup means that a female kangaroo can basically be constantly pregnant.\nAnd yes, some male kangaroos have a double-pronged penis, too. I'm kind of insulted that you even had to ask!\n8. A Chipmunk's Pregnancy Might Be Shorter Than Your Menstrual Cycle\nChipmunks are only pregnant for 31 days, aka the amount of time it probably takes you to decide on a movie to watch on Netflix.\n10. Male Dolphins Are Not As Nice As You Think\nYou may have heard that some dolphins commit sexual assault against each other \u2014 and it's true. Male dolphins will sometimes in effect \"gang rape\" a female dolphin caught alone, preventing her attempts to escape until she has sex with all of them.\nBut that's far from the only sex-related problem to plague the dolphin communities of the world. The heft of carrying a pregnancy slows dolphins down \u2014 a pregnant dolphin experiences a 50 percent increase in swim drag, which can make them more vulnerable to predators, and may play a role in declining dolphin populations.\n10. Male Seahorses Give Birth\nAfter some courtship, the female seahorse lays eggs in the male seahorse's pouch. The male seahorse is then pregnant \u2014 and he doesn't just carry the eggs around. He also provides nutrients and protection from viruses to his young while they're in utero, just like your typical pregnant female mammal does.\nThen, he'll give birth to the couple's young after 10 to 25 days (depending on the species). Did you already know this? I personally learned it from a Nirvana t-shirt that I had in eighth grade, but I've always liked to bring it up at parties.\nAnyway, if you're curious about what it looks like when male seahorses give birth, please check out this extremely NSFW gif (it's a little gross, so consider yourself warned).\n11. Male Ducks Grow A New Corkscrew-Shaped Penis Every Year\nIf you're a student of unusual animal genitalia \u2014 and who among us isn't, really? \u2014 you may have already heard about ducks and their mind-blowingly complex junk. But in case you haven't: male ducks have sort of spring-loaded corkscrew-shaped penises, which emerge from inside their bodies when they prepare to have sex.\nFemale ducks have corkscrew-shaped vaginas, which seems quite reasonable in this context. They also have the ability to prevent the sperm of male ducks whose children they don't want to bear from reaching their uteruses \u2014they can shunt this unwanted sperm off to a \"dead end\" within their vagina, where it won't be able to fertilize their eggs. This ability is really important for female ducks, as male ducks are known to frequently force themselves sexually on female ducks.\nOh, and also, male ducks grow a new penis every year. As the old public service announcement ad used to say, the more you know (the happier you are that you're not a duck)?\nImages: Giphy (11)"}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe - Giraffa camelopardalis | The Rothschild's Giraffes at Marwell Zoo", "url": "https://www.marwell.org.uk/animal/giraffe/", "text": "Common name: Giraffe\nScientific name: Giraffa camelopardalis\nThe giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is the tallest living animal and with its uniquely long legs and neck is one of the most recognisable species in the world. They also have distinctive patchwork coat patterns that differ in appearance between animals found in various parts of Africa. Each individual giraffe can be identified from its own unique coat pattern in the same way that human fingerprints differ from each other.\nMale and female giraffes have horns known as ossicones which are conical bone structures permanently covered in skin. The ossicones lie flat and are not attached to the skull at birth to avoid injury and only later become fused. They have 45-50cm long prehensile tongues which are black, blue or purple. No one really knows why they are these unusually dark colours, but it may help to protect the tongue from prolonged exposure to the sun.\nThe tallest mammals in the world, the giraffe\u2019s height comes with challenges that have been overcome with special adaptations. Weighing around 11kg and about 60cm long, the heart of a full-grown giraffe is the largest of any land animal. It is needed to pump blood around its big body with a blood pressure twice that of an average human. A large, dense complex of blood vessels in the upper neck protect giraffe brains from sudden changes in blood pressure when they lower their heads to drink and raise them again. Just like us, giraffe only have 7 vertebrae in the neck but theirs are elongated and have ball and socket joints allowing greater flexibility. Large muscles and a strong nuchal ligament (at the nape) are needed to hold up the neck and head, giving giraffes a hump at the base of the neck."}

Snails have the most teeth of any animal\nSnails teeth are not like regular teeth. A snail\u2019s teeth are arranged in rows on its tongue. A garden snail has about 14,000 teeth while other species can have over 20,000. But that\u2019s not even the most shocking part: The teeth of an aquatic snail called the limpet are the strongest known biological material on Earth, even stronger than titanium!\n2. You can tell a dolphin\u2019s age by its teeth\nJust like trees, dolphin\u2019s teeth have rings inside them that tell how old they are. Their teeth are permanent, but they don\u2019t use them for chewing\u2014dolphins swallow their food whole because they have no muscle in their jaws.\n3. Giraffes have no upper front teeth\nJust like humans, giraffes have 32 teeth, but most of them are positioned in the back of their mouths. They use their lips and 20-foot long tongues to grab leaves and twigs and grind them up with their back teeth.\n4. Sharks constantly lose their teeth\nSharks\u2019 teeth are positioned in rows within their mouths that simply move forward as they lose them. They usually lose at least one tooth per week\u2014that\u2019s why you can find so many shark teeth on the beach.\n5. Rabbits, squirrels, and rodents have teeth that never stop growing\nThey have to chew on tough foods like nuts, leaves, and bark to wear down their teeth and keep them from growing too long.\n6. Hippopotamuses have the longest canine teeth of any animal\nAt three-feet long, the incisors of a hippo can bite right through a small boat.\n7. Horses can have receding gums just like humans\nIn fact, that\u2019s where the popular saying \u201clong in the tooth,\u201d meaning old, comes from. As horses age, their gums recede and expose more of their teeth, making it look like they\u2019re actually growing.\n8. Narwhal horns are actually teeth\nIt\u2019s scientific name, Monodon monoceros, comes from the Greek term meaning \u201cone-tooth one-horn.\u201d A narwhal\u2019s horn can grow longer than 8 feet and is used to \u201ctaste\u201d the concentrations of chemicals in the water around it to find food.\n9. Blue whales have no teeth\nEven though they\u2019re the largest mammals in the world, blue whales only eat tiny shrimp called krill, so they don\u2019t need teeth. Instead, they have bristle-like filters called baleen that comb through the water for food.\n10. Most animals don\u2019t get cavities because their diets aren\u2019t high in sugar\nThey also chew on more hard or rough materials than we do, such as bone or tree bark, which help to keep their teeth clean. However, domesticated animals can develop cavities if they eat a lot of sugar, so our dentist in Woodstock, Dr. Kenneth R. Eye wants to remind you to keep your pets\u2019 consumption of sweets and other human food to a minimum.\nWho knew animal teeth were so interesting?\nThat was fun, wasn\u2019t it?\nDid you learn something new and interesting?

That means the animal faces extinction in the wild in the medium-term future if nothing is done to minimize the threats to its life or habitat. The next steps are endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild and extinct.\nPoaching of elephants and rhinoceros and the illegal trade in pangolins has overshadowed the problems with giraffes in the last decade. But Damian Carrington at The Guardian reports that giraffe numbers have dropped precipitously in the last 31 years, from 157,000 individuals in 1985 to 97,500 at last count.\n\u201cWhilst giraffes are commonly seen on safari, in the media and in zoos, people\u2014including conservationists\u2014are unaware that these majestic animals are undergoing a silent extinction,\u201d Julian Fennessy, the co-chair of the IUCN's Species Survival Commission's Giraffe and Okapi Specialist Group says in a press release. \u201cWith a decline of almost 40 percent in the last three decades alone, the world's tallest animal is under severe pressure in some of its core ranges across East, Central and West Africa. As one of the world's most iconic animals, it is timely that we stick our neck out for the giraffe before it is too late.\u201d\nThe giraffes face two main threats, encroachment from cities and towns into their habitat and poaching. Poaching has become increasingly problematic. Some food insecure villagers kill the animals for their meat, but Jani Actman at National Geographic reports many giraffes are slaughtered just for their tails, which are considered a status symbol and have been used as a dowry when asking a bride\u2019s father for his daughters hand in marriage in some cultures.\nPatrick Healy at The New York Times reports that red list divides the giraffe into nine subspecies. Five of those subspecies are decreasing in numbers while two populations are increasing and one is stable. West African giraffes, the smallest subspecies, have grown from 50 individuals in the 1990s to about 400 today. But that success took a massive amount of effort from the government of Niger and conservation groups.\nIt will take similar efforts throughout the giraffe's wide range to arrest its plummeting numbers. Derek Lee, founder of the Wild Nature Institute who contributed to the IUCN update tells Healy that both poaching and habitat encroachment need to be stopped to save the giraffe. \u201cThese are problems everywhere for giraffes,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need to stop both threats.\u201d\nWhile increasing funding for anti-poaching efforts can do some good, Lee thinks stopping habitat encroachment is a much more difficult prospect, since it would mean interfering with land development, mining and other economic activities and livelihoods.\nThe biggest problem for giraffes, though, may be the lack of attention over the years. \u201cI am absolutely amazed that no one has a clue,\u201d Julian Fennessy, executive director of Giraffe Conservation Foundation tells Sarah Knapton at The Telegraph. \u201cThis silent extinction. Some populations less than 400. That is more endangered than any gorilla, or almost any large mammal in the world.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a strong tendency to think that familiar species (such as giraffes, chimps, etc.) must be OK because they are familiar and we see them in zoos,\u201d Duke University conservation biologist Stuart Pimm, tells the Associated Press. In fact, giraffes have silently been going extinct across Africa over the last century. The animal is already gone from seven countries, Burkina Faso, Eritrea, Guinea, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria and Senegal."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe - Top Facts, Sounds, Diet & Habitat Information", "url": "https://animalcorner.org/animals/giraffe/", "text": "The Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis meaning \u2018fast walking camel leopard) is an African even-toed ungulate mammal, the tallest of all land-living animal species.\nThe giraffe is related to deer and cattle, however, it is placed in a separate family, the Giraffidae, consisting only of the giraffe and its closest relative, the okapi.\nThe giraffes range extends from Chad to South Africa. Although the Okapi is much shorter than the giraffe, it also has a long neck and eats leaves and both animals have long tongues and skin-covered horns.\nThe giraffes ancestors first appeared in central Asia about 15 million years ago, however, the earliest fossil records of the giraffe itself, from Israel and Africa, date back about 1.5 million years.\nMale giraffes are called \u2018Bulls\u2019, female giraffes are called \u2018Cows\u2019 and baby giraffes are called \u2018Calves\u2019.\nGiraffe Characteristics\nThe giraffe is the tallest living animal which is instantly recognizable by its exceptionally long neck. Adult males stand 15 \u2013 19 feet (4.6 \u2013 6.0 metres) tall, whereas females are shorter at 13 \u2013 16 feet (4 \u2013 4.8 metres) tall. Adult males weigh between 1,764 \u2013 4,255 pounds (800 \u2013 930 kilograms), while females weigh only 1,213 \u2013 2,601 pounds (550 \u2013 1,180 kilograms).\nThe giraffe has the longest tail of any land mammal. Their tail can grow to be 8 feet (2.4 metres) long, including the tuft on the end.\nIn addition to its great height, the giraffe is also one of the heaviest land animals. Exceptionally large males may weigh up to 1,900 kilograms (about 4,200 pounds).\nFemale giraffes are smaller, rarely reaching half that weight. Compared to other hoofed mammals the giraffe has a relatively short body, however, its legs are disproportionately long.\nA giraffes front legs are about 10% longer than their hind legs, a feature that contributes to the animals steeply sloping back. Mature giraffes have large hooves about the size of dinner plates, around 12 inches wide.\nGiraffe Habitat\nGiraffes can inhabit savannas, grasslands or open woodlands. Giraffes prefer areas enriched with acacia growth (a genus of shrubs and trees). Most giraffes live either in East Africa or in Angola and Zambia in southwestern Africa. Until the middle of the 20th century giraffes were also commonly found in West Africa, south of the Sahara. But populations there have fallen sharply and become increasingly fragmented.\nGiraffe Diet\nGiraffes live in habitats where the available food varies throughout the year. During the dry season, giraffes eat evergreen leaves, however, once the rainy season begins, they switch to new leaves and stems that sprout on deciduous trees. Also, twigs and branches are pulled into the mouth of the giraffe with their long and dextrous tongues. In the wild giraffes can eat up to 66 kilograms of food daily.\nWhen there is a choice, male and female giraffes feed in different ways. Males concentrate on leaves from the highest branches, while the females arch their necks to eat closer to the ground. Because of this characteristic behaviour, a giraffe can be identified as either male or female from a long distance away simply by its stance while eating. Male giraffes are also more inclined to wander into dense woodland, a habitat that females generally avoid.\nGiraffes drink large quantities of water and as a result, they can spend long periods of time in dry, arid areas. When searching for more food they will venture into areas with denser foliage. The giraffe has tough lips to ensure there is no damage to their mouths when chewing at trees and twigs such as thorns.\nGiraffes in captivity are generally fed on alfalfa hay and pellets, apples, carrots, bananas and browse (elm and alder are favourites).\nGiraffe Behaviour\nFemale giraffes associate in groups of a dozen or so members, occasionally including a few younger males. Male giraffes tend to live in bachelor herds, with older males often leading solitary lives. A individual giraffe can join or leave the herd at any time and for no particular reason.\nBecause giraffes are so widely scattered, it may seem that they do not keep in contact with each other, however, this is not true. A giraffes keen eyesight means they can keep an eye on their neighbours even at a distance.\nFemale giraffes spend just over half a 24 hour day browsing, male giraffes spend less time doing this \u2013 about 43% of the time that the female does. Night is mostly spent lying down ruminating, especially in the hours after dark and before dawn.\nMale giraffes spend about 22% of the 24 hours walking, compared to 13% for female giraffes. The rest of the time male giraffes are searching for a female giraffe to mate with. Giraffe herds do not have a leader and individual giraffes show no particular preferences for others in the herd.\nYoung giraffes are never left alone, however, they are looked after in a kind of nursery group where the females help look after each others calves (baby giraffes).\nGiraffes spend up to half their time feeding and most of the remainder is taken up either by searching for food or slowly digesting what they have eaten. Sometimes giraffes sleep during the daytime, often while standing.\nGiraffes normally lie down only at night, tucking their feet under the body and usually keeping the head upright. However, when a giraffe is sleeping, something it does only for just a few minutes at a time, it curves its neck around and rests its head on or near its behind.\nOne of the most fascinating elements of giraffe behaviour is the duel between males fighting for mating partners. Giraffe duels are among the most extraordinary in the animal kingdom. Duels begin when two males approach each other and engage in rubbing and intertwining their necks. This behaviour is known as \u2018necking\u2019. It allows the opponents to assess each others size and strength.\nOften, necking alone is enough to establish dominance. If not, the rivals begin to exchange blows with their heads, using their short horns to tackle each other.\nEach giraffe braces its front legs and swings its head upward and over its shoulder. If a blow lands solidly, the giraffe may stagger under the impact and in rare cases may even collapse onto the ground. More often the contest breaks off after a few minutes and the loser simply walks away.\nGiraffe Reproduction\nThe Giraffe breeding season can occur at any time during the year. However, births in the wild usually happen during the dry season and births in captivity can happen all year round. Giraffes reach sexual maturity in captivity at around 3 \u2013 4 years old, however, in the wild, males do not usually breed until they are 6 \u2013 7 years old. In contrast to the male breeding age, females must be physically larger to carry offspring.\nWhen male giraffes are ready to breed, they begin the ritual combat over mates. Giraffes are non- territorial and a successful male giraffe will mate with receptive female giraffes whenever and wherever it finds them.\nGestation period is usually 13 \u2013 15 months and when a pregnant female giraffe is ready to give birth, she makes her way to a calving area that she will use throughout her life. The moment of birth is dramatic, with the mother giraffe standing on all fours and the calf tumbling onto the ground. Remarkably, the calf is rarely injured by its fall.\nNewborn giraffes are often on their feet within 20 minutes and are soon feeding on their mothers milk. Calves can walk about an hour after birth and can run within 24 hours of birth. Giraffe calves are about 2 metres (6 feet) tall at birth and weigh 104 \u2013 154 pounds. Giraffe calves grow about 3 centimetres tall each day during the first week and double their height in their first year.\nBy the age of one year giraffe calves can measure 10 feet tall. Giraffe calves are weaned at one year and become fully independent by 15 months of age. Female giraffe calves are fully grown by age five and male giraffe calves by the age of seven.\nYoung giraffes may suckle for up to a year, however, they start to sample plants just a few weeks after birth. Giraffe calves are ready to leave the protection of their mother after 15 \u2013 18 months of development.\nGiraffe Predators\nAdult giraffes generally have no predators other than lions and humans, as their huge hooves are very effective in defending against predators. Giraffes are more vulnerable when they are lying down or drinking, because this gives lions the opportunity to leap up and seize them by the nose or throat.\nNewly born calves are at much greater risk. Despite their mothers best efforts to protect them, over 50 percent of all giraffe newborns are killed by hyenas and big cats such as lions and leopards during the first month of their life. In captivity, giraffes have lived over the age of 30 years, however, their maximum life span in the wild is about 25 years.\nGiraffe Sounds\nGiraffes are usually silent although they can bellow, grunt or snort when alarmed, as when confronted by lions, and can also moo in distress.\nHold your mouse over the giraffe photo and you may be able to hear a giraffe grunt. (ie only)\nCalves (young giraffes) bleat and make a mewing call, cows (female giraffes) seeking lost calves will bellow and courting bulls (male giraffes) may emit a raucous cough. Giraffes also give alarm snorts, whereby moaning, snoring, hissing and flute like sounds have been reported. Giraffes also give out a grunting sound that sounds like a pig.\nGiraffe Adaptations\nGiraffes have amazing adaptions that help them with their lifestyle in the wild. Because giraffes grow to a very tall height, it gives them access to a level of foliage beyond reach of all other large browsing animals all except possibly, the elephant.\nAlong with their height, giraffes have an incredible array of adaptations. For example, their skin coloring provides excellent camouflage, as it has many different patches of variable size and color.\nGiraffes skin is very thick, so it provides ample protection and insulation. Also, the giraffe\u2019s long eyelids keep out ants and sense thorns on the branches of the trees from which they browse. The valves in veins of the neck control a huge rush of blood to the head when leaning over; this prevents unconsciousness.\nThere is also a network of capillaries in the brain called the \u2018wonder-net\u2019. It acts rather like a shock absorber and is another part of the system that prevents unconsciousness. (Also see \u2018Giraffe Anatomy\u2018 for more facts about the giraffes neck).\nA giraffes tongue is over 18 inches (46 centimetres) long, and the roof of the mouth is grooved to easily strip leaves off branches. Since giraffes are extremely efficient at processing nutrients and liquids from food, they can survive without water for long periods of time. Giraffes ruminate day or night, with periods of sleep in between.\nGiraffes also rest with their eyes open, standing or lying for three to five minutes at a time. Throughout the night, a giraffe may deeply sleep for five to 10 minutes lying down, yet they rarely sleep more than 20 minutes total per day.\nGiraffe Conservation Status\nLike many of Africa\u2019s large mammals, giraffes have declined in numbers and in range over the last century. At one time, herds of over 100 animals were common in savanna regions across the continent, however, today concentrations like these exist only in East Africa particularly Tanzania Serengeti National Park.\nThe decline of giraffe populations has largely been due to hunting. In Africa, the giraffe is a traditional source of hide and hair and also of tough but nutritious meat. Hunting of giraffes has not yet had a catastrophic effect, as it has on some of Africa\u2019s big-game animals, but it is a cause for concern. The natural habitat of the giraffe is also being impacted more and more by human activities, reducing the animals range.\nThe giraffe is currently a protected species throughout most of its range and is classed as conservation-dependent by the World Conservation Union (IUCN). The giraffes prospects for survival are good for those living in national parks and game reserves, but for animals living outside these areas the future is less secure.\nGiraffe FAQs\nHow tall is a giraffe?\nThe giraffe is the tallest living animal on land. Fully grown giraffes stand 4.3 to 5.7 m (14.1 to 18.7 ft) tall, with males taller than females. Despite its long neck and legs, the giraffe\u2019s body is relatively short.\nA giraffe\u2019s neck can be up to 2.4 m (7.9 ft) in length. It results from a disproportionate lengthening of the cervical vertebrae, not from the addition of more vertebrae. Each cervical vertebra is over 28 cm (11 in) long. The giraffe\u2019s elongation of the neck largely takes place after birth, because giraffe mothers would have a difficult time giving birth to young with the same neck proportions as adults.\nIt has been suggested that competitive pressure from smaller browsers, like kudu, steenbok and impala, encouraged the elongation of the giraffe\u2019s neck, as it enabled giraffes to reach food that competitors could not. Giraffes can feed up to 4.5 m (15 ft) high.\nWhat sound does a giraffe make?\nEarly biologists suggested giraffes were mute and unable to produce air flow of sufficient velocity to vibrate their vocal folds. However, they have been recorded communicating using snorts, sneezes, coughs, snores, hisses, bursts, moans, grunts, growls and flute-like sounds. During nighttime, giraffes appear to hum to each other above the infrasound range.\nDuring courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females also call their young by bellowing. Calves will emit snorts, bleats, mooing and mewing sounds.\nHow long does a giraffe live?\nGiraffes have an unusually long lifespan compared to other ruminants, and can live to up to 38 years. Adult giraffes are not usually preyed on because of their size, eyesight and powerful kicks, however, lions can prey on smaller individuals and giraffes are a common food source for big cats. Adult females are a lot more likely to survive if the group in which they socialize is bigger.\nGiraffe calves are much more vulnerable than adults and are also preyed on by leopards, spotted hyenas and wild dogs. A quarter to a half of giraffe calves reach adulthood. Calves born during the dry season have higher survival rates.\nWhat do giraffes eat?\nGiraffes are herbivores and are known to eat up to 60 different species of plant. They most commonly eat from acacia trees but also browse for wild apricots, flowers, fruits and buds along with eating seeds and fresh grass just after the rains. When stressed, giraffes may chew the bark off branches.\nA giraffe eats around 34 kg (75 lb) of foliage daily. They mostly eat during the first and last hours of daytime. They get 70% of their moisture from their food so need to drink very little. In fact, they can survive for up to three weeks without drinking water. However, when they do come across clean water, they must splay their front legs (which are longer than the back) in order to get their head close enough to the ground to drink.\nGiraffe requires less food than many other herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system. As a ruminant, giraffes first chew food, then swallow it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again.\nTheir height helps them to reach branches and leaves that other animals cannot. Competition for food is thought to be the main reason why their necks are so long. They use their prehensile lips and flattened, grooved teeth are able to strip the leaves off the branches.\nHow do giraffes sleep?\nGiraffes usually sleep lying down, although standing sleeps have been recorded, particularly in older individuals. In captivity, a giraffe sleeps intermittently around 4.6 hours per day, mostly at night, but in the wild they can sleep as little as 5 to 30 minutes in a 24 hour period. The most common amount of sleep for giraffes is between one and two hours.\nGiraffes also go through intermittent short \u201cdeep sleep\u201d phases. These are characterised by the giraffe bending its neck backwards and resting its head on the hip or thigh.\nWhere do giraffes live?\nGiraffes are native to Kenya, Cameroon, Chad, Niger, Uganda, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania, Angola, and South Africa. They were originally found in over 20 African nations but are now extinct in seven nations \u2013 Burkina Faso, Eritrea, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria and Senegal. Most giraffes live in East Africa, although some are found in the reserves of Southern Africa. The largest concentration of these animals are found in National Parks.\nThe different subspecies of giraffe live in different countries in Africa, but certain species have declining populations in areas, mostly due to habitat loss and poaching. The Uganda giraffe historically lived in western Kenya, Uganda, and southern Sudan, but now survives in only a few small, isolated populations in Kenya and Uganda. The Nigerian giraffe is now found in just one area of Niger. The reticulated giraffe lives in Somalia, southern Ethiopia, and northern Kenya.\nGiraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands, where there are large amounts of foliage for them to feed on. Their coloring helps them to blend in with their surroundings, but they are so large that they are safer in numbers instead of trying to hide.\nBecause giraffes feed on vegetation that is high in the trees but also too woody for the mouths of smaller herbivores, they are also able to remain in areas where domestic grazing has obliterated the plant species close to the ground.\nWhat is a group of giraffes called?\nA group of giraffes is called a tower! Giraffes are social animals and are usually found in groups, often called herds. The groups vary in size and composition, but can range in size from one to up to 66 individuals! Giraffe towers tend to be sex-segregated, although mixed-sex groups made of adult females and young males also occur.\nFemales are more selective about who they associate with from the opposite sex, and many herds are made up of mothers and their young. As they get older, males become more solitary but may also associate in pairs or with female groups.\nHow does a giraffe move?\nGiraffes have two ways of moving, a loping walk and a gallop. When they walk, the giraffes move both feet on one side of their body in unison, followed by both feet on the other side. When they run, giraffes move the front feet together, then the back feet, swinging the hind feet up and planting them in front of the forefeet. While running, the neck of a giraffe moves backward and forward to keep the animal balanced. Giraffes have a top speed of about 56 kilometres per hour (35 miles per hour), however, because its legs are so long a galloping giraffe does not appear to be going very fast.\nGiraffes are not great travelers, despite their long legs. Giraffes cannot walk over swampy ground because their hooves quickly sink and they very rarely wade across rivers. Giraffes on opposite banks of a river may never come into contact, unless the water levels drop.\nHow does a giraffe bend down?\nFor giraffes, bending down is a daily challenge. To reach ground level for example, when drinking a giraffe has to splay its front legs at an angle of almost 45 degrees.\nA giraffes circulatory system is also specially modified, because the high pressure needed to pump blood up to its head could cause brain damage when the head is lowered. To deal with this problem, giraffes have elastic blood vessels that relieve some of the excess pressure.\nGiraffes also have a series of valves in their neck veins that ensure that blood always flows from the head back towards the heart, even when this means going against gravity.\nWhen giraffes do bend down to drink at water holes, it is commonly done in pairs. This is so that one giraffe can drink, whilst the other keeps an eye open for predators."}

The Diet Of The Tallest Animals In The World", "url": "https://coachellavalleypreserve.org/what-do-giraffes-eat/", "text": "Giraffes are the tallest animals in the world, and they mostly live in Sub-Saharan Africa. These herbivore animals mostly consume leaves and buds. However, they won\u2019t refuse the pleasure of eating flowers and fruit when they are in season. But if you \u2018ask\u2019 a giraffe about its favorite food, it will \u2018tell\u2019 you that it\u2019s either the leaves of acacia or the ones of the mimosa tree.\nNow, as a subcategory to the herbivore family, giraffes fall in the category of even-toed ungulates, along with deers, sheep, or cattle.\nDue to their robust body, giraffes weigh around 3,000 pounds, making them the eighth heaviest land mammals. It is impossible not to recognize giraffes, mainly because of their height and dot body patterns. Also known as spots, these characteristic brown patches have the purpose of camouflaging the animals and are possible thanks to a complex blood vessel system.\nBut let\u2019s return to the food part, which is the day\u2019s topic. Because they are massive creatures and require a lot of food, giraffes will continuously look to eat.\nThis being said, let\u2019s understand the giraffes\u2019 diet and digestion particularities and discover their favorite food.\nWhat Does A Giraffe\u2019s Diet Include?\nHere is what giraffes\u2019 diet includes:\nAcacia trees (their primary food source)\nLeaves\nBuds\nSeeds\nMimosa trees\nVegetables\nFruits\nGrass\nFlowers\nThe acacia leaves are by far their most favorite food type. However, giraffes will also eat other plants, like bush willows or mimosa. Although they can consume lots of different plants and flowers, the diet of giraffes is affected by what food is available at any given time.\nIn other words, giraffes have a different menu based on the season. Therefore, during the rainy months, giraffes will look for deciduous trees, shrubs, or vines, while during the dry season, they will gather around the evergreen trees to feed themselves. The reason for that is simple \u2013 due to the lack of rain, fresh plants are not available, so they have to adjust their diet.\nGiraffes will also snack on the occasional fruits during their seasons. When they feel stressed, giraffes will start eating even the bark off of branches. Unfortunately, this behavior is not beneficial to the trees. In time, the acacia managed to evolve, and now they have vicious thorns. But truth be told, these thorns aren\u2019t a very big obstacle for the extremely long tongues giraffes have. Yes, they can\u2019t eat the acacia bark, but they very easily find their way to the leaves.\nWhat Will Giraffes Eat When They Are In The Wild?\nYes, Acacia nilotica is a giraffes\u2019 favorite food. When they are in their natural habitat, giraffes will eat plants they can easily find or reach. Sometimes, they will be happy with eating some grass too. Yet, the process of eating short grass from the ground will be a bit tricky for these very tall creatures.\nAs such, these animals will have to either bend at the knee or simply splay their long front legs wide apart, so that they can reach food from the ground.\nHow Much Does A Giraffe Eat?\nDue to their colossal size and weight, you can expect giraffes to eat a lot, right? As such, an adult giraffe will eat up to 75 pounds or 34 kilograms per day. Although this quantity might sound like a lot, we need to consider the average weight.\nA male giraffe weighs 2,628 pounds (1,192 kilograms), while a female weighs around 1,825 pounds (827 kilograms). While it may sound like a lot of food, don\u2019t eat as much as other herbivores, considering their size. The reason? An effective digestive system that helps them extract the proper amount of nutrients from their food.\nGiraffe Adaptations For Foraging\nThe body of a giraffe comes with lots of features that help them reach and eat foods of all kinds.\nThe Mouth And Tongue\nThe powerful mouth, as well as the tall height, are a giraffes\u2019 superpowers. Giraffes have this long prehensile tongue and lips that won\u2019t be affected by thorny branches other herbivores might not be able to eat.\nUsually, most of the trees and shrubs of African acacias will be very sharp. However, a giraffe\u2019s tongue is perfectly adapted to hold the leaves without causing any hurt. With their 45 cm long prehensile muscle with small papillae, as well as the mouth itself, giraffes can cushion spiny elements of trees and shrubs. Furthermore, the thick saliva that covers the spines is essential for swallowing without causing any damage to the internal organs.\nBut how do giraffes succeed in eating even the prickly branches and leaves? Well, it\u2019s kind of easy to understand, actually. The animals strip the leaves from limbs, and they take just a tiny part of the branch within the mouth. Next, they pull their heads back in such a way to allow their lips and tongues to rip the leaves apart.\nThe Rumination\nGiraffes are ruminant animals. Their stomach comes with four chambers, making the digestive process different from the other mammals. The whole eating process is particular. So first of all, the giraffes will start by chewing the food for some time, then swallow it.\nThe next step is regurgitating all the food back in their mouth so that they can chew it once again. Giraffes may repeat this process right before they move to consume another food. The rumination action can be pretty lengthy, so a lot of the giraffes\u2019 day consists of feeding.\n\u200bWhy Do Giraffes Prefer Acacia Leaves?\nGiraffes love Acacia leaves, as these trees are very high in protein and calcium, some nutrients and vitamins a giraffe\u2019s huge body needs. Moreover, these trees have many other attractive properties for these tall animals.\nAcacia trees can grow high, a true advantage for the giraffe. The tall creatures will have no competition for their food, as no other animal can reach these leaves.\nDo Giraffes Cause Damage While Eating?\nTrees are the most common food that giraffes are frequenting. For instance, giraffes are not as destructive as elephants when it comes to feeding habits. While the giraffes are nibbling the trees, they can even produce positive results for these plants.\nIt is like you are cutting back a plant in your garden to help it develop new healthy sprouts. When a giraffe is full, the tree will start producing new growth. Furthermore, giraffes are helping in seed distribution and pollination as well.\nYou should not be worried about trees. These plants have a clever system that helps them avoid being overeaten by giraffes. Everything in nature is strongly connected at levels that we can\u2019t even start to think about. For instance, there is a species of ants that have a symbiotic relationship with the acacia trees. So how does this work? Well, the tree provides shelter and food for the ants, and in return, the ants make sure that the herbivores don\u2019t eat only from one branch and create damage to the tree.\nDo Giraffes Consume Meat?\nAlthough this happens rarely, if a giraffe cannot get its essential nutrients, it will have to look elsewhere.\nHowever, giraffes are not hunters. Yet, on very rare occasions, they have been seen liking the meat of some dead carcasses. They would usually avoid doing this, mainly because of their hard work in eating from the ground.\nImagine their neck, which can be 6 feet long, touching the ground. It is almost impossible. So if giraffes want to eat something from the ground, they would need to shuffle down by spreading their feet apart. Doing this will make giraffes genuinely vulnerable in front of their predators.\nYet, if the situation requires it, they will search for small bones to chew for minerals.\nWhat Do Baby Giraffes Eat?\nNew-born giraffes are around 6 feet tall at the time of their birth. This allows them to feed with their mother\u2019s milk as food, starting from the first hour of their life.\nCalves have a muscular structure at the lower end of the esophagus known as the esophageal grooves. This structure will enable milk to bypass the first stomach area and enter the second part.\nWhen they reach the age of four months, baby giraffes will start eating solid food. Their stomach will slowly adapt to change and, finally, their ruminating habit.\nWhat do Giraffes Eat In Zoos?\nGiraffes\u2019 menu can vary from a zoo to another. However, their food needs to provide them with the exact nutrients in the natural environment.\nThe usual diet for giraffes includes fresh acacia leaves placed in artificial trees to imitate the natural habitat. Giraffes will also eat special biscuits, carrots, and fruits along the trees.\nInteresting Facts About Giraffes\nGiraffes are ruminants, so their stomachs are similar to a cow\u2019s. This means they will throw up all the food and eat it once more, as explained earlier.\nGiraffes have these particular muscles right around their neck, which helps them regurgitate.\nThese tall animals have a stomach with four\nGiraffes have 21.3 meters of intestines.\nThe poop of giraffes has the shape of pellets.\nLast but not least\nGiraffes are amazing creatures that don\u2019t cease to amaze with their insides and exterior aspect. Due to their extremely long tongue and powerful lips, giraffes can easily feed themselves even though some trees have evolved and grown defensive thorns.\nBut there are so many more fascinating facts about these creatures, as you\u2019ve discovered in this article. What was your favorite piece of information?\nto explain this part is really scientific. do you want something like this? \u2013 In the rumen, the central organ of foregut fermentation of large herbivores, microorganisms ferment fibers and produce along with several other metabolites volatile fatty acids\nSharing is caring!"}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe - Twycross Zoo", "url": "https://twycrosszoo.org/animals/giraffe/", "text": "Giraffe Scientific Name: Giraffa camelopardalis\nGiraffes are distinctively tall animals who get their scientific name (camelopardalis \u2013 literally \u2018camel marked like a leopard\u2019) for their buff fur with brown patches. Their long necks contain just seven bones, the same as all other mammals (including humans) but the bones have ball and socket like joints that give them much more flexibility.\nThey live in dry tropical woodland, savannah and grasslands. Giraffes are non-territorial and are very sociable. They form herds on home ranges of between 5 and 600 square kilometres. These herds have no permanent members, with individuals coming and going as they please.\nWhen a baby giraffe is born it has a two metre drop to the ground and is walking in around 20 minutes! Nursing mothers form cr\u00e8ches until the infants mature at three years old. At this point males leave the herd, sometimes forming bachelor groups. Although the males continuously fight they rarely result in serious injury, though one male can knock another unconscious!\nA giraffe\u2019s tongue can be up to 45cm long and is prehensile. This means that they can control it like a hand to carefully rip the leaves off thorny trees without getting hurt.\nThe current threats to giraffes are habitat loss through human development and poaching for skins and meat. Traditionally giraffe were hunted just for their tails \u2013 used as fly swatters and good luck charms."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "West with Giraffes \u2013 Zoo Walks Through History", "url": "https://zoohistories.com/2021/02/11/west-with-giraffes/", "text": "\u201cAs the country teeters between a depression and Europe\u2019s looming war, a pair of giraffes, survivors of a hurricane at sea, left a wake of much-needed cheer while driven cross-country to the San Diego Zoo, where lady zoo director Mrs. Belle Benchley awaited\u2026.\u201d\nAs a book junkie, when I receive new book alerts I almost always peruse the titles. Recently, one particular work of historical fiction captured my interest\u2014the fact that the title contained the word giraffes certainly helped, but upon reading the description I discovered that it\u2019s based on actual events revolving around the San Diego Zoo in 1938. Sold!\nThe story begins with a centenarian named Woodrow Wilson \u201cWoody\u201d Nickel sitting in his nursing home watching a TV documentary on the near extinction of giraffes and other endangered species in Africa. Realizing that \u201cpunching all the TVs in the world wouldn\u2019t save the giraffes,\u201d he set out to document his story of how two giraffes changed his life forever. Hence, West with Giraffes.\nGetting to see a giraffe in 1938 was a pretty rare occasion. There were many reasons giraffes were hard to come by for America\u2019s first zoos. Traveling shows displayed them as early as 1837; however, they were difficult to capture and transport, making them expensive to procure. The first giraffes could be seen in Central Park in 1872 and in Philadelphia in 1874, and the first baby giraffe in captivity was born in Cincinnati in 1889. But by 1925 there were reportedly only five giraffes in the entire country. Many zoos simply weren\u2019t willing to take the risk or didn\u2019t have the funds. But in many ways, the San Diego Zoo had been built on risk taking, and Dr. Harry Wegeforth, the zoo\u2019s former director and then Belle Benchley\u2019s right-hand man, was darn good at fundraising.\nWith the necessary funds, zoo director Belle Benchley, the first female zoo director in the world, paid for two young Ugandan giraffes and one rhinoceros to be shipped from Africa in 1938. They were to be the zoo\u2019s first giraffes, and the city was excited about the impending arrivals. (Side note: these events occurred one year after young Nicky Arundel got his wish for giraffes at the National Zoo.)\nThe animals were loaded onto the S.S. Robin Goodfellow in Mombasa, British East Africa (present-day Kenya), for a 52-day, 3,200-mile journey to the coast of New York. In normal conditions this would be a rough trip, especially for temperature-sensitive giraffes, which were placed in crates and forced to endure whatever the high seas threw at them. Little did anyone now that in September 1938, during the final few days of their trip, these animals bound for San Diego would encounter what was then the most devastating hurricane to hit the upper East Coast, killing nearly 700 people. (And New York would not experience one as destructive until Hurricane Sandy in 2012.) The 130-foot storm-ravaged cargo ship finally reached soggy and mangled Brooklyn on September 23.\nWhat happened on that ship during the storm is almost too crazy to be true. Imagine waves so severe that a rhino is tossed overboard. Along with the rhino, the food for the giraffes was lost as well. The crate containing the female giraffe rolled and rolled until it shattered to pieces. She was presumed dead while every precaution was taken to protect the male. Amazingly, one of the crew saw the female giraffe move, so they covered and protected her as the storm raged on. When the storm finally abated they tried to get her out of what was left of her crate, but they were not successful. After three days of being fed pancakes (and the giraffes are indeed fed pancakes at one point in the novel), she mustered up the energy to pull herself up. However, as soon as she was upright the crew could see that her left rear ankle was severely injured.\nThe giraffes, probably only a few years old, were met at the Brooklyn dock by the San Diego Zoo\u2019s head keeper Charley Smith (\u201cRiley Jones\u201d and \u201cOld Man\u201d in the novel) and city truck driver Ed Seuss (\u201cEarl\u201d). As soon as Smith had apprised Belle Benchley of the giraffe\u2019s poor condition, Benchley contacted Dr. Charles Schroeder from the Bronx Zoo to assess her condition. Schroeder was a former zoo veterinarian at the San Diego Zoo and would later become the zoo\u2019s director after Benchley retired in 1953. After examination and treatment, Schroeder deemed the giraffe worth saving and cleared her to make the trip.\nThe hurricane survivors loaded into their crates in New York. \u00a9 San Diego Zoo Global. https://library.sandiegozoo.org/sdzg-history-timeline/#1930\nBut Charley Smith couldn\u2019t start the journey to San Diego just yet. After loading the giraffes onto the truck, they headed to the U.S. Animal Quarantine Station in Athenia, New Jersey, for a federally mandated fifteen-day quarantine. The 45-mile drive from Brooklyn to the quarantine facility through flooded and debris-ridden streets, avoiding potentially low-rise overpasses, was certainly a true test of how the giraffes might handle a drive across the country, which in fact had never been done before with the towering creatures. Benchley preferred to transport the giraffes by vehicle so that they could stop as deemed necessary to nourish and rest the animals. Train travel did not allow that freedom.\nBy this time, the hurricane giraffes had made national headlines.\nCharley Smith was certainly the man for the job. Prior to becoming head keeper at the San Diego Zoo, he had been with the circus since he was eleven years old, including sixteen-year gig as the lead keeper of the Ringling Bros. circus. Smith stayed with the giraffes during their time in quarantine, sleeping beside their stalls, nursing the female\u2019s injury, and getting to know these \u201ctowering creatures of God\u2019s pure Eden.\u201d After their quarantine was complete, it was time to load the giraffes into their custom-made, heavily padded 12\u2032 8\u2033 crates, which were large enough for the giraffes to lie down on piles of peat moss and straw. That was the plan, anyway, but the female giraffe had had enough of travel crates! Smith spent a few days easing her into the crate while attempting not to spook her, and getting kicked in return. They were finally able to leave quarantine on October 10, 1938. Westward ho!\nIn the novel West with Giraffes, Woody Nickel, is a seventeen-year-old \u201cdirt-farm rowdy, pure as a cow pie, cunning as a wild hog\u201d bound to escape the Texas Panhandle (and any law enforcement that might be looking for him). Orphaned during the Dust Bowl, he found his way to New York to work for a distant cousin. Determined to meet his cousin at that Brooklyn dock, he arrived only to find that his cousin was killed on board the Goodfellow during the hurricane. That is when he locks eyes with the giraffes (\u201cBoy\u201d and \u201cGirl\u201d). \u201c\u2026oh, those sky-high eyes of theirs. They\u2019ve seen the world.\u201d Upon hearing that the giraffes were bound for San Diego, Woody became determined to follow them to \u201cthe land of milk and honey\u201d and begin a new life.\nAs the giraffes were rolling out of sight, Woody runs as fast as he can through the flooded streets, passing dozens of reporters, and eventually steals a motorcycle to keep up with the truck bound for the quarantine facility. While hiding out at the barn in Athenia, Woody does his own acquainting with the giraffes\u2014sneaking into the paddock to feed them apples and onions, and checking on the injured girl. \u201cShe smelled of fur . . . and ocean . . . and sweet foreign farm dung.\u201d For a farm boy who grew up listening to his father prattle on that animals were nothing more than food, this experience was life-changing. As the giraffes leave quarantine, Woody jumps back on the stolen motorcycle and follows them.\nThe events of the twelve-day cross-country drive are difficult to decipher outside of what Smith revealed to journalists and \u201cThe Boss Lady.\u201d He did not keep a journal, so Lynda Rutledge takes creative license to fill in the blanks for us. She indeed fills our imagination with a journey full of colorful characters, tall tales, and deep secrets. Her fictional account follows the giraffe truck across the Lee Highway and illustrates the scenes of America in 1938. The country had endured a Great Depression, filling the landscape with Hoovervilles and shantytowns, WPA and CCC projects, and migrants searching for a better life. On the other side of the pond, Hitler was invading Eastern Europe, so the combined stress of world events and personal troubles were briefly assuaged by the sight of the traveling giraffes.\nWhat we called highways were barely tolerable for transporting people much less chauffeuring giraffes. Woody Nickel\nCartoon from the \u201cParade of Youth\u201d section of the Washington Post (October 30, 1938).\nIn the novel, Woody is able to stop chasing the truck as, after much begging and pleading, he is offered the driving job by Old Man after a falling out with Earl. With Woody behind the wheel, true to the actual events, the giraffe truck stopped regularly at auto camps under appropriate trees with the top of the crates open to let Boy and Girl reach up and browse. Another regular occurrence, this one fictional, was the sighting of a fancy green Packard, driven by a redhead full of determination. \u201cRed\u201d was an aspiring photojournalist trying to sell her giraffe story to Life magazine. \u201cShe had red curls all over her head, a fiery halo of raging waves she surely battled into submission every morning, and she was wearing trousers\u2014the first woman I\u2019d ever seen doing so in real life.\u201d Just when Woody thought this crazy girl had stopped following them, the green Packard would come roaring into view.\n\u2026the rig, the Old Man, and the giraffes were more home\u2014and more family\u2014than any home I\u2019d ever had. Woody Nickel\nOne of the aspects of the novel I enjoyed the most was the depiction of Belle Benchley\u2014sweet but tough, and highly respected. \u201cLooks like a granny, dresses like a schoolmarm, swears like a sailor, and still charms snooty zoo galoots with their fancy educations.\u201d Rutledge even includes reference to Benchley\u2019s encounter with an escaped baboon. Instead of running away from the crazed primate, she stretched out her arms and caught it in mid-air and carried it back to its pen. Benchley also once caught a rattlesnake by grabbing it by the back of the head. At one point in the novel, Old Man stops at the zoo in Little Rock, Arkansas, for the night to procure some medication for Girl\u2019s wounded leg. The director of the zoo tells Old Man, \u201cAny friend of Mrs. Benchley is welcome here.\u201d\nI headed to San Diego and their new zoo, where I\u2019d heard that the animals get treated better than the people. I hope to die there, I do. Old Man/Riley Jones\nIt is clear from Belle Benchley\u2019s memoir that she had a wonderful relationship with many of her keepers, particularly Charley Smith. According to Benchley, \u201cOur relations as Boss and Man-Friday are ludicrously funny, and when he thinks he is working for me I am overjoyed. There is no real bluffing and nothing underhanded between Charley Smith and me nor is there between any of us; we are all working for one end, here in the Zoo, though perhaps by different methods. There is not a man now on the animal staff who is not in the work because he would rather be in it than anywhere else in the world, and because he feels that his contribution is important to the Zoo and to the community.\u201d According to Ken Stott, a former San Diego Zoo curator, \u201c. . . she was such a sweet grandmotherly type. But when she was angry she made Mount Vesuvius seem considerably less dangerous. She also had a vocabulary that she kept in reserve that the [former] circus men could understand.\u201d The keepers came to call her \u201cBoss.\u201d She let them know that she admired their work, and responded to her with both respect and affection. Another indication that Benchley was loved by the zoo staff came after she found herself in the hospital for eleven weeks following an auto accident. The keepers and other staff members would visit her daily; \u201c[s]ometimes as many as eight would come during the same day or evening,\u201d she recalled. Staff would often sneak in some of the animals when visiting her\u2014baby foxes, binturongs, and other small mammals . . . even Maggie the orangutan. \u201cThis attention, the time for which had to be borrowed from their all too few leisure hours, touched me deeply because it showed that I had won a place with them not based on relationship of boss and employee, but upon friendship and confidence,\u201d she reminisced in her memoir.\nKeeper Charley Smith with elephant Queenie during a KFSD radio broadcast in 1930. \u00a9 San Diego Zoo Global. http://timeline.sandiegozoo100.org/1930/1930-3/\nCharley Smith would update Benchley via telegram during the twelve-day trek. However, from Benchley\u2019s 1941 memoir it is obvious that Smith did not update her as much as she would have preferred. When she sent him on a collecting trip to Africa in 1940, she noted, \u201cI am quite sure that we shall not hear much about Charley\u2019s trip until his return. He is full of talk and wit and fun when he is around, but when away he makes me wait for news day after day until I am nearly mad from worrying. When, finally, I can bear the silence no longer, I let him know that I must have news. He has often bragged, \u2018When the Missus gets tired of waiting for me to write she just burns up the wires. She telegraphs \u2018WIRE ME TODAY,\u2019 and you can bet she gets her wire.\u201d Knowing that the female giraffe barely survived the hurricane, I can imagine Benchley was quite worried throughout Smith\u2019s cross-country trip with the giraffes!\nAs the truck finally reached the San Diego Zoo entrance on October 17, 1938, the nearly unthinkable had been accomplished. Benchley recalled, \u201cI have never seen anyone so tired and relieved as Charley Smith when he drove the great awkward truck through the zoo gate, half an hour after phoning me from a suburb. But was he proud of the two beautiful animals! He done a grand job and he knew it.\u201d A crane was used to lower the giraffe crates out of the truck and onto terra firma. Initially they refused to leave their traveling carriers but were eventually lured out with onions. They were given names Lofty and Patches, the winning entries in a naming contest. They were instant successes, and beloved by staff and visitors alike. The accomplishment topped off what turned out to be a very successful year for the zoo. San Diego, already a world-class zoo, opened their WPA-constructed Reptile House and a zoo caf\u00e9. They also turned a profit for the first time in the zoo\u2019s 22-year history.\nLofty and Patches lived at the San Diego Zoo for nearly 30 years. During that time they had seven offspring, including aptly named D-Day, born June 6, 1944. According to Benchley, they were one of the few breeding pairs in captivity.\nRaffe (or Raffy), the first giraffe born to Lofty and Patches at the San Diego Zoo in March 1942. \u00a9 San Diego Zoo Global.\nI had read about the true story of the famous hurricane giraffes when I conducted research for my story on Belle Benchley, but I thank Lynda Rutledge for writing this work of fiction, which left me with the desire to learn more about them. I refuse to give out any spoilers about the novel, but I encourage you to pick it up. Perhaps you will fall in love with those giraffes and enjoy the adventures of Old Man and Woody as much as I did.\nWe had us an adventure, didn\u2019t we, Woody Nickel?

Fruit Fly Swarms Are Really Just Massive Orgies\nYou know that big knot of fruit flies buzzing around your fruit\u2026and your head. Yeah, they\u2019re hungry for more than just some overripe bananas. They\u2019re swinging.\nIt starts off slow, but still gross. Two by two the fruit flies pair up and start building arousal through what some call \u201coral sexual foreplay\u201d but what we call tiny bugs going down on each other. Then comes the action. Which, for beings which only live for a little over a month, last an impressive 20 minutes.\nBut wait, there\u2019s more.\nNo sooner has her first partner rolled over and fallen asleep has the female fruit fly buzzed off in search of more. A few more, actually. The female will keep trying out new males until she finds Mr. Right, or at least Mr. Right Now, and he\u2019s the one that will pass on the genetic code to her litter of little flies.\nEw.\n2. Petting Birds Turns Them On\nEver notices how the pretty birdies like it when you stroke their feathers? Yeah, well, it turns out they really, really like it. Like, a lot.\nEver seen birds mate? Have you noticed how it often begins with one stroking its partner along the head and back? See a similarity here?\nSo yes, when you pet the birdie you\u2019re getting them sexually aroused. They even start panting and everything. And if they barf on you? Well, that\u2019s how you know you\u2019re in. The offer of regurgitated food is like inviting you back up to their place for a nightcap, knowwhatImean?\nAt that point, you\u2019d best be careful. If you don\u2019t start giving them what they want, they might turn violent. Now we\u2019re not suggesting that you put out, but consider: nobody wants a horned up creature with a sharp beak and pointy talons going all pecky scratchy on them.\n3. You\u2019ve Probably Eaten Beaver Anal Secretions\nWhen open up the big book of \u201chow did they discover this?\u201d you\u2019ll find a nice large section on beaver butt juice in there. It\u2019s more properly called \u201ccastoreum,\u201d because a nice latin name makes even the most horrific things sounds okay, and you either eat it, smoke it, or you spray it on your face.\nNice.\nCastoreum is the yellowish secretion of a beaver\u2019s castor sac, which is basically the bladder they use to mark their territory. It\u2019s full of anal liquids and urine, all mixed together, and it\u2019s been used for years to bring out the flavor in vanilla ice cream, add a musky aftertaste to cigarettes, and add a fruity note to perfumes.\nAs you can probably imagine it\u2019s not nearly as common an additive as, say, MSG or xanthan gum, because it\u2019s not the easiest thing to acquire. Beavers are not particularly forthcoming about giving up their anal secretions to any old ice cream maker who comes along, so it\u2019s expensive.\nBut no so expensive that some makers of luxury items don\u2019t still use it.\n4. Some Frogs Will Make Homes Out Of Elephant Dung\nWhat do you do when you\u2019re a tiny 1 inch long amphibian and there aren\u2019t any nice leaves to make a comfy home under? Why, find a big steamy pile of elephant poop and cozy on in, of course.\nThe ornate narrow-mouthed frog get a lot of out pachyderm poop, as it turns out. It provides the essential shelter from the sun, and packs a ready-filled pantry to boot. All the bugs crawling through the feces make for quick, easy frog snacks, and the bits of food lodged in it that the elephant didn\u2019t digest first help round out the buffer. It helps that they can\u2019t smell any of it, naturally.\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s never lonely. A giant elephant turd is large enough to provide a whole housing complex for frogs and more critters. As respected biologist Ahimsa Campos-Arceiz wrote in his scientific report, \u201c$^*& Happens (to be Useful),\u201d \u201cA dung pile can become a small ecosystem on its own,\u201d because so many animals are eager to move right into a pile of elephant poop and make it a home they can call their own.\u201d\n5. Proboscis Monkeys Taunt Each Other With Rage-Ons\nA make proboscis monkey is a lot like your average frat boy. They\u2019re little dongs are pretty much always hard, and they\u2019re prone to being angry little buggers.\nThere\u2019s no telling if the two are connected, although one can imagine that if you had engorged sexual organs all the time \u2014 and we mean ALL the time \u2014 eventually you might have some emotional issues to work through, too.\nAll of which is fine. The part that is troublesome is that when they get all raged up and start taking it out on someone else, they use their stiffies to express their anger, and that\u2019s just\u2026rude? Inappropriate? Icky?\nAnd it\u2019s not just a once in a while kind of thing, these guys fly off the handle at a moment\u2019s notice. They\u2019re always shrieking and shaking branches and spreading their legs apart as wide as they can and thrusting their boners at things.\nJust like Friday night at the frat house.\n6. Falcon Breeders Let Birds Copulate With Their Heads\nLet\u2019s start this off by making sure everyone knows that falconry is awesomely cool. It really is. But it\u2019s also frought with a 5 alarm ick factor when it comes to how a falconer breeds little baby birdies. They let the male falcons fuck with their head. Literally.\nFirst, the falconer has to get the male bird\u2019s motor running. So naturally, the human will have to do a sexy little mating dance complete with come hither bird calls and everything. But of course. And if the bird likes what it sees and hears and starts to feel the call of the wild, it will fly onto the breeders head and go to town. Naturally.\nPeople being people, they\u2019ve designed special little hats to wear during this horrible act, to capture the falcon\u2019s semen and make sure not a drop of precious love juice is wasted. Then they do as nature intended and inject this into the female\u2019s eggs so that baby birdies can be born.\nNaturally, they\u2019ve got to get the females in the mood to present their lady bits for injection so there\u2019s more dancing and calling to arouse them too. It\u2019s a lot of flirting on the part of the human here, but apparently it\u2019s worth it to make sure the best birdy DNA is used.\nBut is it worth it, really?\n7. The Greater Short-Horned Lizard Squirts Blood Out Of Its Eyes\nSo, we don\u2019t know what you do when you feel threatened, but we are willing to bet that however horribly you react, the greater short-horned lizard still wins. Hands down. Every time. That is, unless you can do better than shooting blood from your eyes.\nThat\u2019s right. Shooting blood. Not trickling blood, we\u2019re talking real blood projection from the eye sockets splattering things up to 4 feet away. Like a water gun.\nAnd it doesn\u2019t even hurt. We think. At least, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any limit to how much they can do it, except maybe how much blood they have inside their lizard skins.\n8. Several Species Of Birds Keep Cool By Defecating On Themselves\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re hot. It\u2019s a sunny day, you live somewhere warm, and you\u2019re hot. What do you do?\nSure, you could find some shade. Or step into some air-conditioned comfort. Or, perhaps, you could go to the loo on your feet.\nIt\u2019s called urohidrosis and it\u2019s how some birds like storks, condors, flamingos, and vultures keep cool. It seems to do the same thing as sweating, except that instead of sweat these birds dripple excrement down their legs and call it a day.\nIt\u2019s an unpleasant way to beat the heat, but until they build nests with central AC, whatchagonnado?\n9. Bored Ducks Become Cannibals\nAlright, time for another hypothetical. Say this time you\u2019re bored. It\u2019s been a long day our floating on the pond waiting for someone to chuck stale bread your way, so what should you do to pass the time? If you answered drop by a buddy\u2019s place, kill their babies, then eat them, congratulations: you may be a duck.\nHere\u2019s a description of one such lazy Sunday afternoon: it starts with a bored duck visiting a neighbor\u2019s nest and grabbing an egg, then \u201cthe male Muscovy cracked the egg open and bit down on the fully formed chick within. With a snapping upturn of his head, he then swallowed the duckling whole.\u201d\nNow in case you think this is an isolated case, consider that there is an actual beak-trimming machine that made specifically to prevent a duck from being able to go all Hannibal Lector on his pals. You don\u2019t usually make tools for things that you don\u2019t need to do a lot.\n10. After Scorpions Shed Their Tails, They Die Of Constipation\nScorpions are pretty amazing. They\u2019ve got those wicked stingers curling up over their backs to defend themselves with, and did you know that if the stinger gets lodged in an enemy, the scorpion can actually tear it off and run away while the stinger keeps pumping venom into their would-be attacker? Sweet.\nEr, except what happens next. See, the stinger is more than just a stinger, it\u2019s the whole tail section. And inside that tail section is the scorpion\u2019s anus. And those tails do not grow back.\nBut hey, what happens to all the poop when there\u2019s no bunghole for it to come out of. Excellent question, and one to which it\u2019s likely you already know the answer. But in case you need it spelled out: the tailless scorpion is constipated for the rest of its shortened life. Physically incapable of relieving itself, it will gradually fill up with poop until it explodes.\nThis can take months. And it happens in stages. They get so clogged up that a section of their remaining tail blows off and all the built-up crapshoots out. Then it starts again. Boom. And again. Boom. And again until there are no more bits of tail left to release the pressure, so the last time they get filled up with poop ends with one final explosion of the poor creature\u2019s entire body, and 8 months of agony is finally over.\n11. When male bees mate, their sexual organs explode.\nThis is best not to dwell upon for too long. Male bees have evolved a pretty gruesome but effective way to ensure their DNA goes into the next generation: after copulating with the queen, their testicles explode and their genitals fall off inside the vagina of the queen bee, effectively plugging it so that no other bee can go and pollinate the queen.\nEr, not much more to say about that, really.\n12. Sloths almost die every time they have to poop.\nSloths are famously very slow-moving creatures. They spend almost their entire lives up in a tree, doing something close to nothing, moving very little. That slow movement also applies to the movement of their bowels: some meals can take sloths up to a month to digest so they only need to poop once a week.\nBut here\u2019s the thing: they don\u2019t poop up in their tree. It\u2019s one of the few reasons they ever leave the tree, actually. And for good reason: the ground is dangerous. Predators, and such. And since they move so slowly, sloths are easy prey down on the ground.\nSo pooping is clearly a big deal for a sloth, made even bigger when you consider that a sloth can lose one-third of its body weight from pooping. Think about it: what must it be like to crap out a third of your body weight in one go? And it really is one go. One long, squishy go that looks like a ripe banana. Wait, too much information? Too late for that.\nSo if it\u2019s so dangerous, and awful, why does the sloth do the equivalent of 10k run once a week to defecate on the ground instead of up in their tree? Nobody really knows, and there are lots of theories, but the front-runner is that it\u2019s probably for sex, to mark the tree as a place for other sloths to find a good, albeit slow, time.\n13. Flies are all-around horrible things.\nApart from being super-annoying, flies are pretty thoroughly awful. Everything about them is just\u2026nasty.\nFor starters, they eat feces. They literally roll around in feces and they eat it. So their bodies are covered in bacteria \u2014 hello typhoid and dysentery! \u2014 which means that every time one of the little crap-eaters lands on your food, you get to eat feces too. But wait, it gets worse.\nFlies don\u2019t just smear their poo-stained feet around on your food; they actually puke on it. They don\u2019t do it just to be gross, that\u2019s merely a happy side-effect; the reason they throw up onto your food is so that they can cover it in digestive juices that dissolve it down to a soupy substance they can suck through their straw-shaped tongue. So in addition to everything else, you\u2019re getting fly vomit as well.\nOh, and flies also lay their eggs in rotting flesh, and get to spend the first part of their lives as maggots that only grow into flies after snacking on whatever corpse they spawned inside.\nAnd they buzz.\n14. Hagfish may even be worse than flies.\nHagfish look awful, but the reality is they are much much worse than they look.\nNearly blind and completely toothless, the hagfish has a hankering for carrion, and they\u2019re not too particular about how they get it. Once they suss out the irresistible aroma of a dead animal in the water, the happy hagfish will find a way inside. They\u2019re flexible, so any convenient hole in the carcass will do.\nThey slither in, then begin to consume their dinner from the inside out.\nSo they are ugly, with awful table manners and horrible appetites. Could it get worse? Yes, yes it could. They are also exceptionally slimy. Like, to the tune of 17 pints of icky goo slimy. You know, on the off chance that anyone actually wanted to eat a gross little monster like that, the slime helps discourage even those intrepid predators.\n15. Sea Cucumbers are almost as bad as hagfish.\nThere are a lot of different sea cucumbers out there, more than 1200 species in all, and some of them really are shaped like cucumbers. Some live in the deep ocean and some in the shallows. But all of them eat poop.\nThey open their horrible little mouths and scoop the poop in with a whole mess of tentacular tube feet. But that\u2019s not the worst thing about them.\nThe worst thing is their built-in defense mechanisms. They vary from species to species, but are all awful. Some sea cucumbers release sticky threads to ensnare their enemies, which on the scale of things is positively benign. Much much worse are the sea cucumbers who violently contract their muscles and actually spew some of their internal organs out of their anus.\nFear not for the timid sea cucmber, though, for they can speedily regenerate whatever bits of themselves they shot out their assholes at their enemies.\n16. Snapping turtles can be trained to be morticians.\nThis little nugget of horribilia comes to use from India, where the sacred Ganges River flows. The river is famous for lots of reasons, and one of the more interesting is the Hindu ritual of bringing deceased loved ones to its waters for their final resting place. The rather icky offshoot of this practice is that there is an unseemly number of corpses floating down the Ganges.\nNaturally, the solution to a problem like this is to introduce something into the water that can get rid of all the rotting bodies. And that is why $32 million was invested into turtle farms. Snapping turtles, specifically.\nSince 1990, 24,000 specially trained snapping turtles have been set free in the Ganges. How do you train a turtle? Well that depends what you\u2019re training them to do. In this case, you want them to snap up dead bodies, so logically you train them to have a taste for dead, rotting meat. So from the moment they hatch, these turtles are fed on a strict diet of dead fish, which conditions them to seek out the charnel in the river and leave the living bodies alone.\nIt is so successful that when people bring a body in a bag, the turtles sometimes charge up to the shore and drag the bag off for lunch.\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n17. Tarantulas suck their food through a straw.\nTarantulas are, admittedly, pretty scary. There is something primally fearful about big hairy things with lots of legs and, you know, poisonous fangs.\nTruth be told, they are slow, fragile things that probably won\u2019t hurt a person, but that doesn\u2019t make them any less horrible to the things they do hurt: mostly insects but also frogs, toads, and mice, as well as the occasional unlucky bird.\nThere\u2019s no web involved, but they can make a tripwire across the front of their hidey-hole alerting them when it\u2019s time to pounce out and grab their prey and inject a paralyzing venom into it before using the fangs to finish it off. All pretty normal nightmare stuff so far. But keep going, now is when it gets well and truly horrific.\nIn order to eat their dinner, the tarantula secretes digestive enzymes into the critter that liquefies the body so that it can be slurped up through the spider\u2019s straw-like mouth openings.\nMercifully, they don\u2019t need to do this very often. After a large meal, the tarantula may not need to eat again for a month.\n18. We\u2019ve taken to hunting giant rats with sniper rifles.\nLet\u2019s talk rats. They\u2019ve had a bad rep ever since the middle ages where they were thought to be the carriers of the plague (although most scientists now think the real culprits behind the spread of the Black Death were dirty humans, go figure). But you know, while maybe they weren\u2019t technically to blame for the plague, they\u2019re still horrible.\nAnd what\u2019s worse than a rat? How about a giant rat? Say\u202611 pounds?\nTehran, Iran has had a problem with rats for a long time, but it\u2019s gotten worse. Like, 11 pounds worse. That\u2019s how big some of the rats are getting there. To combat the problem, there are now trained snipers on loan from the Iranian army prowling the streets of Tehran at night with infrared scopes on a shoot-to-kill mission against the giant rats.\nBut don\u2019t start getting all smug if you don\u2019t happen to live in Tehran. There are several species of \u201cgiant\u201d rats all around the world that can grow that big. Even common black rats can get very large under the right conditions because their growth plates don\u2019t fuse after puberty. They can conceivably just keep growing and growing.\nAccording to reports in the Middle Ages \u2014 which you can take with however many grains of salt because it was the Middle Ages, and back then those dummies even thought rats were the cause of the plague \u2014 black rats in Europe grew large enough to carry off babies.\nAnd just when you thought it couldn\u2019t get worse, rats are becoming resistant to poison. In West England, for example, rodenticide is completely ineffective on up to 75 percent or rats found there.\n19. Koalas are really gross.\nKoalas are not what you think. You might see a cute little teddy bear clinging to that eucalyptus tree, but looks can be \u2014 and in this case definitely are \u2014 deceiving. These nasty little beasts aren\u2019t built like us, and evolution has only given them one opening through which to pee, poo, and reproduce. It\u2019s called the cloaca, and in most koalas it is positively riddled with chlamydia. I mean, no wonder: they pee, poop, and screw through the same orifice.\nEvolution has dealt the koala some other questionable cards. The things only eat one thing: eucalyptus leaves. And wouldn\u2019t you know it, baby koalas can\u2019t digest the poison in eucalyptus leaves. The only way a baby koala can survive is by eating their mother\u2019s poo.\nWell, not poo exactly, but a slightly less digested waste \u2013 fecal pap. Right from her chlamydia-infected cloaca.\n20. Otters are murderous necrophiliac inter-species sex offenders.\nThe female otters are lovely creatures, adorable and sweet. Male otters should be registered as sex offenders.\nApparently, the kryptonite for these little deviants are baby seals, which everyone knows are pretty adorable and sweet in their own right. But these beastly little boy otters have a thing about raping them.\nAnd when a boy otter does the deed with a girl otter, the act involved holding her head under the water. Because boy otters are horrible. Girl otters don\u2019t usually have a problem with this, although sometimes they drown, which is a whole other topic for counseling. Baby seals aren\u2019t as good at holding their breath, so the act of otter-on-seal copulation often results in seal death.\nAnd sometimes, please please please don\u2019t ask why, the male otters are known to continue mounting the body of the dead seal for up to a week after its death.\n21. Ladybugs\nAw, cute, a ladybug. So pretty.\nOh look, it\u2019s got a bunch of eggs there. How nice, lots of little baby ladybugs.\nSay, what\u2019s it doing there? Oh look, it\u2019s eating its own eggs.\nHow awful.\nFacts and sources here.\nStory credit: Mark Oliver\nSources"}

Check out our ten elephant-astic elephant facts!\nElephant facts\n1) There are three different species of elephant \u2013 the African Savannah elephant, the African Forest elephant and the Asian elephant. Elephants are known for their large ears, tusks made of ivory and their trunks \u2013 which are actually a fusion of their nose and upper lip.\n2) Elephants are the world\u2019s largest land animal! Male African elephants can reach 3m tall and weigh between 4,000 -7,500kg. Asian elephants are slightly smaller, reaching 2.7m tall and weighing 3,000\u2013 6,000kg.\nLove animals? You\u2019d love our magazine! Ask your parents to check out Nat Geo Kids magazine!\n(AD)\n3) There\u2019s an easy way to tell the African elephants apart from their Asian cousins \u2013 their ears! African elephants have large ears shaped like the continent of Africa! Asian elephants\u2019 ears are smaller and shaped like India. Cool, huh?\n4) You can tell a lot about an elephant by looking at their tusks! Elephant tusks never stop growing, so enormous tusks can be a sign of an old elephant. Both male and female African elephants grow tusks, but only male Asian elephants grow them. A tusk-less adult elephant is likely to be a female Asian elephant.\n5) Until recently, African Forest elephants were thought to be a subspecies of the African elephant, but new research discovered that they are actually a separate species entirely. These elephants live in the tropical forests of Africa\u2019s Congo Basin. They have straighter tusks and more rounded ears than Savannah elephants.\n6) These magnificent mammals spend between 12 to 18 hours eating grass, plants and fruit every single day! They use their long trunks to smell their food and lift it up into their mouth \u2013 yum!\n7) All that eating means one thing, gang, an awful lot of poo! Each elephant creates about one tonne of poo per week, which keeps the soil fertile and disperses tree seeds. Elephants also dig waterholes and create footpaths, literally changing the landscape around them!\n8) In Mount Elgon National Park in Kenya, a group of elephants use their tusks to mine for salt in underground caves! They feel their way around with their trunks and eat the salts by breaking them off with their tusks.\n9) Elephants have created their very own sunscreen! After a river or swamp bath, they\u2019ll throw mud and sand up and over themselves to protect their skin from the hot, burning sun. Clever!\n10) Sadly, elephants are in trouble. Many are killed by humans for their ivory tusks, because they\u2019ve come into conflict with communities or simply for sport. There are far fewer Asian elephants (which are categorised as Endangered) than there are African elephants (listed as Vulnerable \u2013 at risk of becoming Endangered). Asian elephants also face threats from tourist attractions where people pay to ride on their backs or watch them paint pictures using their trunks.\nClick here to learn more about threats to the Asian elephant and what is being done to help.\nWhat did you think of our elephant facts?

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "10 Amazing Animal Heart Facts - NC State Veterinary Medicine", "url": "https://cvm.ncsu.edu/10-amazing-animal-heart-facts/", "text": "They can be as big as a piano or too small to see without a microscope. They may beat as much as 1,000 \u2014 or as little as six \u2014 times a minute.\nThey are animal hearts and they\u2019re extraordinary.\nYes, the human heart is pretty astonishing, too. The thing has its electrical impulse, so with enough oxygen it can beat when outside of the body.\nBut then again, we just have one of them. The octopus has three. And it just gets more amazing from there.\nBeat It\nThe cheetah is one of the fastest land animals, but its resting heart beat is about 120 beats per minute, similar to a jogging human. Here\u2019s the difference: While it takes some time for a human heart to reach its limit, usually 220 BPM, the cheetah can go up to 250 BPM in just a few seconds.\nReally Beat It\nThe cheetah has a bit of competition, however, with the Etruscan shrew. The smallest known mammal by mass, the Etruscan shrew weighs in at under 2 grams and has a 25 beats per second heart rate. That\u2019s a 1,500 BPM. It\u2019s also kind of cute.\nSizing It Up\nThe human heart is about the size of a fist \u2014 and a cow\u2019s heart is the size of a human head. The largest animal heart is the blue whale\u2019s, which has been weighed at about 400 pounds (and it is not the size of a small car, contrary to popular belief).\nBut the animal with the largest heart-to-body-mass ratio is somewhat surprising: the dog. Compare a dog\u2019s heart to its body mass and it\u2019s a .8 percent ratio. Almost all other animals \u2014 including elephants, mice and humans \u2014 have a .6 percent ratio. Another animal with a ratio larger than most mammals is the dog\u2019s ancestor, the wolf.\nSizing it down\nThe smallest animal hearts belong to the .006-inch long fairyflies. You need a microscope to see its heart, which is a tube running along its back. A new species of fairyfly found in Costa Rica is named Tinkerbella nana.\nRoom for Growth\nThe tropical, freshwater zebrafish is a popular aquarium addition, but it\u2019s the animal\u2019s heart that deserves the most attention. It has amazing regenerative properties, quickly closing injuries and mending itself back to almost full function.\nThat\u2019s why researchers study the zebrafish to uncover possible treatments for heart failure and other cardiac injuries. At the CVM, the zebrafish is helping us unlock some of the mysteries of the human immune system.\nTriple Play\nHuman hearts, like those of all mammals, as well as birds, have four chambers. The heart\u2019s \u201cthump-thump\u201d sound is the four valves opening and closing as they pump blood. But frog hearts have three chambers \u2014 two atria and one ventricle (you can actually see how it works in a glass frog).\nA Little Help\nActually, all reptiles have three-chambered hearts with one exception. Crocodilian hearts have four chambers, but unlike mammals they have an extra flap that can close to keep blood from going to the lungs. Researchers believe the blood can be sent to the stomach to aid digestion, which is just a smidge helpful when bones are often on the menu.\nDive right in\nMany animals decrease their heart rate while diving into water. An emperor penguin\u2019s heart rate dips 15 percent from its resting rate when diving and drops even more during long dives (in between dives it jumps rapidly, likely to replenish tissues with oxygen). A manatee heart rate cuts by half while on a long dive and seals decrease their heart rate from 50 to 80 percent while diving. By the way, seals eat squids, which, like octopuses, have three hearts.\nComing Up Empty\nThere are also numerous animals with no hearts at all, including starfish, sea cucumbers and coral. Jellyfish can grow quite large, but they also don\u2019t have hearts. Or brains. Or central nervous systems. It\u2019s working for them, though. They\u2019ve been around at least 500 million years.\nHow \u2026 cute?\nPairs of dragonflies and damselflies (damselflies are different than dragonflies and, yes, that\u2019s what they\u2019re called) form heart shapes when mating.

Let us know in the comments at the bottom of the page!\nSee More African Animals\nAfrican Animals List\nFor individual species (i.e. aardvark), we\u2019ve included the animal\u2019s scientific name and its IUCN conservation status (if assessed). For groups of species (i.e. antelopes) we\u2019ve included the number of species in the group and the group\u2019s name.\nAardvark\nScientific Name: Orycteropus afer\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe aardvark is a nocturnal mammal whose diet consists mainly of ants and termites. It uses its excellent sense of smell to find food, and its long, sticky tongue to capture its prey. The aardvark has thick skin to protect it from insect bites and stings.\nThe aardvark is an expert burrower. If threatened, it will retreat to the safety of its burrow. If no burrow is available, it will quickly dig a new one, reversing out backwards when the danger has passed.\nThe aardvark is the only member of the family Orycteropodidae, and the last remaining species of the order Tubulidentata.\nYou can find out more about the aardvark here: Aardvark Facts\nReturn to index\nAardwolf\nScientific Name: Proteles cristata\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nAardwolf means \u2018earth wolf\u2019 in Afrikaans, a language spoken in South Africa. Despite its name, the aardwolf is not a wolf or even a member of the dog family. In fact, it\u2019s one of the four living species of hyena, and a member of the hyena family Hyaenidae.\nThe aardwolf lives in scrubland (a habitat consisting of grass and small bushes) in eastern and southern Africa. It has a nocturnal lifestyle, sleeping in burrows during the day.\nUnlike the other three hyenas, the aardwolf doesn\u2019t eat large vertebrates. Instead, the aardwolf\u2019s diet consists mainly of termites and other small insects.\nThe aardwolf uses its long, sticky tongue to capture its prey. It can eat up to 250,000 termites in one night!\nYou can find out more about the aardwolf here: Aardwolf Facts\nReturn to index\nAfrican Buffalo\nScientific Name: Syncerus caffer\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe African buffalo is a large, powerfully-built hoofed animal. It belongs to the subfamily Bovinae, the members of which are known as bovids.\nThere are several subspecies of African buffalo. Each varies slightly in appearance and is found in a different region of Africa. The largest and best-known subspecies is the Cape buffalo, which is found in Southern Africa.\nBoth male and female African buffaloes have distinctive upward-curving horns, the tips of which can be over 1 m (3.3 ft.) apart in large males. The horns of full-grown adult males meet in the middle, creating a hard panel known as a \u2018boss\u2019.\nThe horns are used as a means of defense against predators. Males also use their horns when fighting for dominance in the herd.\nAn adult African buffalo is large, powerful and well-armed; it has little to fear from most predators; only a very brave or hungry lion would attack a full-grown buffalo.\nThese large animals are known for their unpredictable behavior and will occasionally attack humans.\nYou can find out more about the African buffalo here: African Buffalo Facts\nReturn to index\nAfrican Bush Elephant\nScientific Name: Loxodonta africana\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nThe African bush elephant is the largest land animal in the world. It stands up to 4 m (13.1 ft.) in height, and weighs up to 6,048 kg (13,334 lb.). Both male and female African bush elephants have tusks (only male Asian elephants have tusks).\nUntil recently, all elephants in Africa were considered to be the same species, the African elephant. Recent studies have shown that Africa\u2019s elephant population consists of two different species: the African bush elephant and the smaller African forest elephant.\nThe African bush elephant is herbivorous, eating a wide variety of plant matter. The species is found throughout sub-Saharan Africa, but its population is becoming increasingly fragmented.\nYou can find out more about the African bush elephant here: African Bush Elephant Facts.\nReturn to index\nAntelope\nNumber of species: 91\nFamily: Bovidae\nAntelopes are a group of hooved mammals within the family Bovidae (the family also includes animals such as bison, buffaloes, sheep, goats and cattle).\nAll antelopes have horns (although in some species they are only present on males), and most live in herds. Living in herds helps to keep antelopes safe from predators. With all those eyes and ears looking and listening out for danger, predators find it hard to approach undetected.\nThere are 91 species of antelope, most of which are native to Africa. They live in a range of habitats, including forests and grasslands. Antelopes are herbivores (plant eaters), and many species live in large herds.\nThe largest antelope is the giant eland, a species found in the savannas of Central Africa. The smallest is the royal antelope, which is found in Western Africa. It is just 25 cm (9.8 in.) tall at the shoulder.\nReturn to index\nBaboon\nNumber of species: 5\nGenus: Papio\nBaboons are monkeys in the genus (a group of related animals) Papio. They have long snouts and close-set eyes, giving their faces a dog-like appearance.\nThere are five species of baboon: the hamadryas baboon, Guinea baboon, olive baboon, yellow baboon, and chacma baboon. All five species are found in Africa.\nBaboons live in groups called troops. Troops range in size from 5 to 250 individuals. Male baboons use noises and visual threats, such as the baring of their long, sharp canine teeth, to establish dominance within the troop.\nThe conservation status of four of the five species of baboon is \u2018Least Concern\u2019. The Guinea baboon, the smallest of the baboons, is rated \u2018Near Threatened\u2019.\nYou can find out more about baboons here: Baboon Facts\nReturn to index\nBonobo\nScientific Name: Pan paniscus\nConservation Status: Endangered\nThe bonobo is an endangered primate that lives in the rainforests of Central Africa. It is closely-related to the chimpanzee. It is thought that the two species split fewer than 1 million years ago.\nBonobos can be told apart from chimpanzees by their lighter build, smaller heads, pink lips and black faces.\nBonobos and chimpanzees are our closest living relatives in the animal kingdom. They share over 98% of our genes, and are more closely related to us than they are to gorillas.\nYou can find out more about bonobos here: Bonobo Facts\nReturn to index\nBoomslang\nScientific Name: Dispholidus typus\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe boomslang is a highly venomous snake found in sub-Saharan Africa. Its name means \u2018tree snake\u2019 in Afrikaans (a language spoken in South Africa). This large snake is mainly arboreal (tree-dwelling).\nGreatly feared by local people, the boomslang is capable of delivering a bite that is potentially fatal if not treated.\nLike other members of the family Colubridae, to which it belongs, the boomslang\u2019s venom-delivering fangs are located at the back of its mouth. Snakes such as these are said to be \u2018rear-fanged\u2019.\nReturn to index\nBushbaby\nNumber of species: 18\nFamily: Galagidae\nBushbabies are nocturnal primates in the family Galagidae. Their huge eyes provide them with excellent night vision.\nThese small, monkey-like animals are expert jumpers. While leaping through dense vegetation, bushbabies fold their bat-like ears back for protection.\nBushbabies are also known as Galagos or Nagapies (which means \u2018little night monkeys\u2019 in Afrikaans, a language spoken in South Africa). Their English name is thought to come either from their baby-like appearance, or from the wails they make at night.\nReturn to index\nCheetah\nScientific Name: Acinonyx jubatus\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nThe cheetah is the world\u2019s fastest land animal. It uses its great speed to capture its prey, which consists of other fast-moving animals such as antelope and hares.\nThe cheetah\u2019s coat is pale brown / yellow and covered with distinctive black spots. The spots provide camouflage, breaking up the animal\u2019s outline against grasses and other foliage.\nThe cheetah is a member of the Felidae (cat) family. Although one of the larger cats, it is not considered to be a \u2018big cat\u2019 as it is neither a member of the subfamily Pantherinae, nor a member of the genus Panthera.\nThe cheetah\u2019s closest relatives are the cougar and the jaguarundi.\nClick here to learn more awesome cheetah facts.\nReturn to index\nCrocodile\nNumber of crocodile species found in Africa: 4\nNumber of crocodile species worldwide: 15\nSubfamily: Crocodylinae\nCrocodiles are semi-aquatic, meat-eating reptiles in the subfamily Crocodylinae.\nThese master ambush predators lie in wait in shallow water for their prey to approach. When the unsuspecting victim gets within range, the crocodile launches an explosive attack, capturing the prey in its immensely strong jaws.\nThere are four species of crocodile found in Africa: the slender-snouted crocodile, Nile crocodile, West African crocodile, and the dwarf crocodile.\nThe largest African crocodile is the Nile crocodile. It is the second-largest crocodile species: only Australia\u2019s saltwater crocodile is bigger! The Nile crocodile is one of Africa\u2019s most dangerous animals.\nYou can find out more about the Nile crocodile here: Nile Crocodile Facts\nYou can find out about all of Africa\u2019s crocodiles here: African Crocodiles List & Information\nReturn to index\nDesert Locust\nScientific Name: Schistocerca gregaria\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe desert locust is found in North Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia. Like all locusts it is a member of the grasshopper family Acrididae.\nMost of the time the desert locust is solitary and flies at night. However, under certain conditions \u2013 usually an increase in rainfall after a period of drought \u2013 the insects begin congregating and multiplying rapidly, forming huge swarms that fly during the day.\nDesert locust swarms can cover an area of 460 square miles (1,200 km2), and consist of up to 100 billion insects! These crop-destroying insect clouds can move at up to 124 miles (200 km) in a day.\nIt is said that a plague of locusts can affect the livelihood of one-tenth of all humans.\nReturn to index\nDriver Ant\nNumber of species: around 60\nGenus: Dorylus\nDriver ants live in huge colonies containing over 20 million insects. When food becomes short, driver ants march through the undergrowth in long lines consisting of many millions of insects, eating any insects (and occasionally larger animals) in their path.\nDriver ants have a sting, but usually attack with their powerful jaws. Their bite is extremely painful. Local people are known to use the insects\u2019 jaws, which remain closed even if the ant\u2019s head is separated from its body, to close wounds.\nReturn to index\nFennec Fox\nScientific Name: Vulpes zerda\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe fennec fox is the smallest member of the dog family. It is found in the Sahara Desert and other dry regions of Africa.\nThe large ears of the fennec fox are an adaptation for living in desert regions. They help the fox stay cool by transferring its body heat into the air.\nThe fennec fox has excellent hearing, and is even capable of hearing prey moving underground.\nYou can find out more about the fennec fox (and its adaptations for living in the desert) here: Fennec Fox Facts\nReturn to index\nGiraffe\nScientific Name: Giraffa camelopardalis\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nThe giraffe is one of the most distinctive of all African animals. With its long neck and stilt-like legs, the giraffe is the world\u2019s tallest land animal.\nThe giraffe\u2019s great height allows it to feed on leaves that are beyond the reach of other animals.\nThere is some disagreement over the number of giraffe species. Some authorities, such as the International Union for Nature Conservation (IUCN) recognize only one species. Others, such as the Catalogue of Life, recognize 4, and yet others recognize 8 species!\nOn the heads of both male and female giraffes are horn-like growths called ossicones.\nThe giraffe\u2019s closest living relative is the okapi, which you\u2019ll meet further down the page.\nYou can find out more about the tallest creature in the world here.\nReturn to index\nGorilla\nNumber of species: 2\nGenus: Gorilla\nBoth the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla are Critically Endangered\nGorillas are the world\u2019s largest primates. (Primates is the group of animals that includes animals such as apes, monkeys, and lemurs).\nDespite their fearsome looks, gorillas are mainly herbivorous.\nGorillas are members of the great ape family Hominidae. If you look in the mirror you\u2019ll see another member of this family!\nThere are two species of gorilla: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla. Both live in the forests of central Africa.\nThe eastern gorilla has two subspecies: the mountain gorilla and eastern lowland gorilla. The western gorilla also has two subspecies: the western lowland gorilla and Cross River gorilla.\nBoth species of gorilla are critically endangered. Sadly, poaching has been identified as the main cause behind the continued decline of both species.\nYou can find out more about gorillas here: Gorilla Facts.\nYou can find out more about the mountain gorilla subspecies here: Mountain Gorilla Facts\nGorilla Charity: The Gorilla Organization.\nReturn to index\nHippopotamus\nScientific Name: Hippopotamus amphibius\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nThe word \u2018hippopotamus\u2019 is derived from ancient Greek, and means \u2018river horse\u2019. It is a fitting name for this large animal, which has a semi-aquatic lifestyle.\nCommonly known as \u2018hippos\u2019, these herbivorous animals spend most of the day bathing in water or mud, only emerging at dusk when the temperature is cooler.\nA smaller hippo species, the pygmy hippo, lives in Africa\u2019s rainforests.\nThe hippos\u2019 closest relatives in the animal kingdom are the Cetaceans \u2013 the group of animals that includes whales and porpoises.\nYou can find out more about the hippopotamus here: Hippo Facts\nYou can find out more about the pygmy hippo here: Pygmy Hippopotamus Facts\nReturn to index\nHyena\nNumber of species: 4\nFamily: Hyaenidae\nThe family Hyaenidae contains four living species: the spotted hyena, brown hyena, striped hyena and the aardwolf.\nHyenas may look like dogs, but in fact are more closely related to cats. The animal group Carnivora (to which both dogs and cats belong) has two branches. One contains animals such as dogs, bears, and seals; the other contains animals such as cats, mongooses and hyenas.\nAlthough hyenas have a reputation for being scavengers it is only the striped hyena and the brown hyena that find most of their food this way. The spotted hyena (also known as the laughing hyena) actively hunts most of its own prey.\nThe aardwolf is the \u2018odd one out\u2019 among the hyenas. Instead of eating large vertebrates, it feeds on insects such as ants and termites. (The aardwolf appears near the top of this list of African animals.)\nYou can find out more about the spotted hyena here: Spotted Hyena Facts\nReturn to index\nJackal\nNumber of species: 3\nGenus: Canis (although not all members of the genus are jackals)\nJackal is a name given to three small to medium-sized canids (members of the dog family, Canidae), two of which are found in Africa.\nBoth the black-backed jackal and the closely-related side-striped jackal are found in sub-Saharan Africa.\n(The golden jackal, which is more closely related to the grey wolf than it is to the other jackals, is found in Europe and Asia.)\nJackals are most active at dawn and dusk. They are omnivorous, hunting small animals, scavenging carrion and also eating plant matter.\nThe conservation status of all three jackal species is Least Concern.\nFind out more about the black-backed jackal here: Black-Backed Jackal Facts\nYou can see a list of ALL of the members of the dog family here: Wild Dogs List.\nReturn to index\nKori Bustard\nScientific Name: Ardeotis kori\nConservation Status: Near Threatened\nThe kori bustard is Africa\u2019s largest flying bird, and the world\u2019s heaviest flying animal. It stands up to 1.2 m (3.94 ft.) tall, and has a wingspan of 275 cm (9 ft.). There is a large difference in size between male and female kori bustards, with males being up to three times the weight of females.\nThis giant African bird rarely takes to the air and is only occasionally seen in trees. It builds its nest on the ground.\nThe species is usually found in open grasslands in southern Africa.\nReturn to index\nLappet-Faced Vulture\nScientific Name: Torgos tracheliotos\nConservation Status: Endangered\nWith a wingspan of up to 2.9 m (9.5 ft.), the lappet-faced vulture is one of the largest vultures in Africa (the Cape vulture and the griffon vulture may be slightly heavier, but their wingspans are smaller).\nThe lappet-faced vulture is top of the pecking order around carrion. It uses its size and strength to see off smaller scavengers until it has eaten its fill.\nIn fact, the lappet-faced vulture is doing the other scavengers a favor; with its huge hooked bill it is able to tear open leathery hides that other species would not be able to break into.\nOld World vultures such as the lappet-faced vulture find their food primarily by sight. They lack the New World vultures\u2019 excellent sense of smell.\nReturn to index\nLeopard\nScientific Name: Panthera pardus\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nThe leopard is a fast, powerful big cat found in both Africa and Asia. Its coat is dotted with distinctive rings known as \u2018rosettes\u2019. These provide camouflage in the grasslands and forests in which this adaptable species lives.\nThe leopard is known for its great strength, and is capable of dragging its prey up a tree. By doing this the leopard is able to prevent its meal from being stolen by lions and other predators.\nYou can find out more about the leopard here: Leopard Facts\nReturn to index\nLion\nScientific Name: Panthera leo\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nOne of the most iconic African animals, the lion is a much feared predator that, like so many of Africa\u2019s large animals, is now threatened.\nThe total number of adult lions left in the wild is estimated to be between 23,000 and 39,000; that\u2019s around half the number of people who attend a single National Football League game.\nThe primary cause behind the lion\u2019s continued decline is persecution by livestock farmers who regard the animal as a threat to their livelihoods. Habitat loss has also played a major part in the species\u2019 decline.\nThe lion is the second largest member of the cat family Felidae (the largest being the tiger). It is found in a variety of habitats, including savanna, grassland, woodland and the edges of deserts.\nUnlike most cats, the lion is a social animal, living in groups known as prides. A typical pride consists of several females and their young, with either one or a small number of males.\nLions tend to be inactive during the day, and can spend up to 20 hours of the day resting.\nLearn more about lions here: Amazing Lion Facts.\nReturn to index\nMongoose\nNumber of species: 34 (29 of which have the word \u2018mongoose\u2019 in their names).\nFamily: Herpestidae\nMongooses are small carnivorous mammals in the family Herpestridae. There are 34 species of mongoose, although only 29 of them have the word \u2018mongoose\u2019 in their names. Mongooses are found in Asia and southern Europe as well as in Africa.\nOne of the best-known species of mongoose is the meerkat, which lives in desert and other dry habitats in Africa.\nMongooses are diurnal (active during the day). They have a varied diet, which includes insects, earthworms, crabs, lizards and other small animals. Mongooses will also eat snakes, and are largely unaffected by snake venom.\nYou can find out more about meerkats here: Meerkat Facts\nReturn to index\nMonkey\nNumber of species: There are around 153 species of Old World Monkey. Not all are found in Africa.\nFamily: Cercopithecidae (Old World Monkeys)\nAfrica is home to many species of monkey. Well-known examples of African monkeys include: the black-and-white colobus monkey, mandrill, vervet monkey (pictured above) and the five species of baboon.\nAll monkeys found in Africa are in the family Cercopithecidae, a group of animals also known as the Old World Monkeys.\nOld World monkeys are more closely related to apes than they are to the New World monkeys of the Americas.\nUnlike New World Monkeys, Old World monkeys don\u2019t have prehensile tails to help them climb trees. (Prehensile means \u2018able to grab\u2019).\nThe world\u2019s largest monkey, the mandrill, is found in the rainforests of Central Africa.\nReturn to index\nMosquito\nNumber of species: around 3,500 (not all found in Africa)\nFamily: Culicidae\nDespite their small size, mosquitoes are among the most dangerous African animals. Mosquitoes feed on the blood of a variety of animals, including humans. Although only a small amount of blood is taken at a time, the insect spreads deadly diseases such as malaria, yellow fever and dengue fever.\nMosquitoes use their highly-adapted mouthparts to pierce their victim\u2019s skin and draw up the blood. Chemicals in their saliva prevent the blood from clotting while the mosquito is feeding.\nMosquitoes are responsible for more human fatalities each year than any other animal.\nReturn to index\nNile Monitor\nScientific Name: Varanus niloticus\nConservation Status: Unassessed\nThe Nile monitor is one of Africa\u2019s biggest lizards, growing to lengths of well over 2 meters (6.56 ft.). It is widespread across much of sub-Saharan Africa, and is also found along the Nile River in North Africa.\nThis African reptile is often found by rivers. It is a capable swimmer, propelling itself through the water with its tail, crocodile fashion. Its nostrils are located high up on its snout, enabling it to breathe while in the water.\nReturn to index\nOkapi\nScientific Name: Okapia johnstoni\nConservation Status: Endangered\nThis shy, rarely-seen African animal lives in the forests of Central Africa. Although it has zebra-like stripes, its closest relative is the giraffe. The okapi\u2019s markings break up its outline and provide camouflage in the forest environment.\nThe horn-like projections on the head of a male okapi are called ossicones. (Both male and female giraffes have ossicones.)\nThe okapi is an endangered species, mainly due to the loss of its natural forest habitat.\nFind out more about the okapi at our Okapi Facts page.\nReturn to index\nOstrich (Common)\nScientific Name: Struthio camelus\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe common ostrich is one of two ostrich species, both of which are found in Africa.\n(The other ostrich species is the Somali ostrich. It was judged to be sufficiently different to the common ostrich to be declared a separate species in 2014.)\nThe common ostrich may not be able to fly, but it is a true record breaker. Not only is it the world\u2019s largest bird, but it is also the fastest (on land) and the layer of the biggest eggs!\nThe common ostrich eats grasses, flowers, seeds and other plant matter. In addition, it will also occasionally eat Insects.\nThe ostrich swallows small stones to help it digest its food.\nThe main predator of the common ostrich is the cheetah; one of the few animals able to catch this fast-moving bird.\nYou can find out more about ostriches here: Common Ostrich Facts\nReturn to index\nPangolin\nNumber of species: 8 (4 are found in Africa)\nFamily: Manidae\nThere are 8 species of pangolin, 4 of which are found in Africa. The four African pangolins are the tree pangolin, long-tailed pangolin, giant pangolin and ground pangolin. The conservation status of all four African pangolins is Vulnerable.\nPangolins have armored coats made of hardened scales. The scales are made of keratin; the same material out of which our fingernails are made. A pangolin\u2019s scales make up around 20% of its body weight.\nIf threatened, a pangolin will roll up into an armored ball. As an additional protection against predators, pangolins are able to emit an unpleasant smelling chemical.\nPangolins are nocturnal and insectivorous (insect-eating). Their diet consists mainly of ants and termites, which they capture with their long, thin tongues.\nFind out more about the giant pangolin on this page: Giant Pangolin Facts\nReturn to index\nPuff Adder\nScientific Name: Bitis arietans\nConservation Status: Currently Unassessed\nThe puff adder is a medium-sized venomous African snake. One of the most common snakes in Africa, the species is present throughout the continent except in rainforests and desert regions. It is most common in savannas and grasslands.\nDue to its abundance, the puff adder is responsible for the most snake bite fatalities in Africa. Its venom is highly potent and the species is known to be aggressive. It is a nocturnal ambush hunter that waits for its victims to draw near before striking.\nReturn to index\nRhinoceros\nNumber of species: 5 (2 species found in Africa)\nFamily: Rhinocerotidae\nRhinoceroses, or rhinos, are among the world\u2019s largest land animals. The name rhinoceros comes from the Greek for \u2018nose horn\u2019.\nThere are five species of rhino, two of which live in Africa: the white rhinoceros and the black rhinoceros.\nBoth African species have two horns on their noses. The species\u2019 prominent nose horns, and their large size ensure that they are among the best-known of all African animals.\nThe white rhinoceros is the largest of all the rhinos, with males (the larger of the two sexes) weighing around 2400 kg (5,000 lb.). The black rhino is by no means a small animal, with males reaching weights of around 1400 kg (3,090 lb.).\nDespite their names, both the white and black rhino are grey. The best way of telling them apart is by looking at their lips: the white rhino has square lips; the lips of the black rhino are beak-shaped.\nRhinos are herbivores. Their diet consists mainly of grass.\nThe conservation status of the white rhinoceros is Near Threatened.\nThe black rhinoceros is Critically Endangered, with a wild population of around 5,000.\nThe biggest threat to both species is poaching. Rhino horns can be ground down for use in traditional Chinese medicine, and are also used to make ornaments. Rhino horns are quite literally worth their weight in gold.\nFind out more about rhinos here.\nYou can read about the critically endangered black rhino here: Black Rhino Facts\nReturn to index\nRoyal Goliath Beetle\nScientific Name: Goliathus regius\nConservation Status: Currently Unassessed\nGoliath beetles are the world\u2019s biggest insects, in both their larval and adult form. The five species of Goliath beetle live in Africa\u2019s tropical forests.\nThe royal Goliath beetle is one of the largest Goliath beetles, reaching a length of up to 11 cm (4.3 in) and a weight of 60 g (2.1 oz.) in its adult form.\nGoliath beetles are herbivorous. As larvae they feed on rotting wood, whereas as adults they feed on tree sap and fruit.\nReturn to index\nSecretary Bird\nScientific Name: Sagittarius serpentarius\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nThe secretary bird is a large and distinctive bird of prey found in sub-Saharan Africa. It is known for its ability to hunt venomous snakes, but will also eat a wide variety of other animals.\nThe long-legged predator spends most of its time on the ground and rarely flies. Instead, it uses its long wings to keep balance when running, and also to hunt its snake prey; by holding out its wings, the secretary bird confuses the snake into not striking.\nReturn to index\nServal\nScientific Name: Leptailurus serval\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe serval is a medium-sized wild cat found throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa. It stands up to 2 ft. (62 cm) tall at the shoulder and has gold fur with dark markings.\nThe legs of the serval are the longest in relation to body size of any cat. It has big ears and a sense of hearing to match; it locates its prey by sound.\nThe serval mainly preys on rodents, but will also take other small animals such as birds and reptiles. It is active both by day and by night.\nThe species is usually found in savannas.\nYou can find out more about the serval here: Serval Facts\nYou can see a list of wild cats here: Wild Cats List with Pictures & Facts.\nReturn to index\nWarthog (Common)\nScientific Name: Phacochoerus africanus\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe common warthog is one of two living warthog species, both of which are found in Africa. (The other warthog species is the desert warthog.)\nWarthogs are members of the pig family, Suidae. The name \u2018warthog\u2019 refers to the fleshy bumps on the faces of both species.\nThe common warthog is widespread throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa. It lives in grassland, savanna and woodland habitats.\nThe warthog\u2019s tusks are used for fighting with other warthogs and as a means of as defense against predators. Both pairs of tusks are extended teeth which protrude through the animal\u2019s mouth. The upper tusks are canine teeth which grow from the upper jaw before turning upwards.\nYou can find out more about the common warthog here: Common Warthog Facts\nReturn to index\nWildebeest\nNumber of species: 2\nGenus: Connochaetes\nWildebeest are antelopes with upwardly-curving horns, long faces, shaggy manes and long tails. They are also known as gnus.\nThere are two species of wildebeest: the blue wildebeest and the black wildebeest.\nThe black wildebeest is found mainly in South Africa and neighboring countries. The blue wildebeest has a larger range, being found in across several countries in southern and south-central Africa.\nThe blue wildebeest is larger than the black wildebeest. It is grey with darker stripes on its neck and shoulders. The black wildebeest is dark brown or black.\nOver 1.7 million blue wildebeest take part in the Great Migration of Serengeti and Masai Mara. This annual circular migration, which is also undertaken by hundreds of thousands of gazelles and zebras, is one of the world\u2019s most impressive natural spectacles.\nReturn to index\nZebra\nNumber of species: 3\nGenus: Equus (also in this genus are the wild horse, the donkey, and two species of wild ass)\nNearly everyone in the world can identify a zebra, but far fewer people know that there are actually three different species of zebra: the plains zebra, mountain zebra and Gr\u00e9vy\u2019s zebra.\nAll three zebra species are in the genus Equus. That\u2019s the same group in which the horse and the donkey are found. (The group also includes two lesser-known species: the African wild ass and the kiang, an ass found in Asia.)\nMany theories have been put forward to explain the purpose of the zebra\u2019s stripes. Possible explanations include: camouflage, heat dispersal, creation of an optical illusion to fool predators, and to make the zebra less attractive to biting flies (experiments in which horses were painted with stripes back up this last theory).\nThe plains zebra is the most common and widespread zebra. It is found in several parts of south-central and southern Africa. The conservation status of the species is Near Threatened due to over-hunting and the fencing off of traditional grazing routes.\nThe mountain zebra is found in hot, rocky, mountainous or hilly regions of south west Africa. There are no stripes on the undersides of this species. The mountain zebra\u2019s IUCN conservation status is Vulnerable.\nGr\u00e9vy\u2019s zebra is not just the largest species of zebra, it\u2019s also the world\u2019s largest wild horse. The species is found in eastern Central Africa. The conservation status for Gr\u00e9vy\u2019s zebra is Endangered. Fewer than 2,000 adult individuals exist in the wild, although the population is now stable.\nYou can find out more about zebras here: Zebra Facts\nReturn to index\nAfrican Animals List: Conclusion & Related Pages\nWe hope that you have enjoyed this list of African animals, and have clicked on some of the pictures for more information on your favorite species!\nWhat\u2019s your favorite African animal?

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Reticulated giraffe - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticulated_giraffe", "text": "Species of giraffe\nThe reticulated giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis reticulata or G. reticulata), also known as the Somali giraffe, is a subspecies or species of giraffe native to the Horn of Africa. It lives in Somalia, southern Ethiopia, and northern Kenya. There are approximately 8,500 individuals living in the wild. The reticulated giraffe was described and given its binomial name by British zoologist William Edward de Winton in 1899, however the IUCN currently recognizes only one species of giraffe with nine subspecies.\nReticulated giraffes can interbreed with other giraffe species in captivity or if they come into contact with populations of other species in the wild.\nTogether with the Rothschild's giraffe, it is by far the giraffe that is most commonly seen in zoos. Its coat consists of large, polygonal, liver-colored spots outlined by a network of bright-white lines. The blocks may sometimes appear deep red and may also cover the legs. Giraffes are the tallest mammals in the world.\nTaxonomy [ edit ]\nThe IUCN currently recognizes only one species of giraffe with nine subspecies, one of which is the reticulated giraffe. All living giraffes were originally classified as one species by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The subspecies was described and given a binomial name Giraffa reticulata by British zoologist William Edward de Winton in 1899.\nDistribution and habitat [ edit ]\nReticulated giraffes historically occurred widely throughout Northeast Africa. Their favored habitats are savannas, woodlands, seasonal floodplains, and rainforests.\nConservation [ edit ]\nTo save the remaining 9,000, or so, Reticulated giraffes, several conservation organizations have been formed. One of these organizations is San Diego Zoo Global's \"Twiga Walinzi\" (meaning Giraffe Guards) initiative. Their work includes hiring and training local Kenyans to monitor 120 trail cameras in Northern Kenya (Loisaba Conservancy and Namunyak Wildlife Conservancy) that capture footage of wild giraffes and other Kenyan wildlife; developing a photo ID database so individual giraffes can be tracked; informing rangers of poaching incidents and removing snares; caring for orphaned giraffes; and educating communities about giraffe conservation.\nIn captivity [ edit ]\nAlong with the Rothschild's giraffe, the reticulated giraffe is the most common giraffe found in zoos. The Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs, Colorado is said to have the largest reticulated giraffe herd or tower in all of North America. Reticulated and Rothschild's giraffes have been bred together in the past. This was done because it was thought that the giraffe subspecies interbred in the wild. However, new research that was done in 2016 discovered that the separate giraffe populations do not interbreed.\nFew zoos have distinct Rothschild's giraffe or reticulated giraffe herds. The San Diego Zoo Safari Park, Bronx Zoo, and Chester Zoo have herds of just Rothschild's giraffe. Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, Busch Gardens Tampa, The Maryland Zoo, Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo, The Louisville Zoo, and Binder Park Zoo all have strictly reticulated giraffe herds. However, some zoos still breed Rothschild's giraffe and reticulated giraffes."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe Habitat - Animal Sake", "url": "https://animalsake.com/giraffe-habitat", "text": "Did you know that the destruction of their native habitat by humans has seriously affected the giraffe population?\nAt 5.5 meters, the giraffe is no doubt the tallest animal on the Earth. Sadly, that\u2019s exactly where our knowledge about the graceful animal ends. Have you ever wondered why giraffes have such long, spindly legs and a gigantic neck? Leave alone knowing the fact that these are the adaptations that have helped them survive their changing habitat, many people don\u2019t even know that they are only found on the continent of Africa.\nGiraffe Range and Habitat\nGiraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) inhabit the savannas and open woodlands of Africa. Their geographical range spans from Chad in north to South Africa in south. While that may seem a vast range for a single species, the fact is that today, they are only found in small pockets in this \u2018vast\u2019 area.\nIf at all, you can find them in the areas covered by Acacia, a kind of spiny tree or shrub, on which they feast. Adult giraffes have about 27-inch long tongue. These mammals love to feed on Baobab leaves as well. With the long neck, long legs, and long tongue, they are able to eat leaves of branches lying at higher level, where other animals cannot reach.\nGiraffes live in herds. Considering that a single adult male giraffe needs about 100 pounds of food per day, it is difficult to imagine how much food a herd of 8 \u2013 10 giraffes would require throughout their lifetime? Even more surprising is the fact that they live in grasslands, where trees are scarce, in spite of being armed with all the adaptations that suit feeding on leaves of higher branches.\nHow Do They Survive Here?\nGiraffes spend about 18 hours a day feeding on tree leaves, shrubs, and even grass at times. They mainly feed on the Acacia and Combretum trees, but don\u2019t mind eating the leaves of other trees when they don\u2019t get their favorite food. Half the time, giraffes lower their neck to graze on plants and shrubs below their shoulder level, while the rest of the time their necks are at an angle of 50 to 60 degrees plucking leaves of the trees above their shoulder level.\nTheir upper lip, and pink and black tongue, help them pluck fresh leaves, delicate shoots, and tasty flowers from trees. Though Acacia tree has thorns, giraffes either exclude them or cover them with leaves and their thick, gluey saliva, so as to ensure that they don\u2019t damage their mouth. A giraffe can store its food in one of the four compartments of its stomach and thus, can survive without food or with minimum food for several days during a drought.\nWhat about Water?\nTheir huge neck only has 7 vertebrae. The ball and socket joints in the vertebrae and the elastic blood vessels in their neck make it flexible. Bending down to drink water is very difficult for giraffes. Normally, they can see everything within 360 degrees with ease. But when they bend to drink water, they are in an awkward position. At that point of time, they cannot see their predators or poachers (which frequent the area in search of rhinos and elephants) and thus, are vulnerable to them.\nInterestingly, they have now adapted to this problem. When they see abundant water, they just gulp it. A giraffe can drink about 10 gallons of water in a minute without choking! And then, it survives without water for several days. For them, the morning dew or the water obtained through leaves is enough for survival. The valves in the veins in their neck ensures that they don\u2019t faint when they bend down to drink water.\nGiraffes need a plenty of open space, with trees and shrubs, and a source of water, which makes the savanna grasslands a perfect habitat for them. Humans are encroaching on the grasslands and destroying them. Like we said in the beginning, it is this destruction of habitat that is affecting the giraffe population. We are losing our natural wealth and disturbing the environment, which has already proved to be a reason for extinction of several species \u2026 and going by the current trends, the giraffe may as well be the next to go."}

Not only do the different subspecies have distinct patterns, no two giraffe have the same pattern. Of all the subspecies, the reticulated giraffes have the clearest, most distinctive blotches.\nGiraffes\u2019 long legs mean they take big steps when they walk or run. One step can be about 5 metres long. They can run very fast, reaching speeds of about nearly 60 km per hour.\nBecause of their long legs and short bodies, giraffes move differently from other four legged animals. They move the two legs on one side of the body forward, then the two legs on the other side. This keeps them from tripping over.\nBig heart!\nBecause of their 2 m long necks, giraffes need big, strong hearts to pump blood all the way up to the brain. A giraffe heart is the biggest of any animal\u2019s, weighing around 11 kg. There are special valves in the neck arteries so that when the giraffe bends its neck down, the blood doesn\u2019t rush to its head, and when the head is raised again, the blood doesn\u2019t rush back down to the heart. Such rapid changes in blood pressure would make a giraffe faint.\nThe giraffe has high blood pressure because the blood circulation has to go 2m higher than the heart to reach the brain. The skin on the legs below the knee is tight, otherwise high blood pressure would cause a giraffe\u2019s ankles to swell.\nBehaviours\nAlthough giraffes are peaceful animals, they will defend themselves from lions, leopards and hyenas which attack the young, and sometimes adult giraffes. Giraffes are able to deliver powerful kicks with any of their four, strong, heavy legs, and a well placed kick can kill a lion."}

Though healthy, he was genetically unsuitable for future captive breeding, as his genes were over-represented in the captive population, so the zoo authorities decided to euthanize him. Despite several offers to adopt Marius and an online petition to save him, he was killed on 9 February 2014. His body was then dissected and necropsied in a public educational class and then fed to the zoo's lions. The event received worldwide media coverage and generated responses from several organisations and individuals, including death threats to staff at the zoo.\nBetween when records began in the early 1900s and when the animal was killed in February 2014, five giraffes had been killed for similar \"conservation management reasons\". Since 2012, two other young giraffe bulls in the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) were also culled in zoos.[failed verification][needs update] The captive population in Europe stood at 798 giraffes in 2014.\nLife [ edit ]\nMarius was born on 6 February 2012 at Copenhagen Zoo where he lived all his life. The zoo has a policy of only giving an official name to a few selected animals such as elephants with the prospect of living up to 50 years or more but the keepers informally named the giraffe \"Marius\". Shortly after his birth, Copenhagen Zoo informed the coordinator of the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) for giraffes who, according to the Danish Zoo Federation, along with his committee tried to find a suitable location for Marius but failed.[citation needed]\nFollowing the recommendations of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) the zoo decided to put down Marius. In a statement, Copenhagen Zoo explained that:\nAs this giraffe's genes are well represented in the breeding programme and as there is no place for the giraffe in the zoo's giraffe herd the European Breeding Programme for Giraffes has agreed that Copenhagen Zoo euthanizes the giraffe.\nIn an interview with the BBC, a spokesman for the EAZA said that Marius had siblings with similar genes who were already in the organisation's breeding programme,(~) which meant that he could not add anything to the programme. He specified that Marius could not be considered inbred, refuting earlier reports.\nOffers of placement [ edit ]\nOffers to relocate Marius were received by Copenhagen Zoo, but none were taken up. Commenting on several offers the zoo stated that the offers did not match with the requirements of the EAZA. As an EAZA member, the Copenhagen zoo does not own its animals, but manages them. The zoo is also not allowed to sell animals and the placement of animals outside of the EEP is limited to those that follow the same set of rules as EAZA. The following offers were declined.\nEAZA member Krakow Zoo said it offered to adopt Marius but received an unexplained refusal from the EAZA. A last-minute offer by EAZA member Yorkshire Wildlife Park to adopt Marius into a bachelor herd in its giraffe house was declined, according to Bengt Holst because the wildlife park's space would be better used by a \"genetically more valuable giraffe\" than Marius, whose brother already lived there. Also declined were offers from two non-EAZA members, the Dutch Landgoed Hoenderdaell wildlife park and the Swedish Fr\u00f6s\u00f6 Zoo, as well as an offer by a private individual.\nAs the zoo was unable to find a suitable place for Marius, considered sterilization damaging to the animal's quality of life and did not want to send it to another EEP zoo where it would take up a \"space for more genetically valuable giraffes\", he was killed on 9 February 2014.\nKilling [ edit ]\nThe zoo had announced that he would be anaesthetized before being put down with a bolt gun, as lethal injection would make it unsafe for the carnivores at the zoo to eat. However, the euthanizing vet said that he used a rifle, reportedly a Winchester.\nMost media wrote that Marius was 18 months old. Bengt Holst, the zoo's Scientific Director, corrected this, saying Marius was two years old. He added that alternative solutions were considered, but not found viable.\nPublic dissection [ edit ]\nAfter being euthanized, the giraffe was publicly dissected. This was done in a separate area of the zoo, but accessible for those interested, including parents with children.[better source needed] Associated Press distributed a photo of the public dissection worldwide, heightening the attention to the case. Parts of his body were fed to the zoo's lions. Other parts were sent to seven research projects. The zoo's spokesman said, \"I'm actually proud because I think we have given children a huge understanding of the anatomy of a giraffe that they wouldn't have had from watching a giraffe in a photo.\" According to Bengt Holst, public dissection of deceased animals fits with the zoo's policy to educate people on nature and wildlife, and is a normal practice in Denmark. The main animal rights group in Denmark, Dyrenes Beskyttelse, supported the zoo's actions. Others have criticized the public dissection, questioning its educational value.\nResponses [ edit ]\nZoological organizations [ edit ]\nBengt Holst, scientific director at the Danish zoo, said that the amount of international interest had come as a surprise to the zoo, but also stressed the importance of a policy of openness. He defended the killing of the young bull based on culling for artificial selection. He said that giraffes in zoos bred very well and where this was the case, giraffes had to be selected to ensure the best genes were passed down to ensure the animals' long-term survival. He confirmed the zoo typically culls 20 to 30 animals every year, mostly antelopes, llamas and goats.\nEAZA issued a press release \"fully supporting\" the decisions and policy of the Copenhagen Zoo. Its executive director, Lesley Dickie, supported the killing and public dissection, and said that EAZA's position receives support from the International Union for Conservation of Nature. An EAZA spokesperson estimated that on average each of its members annually euthanizes about five large mammals.\nThe Executive Director of the North American Association of Zoos and Aquariums stated in response to public concerns that programs and procedures of EAZA vary from theirs.\nEAZA members [ edit ]\nDou\u00e9-la-Fontaine Zoo in France said Copenhagen Zoo had not broken EAZA rules, but called the events \"shocking\" and wondered why a more \"soft\" solution had not been found.\nDublin Zoo in Ireland was \"saddened\" by the giraffe's death, calling it \"cold, calculated, cynical and callous\".\nThe director of Hellabrunn Zoo in Munich, Germany said the zoo would never kill a giraffe or do a similar public dissection, which had left him \"speechless\". He said some animals such as goats and guinea pigs are slaughtered as food for predators, but without \"making a show\" of this, and that the killing of animals has been more accepted in Scandinavian zoos for a number of years, but he did not know the exact reasoning behind the Copenhagen Zoo's decisions.\nThe director of Krak\u00f3w Zoo in Poland, J\u00f3zef Skotnicki, expressed deep disappointment with the EAZA attitude, the killing, and the public dissection.\nMoscow Zoo in Russia condemned the actions, saying it did not support killing policies and instead favoured sterilization. It also expressed concern for the potential harm to children who attended the dissection.\nNuremberg Zoo in Germany supported the Copenhagen Zoo's actions. Director Dag Encke noted that giraffes had more emotional appeal than some other species and that the policy and actions had been well considered. With regard to the public dissection, he commented that children tended to have a natural curiosity, provided that everything was well explained.\nThe director of Prague Zoo in the Czech Republic criticized the public dissection, saying it \"...should have been done with a certain amount of dignity and not in the presence of the public and cameras\". However he also wrote that the killing should be evaluated \"after a necessary interval and from a number of perspectives.\"\nA vet at Safaripark Beekse Bergen in the Netherlands said euthanasia was considered less objectionable by Scandinavian zoos than by Dutch zoos, which instead choose to use bachelor herds and birth control.\nThe South Lakes Wild Animal Park in England supported the policy, writing that Copenhagen Zoo \"has a very strict welfare and ethics record and is a very highly regarded zoo in every aspect.\"[unreliable source?]\nA specialist vet at Tiergarten Sch\u00f6nbrunn in Austria stated that \"if a giraffe likewise would be born in Sch\u00f6nbrunn, which due to a risk of inbreeding could not be placed elsewhere, then a similar procedure like the one in Copenhagen could take place there\" but called the public feeding of the predators \"emotionless\".\nAnimal rights organisations [ edit ]\nDyrenes Beskyttelse, a Danish animal protection organization, said that it trusts the decisions made by the zoo and pointed to the issue of the large numbers of authorized killings and culls of animals like piglets and stags.\nDenmark's Organisation Against the Suffering of Animals repudiated the action as unethical, saying:\nThis situation should not have occurred at all. It just shows that the zoo is in fact not the ethical institution that it wants to portray itself as being, because here you have a waste product \u2013 that being Marius. Here we have a zoo which thinks that putting this giraffe down instead of thinking of alternatives is the best option.\nThe Born Free Foundation called for,\na review and amendment to EAZA euthanasia policies, to ensure healthy animals who can be relocated are not killed, and for increased transparency in zoos across Europe, with accurate recording and publication of the numbers of healthy animals that are destroyed in each licensed zoo in the region.\nPETA UK director Mimi Bekhechi has stated\nMarius' death should be a wake-up call for anyone who still harbors the illusion that zoos serve any purpose beyond incarcerating intelligent animals for profit\nPolitics [ edit ]\nEsther Ouwehand, Member of the Dutch Parliament for the Party for the Animals asked the State Secretary for Economic Affairs for clarification on the practice in Dutch zoos and request for more strict European regulation on breeding programs. In her response the State Secretary did not second additional restrictions arguing that the role of zoos, as preservers of the biodiversity of animals as is described in the EU Directive 1999/22/EC, does not compromise the individuality, health and well-being of the animal.\nPublic [ edit ]\nSit-in protest in Lisbon , February 2014\nMembers of the public started an international online petition directed at the Copenhagen Zoo to save Marius. Upon its closure shortly after Marius's death, the petition had collected over 27,000 signatures.\nCopenhagen Zoo managers confirmed that staff, including its head of conservation, received death threats by phone and email following the killing of Marius.\nOn 26 May, Bengt was elected as Copenhagener of the Year by readers of the Danish newspaper Politiken. The zoo director was nominated by the newspaper for his business-like response to Channel 4 reporter Matt Frei and for \"insisting that we should not change the world into a Disney World wherein no person ever dies\".\nIndividuals [ edit ]\nThe reported events quickly gained attention in many countries, and some examples from entries in the public debate are given below.\nJack Hanna, American director emeritus of the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in the United States, criticized the zoo's actions, calling it \"abominable, insensitive, grotesque\". He stated that such an action would never have occurred in the United States.\nBen Fogle, British broadcaster and adventurer, criticized the \"shocking lack of compassion\" in the dealing with zoo animals as the result of unsuitable funds for many contemporary zoo institutions.\nAlan Posener, British-German columnist, condemned the killing and dissection as a sort of entertainment, which he saw as based on a fascination of violence. To him, a zoo strategy built on Disney-like fairy-tales was actually preferable to instruction in emotionless and patronizing Darwinism.\nRobert Young, professor of Wildlife Conservation at the University of Salford, wrote that the case illustrated cultural and institutional differences in how zoos weigh aspects of the animals' quality of life. He discussed how some zoos may favour sterilization and increased longevity. Copenhagen Zoo, however, favours non-sterilization, fewer constraints on breeding and full periods of parenthood, though at the risk of shorter lives for the offspring.\n\u00c9ric Baratay, a professor in History at the Universit\u00e9 Jean Moulin in Lyon, France, and a specialist in the relationship between humans and animals, called the media transparency of the event \"very surprising\" as it concerns a baby giraffe, \"since giraffes are among the most beloved animals among the public\".\nVictoria Martindale, British animal activist, wrote that the case illustrated how zoos were unnatural surroundings for animals, and that the early death liberated Marius from \"years of imprisonment\".\nBrendan O'Neill, British editor of Spiked magazine, criticized mass media presentation of the events as an example of sensationalist press tendencies.\nWriting in the American magazine Psychology Today, Denise Cummins, a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science, questioned the precise educational benefit to children of attending the public dissection. Entitled \"What we Learned From Marius the Giraffe\", the article criticized the move, which it called a \"canned hunt-blood sport\", and insisted that the children would only learn that \"killing animals for entertainment is perfectly legitimate\".\nMarc Bekoff, American Professor Emeritus of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado, Boulder, said: \"The cold justification for these killings offered by zoo workers chilled and scared me. Furthermore, these easily avoidable deaths, perversely justified 'in the name of conservation', are horrible lessons for youngsters and run counter to global programs in humane education and compassionate conservation.\"\nSee also [ edit ]\nReferences [ edit ]\nFurther reading [ edit ]"}

When you use our links, we may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more\nHow many types of giraffes are there? In this post, you\u2019ll learn about the current giraffe species / subspecies classification. We have lists, charts, and guides for the different giraffe types (species and subspecies).\nGiraffe Species Guide\nWhat are the different types of giraffes? According to science, there are 4 giraffe species and 5 subspecies.\nBut it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that taxonomists disagree about how to classify the different types of giraffes.\nOne group (IUCN) says there is just one species and numerous subspecies. Another (GCF) says there are actually four species and five subspecies. Still others list 3 and 8 species of giraffes, with varying numbers of subspecies. See more on these below.\nOf course, the actual giraffes aren\u2019t changing. These are just different classification methods to classify these different types of giraffes.\nIn this post, we\u2019ll break this all down to make it as clear as possible.\nSo while there are at least four ways to classify giraffes, we\u2019ll go into depth on just two. The original (outdated) taxonomy and the current classification.\nFirst, lets begin with the current, accurate method of classification.\nFour Giraffe Species: Giraffe Conservation Foundation (Current)\nIn a study published in September 2018, the classification was fully overhauled. This classification method is becoming the accepted giraffe taxonomy.\nAccording to this study, there are 4 giraffe species, with an additional 5 subspecies. And the popular Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe is essentially eliminated as a species or subspecies.\n4 Species / 5 Subspecies List\nAccording to this new study, there are 4 distinct species:\nMasai giraffe (G. tippelskirchi) Northern giraffe (G. camelopardalis) 3 subspecies Reticulated giraffe (G. reticulata) Southern giraffe (G. giraffa) 2 subspecies\nHere\u2019s a chart showing the species / subspecies breakdown.\nImage copyright belongs to publisher of \u201cMulti-locus Analyses Reveal Four Giraffe Species Instead of One\u201d report Used with permission.\n3 Subspecies of the Northern giraffe\nNubian giraffe (G. c. camelopardalis) Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe has been absorbed into this subspecies of the Northern Giraffe. More on this below. Kordofan giraffe (G. c. antiquorum) West African giraffe (G. c. peralta)\nTwo Subspecies of the Southern giraffe\nAngolan giraffe (G. g. angolensis) South African giraffe (G. g. giraffa)\nWhat about the Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe?\nAccording to GCF, the \u201cRothschild\u2019s giraffe is genetically identical to the Nubian giraffe. As the nominate species, Nubian giraffe takes precedence and Rothschild\u2019s giraffe is thus subsumed into it.\u201d\nWhat does this mean? Basically, the Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe doesn\u2019t exist as a species or subspecies. It has been subsumed, or absorbed, into the Nubian giraffe subspecies classification (under the Northern giraffe).\nWhat about the Thornicroft\u2019s Giraffe?\nData from this study indicated a genetic similarity to the Masai giraffe. Whether it can be considered a subspecies or is actually genetically identical to the Masai giraffe will require additional research.\nBut the fact that it hasn\u2019t been classified yet, suggests that it\u2019s fate is likely the same as the Rothschild\u2019s giraffe.\nI spoke with a Zambian resident earlier today, and he indicated that the local wildlife lodges are saddened with this changed classification. \u201cTheir precious Thornicroft Giraffe is just a Masai now. Isolated group of Masai.\u201d\nTime will tell if this classification will remain or be adjusted.\nWhat Caused the Changed Classification?\nThe study was conducted by the Giraffe Conservation Foundation (GCF) and Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (BiK-F). And rather than just move different giraffe types around based on diet and appearance, they went deeper.\nAccording to GCF, they \u201cperformed the first-ever comprehensive DNA sampling and analysis (genomic, nuclear and mitochondrial) of all major natural populations of giraffe throughout their range in Africa.\u201d\nIt was this data that prompted the significant taxonomy update.\nThis study (Multi-locus Analyses Reveal Four Giraffe Species Instead of One) and subsequent classification is supported by many influential organizations and foundations, including:\nState of Hesse\u2019s funding program LOEWE\nThe Leibniz Association\nThe Giraffe Conservation Foundation\nThe Leiden Conservation Foundation\nThe Auckland Zoo\nVarious African government partners and international supporters\nThis study was authored by the following 9 individuals.\nJulian Fennessy Tobias Bidon Friederike Reuss Vikas Kumar Paul Elkan Maria A. Nilsson Melita Vamberger Uwe Fritz Axel Janke\nWhat is GCF?\nGCF is Giraffe Conservation Foundation. According to their site, GCF An international science-based conservation organisation that provides innovative approaches to save giraffe in the wild.\nUnder the umbrella of GCF, there are four member organizations.\nGCF Trust (Namibia)\nGCF-USA (Florida, USA)\nGCF-East Africa (Kenya & Uganda)\nFreunde von GCF (Germany)\nLearn about giraffe babies with these 17 giraffe baby facts.\nOne Giraffe Species: IUCN (Outdated)\nAccording to IUCN, there is one species of giraffe (Giraffa camelopardilis) and nine subspecies. This is the traditional classification method, and still the most cited taxonomy. Giraffes were first classified this way by Carl Linnaeus in 1758.\nLike many traditions, this method is no longer accurate.\nIUCN divides the nine subspecies this way:\nAngolan giraffe (G. c. angolensis) Kordofan giraffe (G. c. antiquorum) Masai giraffe (G. c. tippleskirchi) Nubian giraffe (G. c. camelopardalis) Reticulated giraffe (G. c. reticulata) Rothschild\u2019s giraffe (G. c. rothschildi) South African giraffe (G. c. giraffa) Thornicroft\u2019s giraffe (G. c. thornicrofti) West African giraffe (G. c. peralta)\nAs classifications go, putting nine giraffe types under the umbrella of one species is a pretty clean and simple method. Because this has been the standard, I\u2019m not going to go into detail.\nMore reading: Conservation vs Preservation\nWhat is IUCN?\nIUCN is the International Union for Conservation of Nature. According to their site, they are \u201cthe global authority on the status of the natural world and the measures needed to safeguard it.\u201d\nMore reading: 9 Facts About Giraffe Tongues\n6 Giraffe Questions Answered\n1. What are the Nine Species of Giraffes?\nActually, no one has classified nine giraffe species. The closest any classification has come is nine subspecies. This classification is the traditional division of giraffe types.\nBut because of the number of classification methods and changes over the years, it\u2019s easy to understand why there is confusion about the number of species and subspecies of giraffes.\nThe following point covers how opinions have changed over the years.\n2. How Many Ways Have Giraffes Been Classified?\nGiraffe classification has changed numerous times over the past 260 years.\nHere are the four most common divisions of Giraffe species / subspecies.\nOne species taxonomy: This is the traditional classification of giraffes. First classified by Carl Linnaeus (Swedish botanist and zoologist) in Systema Natur\u00e6 (1758) . This is the classification is recognized by IUCN.\nThis is the traditional classification of giraffes. First classified by Carl Linnaeus (Swedish botanist and zoologist) in (1758) This is the classification is recognized by IUCN. Three species taxonomy: Published in February 2020, Alice Petzold and Alexandre Hassanin expanded the classification to include three species in the Giraffa genus.\nPublished in February 2020, Alice Petzold and Alexandre Hassanin expanded the classification to include three species in the Giraffa genus. Four species taxonomy: Published September 8, 2016, this is the classification supported by the Giraffe Conservation Foundation, among many other influential partners. This classification is based on comprehensive DNA sampling and analysis (genomic, nuclear and mitochondrial).\nPublished September 8, 2016, this is the classification supported by the Giraffe Conservation Foundation, among many other influential partners. This classification is based on comprehensive DNA sampling and analysis (genomic, nuclear and mitochondrial). Eight species taxonomy: Published in 2011 by Colin Groves and Peter Grubb in \u201cUngulate Taxonomy\u201d (The Johns Hopkins University Press).\nOf these four types of classifications, the one species taxonomy has been the most popular for the past centuries. But the four species taxonomy seems to be the most accurate, according to the actual DNA similarities of the individual types of giraffes.\n3. Do Giraffes Interbreed?\nYes, but not typically in the wild. Senckenberg scientists have confirmed that the four giraffe species practically never interbreed. Most of these different types will never meet in the wild.\nWhile this is uncommon in the wild, giraffes have been known to hybridize in zoos.\n4. Do Giraffe Species Live in the Same Area?\nThe four species and five subspecies live in distinct geographic areas of Africa. This contributes to the limited interbreeding in the wild.\n5. Does Giraffe Taxonomy Really Matter?\nYes. A broad, umbrella classification of one species for 9 giraffe types is too broad to accurately represent the actual risks faced by each type.\nWith the IUCN classification of giraffes as one single species, they list giraffes as \u201cendangered\u201d as a group on the Red List. In their \u201cGeographic Range\u201d section, they do breakdown the types of giraffes (and their Red List category) according to what they classify as subspecies. But it would be more accurate if they updated their classification to the current giraffe taxonomy.\nMore specific classification means increased protection for vulnerable species and subspecies.\n6. What are the Differences Between Giraffe Types?\nIn this chart by the GCF, you\u2019ll see the key differences between the four giraffe species.\nImage copyright belongs to giraffeconservation.org\nIsn\u2019t that chart interesting? Their patches are all unique and beautiful.\nDid you know? Giraffes have the longest tail of all land animals?

Their claws do not retract, and are always extended providing extra traction, and the extremely long and flexible tail is used as a rudder for aid in changing directions.\nMale cheetahs are the more social, spending most of their lives in small groups called \"coalitions\", while females live with their youngsters until they are independent and rarely associate with adult cheetahs other than for brief breeding encounters.\nFemales can be promiscuous and have been known to have several partners over many square miles of territory. The cheetah is easily distinguished from the leopard and the jaguar by its black \"tear stripes\". -Cheetah Facts\nthe thrilling gamble of extreme acceleration\nQuicker off the mark than a Lamborghini, the cheetah is the fastest animal on Earth, capable of going from a dead standstill to sixty miles per hour in 3 seconds. If need be, they can maintain 70 miles per hour for the length of 10 football fields before they overheat and must stop.\nHunting by sight they will choose a gazelle, rabbit or young wildebeast and than run the target down, tripping it with a paw swipe or a body check and closing the deal with a choke hold.\nAfter the extreme acceleration however, the cheetah, exhausted, with its massive heart pumping at over 170 beats per minute, must rest and cool down.\nAt this critical time cheetahs often find themselves the victim of a lion, leopard or hyena pack and have their bounty stolen away. Giving up bulk and brawn for their streamlined and swift construction, cheetahs are no match for more robust carnivores and will leave the kill when challenge, and sometimes, in their vulnerable state, be attacked themselves, losing their lives as well as their dinner. - Cheetah Facts\ncheetah reproduction\nThe female cheetah is \"poly estrus\", meaning she will come into heat more than once a year. She will ovulate every 3 to 4 months until she is impregnated. While in estrus female cheetahs will mate with multiple partners but they don't stick around for more than a couple of days.\nA cheetah pregnancy lasts about 90 days. Before she is ready to deliver, the expectant mother will scout out multiple safe dens for future use. She will settle in a den and give birth to as many as 6 cubs, although 3 or 4 is most common.\nThe first 3 months of the little cubs lives is a dangerous time because she must leave them alone while she hunts.\nRaising a family on her own, the mother cheetah is tireless, fearless and cunning. She waits till the hottest part of the day when other predators are snoozing in the shade, to transport her youngsters one at a time from den to den. Every two or three days she will find a new hiding spot. When the cubs reach about 3 months they are finally old enough to travel with her. At 4 months they will start to stalk and hunt and will be taking down prey successfully by 10 months.\nIn an interesting twist, it is the mother cheetah who leaves her cubs at about 18 months. They will remain in a sibling group for another year or so, and then the female siblings will branch off on their own. Males will sometimes live alone, but usually they stay together in groups of 2 to 6 probably related individuals called a \"coalition\". -Cheetah Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Extremely rare in the wild, and not even photographed until 1975, several have been bred in captivity with the discovery of the recessive gene.\nKing cheetahs seem to be normal in all regards except color. Normal cheetah color pattern and king cheetah coat pattern side by side comparison shows the long mantle hair and thick stripes of a king cheetah -awesome king cheetah photo by Steve Jurvetsen\na girl on her own\nAfter the first eighteen months of life spent with her mom and siblings, female cheetahs head off to live, hunt, mate and raise young all on their own.\nIn a life pattern vastly different from other animals, male cheetahs will remain in very social groups of 2 to 6 usually related males called \"coalitions\" their entire lives.\nThis flip-flop of gender role structure is extremely unique and the exact opposite of what usually occurs in the kingdom of mammals. -Cheetah Facts\na few more cheetah facts\nThe cheetahs claws do not retract\nCheetahs use the \"chase-trip-bite\" hunting method, using one front paw to send their prey into a tumble and then killing with a strong squeeze of the neck..\nThe average cheetahs top speed is probably about 65mph, with some exceptional individuals reaching up to 70mph for no more than 3-4 seconds.\nThe cheetahs extremely flexible spine is the main reason it is so much faster than other speedy animals.

Both are in the Giraffidae family, with girafffes in the Giraffa genus and okapi in the Okapia genus.\nAdvertisement\nGiraffidae are ruminants, and share a common ancestor with deer and bovids. On first sight, the two Giraffidae look quite different but do share a number of similar features, including a long, dark-coloured tongue.\nIn the okapi, the tongue can measure between 14 and 18 inches long and they can lick their own ears and eyelids.\nCloseup of an okapi eating leaves from a tree. \u00a9 Thorsten Spoerlein/Getty (photographed in captivity)\nWhere do okapi live?\nUnlike their giraffe relatives, okapi are not found in open savannas but instead live in dense rainforest. Currently they are only found in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but in the recent past, they were also found in the Semliki forest of Uganda.\nWhen were okapi discovered?\nThe okapi wasn't discovered by western scientists until the 1900s. Explorers in the 1880s heard rumours of a striped donkey, and it was named as a species (Okapia jonstoni) in 1901.\nIt was named 'Okapia' after the local word 'o'api' and 'jonstoni' in recognition of the British governor of Uganda, Sir Harry Johnston, who acquired an okapi specimen.\nDo okapi live in groups?\nOkapi are solitary animals, though their home ranges will overlap. These ranges average 3-5 km2 for adult females and up to 13 km2 for adult males.\nOkapi in captivity. \u00a9 Jurgen & Christine Sohns/Getty\nAre okapi endangered? What are they threatened by?\nOkapi are hunted for meat and skins, and a major threat to this species is habitat loss due to logging and human settlement.\nIllegal armed groups in some protected areas have prevented effective conservation action. In June 2012, the R\u00e9serve de Faune \u00e0 Okapis HQ was attacked, during which seven people and 14 captive okapi were killed.\nThe species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List.\nWhat do okapi eat?\nOkapi are known to feed on over 100 species of plants, and whilst they are diurnal, they have been recorded feeding at night. They are the only species of forest ungulate which depends on understory foliage.\nAn okapi's tongue can reach between 14 and 18 inches in length. \u00a9 Juergen and Christine Sohns/Getty (photographed in captivity)\nHow many babies does a female give birth to?\nOkapi gestation lasts between 14 and 16 months, and a female okapi gives birth to one calf. This calf says in one place for the first six to nine weeks, to avoid leopards.\nTo stay in contact with their calves in the dense rainforest, female okapi produce an infrasonic call at around 14Hz, which cannot be heard by humans.\nAdvertisement\nMain image: Wild okapi are only found in the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of Congo. \u00a9 Mint Images/Frans Lanting/Getty (photographed in captivity)"}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Echidna Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Echidna-facts.html", "text": "echidna Facts\nPortrait of an echidna\nThe coolest of all echidna facts is that they are a living \"missing link\" between mammals and reptiles. The echidna, and its only living relative the duckbill platypus, are monotremes, or egg-laying mammals. Of the 28 different orders of mammals, the monotremes are by far the most unique.\nSome scientists suggest they should be further separated from mammals and placed in their own classification.\nAlthough the echidna lays eggs, it also has hair and produces milk, so for those reasons it is considered a mammal. In fact, the echidna is the most primitive and most ancient living mammal. They can be found in Australia and southern New Guinea, and are basically insect-eaters living on worms, grubs, ants and termites, but they are not closely related to the anteaters, despite the common name \"spiny anteater.\"\nThey are also no relation to porcupines or hedgehogs, even though they covered with similar modified hollow hairs, known as spines. The echidnas spines are closer in construction to those of the hedgehog. They do not have barbs and they do not detach like porcupine quills, and are not toxic or poisonous as is sometimes reported.\nThe echidnas stout spines extend passed the length of their coarse fur and serve as their only line of defense against the myriad of animals that consider eating them. Passive and shy, these somewhat slow-moving creatures will roll up in a ball for protection.\nThey also wedge themselves between rocks or branches, their spines locking them in place and making them very difficult for a predator to extract. They may also attempt to quickly bury themselves in the sand or soil revealing just a layer of spines to discourage an attacking dingo, Tasmanian devil, or monitor lizard, but dingoes are known to roll them around till they are so dizzy and exhausted they eventually expose some softer parts of themselves. Tasmanian devils are known to eat them spines and all.\nThere are four species of echidna. The short-beaked echidna, which is the most common and widely distributed, and the Western long-beaked, Eastern long-beaked and Sir David's long beaked echidnas.\nThe long-beaked species are larger, with, as you might guess, a longer beak - sometimes as long as 8 inches. They can be almost 3 feet long and weigh over 25 pounds.\nThe short-beaked echidna averages 12 to 18 inches in length and can weigh up to 16 pounds. Males of all species are 20 to 30 percent larger than females.\nEchidnas are solitary, waddling, basically peaceful animals. They live in a variety of environments throughout Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea, from snowy mountains to near desert, foraging for insects by using their strong, flattened claws to dig through soil and sand or rip open ant mounds and rotted logs. They can consume hundreds of insects at a time, licking them up with their long, tongue which is covered with thick, sticky saliva.\nEchidnas have particularly large saliva glands to aid in the capture of insects, but also to assist in digestion. Instead of teeth, echidnas have hard pads on the roof of the mouth and the back of the tongue between which they grind up their food. The mouth is very small and they often have to crush larger insects with their claws before licking up the pulp. Their tongue is lightning fast and inspired the name of the short-beaked's genus - tachyglossus, meaning \"fast tongue\".\nThey are nocturnal in the warmer, lower elevations, sleeping during the day to avoid the heat. In cooler areas they may be most active at dawn and dusk, and populations throughout southern Australia tend to be active throughout the day. Some have adapted to urban environments, where they limit their activities to the wee hours, and often live completely undetected by humans.\nIs the echidna a mammal or a reptile?\nThe echidnas egg-laying is not the only thing that makes it seem reptilian, in fact there are a whole bunch of physical features that are very lizard-like.\nFirst, their body temperature, although not actually cold-blooded like a reptile, (unable to maintain its own warmth), is considerably lower than that of a mammal, and does not remain stable. It ranges from 86 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit, and echidnas may go into torpor - a kind of hibernation - several times a year if the temps dip too low.\nSeveral bones of the echidna skeleton, most notably in the shoulder and skull, are reptilian in structure. The set of the shoulder girdle angles the front limbs out horizontally from the sides and than down, like a crocodile, and is distinctly reptilian in design.\nIn both sexes the intestines, the ducts of the excretory system, and the genital ducts all open into a common chamber known as the cloaca, with just one external opening. This one opening is where the name for the order monotremata comes from, mono meaning one, trema meaning orafice or opening. Reptiles and birds have a cloaca too.\nThe male echidna's penis is somewhat reptilian in that it is retained in the cloaca, and only extends away from the body when erect. It is quite bizarre as well, with the tip having 4 small heads, only 2 of which are used at a time.\nAll mammals have some degree of external ear structure known as the \"pinna\", except the platypus and the echidnas who have no pinna. But the spines around the ear opening move to capture sounds, just like some external ears might, and the echidna has excellent hearing.\nEchidnas also have electroreceptors in the tip of the beak which help them locate insects, particularly earthworms, underground. The only other mammal with such abilities that we know of is a species of dolphin. Fish of all kinds, however, can detect electrical signals with a variety of electric organs, some located near the tail. But sharks are considered the most electrically sensative creatures on Earth.\nSo what traits make the echidna more mammal? Well, although some of the echidnas skeleton points to reptiles, the jaw and the middle ear are decidedly mammalian. The brain and heart as well. Also, echidnas have hair, which is exclusive to mammals, - two types of hair in fact, both body fur and spines.\nBut the word \"mammal\" refers to mammary glands, and the ability of a mammal mother to nourish young with milk produced by her own body. Echidnas have mammary glands, and their young are nourished by their own milk, hence, mammal.\nechidna reproduction\nlong-beaked echidna\nThe echidna is a solitary animal except come mating season of course. Males are attracted to females and groups of them may follow her around for days in a single file line called an \"echidna train.\" When she is ready to mate, she may engage a few of the suitors. With all the spines, mounting is a little tricky, and males will actually dig a little trench out behind the female to get lower than her and improve their angle. Once mating is complete, the female digs a burrow which will be her nursery for several few months. Echidnas do not have a permanent pouch like a kangaroo, but instead, as their mammary glands swell during her 22 day pregnancy, the extra tissue creates a rearward facing \"pouch\" of skin on her belly that she will lay her single egg directly into. Echidna eggs are not hard-shelled like a bird, but have a leathery texture like a snake egg. After 10 days in the pouch, the baby rips open the relatively soft shell with a special \"egg tooth\", a sharp little tip on the top lip that soon drops off. The newly hatched baby echidna is called a \"puggle\", and is somewhat like a larva at this stage, pink, bald, blind, incompletely formed, and quite helpless at only an inch long. The echidna mother does not have nipples. She excretes milk through the pores of two patches of skin inside the pouch called \"milk patches\". The baby begins to develop spines in 2 to 3 months, and must leave the pouch, but the mother continues to nurse it for up to 7 months. She will leave the puggle in the burrow for a few days at a time and only return to feed it 2 or 3 times a week. The mother's milk is very rich, however, and the baby is content to nestle in the burrow. At 5 months or so the baby is venturing out and foraging on its own. Once it is completely weaned, the mother will not return, but the baby may stay and use the burrow for up to a year after.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "The 10 Weirdest Animal Facts - ThoughtCo", "url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/weirdest-animal-facts-4116013", "text": "Some animal facts are weirder than others. Yes, we all know that cheetahs can run faster than motorcycles, and that bats navigate using sound waves, but those tidbits of information aren't nearly as entertaining as immortal jellyfish, butt-breathing turtles, and three-hearted octopuses. Below you'll discover 10 truly weird (and true) facts about 10 truly weird (and real) animals.\n01 of 10 Female Spotted Hyenas Have a Penis Getty Images Okay, it may be a bit of an overstatement to say that the female spotted hyena has a penis: more accurately, the clitoris of the female closely resembles the penis of the male, to the extent that only a very brave naturalist (presumably wearing gloves and protective headgear) could hope to tell the difference. (For the record, the female's sex organ is slightly thicker, with a more rounded head than that sported by males.) Only slightly less weirdly, spotted hyena females are dominant during courtship and mating, and prefer to hook up with younger males; clearly they're the \"cougars\" of the mammal family.\n02 of 10 Killer Whales Experience Menopause Getty Images The menopause of human females is one of the mysteries of evolution: wouldn't it be better for our species if women could give birth throughout their lives, rather than becoming infertile around the age of 50? This enigma isn't diminished by the fact that only two other mammals are known to experience menopause: the short-finned pilot whale and the orca, or killer whale. Female killer whales stop bearing children when they reach their 30's or 40's; one possible explanation is that elderly females, undistracted by the demands of pregnancy and birth, are better able to guide their pods. This is the same \"grandmother effect\" that has been proposed for elderly human females, who provide inexhaustible supplies of wisdom (and babysitting).\n03 of 10 Some Turtles Breathe Through Their Butts Wikimedia Commons A handful of turtle species\u2014including the North American eastern painted turtle and the Australian white-throated snapping turtle\u2014have specialized sacs near their cloacas (the organs used for defecating, urinating, and copulating) that collect air and filter out oxygen. However, these turtles are also equipped with perfectly good lungs, which begs the question: why breathe through your butt when your mouth will do? The answer likely has something to do with the tradeoffs between hard, protective shells and the mechanics of respiration; apparently, for these turtles, butt-breathing is less metabolically demanding than mouth-breathing.\n04 of 10 One Species of Jellyfish Is Immortal Getty Images Before we talk about immortal jellyfish, it's necessary to define our terms. Turritopsis dohrnii will definitely kick the marine bucket if you step on it, pan-fry it, or torch it with a flamethrower. What it won't do, however, is die of old age; the adults of this jellyfish species can reverse their life cycles all the way back to the polyp stage, and (theoretically) repeat this process an indefinite number of times. We say \"theoretically\" because, in practice, it's virtually impossible for a single T. dohrnii to survive for more than a few years; that would require a given individual (either polyp or adult) to avoid getting eaten by other marine organisms.\n05 of 10 Koala Bears Have Human Fingerprints Getty Images They may seem cute and cuddly, but koala bears are extremely devious: not only are they marsupials (pouched mammals) rather than true bears, but they have somehow managed to evolve fingerprints virtually indistinguishable from those of human beings, even under an electron microscope. Since human beings and koala bears occupy widely separated branches on the tree of life, the only explanation for this coincidence is convergent evolution: just as early Homo sapiens needed a way to firmly grasp primitive tools, koala bears needed a way to grasp the slippery bark of eucalyptus trees.\n06 of 10 It's Almost Impossible to Kill a Tardigrade Getty Images Tardigrades\u2014also known as water bears\u2014are microscopic, eight-legged, vaguely repulsive-looking creatures that can be found pretty much everywhere on earth. But the weirdest thing about tardigrades, apart from their nightmarish appearance, is that they're pretty much indestructible: these invertebrate animals can survive prolonged exposure to the vacuum of deep space, endure bursts of ionizing radiation that would fry an elephant, go without food or water for up to 30 years, and prosper in terrestrial environments (Arctic tundra, deep-sea vents) that would kill most other animals, including human beings.\n07 of 10 Male Seahorses Give Birth to Young Getty Images You might think the spotted hyena (previous slide) is the last word for gender equality in the animal kingdom, but you don't know about seahorses yet. These marine invertebrates pair up for elaborate, intricately choreographed mating rituals, after which the female deposits her eggs into a pouch on the male's tail. The male carries the fertilized eggs for two to eight weeks (depending on species), its tail slowly swelling up, and then releases up to a thousand tiny seahorse babies to their fate (which mostly involves being eaten by other marine creatures; sadly, only one-half of one percent of seahorse hatchlings manage to survive into adulthood).\n08 of 10 Three-Toed Sloths Wear Algae Coats Getty Images Just how slow is the three-toed sloth? Not much faster than you saw in the movie Zootopia; this South American mammal, when it isn't entirely motionless, can hit top speeds of a blazing 0.15 miles per hour. In fact, Bradypus tridactylus is so crepuscular that it can easily be overtaken by unicellular algae, which is why most adults sport shaggy green coats, making them (for all intents and purposes) equal parts plant and animal. There is a good evolutionary explanation for this symbiotic relationship: the green coats of three-toed sloths provide valuable camouflage from jungle predators, notably the much, much faster jaguar.\n09 of 10 Octopuses Have Three Hearts and Nine Brains Getty Images There's a reason vaguely octopus-like creatures often feature in science-fiction movies as super-intelligent aliens. The anatomy of octopuses is alarmingly different from that of humans; these invertebrates have three hearts (two of which pump blood through their gills, the other to the rest of their bodies), and nine aggregations of nerve tissue. The primary brain resides, appropriately enough, in the octopus' head, but each of its eight arms also contains its share of neurons, which allow for independent movement and even primitive \"thinking.\" (Let's keep things in perspective, though: even the smartest octopus only has about 500 million neurons, one-twentieth the amount of the average human.)\n10 of 10 Dugongs Are Closely Related to Elephants Getty Images You might naively assume that dugongs\u2014the awkward-looking marine mammals that drunken sailors once mistook for mermaids\u2014are most closely related to seals, walruses, and other pinnipeds. The fact is, though, that these ocean dwellers descend from the same \"last common ancestor\" that spawned modern elephants, a tiny quadruped that lived on dry land about 60 million years ago. (Dugongs belong to the same family, the sirenians, as manatees; these two mammals went their separate ways about 40 million years ago.) The exact same pattern was repeated by (unrelated) whales, who can trace their ancestry to a population of dog-like mammals that lived during the early Eocene epoch."}

Join us as we learn about one of nature\u2019s cutest critters in our facts about pandas!\nFacts about pandas\n1. Giant pandas (often referred to as simply \u201cpandas\u201d) are black and white bears. In the wild, they are found in thick bamboo forests, high up in the mountains of central China \u2013 you can check out our cool facts about China, here!\n2. These magnificent mammals are omnivores. But whilst pandas will occasionally eat small animals and fish, bamboo counts for 99 percent of their diet.\nLove animals? You\u2019d love our magazine! Ask your parents to check out Nat Geo Kids magazine!\n(AD)\n3. Pandas are BIG eaters \u2013 every day they fill their tummies for up to 12 hours, shifting up to 12 kilograms of bamboo!\n4. The giant panda\u2019s scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca, which means \u201cblack and white cat-foot\u201d.\n5. Giant pandas grow to between 1.2m and 1.5m, and weigh between 75kg and 135kg. Scientists aren\u2019t sure how long pandas live in the wild, but in captivity they live to be around 30 years old.\n6. Baby pandas are born pink and measure about 15cm \u2013 that\u2019s about the size of a pencil! They are also born blind and only open their eyes six to eight weeks after birth.\n7. It\u2019s thought that these magnificent mammals are solitary animals, with males and females only coming together briefly to mate. Recent research, however, suggests that giant pandas occasionally meet outside of breeding season, and communicate with each other through scent marks and calls.\nDid you know that we have a FREE downloadable panda primary resource? Great for teachers, homeschoolers and parents alike!\n8. Family time! Female pandas give birth to one or two cubs every two years. Cubs stay with their mothers for 18 months before venturing off on their own!\n9. Unlike most other bears, pandas do not hibernate. When winter approaches, they head lower down their mountain homes to warmer temperatures, where they continue to chomp away on bamboo!\n10. Sadly, these beautiful bears are endangered, and it\u2019s estimated that only around 1,000 remain in the wild.

This hyena call is thought to be able to be heard by other hyenas for up to three miles.\nAnimal facts - Even though the Hippopotamus looks like it would be slow on land thanks to it's short and stubby legs, they are actually able to run at quite remarkable speeds and are capable of reaching 30mph when running.\nAnimal facts - Vultures have excellent senses of sight and smell to help them locate food, and they can find a dead animal from a mile or more away. Because of this, vultures often have large territories and will spend a lot of time soaring to locate their next meal.\nOf all the Kenyan animals, the most famous ones are known as 'The Big Five' and they are: Lion, Leopard, Elephant, Buffalo and Rhinoceros. In addition to these, Kenya has a wide range of fascinating animals providing awe and wonder to all that see them. These animal pictures cover all from the great migration which sees millions of wildebeest move in search of food every year, to the simply named 'Remarkable climbing mouse'. From the 110 different species of bat found in Kenya to the 'Maned rat' which has evolved to look just like a porcupine to ward off predators.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Lion Facts for Kids | African Animals | Big Cats", "url": "https://animalfactguide.com/animal-facts/lion/", "text": "Living in the grasslands, scrub, and open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa, the lion is the second largest cat in the world. It is dwarfed slightly by the tiger, which is closely related and has a very similar body type.\nUnlike other cats, lions are very social animals. They live in groups, called prides, of around 30 lions. A pride consists of up to three males, a dozen related females, and their young. The size of the pride is determined by the availability of food and water. If resources are scarce, the pride becomes smaller.\nPride members keep track of one another by roaring. Both males and females have a very powerful roar that can be heard up to 8 km (5 mi.) away.\nMales and females take on very different roles in the pride. Male lions spend their time guarding their territory and their cubs. They maintain the boundaries of their territory, which can be as large as 260 sq. km (100 sq. mi.), by roaring, marking it with urine, and chasing off intruders. Their thick manes, a unique trait to male lions, protect their necks when they fight with challengers.\nFemale lions are the primary hunters of the group. They are smaller and more agile than males. But since their prey is still generally faster than them, they use teamwork to bring an animal down. Fanning out, they form a semicircle, with the smaller, weaker lionesses herding the prey towards the center. Then the stronger females knock the animal down and make the kill.\nLions usually hunt at night. Their prey includes antelopes, buffaloes, zebras, young elephants, rhinos, hippos, wild hogs, crocodiles and giraffes. But they also sometimes eat smaller prey like mice, birds, hares, lizards, and tortoises. They are not above stealing kills from other carnivores, like hyenas, wild dogs, cheetahs, and leopards, or scavenging spoiled meat.\nAfter a successful hunt, all the lions in the pride share the meal. But there is a pecking order, with the adult males taking first claim, followed by the lionesses, and finally, the cubs.\nLions have a fast-working digestive system, which allows them to gorge themselves and then go for seconds shortly after. If available, they will drink water everyday. But they can go 4-5 days without drinking by obtaining moisture from the stomach contents of their prey.\nSpending 16-20 hours of the day sleeping or resting, lions are the laziest of the big cats. They can be found lying on their backs with their feet up or taking a snooze up in a tree. While lazing around, they are very affectionate towards one another, rubbing heads, grooming, and purring.\nLionesses give birth to 2-3 cubs at a time. Usually a couple females give birth around the same time. The cubs are then raised together, sometimes nursing communally.\nVulnerable to predators like hyenas, leopards, and black-backed jackals, cubs have a 60-70% mortality rate. They are sometimes trampled by large animals like buffaloes. Furthermore, when another group of male lions takes over a pride, they kill all the cubs so they can sire their own with the lionesses.\nFemale cubs stay with the group as they age. At around two years old, they become capable hunters. But young males are forced out of the pride at that age. They form bachelor groups and follow migrating herds until they are strong enough to challenge male lions of other prides. In general, a group of males stays in power in the pride for around three years before another bachelor group takes it over.\nConservation Status\nAfrican lions are considered vulnerable of extinction by the IUCN Red List. They are threatened by loss and fragmentation of habitat. They are also killed by humans in bravery rituals, as hunting trophies, for medicinal powers, or by ranchers protecting their livestock. Furthermore, they are susceptible to tick-borne diseases like canine distemper and babesia. Distemper is spread to lions by neighboring village dogs as well as hyenas. Babesia occurs during droughts, when malnourished prey is vulnerable to disease. The ticks spread to the lions after they kill the sick animal. The combination of distemper and babesia causes mass fatalities in lion populations.\nWhat You Can Do to Help\nYou can help save lions by donating to charities like National Geographic\u2019s Big Cat Initiative, Panthera\u2019s Project Leonardo, or the African Wildlife Foundation.\nLion Distribution\nLion Resources\nBlog Posts about the Lion"}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Okapi images!\nOkapi Classification and Evolution\nThe Okapi is an elusive, herbivorous animal that is found in a small pocket of tropical mountain forest in central Africa. Despite its Deer-like appearance the Okapi is actually one of the last remaining ancestors of the Giraffe, which is the tallest animal on Earth. Along with having a relatively long neck compared to its body size, the most striking feature of the Okapi is the horizontal stripes that are particularly visible on their behinds and give this animal an almost Zebra-like appearance. The Okapi is a very shy and secretive animal, so much so in fact that they were not recognised as a distinct species by western science until the earth 20th century. Although they are seldom seen by people, the Okapi is not an endangered species as they are thought to be fairly common in their remote habitats.\nOkapi Anatomy and Appearance\nLike its distant and much larger ancestor, the Okapi has a long neck which not only helps it to reach leaves that are higher up, but also provides the Okapi with a tool to both defend itself and its territory. The Okapi has a red-brown coloured coat of fur with horizontal, white striped markings that are found on their hind quarters and at the tops of their legs, and provide the Okapi with excellent camouflage in the dense jungle. They have white ankles with a dark spot above each hoof and very thick skin to help protect them from injury. The Okapi has a long head and dark muzzle with large set-back ears which enable the Okapi to detect approaching predators easily. The Okapi also has an impressively long tongue, which is not only black in colour but it is also prehensile meaning that it is able to grab hold of leaves from the branches above. The appearance of the Okapi makes it one of the strangest animals alive in the world today.\nOkapi Distribution and Habitat\nThe Okapi is an animal that is found in the dense tropical rainforests of north-eastern Democratic Republic of Congo generally at an altitude that can vary between 500 and 1,000 meters, although the majority of individuals are thought to inhabit areas at roughly 800 meters above sea level. They are incredibly shy and elusive animals and rely heavily on the very thick foliage around them to protect them from being spotted by predators. The Okapi can also be found in areas where there is a slow-moving fresh water source, but the range of the Okapi is very much limited by natural barriers, with unsuitable habitats on all four sides trapping these animals into the 63,000 square kilometre Ituri Rainforest. Around a fifth of the rainforest is today made up of the Okapi Wildlife Reserve, which is a World Heritage Site. Although they are thought to be common in their native region, the Okapi has been severely threatened by habitat loss particularly from deforestation.\nOkapi Behaviour and Lifestyle\nThe Okapi is a diurnal animal meaning that they are most active during the day when they spend the majority of their time roaming set paths through the forest in search of food. They are solitary animals with the exception of the time mothers spend with their calves but are known to tolerate other individuals and may occasionally feed together in small groups for a short period of time. Okapi have overlapping home ranges with males tending to occupy a larger territory than females, which is marked with both urine and by rubbing their necks on trees. Males also use their necks to fight with one other to both settle disputes over territory and to compete to mate with a female during the breeding season. Okapis are known to also communicate with one another using quiet \u201cchuff\u201d sounds and rely heavily on their hearing in the surrounding forest where they are not able to see very far at all.\nOkapi Reproduction and Life Cycles\nAfter a gestation period that can last for up to 16 months, the female Okapi retreats into the dense vegetation where she gives birth to a single calf. Like many hoofed-herbivores, the Okapi calf is usually able to stand within half an hour when mother and baby then begin starting to look for a good nest spot. They remain in their nest deep in the undergrowth for the majority of the next two months which not only helps the calf to develop more rapidly but also gives it vital protection from hungry predators. Although the female Okapi will protect and feed her vulnerable calf, the two are not thought to share the same close bond that occurs with numerous other hoofed mammals. Although they do begin to develop their white stripes at a fairly young age, the young Okapi do not reach their full adult size until they are roughly three years old. They are generally weaned at around 6 months old but may continue to suckle from their mother for more than a year.\nOkapi Diet and Prey\nThe Okapi is a herbivorous animal meaning that it survives on a diet that is only comprised of plant matter. They eat leaves, shoots and twigs that are drawn into their mouths using their long prehensile tongue along with fruits, berries and other plant parts. The Okapi will even eat fungi on occasion and is known to eat more than 100 different types of plant, many of which are poisonous to other animals and Humans. Along with consuming a vast variety of plant material, the Okapi is also known to eat a reddish clay that provides essential salt and minerals to its plant-based diet. The Okapi spends a great deal of the daylight hours in search of food and walks quietly along well-trodden paths that it uses regularly to ensure an easier escape from predators.\nOkapi Predators and Threats\nDue to the fact that the Okapi inhabits such a secluded region of mountain rainforest, it actually has surprisingly few common predators particularly in comparison to similar species. The main predator of the Okapi is the Leopard, which is one of the world\u2019s largest and most powerful felines and an animal that spends a lot of time resting in the trees. Unlike other predators which the Okapi\u2019s acute hearing would sense moving through the undergrowth, the Leopard\u2019s position above ground means that they are able to both survey the surrounding area for potential prey and are also able to ambush it from above. Other predators of the Okapi include the Serval and Human hunters in the area, but the biggest threat to the world\u2019s Okapi population is habitat loss due to deforestation.\nOkapi Interesting Facts and Features\nOne of the most distinctive features of both the Okapi and the Giraffe is their long prehensile tongue which can not only be used to grab onto leaves and branches but it also assists the animal when grooming. The tongue of the Okapi is in fact so long, that they are one of the few animals in the world that are said to be able to lick their own ear! Although they are quite rare and very secretive animals, there were sightings of the Okapi in these forests but these generally involved seeing the animal from behind and so the Okapi was known by many as a Forest Zebra. The Okapi was not classified as a distinct species until 1900 \u2013 1901, when Harry Johnston sent two pieces of Zebra-like skin to London which was analysed and meant that a new species had been recorded.\nOkapi Relationship with Humans\nUntil the beginning of the last century, the Okapi itself was not known to western scientists but the native people of the region were known to hunt this rare and elusive animal for both its meat and its thick hide. Today this secretive animal is still seldom seen in the high mountain rainforests of central Africa both due to its shy nature and its excellent camouflage amongst the dense foliage, so much of what we know about the Okapi is from observations of individuals found in zoos and animal institutions around the world. This however was not really successful until the introduction of planes as the trauma endured by the animal on trains on boats often meant that there was a high mortality rate of the individuals that were captured.\nOkapi Conservation Status and Life Today\nAlthough they are thought to be fairly common throughout their naturally isolated range, the Okapi has been listed by the IUCN as an animal that is Near Threatened from extinction in its natural environment. This is due to the increase of deforestation in parts of their natural habitat along with the fact that they are becoming increasingly caught on snares and other traps that are set by locals to catch other animals. The Okapi has been protected by law in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formally Zaire) since 1933, and the IUCN last estimated that there were between 10,000 and 35,000 individuals left in the wild.\nView all 23 animals that start with O"}

The closing living relatives to hippos are whales and porpoises.\nIf you love learning about Africa\u2019s animals, read more interesting facts about cheetahs, leopards, buffalo and hyenas to name a few.\nTo give you a greater understanding of these massive herbivores, we\u2019ve compiled a list of interesting hippo facts.\nInteresting Hippo Facts\nRiver horses\nDerived from an ancient Greek word which means \u201criver horse\u201d, hippos are semi-aquatic animals, most commonly spotted with its enormous body submerged under rivers and lakes.\nHippos can\u2019t swim\nHippos spend most of their lives in water, but they actually cannot swim. Hippos sink in the water. Instead of swimming, they run along the river bottom. The main reason they spend time in the water is to protect their sensitive skin from the sun.\nNatural sunblock\nThe hippo\u2019s skin is hairless and very thick. They secrete an oily red substance from their skin which gives rise to the myth that these animals sweat blood. The shiny liquid moistens the skin and contains chemicals that disinfect their wounds, prevent dehydration and act as a natural sunblock.\nHabitat\nThese large mammals spend up to 16 hours a day submerged underwater or covered in mud. Hippos can hold their breath underwater for long periods and prefer to walk on the river bed, rather than swim. Hippo calves have an incredible ability to suckle underwater by closing their ears and nostrils so that water doesn\u2019t get into them.\nTemperament\nThe hippo is known as one of the most aggressive creatures on earth. Apart from mosquitoes, hippos are the animals responsible for the most human deaths in Africa. These highly aggressive creatures use their canine teeth and massive jaws for fighting.\nHippos are territorial when they are in the water and will open their mouths to \u201cyawn\u201d as a warning sign to not come any closer.\nFeeding\nThese herbivores exit and enter the water at the same spot and travel overland to graze at dusk. The school will travel up to 10 kilometres in single file until they\u2019ve eaten their fill. On average, a hippopotamus can consume 68kg of grass each night.\nAbilities\nAnother interesting hippo facts is that hippos weigh between 2,000 and 3,500 kilograms. Despite their size, these animals are agile and can easily outrun most humans. If hippos are threatened on land, they will run for the water and can reach speeds of up to 30km/h in short distances.\nReproduction\nFor hippos, reproduction and birth occur in the water. Therefore, hippos are territorial and protective of their young while in the water. Each female has one calf every two years.\nSoon after birth, mother and calves join schools that provide protection from lions, hyenas and crocodiles. Dominant male hippos protect their schools of between 10 and 40 other hippos.\nSurvival\nHippos are classified as vulnerable on the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature). They\u2019ve been poached for their meat and ivory-like teeth. As well as being killed in areas where they damage agriculture and pose a threat to human settlement.\nIf you are interested in learning about animal conservation in Africa, read our post on The 5 Most Endangered Animals in Africa.\nWe hope you enjoyed reading this post on hippo facts.

Most leopards are light coloured and have dark spots on their fur. These spots are called \u201crosettes\u201d because their shape is similar to that of a rose. There are also black leopards, too, whose spots are hard to see because their fur is so dark.\n2. Leopards can be found in various places around the world \u2013 they live in Sub-Saharan Africa, northeast Africa, Central Asia, India and China.\n3. Leopards are fast felines and can run at up to 58km/h! They\u2019re super springy, too, and can leap 6m forward through the air \u2013 that\u2019s the length of three adults lying head to toe!\n4. Leopards are very solitary and spend most of their time alone. They each have their own territory, and leave scratches on trees, urine scent marks and poop to warn other leopards to stay away! Males and females will cross territories, but only to mate.\n5. These big cats have a varied diet and enjoy different kinds of grub. They eat bugs, fish, antelope, monkeys, rodents, deer\u2026in fact, pretty much any prey that is available!\n6. Leopards are skilled climbers, and like to rest in the branches of trees during the day. They are strong beasts, too, and can carry their heavy prey up into the trees so that pesky scavengers, such as hyenas, don\u2019t steal their meal!\n7. Nocturnal animals, leopards are active at night when they venture out in search for food. They mostly spend their days resting, camouflaged in the trees or hiding in caves.\n8. When it comes to hunting for food, these big cats know their stuff! When a leopard spots a potential meal, it approaches with legs bent and head low, so as not to be seen. It then stalks its prey carefully and quietly, until it\u2019s five to ten metres within range. Then\u2026. pounce! The leopard dashes forward and takes down its victim with a bite to the throat or neck. Small prey, such as small birds or mice, will receive a fatal blow from the feline\u2019s paw. Ouch!\n9. Female leopards give birth any time of the year \u2013 when they do, they usually give birth to two or three cubs. Mothers stay with their cubs until they are about two years old, when they are old enough to hunt and take care of themselves.\n10. Leopards communicate with each other through distinctive calls. For instance, when a male wants to make another leopard aware of his presence, he\u2019ll make a hoarse, raspy cough. They also growl when angry and, like domestic cats, purr when happy and relaxed.

They\u2019ll also eat small reptiles, birds, eggs, fruit and plants.\nHabitat: Desert\nRange:\nThere are few animals on Earth who work as well together as meerkats. These squirrel-size members of the mongoose family live in groups of different sizes, from as little as three to as big as 50 members. everyone in the mob participates in gathering food, keeping a look out for predators and taking care of the babies.\nMeerkats live in the deserts and grasslands of the southern tip of Africa. They are super cute, with bushy, brown-striped fur, a small, pointed face and large eyes surrounded by dark patches. They average about 50 centimetres long, including their tail. These extremely social animals live together in burrows, which they dig with their long, sharp claws. Living underground keeps mob members safe from predators and out of the harsh African heat. These burrows can be 5 metres long and contain multiple entrances, tunnels, and rooms. A group will use up to five separate burrows at a time.\nMeerkats only go outside during the daytime. Each morning, as the sun comes up, the mob emerges and begins looking for food. They use their keen sense of smell to locate their favourite foods, which include beetles, caterpillars, spiders and scorpions. They\u201dll also eat small reptiles, birds, eggs, fruit and plants. Back at the burrow, several babysitters stay behind to watch over newborn pups. This duty rotates to different members of the mob, and a sitter will often go all day without food. The babysitters\u201d main job is to protect pups from meerkats in rival mobs who, if given the chance, will kill the babies. Eeek!\nWhile the rest of the mob forages for food, one of the meerkats (or sometimes more), called a sentry, will find a high point, like a termite mound, and perch on its back legs. From here it scans the sky and desert for predators such as eagles, hawks and jackals. A sentry who senses danger will let out a high-pitched squeal, sending the mob scrambling for cover.\nMeerkats dig safe places called bolt holes throughout their foraging area, where they can hide in an emergency. But if caught in the open by a predator, a meerkat will try to look fierce, lying on its back and showing its teeth and claws. If a group is confronted, the meerkats will stand together, arching their backs, raising their hair and hissing. This sometimes fools an attacker into thinking they are a single large, vicious animal.\nMeerkats are abundant throughout their range and are not considered threatened or endangered. But they live a very difficult life in the African desert, constantly threatened by hungry predators, rival meerkats, drought and burrow-flooding rainstorms.\nPicture credits\nMeerkat watching for predator: Joel Sartore, National Geographic Creative.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "22 Astonishing Elephant Facts \ud83d\udc18 - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/elephants/", "text": "Elephant Profile\nElephants are the largest living land mammals on the planet, that habitat sub-Sharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.\nThey are the only living member of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea, which once contained the now extinct Woolly Mammoth, and American Mastodon.\nElephant Facts Overview\nHabitat: Savannahs, Rainforests, Deserts, & Marshes Location: sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia Lifespan: 60 \u2013 70 Years Size: 6.5 \u2013 13 ft (2 m \u2013 4 m) Weight: 6,600 \u2013 15,500 lb (3,000 \u2013 7,500 kg) Color: Grey Diet: Grass, plants, bushes, fruits, twigs, tree bark, roots Predators: No natural predators. Lion attacks are rare. Top Speed: 30 Kph (15.5 Mph) No. of Species:\n3 Conservation Status:\nAfrican elephants are listed as vulnerable, while Asian elephants are endangered.\nElephants are herbivorous and live in various areas, including savannahs, rainforests, deserts, and marshes. They tend to stay close to water sources.\nElephants are known for their trunks, which are actually a long nose used for smelling, breathing, trumpeting, drinking, and also for picking up things, like a meal.\nElephants can also have tusks, which are present for both male (bulls) and female (cows) African elephants, and Asian male elephants. Asian females either have very small tusks, or no tusks at all.\nElephant Species\nThere are three recognised species of elephants \u2013 The African bush elephant (also known as the Savanna elephant), the African forest elephant and the Asian elephant.\nThe African elephants used to be considered one species, until genetic studies concluded that they were separated between 2-7 million years ago.\nAfrican elephants are typically significantly larger than their Asian elephant cousins, with bulls growing up to 13 feet (4 meters) tall and weigh between 4,000-7,500 kg, while Asian elephants reach no more than 11.5 feet (3.5 meters), and weigh less, between 3000-6,000 kg.\nAfrican elephants ears are larger, and reach up and cover the neck, while their skin is also more wrinkled. Asian elephants have a twin-domed head with an indent in the middle (known as \u2018dorsal bumps\u2019), whereas African elephants have fuller, more rounded heads. African elephants also have concave backs, while Asian elephants have convex or level backs.\nThe African elephant is on the left, in comparison to the Asian elephant, on the right.\nBoth Asian and African elephants migrate, and generally follow the same migratory routes annually in search of favoured climate for water, and food.\nSadly, the elephant population has slowly decreased since the turn of the 20th century. At that time, African elephants numbered in the millions, and Asian elephants totaled about 100,000. Currently, the African elephant population is down to an estimated 300,000 and are considered vulnerable by the IUCN. Asian elephant\u2019s numbers range from 40,000 to 50,000 and are listed as endangered.\nElephant Behavior\nElephants form deep, intimate family bonds and live in groups, known as a herd. These herds have a matriarchal head, which means the oldest, and usually largest, female in the group will lead the herd. She is referred to as the matriarch. A family usually includes the mother, her sisters, daughters and their babies.\nThe size of the herd will depend entirely on the size of the family and the terrain they have chosen to live on. Normally a herd of elephants can number between 8 and 100, however there have been recorded aggregations of up to 1,000 around watering holes.\nThe entire matriarchal herd will protect a newborn calf, and help to raise it. Males have a very different behavior pattern. They usually leave the herd between the ages of 12 and 15 after reaching puberty. Males who have left the family unit will either live temporarily with other males, or may just be alone for the rest of their lives. Even after pursuing and selecting a female mate, a male elephant will then resume his predominantly nomadic and solitary life, to roam alone.\nElephants typically eat leaves, grasses, bark, roots and bamboo and can spend 16 hours a day collecting food. They will also eat various ground crops, including sugar cane and bananas. The average adult elephant can consume between 300 and 400 pounds of food daily.\nInteresting Elephant Facts\n1. Elephants are the largest living land animals on earth.\nThe African bull elephant can grow as large as 13 feet (4 meters) tall, weigh between 4,000-7,500 kg and can have tusks as long as 6.5 feet (2 meters) in length weighing 100 pounds each (45 kg).\n2. Elephants have the largest brain in all of the animal kingdom, and are smart too.\nTheir brains can weigh up to a whopping 5.4kg. Size doesn\u2019t necessarily equate directly to intelligence, however evidence suggests that elephants are some of the most intelligent, social and empathic animals on the planet.\n3. Elephants can hear and communicate through the ground.\nThey can communicate long distances by foot stomping, and creating a low-frequency rumble that generates seismic waves in the ground that can travel nearly 20 miles. The sensitive skin in an elephant\u2019s trunk and feet helps them to pick up the message, and interpret them as a warning, or distant danger.\n4. Elephants can hear the sound of approaching clouds. Their hearing allows them to sense low-frequency rumbles, and communicate in \u2018infrasounds\u2019, which are sounds with pitches below the range of human hearing.\nThese infrasounds are produced in the same way as humans speak, via the larynx. The frequencies are as low as the lowest notes of a pipe organ, which cannot be heard by humans.\n5. An elephants graveyard is a mythical place, where legend says elephants walk to die alone at a certain age or time.\nHowever, these so-called elephant graveyards are entirely natural and often result from environmental factors, like drought or poisoning.\n6. Elephants are the strongest animals alive, and can lift up to 770 pounds (350 kg) with their trunks.\nElephants have long been used to transport people and goods, and they have been heavily utilised in the logging industry. There are reports that elephants have lifted as much as 1,100 pounds (500 kg) of tree logs, by leaning back and using it\u2019s weight for more power.\n7. Elephants can\u2019t use their trunks right away.\nA newborn elephant calf trunk has no muscle tone. This means that it will have to suckle through its mouth. Although the calf will eventually gain full control of its trunk, it won\u2019t happen until it is several months old. It takes calves time to learn to use them, and at first they often tread on their own trunks.\n8. An elephants tusks are modified second incisors in the upper jaw, which replace their milk teeth between 6-12 months old.\nThe visible, ivory part of the tusk is made of dentine with an outer layer of enamel and are essentially no different to other teeth.\n9. Both female and male African elephants have tusks, but only male Asian elephants have tusks.\nAn elephants tusks are used for digging, debarking trees, moving trees and branches when clearing a path and for attacking and defending when fighting.\n10. When on the move, a heard of elephants often walk in single file.\nThe matriarch elephant leads the herd, while her siblings and their offspring follow behind. Calves will follow mothers obediently, sometimes holding onto their mothers tails with their trunks to keep up.\n11. Elephants are the only animals that have an in-built snorkel.\nBy raising the tips of their trunks above the water\u2019s surface, elephants can cross rivers totally submerged walking on the river bed.\n12. There have been many observations of elephants showing altruism and empathy towards other species.\nThey are known to become friendly with humans, dogs and other animals. There have also been reports of elephants rescuing other animals from wild predators.\n13. Elephants can sleep standing up and only need a couple of hours of sleep each day.\nBut not always, they do lay down every few nights to sleep.\n14. Elephants can curl up together and sleep.\nThis elephant family was captured sleeping together by a drone.\n15. Elephants use mud as sunscreen to protect their sensitive skin from ultraviolet light.\nWhile it\u2019s skin is 2.5cm (1 inch) thick and generally tough, it\u2019s extremely sensitive, and requires protection from the sun and insect bites.\n16. Elephants are emotional creatures, that mourn the dead and grieve. They can also shed tears, and often try and bury their dead.\nElephants have been observed staying with the dead in apparent mourning, and appear to experience grief similar to that of humans at the loss of a relative.\n17. Elephants are strong swimmers and have been recorded swimming up to 50 kilometers across water, and can swim for six hours continuously without rest.\nExperts believe that elephants swam from Southern India to Sri Lanka where they settled.\n18. Wild elephants walk between 3.2 to 12.0 kilometers a day, in comparison to elephants in captivity in American zoos, which walk on average of 5.3 kilometers each day.\nHow far an elephant will walk depends on the age, sex, season, availability of food and much more.\n19. Female elephants have the longest pregnancy of any mammal at 22-months, and give birth to BIG babies.\nA litter for the average elephant family consists of one calf. Although twins are born, it is rare. The newborn calf will weigh between 200 and 250 pounds (90 to 115 kg).\n20. The saying \u2018an Elephant never forgets\u2019, holds some truth. Elephants have incredible memories.\nTwo elephants were observed seemingly recognising each other, after crossing each others paths at a circus, some 23 years earlier.\n21. Elephants have \u2018fingers\u2019 on the end of their trunks. An African elephant has two trunk tip fingers, where as the Asian elephant only has one finger on the tip of its trunk.\nDue to this, the African elephant is able to pick up objects delicately, while the Asian elephant can only scoop up objects by using its entire trunk.\n22. The Asian elephant population has declined by over 50% in the last three generations.\nThe main threats to the Asian elephant today are habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation, largely due to an expanding human population. Poaching is also a threat, due to their valuable tusks and other body parts for leather or meat.\n23. Poaching sadly continues to impact elephant populations.\nAlthough it is illegal and in some countries and the penalties are stiff, poaching for ivory has continued to contribute to the drop in numbers of wild elephants in the world.\nElephant Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification\nKingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Vertebrata Order: Mammalia Family: Elephantidae\nSpecies & Subspecies List"}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "10 Bizarre Animal Mating Habits - Unbelievable Facts", "url": "https://unbelievable-facts.com/2018/01/animal-mating-habits.html", "text": "Ah, sex! We do it; animals do it; birds do it. It\u2019s nothing to be intrigued about. But wait! Did you know that in case of some animals, their genitalia explodes after they have coitus? Or did you know that some fish disguise themselves as a female to protect themselves against rival males and sneak out the females right under their noses? Curious? Then read on to find more such intriguing animal mating habits.\n1 Female ducks are known to have complex vaginas that are lined with several dead-end pockets and tunnels in order to confuse unwanted male ducks and prevent forceful fertilization.\nMating in the animal world is driven by competition. The same happens when it comes to ducks. Male ducks are always challenged by rival males who try to force themselves upon the female. To have a competitive edge over rivals, males have large corkscrew-shaped penises that are lined with ridges and spines which enable them to deposit their sperm further into a female compared to their rivals.\nBut it\u2019s the female ducks that offer the most interesting scenario. With the mating war going on for some time, females have developed an evolved and complex vagina. Their vaginas are long and twisted, complementing the male penises, but are lined with dead-end tunnels, pockets, and spirals that curve in the opposite direction.\nThe complex detailing of their vagina ensures that if a male duck forces himself upon a female, the chances of him fertilizing her are quite slim. Even if the male duck does ejaculate, there\u2019s no surety that the semen has been deposited anywhere near the egg.(source)\n2 Male giraffes take a mouthful of the female\u2019s urine to find out if she is a good mate. The male first approaches the female and rubs her back to instigate urination. He then tastes the urine to determine if she is willing to mate.\nMale giraffes use a strange way to determine whether the female is ready to mate or not. When a male giraffe approaches a female, he will first rub her backside until she urinates. When she urinates, the male giraffe tastes the urine to find out if the female is ready to mate. This is known as the \u201cFlehmen sequence.\u201d\nIf the male giraffe feels that she is willing to mate, then he starts stalking her. It has been observed in many cases that the female simply runs away from the male and keeps a lookout for better males. The male that tasted her urine keeps pursuing her until she agrees to the mating.\nOn the other hand, if a female develops an interest in a male giraffe, it is she who would pursue the male giraffe and get him to taste the urine. If the urine is to the male giraffe\u2019s liking, then they end up having coitus very soon.\nAnother interesting case among giraffes is when two males fight over a female. It\u2019s less fighting and more \u201cnecking\u201d in which the males press their necks against each other until one of them gives up. They sometimes also swing their necks and try to hurt each other but that is very rare. Under such circumstances, it is the male with the long neck that wins a majority of the times. Once the fight is over, the males caress one another with their necks and end up having sex with each other! In fact, 75% to 94% of the time that male giraffes have coitus, it is with another male giraffe! The animal kingdom is strange!(1,2)\nAdvertisements\n3 The testicles and penis of male bees \u201cexplode\u201d and are ripped off right after sex with the queen bee. The queen bee goes on to mate with multiple partners leaving a trail of dead, penisless bees behind.\nThe male honeybee exists for one and only one reason \u2013 to mate with the queen bee. Known as \u201cdrones,\u201d this is the only service that the male bees contribute to their society. The queen soars into mid-air in the search for mates. The drones compete to mate with the queen and swarm around her as she flies.\nEventually, when a drone gets hold of the queen bee, he inserts his penis tightly into the queen bee\u2019s reproductive tract with the help of pressure of his abdominal muscles. Without losing any time, the drone immediately ejaculates. The ejaculation requires such explosive force that the tip of his penis ruptures. The broken penis remains inside the queen. The drone collapses to the ground where he dies soon after mating with the queen bee.\nMoreover, it\u2019s not just one drone bee that gives his life to fertilize the queen. The queen mates with dozens of bees and during this, she leaves behind a series of dead bees who sacrificed their lives.(source)\n4 Quolls are very violent and ruthless while mating and often get their females killed during the act. As if that\u2019s not bad enough, the males put out so much energy during the mating season that they lose weight, get bald, and die within only a few weeks of their sexual rampage.\nWhen you are a quoll, life is tough. You end up spending your life fighting for female attention and fighting with rival males, only to end up dead just after you have got it all. That too, before you even get to your first birthday!\nQuolls have a lifespan of only 12 months. In that time, they travel long distances to find female mates. In the meantime, they are also required to fight off rival males who are in the same pursuit. They travel as far as 10 square kilometers, which is a long range away from home.\nAll the pursuit for mates wears out the male quolls. They begin losing weight and hair, and just within a few weeks of their reproductive cycle, they lose their life. According to Jaime Heiniger, a University of Queensland Ph.D. student who has been studying the behavior of quolls, this unusual reproductive behavior is known as \u201csemelparity,\u201d and even though it\u2019s common in the animal kingdom, it occurs rarely in mammals.(source)\nAdvertisements\n5 Gray whales mate in threes. One of the males involved is non-dominant and acts as a support to hold the female in place so that she doesn\u2019t float away.\nGray whales are one of the most majestic marine creatures. But their mating process can raise a few eyebrows! During the mating season, that is in the months of November and December, gray whales begin to be spotted in groups of three or more.\nThe reason being this is the time when they are on the lookout for eligible females to mate. The whales perform a behavior known as \u201cSpy Hopping,\u201d where they put their heads out of the water and scan the surrounding area for females, at the same performing some circular motions to attract them. After few hours, they split into groups of three comprised of one female and two males.\nBoth the males have a part to play in the mating process, but there is a dominant male who can be identified as the one extending a single flipper. He lies motionless on the surface of the water, waiting for the female. The female approaches him, grazing him with her flippers, and lies belly-to-belly with him. The mating then begins which can last up to an hour during which they mate several times.\nWhere is the second male in all of this? Well, he lies on the far side of the female, holding her tight to the dominant male so that she doesn\u2019t float away in the middle of the ritual. That\u2019s a strange kind of partnership that you wouldn\u2019t see anywhere.(source)\n6 When anglerfish mate, their bodies melt into each other. They then share their bodies forever. The male latches and fuses onto the female, losing his internal organs in the process, until they share a bloodstream.\nAnglerfish might just be the most angry-looking deep sea creature. Their females have a distinctive piece of the spine that protrudes above their mouths. It looks like a fishing pole and acts as a bait for prey.\nBut that\u2019s not what we are interested in. Anglerfish literally become one when they mate. When a free-swimming young, male anglerfish encounters a female anglerfish, he latches onto her with the help of his sharp teeth. After some time passes by, the male fusses with the body of the female physically. He loses his eyes and internal organs in the process, and at the end of the fusion, they end up sharing the same bloodstream. The only organ that remains of the male is his testes. Since not just one male has sexual encounters with a female, the female carries around five to six males on her body! Crazy right?(source)\nAdvertisements\n7 Male dolphins sometimes separate the females from their families and deny them food until they agree to mate.\nDolphins are universally loved creatures. They are always happy and contribute their share of spreading happiness around. Also, their behavior and the large size of their brains indicate a high level of intelligence.\nBut the story is quite different when it comes to mating. A group of male dolphins would form an alliance with another group of male dolphins to seek help while luring fertile females from the hands of rival males. And after they have succeeded in stealing the female away, the alliance remains intact to ensure that the female behaves and complies with requests of courtship.\nTwo or three males surround the female like guards. If she tries to escape, then the males chase after her, bite her, slap her with their fins or slam into her with their heavy bodies. They even deny them food until they agree to mate with one of the males.\nBut once a dolphin gives birth, the alliance loses interest in her and goes off on their next adventure. The females raise their kids as single mothers for four to five years.(source)\n8 The adult luna moths develop without a mouth as their only purpose is to mate during their 7-day lifespan. After this, they die of starvation.\nEver heard of anyone brought into this world for just seven days with the only purpose of mating? Sounds crazy, but that is the life of the luna moths. The luna moths stay inside their cocoons even after they have turned into adults via metamorphosis. It\u2019s only when all the biological factors are suitable that they come out of their cocoon. Just after they emerge from the cocoon, their abdomens are swollen and their wings are yet to be fully developed. This takes around two to three hours.\nThe things that stand out is that they do not have mouths. Luna moths come to the world without any mouths and they just have a lifespan of one week during which they do not consume any food. Their sole purpose is to look for mates.\nThe females, on the other hand, give off pheromones to attract males. Normally, a female mates with the first male that approaches her. Once a male moth approaches a female, they mate and remain in the same position until the next evening if left undisturbed. After their separation, the female looks around for hosts on which to lay her eggs. Once a week passes by, the male moths starve to death.(1,2)\nAdvertisements\n9 Mating for pandas is difficult because the sexual interest of the female lasts just 24-72 hours per year.\nMating among pandas is a tricky business. This is because the female pandas are not always in the mood for breeding. They are just in the mood for one to three days in a year! That\u2019s a very short time for the male pandas to woo the female as well as convince her to have coitus.\nA few researchers have discovered that several months prior to the females entering their phase of ovulation, the males start getting ready. It\u2019s also a possibility that the sperm production increases among males during the few months leading up to the time when the females are in the ovulation phase. This is in order to accommodate the brief window when the females express interest in breeding.\nIn China, a breeding and research center for pandas resorted to \u201cpanda porn\u201d to get two grown-up pandas to mate.(1,2)\n10 Weak, male cuttlefish pretend to be female by changing their skin color so that they can sneak past the bigger males and mate with the real females right under their noses.\nCuttlefish have taken sexual trickery to new depths. Cuttlefish have heightened the ability to change their color for communication purposes. Male cuttlefish are normally adorned with pulsating stripes, whereas females have dots on their body.\nScientists have observed an unbelievable phenomenon while observing cuttlefish mate. They noticed that weak, male cuttlefish tag along, disguised as females, with breeding male-female pairs. They wait for their chance to woo the female when the strong male is not around. The strong male never doubts the cuttlefish in disguise and goes off to tackle other rivals. As soon as he is gone, the weak cuttlefish reveals its true colors to the female, woos her, and mates with her. In case the strong male returns back unexpectedly, the weak male cuttlefish quickly changes its color again to look like a female! This is some high-level social intelligence going on here!(source)"}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Rabbit Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Rabbit-facts.html", "text": "rabbit Facts\nPortrait of a Rabbit\nThe rabbit is one of the most recognizable and well-loved creatures in the animal kingdom. Domesticated for thousands of years, rabbits are bred for their meat, their fur, and of course, for companionship.\nThere are an estimated 14 million pet rabbits in the world, many of whom live in the classic outdoor wood and chicken-wire hutch, some living in indoor cages, and some clever bunnies learning to use a litter pan and getting the run of the house.\nRabbits are beautiful little animals with many endearing features. They have slender, thin-skinned, towering ears that, in hares, can be 3 times the length of the skull.\nThe ears are amazingly expressive. They can move independently, swivel in almost any direction and can be held erect or folded flat back against the shoulders.\nWhen at ease, rabbits move about in soft little two-beat hops, grazing on vegetation and grooming themselves, cleaning limbs, backs, ears and toes with their short pink tongues.\nThey commonly raise up on their hind legs to inspect their environment, reach tall flowers and leaves, and clean their front paws and faces with the same motions that a house cat uses, except with two paws at the same time.\nRabbits have ever quivering noses, long expressive whiskers, and a powder puff for a tail. Although both rodents and rabbits are small, furry and buck-toothed, rabbits are not in the rodent family.\nRabbits and hares are approximately 50 different species of small herbivorous mammals in the family Leporidae. They are from an order known as lagamorphs, which also includes little mountain-dwelling animals called pikas.\nThere are several major skeletal and systemic differences between lagamorphs and rodents. Lagamorphs have an extra pair of small flat teeth known as \"peg teeth\" in their top jaw, directly behind their incisors.\nan assortment of domestic rabbits\nLagamorphs are basically exclusively vegetarian, while most rodents are opportunity feeders, happily dining on meat whenever it is available.\nMale lagamorphs lack the penile bone that rodents have, and the overall design of the male genitals is different.\nRabbits are found around the world in a variety of environments, but most are woodland creatures who are classically known for living in a burrow - usually a self-dug hole several feet deep with multiple rooms and tunnels known as a \"warren\".\nFinally, rabbits in the wild eat grasses as a dietary mainstay. They will eat many types of vegetation when available, but rarely consume root vegetables like the famous carrots of Bugs Bunny lore. In fact, carrots fed too liberally can actually cause tooth decay in pet rabbits.\nSpeaking of Bugs Bunny, the term \"bunny\" formally refers to a juvenile rabbit, but is often used informally to describe any rabbit, and sometimes in conjunction with the term rabbit as in \"bunny-rabbit\". which is similar to calling a cat a kitty-cat, or your 90 pound Lab a \"puppy-dog\" - it's all good. - Rabbit Facts\nthe domestic rabbits\nAll domestic rabbits are descendants of the European wild rabbit. First farmed in outdoor pens, and possibly barns, by the Romans around 200 years B.C., the European rabbit became a popular and easy source of superior meat and fur.\nCatholic monks living in the Champagne region of France conscientiously and selectively bred, housed, and thus domesticated the European rabbit between 500 and 600 A.D.\nIt is said that some forms of rabbit meat were declared to be fish and were acceptable to eat during Lent, which served as continued motivation for the Monks.\nA few hundred years later, rabbits were being line bred throughout most of Europe. Different regions began to develop specific breeds, and the size, color, and disposition of the animals evolved and expanded over time.\nThe Dutch rabbit, one of the most popular and recognizable breeds of pet rabbit in modern society, can be seen depicted in artwork beginning in the 1400's..\nToday, the American Rabbit Breeders Association, or ARBA, has over 30,000 members and recognizes 45 different breeds of rabbit. Worldwide there are approximately 80 recognized breeds of domestic rabbit, each with its own contribution and traits, from massive New Zealand Giants, regularly considered the finest animals for meat, to the plush coated Rex breeds that are favorites for fur production, to dainty Netherland dwarfs, bred purely for companionship.\nRabbit meat is one of the leanest meats available, with far less fat than beef, pork or chicken. The entire rabbit is considered to be white meat. The rabbit is so lean, in fact, that it is a bit less tasty than other types of meat, and although the reproduction rate of a single doe may lead to her producing up to 200 pounds of rabbit meat in a single year, the meat itself is an acquired taste.\nToday's domestic rabbit is an entirely different animal from the creature that was first captured and corralled in Ancient Rome. So different, in fact, that it is no longer physicallly capable of reproducing with the European wild rabbit it was derived from. - Rabbit Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

There are two families in this order of animals. Rabbits and hares are in the family leporidae, pikas which are smaller and rounder bodied than rabbits with shorter limbs and ears and no tail, are in the family ochotonidae.\nThe rabbit is in a separate genus from the hare, but the differences between the two animals are not obvious or plain to see. In general, hares are larger than rabbits with longer limbs and ears, but many species of hares are remarkably similar in appearance to rabbits.\nAdding to confusion is the fact that probably the most \"hare-like\" example of a hare - the black-tailed jackrabbit- is actually inaccurately called a \"rabbit\".\nThere are, however, substantial differences between rabbits and hares, and their separation by genus is not controversial.\nFirst, hares and rabbits start life very differently. Newborn rabbits are hairless, blind, toothless and completely helpless. They cannot walk, see, or eat solid foods until they are several weeks old.\nNewborn hares on the other hand, not only have their eyes open, they are fully furred and can actually begin foraging and eating solid foods within hours of birth and can survive completely on their own within a few hours of being born.\nOnce out and about, hares and rabbits live surprisingly different lifestyles too.\nRabbits are social creatures living in family units of up to 20 individuals. They dig large, communal homes underground called warrens, where they spend most of their daylight hours, and they eat soft vegetation like grasses and flowers.\nHares are generally solitary animals only coming together for mating. They do not dig warrens, but live above ground their whole lives. Hares have tougher digestive systems, and many live in very harsh environments where they must eat difficult to forage foods that are hard to chew and digest like bark and twigs.\nFinally, many species of hares molt their fur to change colors with the seasons. Rabbits remain the same color all year round, regardless of any changes in weather or environment.\nrabbit reproduction - how can rabbits have so many babies?\nbaby baboons\nRabbits have long been used as symbols of fertility and sexual vigor in many societies. It is mathematically possible for a single pair of rabbits to multiply to about 1300 individuals in the span of just one calendar year.\nWhy and how does the rabbit reproduce at such an amazing rate? Well the why may be because rabbits are very popular food source for a large variety of predators.\nA wild rabbit has a life expectancy of less than 3 years, simply because it is hunted by every predator in its habitat.\nAnd even animals smaller in size and weight than mature rabbits and hares, such as house cats and sparrow hawks will regularly take them, because they offer little defense other than fleeing.\nSo for a bunny, reproducing before you get eaten is the number one plan, and nature has designed the rabbit with several physical characteristic to help with that goal.\nFirst, female rabbits do not have a \"season\" as most mammals do. The female is receptive to the males advances as long as she has unfertilized eggs available, which is about 26 days out of every month. The females hormones are triggered by the act of intercourse, and she ovulates about 10 hours after copulating, so the eggs are released only when sperm are present, and impregnation is virtually guaranteed with a single mating.\nSecond, while hare newborns are almost completely self sufficient the day they are born, rabbits catch up quickly, remaining helpless for the first few days but becoming completely independent and fully weaned at only 4 to 5 weeks. (some variation, of course, between species)\nNext, young rabbits and hares are ready, and often do, mate at as young as 4 months old. Once pregnant, the gestation is a relatively short 29-33 days. Litter size is not extreme compared to many other species - including many breeds of dogs - with a typical litter size of 5 or 6 kits, but some other factors like the speed of development, make up for, and may be the reason for this.\nWithin 2 to 4 days of giving birth, a female rabbit may be receptive to an interested male, and become impregnated again. So it is actually conceivable for one female rabbit to become pregnant every 35 days and deliver up to 10 kits in each litter in the course of 1 year.\nThrow in the idea that the youngsters from her first litter may begin mating at 1 month old, and so on and so on, and you end up with many, many rabbits.\nSome animals, particularly some rodents, have shorter pregnancies, larger litter sizes, and even quicker weaning times, but the combination of all these factors in the rabbit, along with a very strong reproductive drive, gives you the most prolific mammal in the animal kingdom. - Rabbit Facts\npet rabbits\nNetherland dwarf, Dutch, Mini-lop\nAngora rabbits\nRabbits make lovely pets, and have been diligently bred for attractiveness and personality since the 1400's.\nSome modern breeds are so petite that they may be kept happily in a simple hutch indoors, not unlike one might keep a hamster or gerbil. The Netherland dwarf, Dutch, Mini-lop and Angora bunnies are the most popular modern breeds, but there are literally dozens of fine choices for an indoor or outdoor companion.\nSome rabbits pets aren't confined at all, but are given the run of the house once some rabbit-proofing is done to discourage the chewing of furniture and electrical cords. Since the rabbit is a den animal in the wild, its natural tendency is to eliminate in the same place all the time, which facilitates litter-pan training. Of course healthy rabbit feces are relatively dry and pellet-like,so an accident is rarely an issue.\nThe main drawback to rabbits being kept indoors is the odor of wet litter. Rabbits drink lots of water and produce dark, potentially strong-smelling urine, so pans and cages must be cleaned regularly. Male rabbits will occasionally spray urine, similar to male cats, which can be a huge problem.\nSpaying or neutering your pet rabbit is an excellent idea and can eliminate potential issues. Spayed and neutered rabbits are less likely to develop bad toilet habits, have milder smelling urine and feces, will be more gentle and less anxious, and can't reproduce, so you will not be overrun with bunnies if you happen to have a pair.\nIt has been calculated that, do to the rabbits amazing reproductive gifts, if a single pair of healthy rabbits and all of their offspring are left to breed freely, they can expand to 1300 individual rabbits within just one years time!

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Elk Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Elk-facts.html", "text": "elk Facts\nPortrait of an Elk\nOne of the most fascinating elk facts, is that their ancestors had 8-inch long tusks, just like a walrus! The elk is the second largest member of the deer family. They are smaller than the moose overall, but their incredible, branch-like antlers are longer than those of the moose, and when measured from the ground to the top of their antler rack, many elk are quite a bit taller than moose.\nA mature male elk may stand over 5 and a half feet at the shoulder, and the largest will top nearly 1100 pounds. The elk is reddish brown in color, with a beautiful wedge-shaped head, and large, expressive eyes and ears. Males grow a huge pair of antlers, and have a mantle of dark fur around the neck. Females and even youngsters of some northern subspecies may also have manes.\nElk also have two large teeth in the upper jaw called ivories, whistlers or buglers. Scientists believe these teeth were once 8 inch long tusks, similar in appearance and direction to those of a walrus. There are small deer species in existence today who still have long tusks, but they don't have antlers. It is thought that when the elk developed antlers as a weapon, it no longer had a need for the tusks.\nElk are adaptable, tenacious, herbivores that eat a large variety of plants, and can exist in many habitats from deep forest to arid, near-desert conditions. They are ruminants, just like cows, and have a four-chambered stomach that allows them to digest lots of vegetation that has little nutritional value.\nDuring winter months, they may strip the bark from trees, and eat moss, twigs and acorns. When food is initially swallowed, it is stored for a few hours in the first stomach chamber, called the rumen. After the food has mellowed, the rumen sends balls of partially digested food back up to the mouth, where the elk will continue to chew it, before finally swallowing it again. This is called \"chewing cud\", and it helps large animals to survive on meager rations.\nThe adaptable elk also grow double coats for winter time that are lighter in color than their summertime garb, to help them blend in. In the spring, they tend to look a little shabby as the fur falls out and is replaced by their rich, single-layered coppery colored summer coat.\nElk are social animals who live in same-sex herds of 10 to 20 individuals, that are loosely structured, and may come together in much larger groups, particularly as they migrate to higher ground. The springtime migration of elk may bring together thousands of animals into one massive herd as they seek out green pastures.\nElk range across much of North America, where they once numbered nearly ten million individuals. The North American elk is also called a wapiti, which means \"white rear\" in the language of the Shawnee Indians, and refers to the distinctive, beige area of fur surrounding the elks tail. They were a vital part of the lives of native Americans, who fashioned elk bones and elk antlers into various tools, weapons and decorations, made clothing and tents from elk hides, and consumed or cured elk meat to survive.\nThe Lakota Sioux also treasured the elk, and male babies were awarded elk ivories to bring long life and prosperity. The Lakota people believed the spirit of the elk brought wisdom and courage to them, and was a symbol of potency.\nAfter European settlers arrived, and with the increase in farming, the elk population dwindled, and by the early 1900's, only about 90,000 elk remained. Today, however, elk populations are healthy, and number close to one million animals across Canada and the United States.\nelk lifestyle\nElk are generally peaceful, social creatures that live together in large herds and cooperate to protect themselves from predators. In late winter and spring, herds of elk, called gangs, are divided by sex.\nFemales may congregate in huge gangs with several hundred members. These include their youngsters from the year before, and are usually guided by a few older members who decide where to graze, when to rest, and when to start migrations.\nMigrating is an important tool in the elks survival, and timing is critical.\nIn the winter months, elk must be near forested areas with many trees for cover, and also to strip the bark.\nWhen spring is near, the females in charge begin to head towards valleys where seasonal grasses will soon emerge. Feasting on freshly sprouted greenery is key to the elk replenishing itself after the harsh winter, during which they may loose up to 250 pounds.\nMale elk may stay alone for awhile after the rut, as long as their antlers stay. The antlers allow them to protect themselves from predators, but weakened bulls will join up early, before their antlers fall, and enjoy the safety of a group.\nMale herds, because they don't include offspring, are generally smaller and more fluid, with members coming and going. Both sexes, however, may meet up and move together in massive herds during the migration, which, in places like Yellowstone national park, may number in the thousands.\nelk facts on reproduction\nBreeding season for elk is late August through early October, and is referred to as the rut. The decrease in daylight brought on by shortening days, triggers a surge in hormones, and while female elk enter estrus at this time, bull elk go through some physical changes as well.\nAs testosterone and melatonin levels increase, the antlers of the male elk calcify beneath the velvet, and he scrapes the soft covering off against trees and stones, revealing a sharp, fresh rack of points. To prepare for jousting, the male elks neck actually gains muscle mass, his mane grows fuller, and the voice box thickens, creating the correct tone for effective bugling. Then males compete for territory and ranking, jousting with eachother, as well as shrubs, tree stumps and sometimes cars and mailboxes.\nThe males size each other up by walking in parallel lines, then turning their racks in, lowering their heads and testing their rivals strength. A few swishes back and forth, knocking antlers together, and then they brace against eachother and drive forward with straining legs, attempting to push straight through the enemy.\nInjuries don't usually occur and the contests last only a few minutes. Exhausted, one or the other flees the scene, chased mercilessly out of the area, often receiving a few jabs in the rump as they go.\nMales will try to attract more than one female, and particularly dominant males in their prime of 6 to 8 years old, may have a harem of 20 or even 40 cows.\nThe elk rut can be several weeks long, and bulls are so excited they forget to eat. A bull at the end of rut may have lost as much as 30% body weight, and are vulnerable to predation at this time.\nFemales are pregnant for 240 -250 days and deliver one baby in the spring. Newborn elk are very well developed, and stand within about 30 minutes of birth. But during the first week of life, they spend most of their time lying quietly in tall grass or woods. They are light red in color with white spots sprinkled across their coats to help them hide.\nBaby elk will lay still in the woods while their mother feeds, and their spotted coats echo the dappling of the sun through the trees. They are instinctively quiet, and perfectly still when approached by anyone other than their mother. The newborn has no scent, and can't be detected by predators, so the mother actually stays a few yards away, coming close to nurse, but generally observing from a distance, for the first week or so.\nBy two weeks old, the mother returns to the herd with her new calf. The elk calf will be weaned in two months, and loses its spots in about six months.\nThe herd is mostly mothers with new babies, yearlings, and older females that did not breed. They will maintain the calves in little nursery groups, where all adults keep an eye on the youngsters. They are vocal in these groups, communicating with eachother with grunts and squeaks, and they will join together and take on predators, including wolves and grizzlies, if calves are threatened.\nThe herd will surround the babies, and will strike out with their forelimbs at anything that poses a threat. One well-placed kick can kill a full grown wolf, and if the herd is truly brave and vigilant, they may drive off even the most fearsome threat.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Antlers are sometimes mistakenly called \"horns\", but antlers are structurally completely different from horns.\nCows and antelopes grow horns, which are made of keratin, the same stuff as hair and nails. Horns don't fall off, they continue to grow throughout the life of the animal, and in most cases, both males and females grow them.\nAntlers are actually made of bone, fall off and are regrown each year, and are usually only found on the males of the species.\nAntlers grow from two round surfaces of bone called pedecils, that are part of the skull. Hormones triggered by seasonal changes start growing in the spring. They begin when the male has low, not high, levels of testosterone, presumably to focus energy on their growth, and insure that the animals are calm and not combative.\nWhile the antlers are growing they are soft and spongy and can be easily damaged, so males are careful with their movements. Antlers are the fastest growing tissue known in mammals, and each spine of the antler may grow at a rate of half an inch a day. The growing antler is a pulpy tissue filled with nerves and blood vessels. It is covered with blood-filled, hairy skin called velvet.\nWeirdest of all elk facts is that while the antler tissue is growing, it can actually be grafted to any part of the elks body, and it would continue to grow. The entire body is dedicated to this remarkable process.\nBy late summer the testosterone level begins to rise, the antler calcifies into solid bone, the velvet dries up and falls off, and the full, pointed rack appears, ready for some jousting action.\nAn intriguing feature of elk antlers, is how much they look like tree limbs...check it out...\na few more elk facts\nMale elk lose their antlers in late winter, and grow a new pair in the spring\nElk have teeth called \"ivories\" that were once 8-inch long tusks like a walrus\nElk antlers may weigh 40 pounds\nElk are ruminants and \"chew their cud\" just like a cow\nA well-organized elk herd can deter a wolf pack attack\nElk are also known by the Shawnee Indian name \"wapiti\"\nElk ivories are used in jewelry\nThe elk antler has properties that can fight cancer and other diseases\nElk are raised on farms where their antlers can be safely harvested without harming the elk\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Artiodactyla\nFamily Cervidae\nSubfamily Cervinae\nGenus Cervus\nSpecies canadensis\nElk - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT bull cow calf herd GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD gang North America,\nEurope,Asia woodland grass, twigs TOPSPEED ENDANGERED AVG WEIGHT AVG HEIGHT 45 mph no 400-900 pnds 4.5-5.5 feet\nat shoulder ESTRUS GESTATION BIRTH HEIGHT BIRTHWEIGHT 1 x year 245-250 days 24-26 inches 35 pounds RAISED BY # OF YOUNG AT BIRTH STANDS UP mother 1\ntwins rare eyes open,\nfully furred 20-30 minures WEANED INDEPENDENT MATURITY LIFESPAN 2 months 9-11 months 3-5 years 12-18 years"}

Yet Giraffe has also extended their influence around the globe.\nDo you seem to know things based on your intuition alone? Do you want to wade in the world of knowledge only accessible beyond the veil? Giraffe, as a Spirit, Totem, and Power Animal, can help! Giraffe teaches you how to heighten your psychic awareness so you can take on those tall tasks while holding your head high. Delve deeply in Giraffe symbolism and meaning to find out how this Animal Spirit Guide can support, illuminate, and uplift you.\nGiraffe Table of Contents\nGiraffe Symbolism & Meaning\nGiraffe symbolism and meaning evokes images of humanity striving to join with the Divine.\nGentle Giraffe, with its long neck reaching into the heavens, symbolizes the ability to see the future and obtain things that seem out of reach. When your life is chaotic, Giraffe reminds you to keep your head up and avoid getting entangled in needless arguments; as an Animal Ally, Giraffe encourages you to \u201ctake the high road.\u201d The creature signifies things that inspire and raise your energies or Spirit.\nThere\u2019s little that proves a threat to this giant creature since it reaches a towering height of up to eighteen feet; Giraffe\u2019s only vulnerability is the need to put its head to the water to drink. It\u2019s a good thing the Animal can withstand the lack of water for upwards of a month. Here, Giraffe\u2019s height symbolizes the wise use of resources, remaining grounded when reaching for new heights, and attuning to the Divine\u2019s guidance while maintaining a higher perspective.\nA Giraffe does not attack without reason, but when this creature senses danger, it is swift and powerful when it reacts. While a Giraffe may not look threatening, one swift kick can from the beast can cripple or kill. Kicking is the means Giraffe uses for protecting its calves. The creature\u2019s method for protecting its young gives Giraffe the symbolism of safety and strength in times of need.\nThe prevalence of Giraffes in Africa means that they have appeared in various stories, myths, and artistic renditions. In African cultures, the creature represents distinctiveness and individuality because no two Giraffe spotted-fur patterns are alike. Giraffe signifies standing out from among all the rest and expressing your identity with pride.\nIndigenous people have tremendous respect for Giraffes. One example of this reverence occurs in the Giraffe Dance. The practice is curative and based on a vision of Giraffes running through the rain.\nGiraffe Spirit Animal\nWhen Giraffe appears in your life, it may be a sign you\u2019ll stick out your neck for someone. Your Animal Ally encourages you to use your heightened awareness, intuition, and intellect to help others who lack your insight or wisdom. Note, however, sometimes Giraffe\u2019s meaning is a warning that you should avoid putting your neck on the line for others who might take advantage or those who might not appreciate the gesture.\nWhen Giraffe appears as a Spirit Guide, often, it\u2019s when you need to be more future-oriented. Your Animal Ally lifts its head high to reach for vegetation from the trees and gets a full, near-aerial view of the landscape. You, too, may need to adjust your perspective or open your mind to discover new opportunities beyond your present vantage point.\nGiraffe Spirit arrives in your life when it\u2019s time for you to acknowledge your innate future-telling abilities. You may find that you know things others don\u2019t; This \u201cknowing\u201d is something Giraffe urges you to use with caution. Psychic insights and visions often frighten people unless you use tact and diplomacy when delivering the message. Giraffe Spirit also reminds you not to get caught up in illusions. You won\u2019t benefit from clinging to the past or spending all your time predicting the future instead of living it.\nWhen Giraffe comes to you, you often feel disconnected from the Universe, or you are questioning life\u2019s meaning. Folklore suggests Giraffe kneels to sleep, and when it does, the creature is meditating or praying. Your Animal Spirit Guide urges you to question if you\u2019ve been staying connected to your Higher Self, Guides, Angels, and the Divine. If not, Giraffe appears to help you uplift your soul by showing you how to connect with the realm of Spirit.\nGiraffe\u2019s other message has to do with the power of silence. While they have a tongue that spans over twenty inches, this creature makes noise rarely; at least no sounds humans can hear. More often, the Giraffe communicates with body language, specifically its tail. In humans, the tail corresponds to the Root Chakra, a place where consciousness, courage, and intention reside. Quiet meditation is one means by which you can activate that Chakra. It is also a tranquil time during which God communicates on a profound level.\nGiraffe Totem Animal\nWhat does a Giraffe symbolize as a totem animal?\nIf you have a Giraffe as your Birth Totem, you are graceful, quiet, and prefer a content life full of simple pleasures. You are happiest when you experience complete tranquility. Walking your talk matters to you, and you don\u2019t use words without thoughtfulness behind them. As a Giraffe Person, you have no problem standing out in the crowd and are comfortable center stage.\nThroughout your life, you\u2019ll be better able to sense what\u2019s coming\u2013particularly when it pertains to you and those in your inner circle. You tap into your innate psychic gifts to guide you through troubling conditions or complicated relationships. You don\u2019t like conflict, but when you have no other choice, you\u2019ll use every ounce of your strength to defend what you hold precious and those you love.\nAn enormous challenge for Giraffe People is that sometimes they put the needs of others before their own. In doing so, sometimes you find helping others out is to your detriment. Often, sticking one\u2019s neck out for others may stem from the isolation that people with a Giraffe Totem feel. See, Giraffe People see the bigger picture; their lofty awareness and intellect can cause difficulties with emotional bonding and communication. As the saying goes, it\u2019s lonely at the top, and loneliness leaves you longing for genuine connections. Going the extra mile when being helpful is merely a way to initiate bonding with others.\nIf a Giraffe is your Totem Animal, don\u2019t hold yourself down because of others\u2019 jealousy. Reach toward your goals and continue to pursue your dreams. Giraffe is there to support you on the journey, ensuring you\u2019ll reach the loftiest of heights!\nGiraffe Power Animal\nWhat do Giraffes symbolize as a Power Animal?\nInvoke Giraffe as your Power Animal when you need help with matters where you want to win the honor, respect, or gratitude of others. With the Giraffe, many Animals have to look up to the creature because it\u2019s so tall. Working with Giraffe Energy helps you keep your head held high, and others will not only look up to you but will also respect you, finding you dignified and honorable.\nCall on Giraffe when you have important decisions to make, and you are seeking guidance. Giraffe Spirit gives you the confidence to know that you are just in your action or making appropriate decisions. The creature also supports you when you\u2019re looking to connect with your Higher Self or seek Divine assistance. Here, Giraffe also reminds you to appreciate what you have while expecting nothing in return. Like the tall Giraffe, your elevated perspective, bright outlook, and heightened awareness lift your soul closer to the heavens.\nGiraffe Dreams\nWhat does a Giraffe symbolize when they gracefully appear in a dream?\nDreams about Giraffes often call into question your current perspectives about a person or situation. If your views are too narrow, you\u2019ll miss something important. Otherwise, you may take unwarranted risks requiring greater scrutiny.\nWhen there is focus on the Giraffe\u2019s neck, your dream may point to a situation in your waking life where you feel up to your neck in difficulties. The dream imagery may also symbolize the need to forego all else to save your neck when facing trying conditions.\nIf the Giraffe is kicking at something, your dream foretells a time when you must defend yourself or others around you. Make sure you consider the amount of forcefulness you use when asserting yourself. Remember, a Giraffe\u2019s kick has a powerful and lasting impact.\nIf you see a baby Giraffe in the dream, you are progressing on an emotional or spiritual level, but there\u2019s still room for growth. A baby Giraffe also symbolizes a lengthy endeavor or journey, where you will have good luck in facing challenges or obstacles.\nLearn more about Giraffe Spirit by reading What if You Dream About a Giraffe? on WhatIsMySpiritAnimal.com!\nGiraffe African Symbolism\nGiraffes are native to Africa and are prominent figures in African lore and spirituality. Considered gentle giants, Giraffe challenges the concept that the largest and strongest must be violent or aggressive to show power.\nIn fact, Giraffe can easily be seen as emblematic of peace and pacifism. They don\u2019t even hunt other animals for food.\nSpeaking of size, two of the world\u2019s largest rock carvings are of Giraffes. This pair is known as the Dabous Giraffes, and were found in the Sahara. This prehistoric art is now being preserved so that more can be understood about the people who created it.\nThe carvings are in a remote region and can\u2019t be seen from the ground. There is some speculation that of all the animals, such attention was given to Giraffe in prehistoric art because of this animal\u2019s extremely unique appearance. Others speculate that shamans and religious leaders felt a strong connection to the Giraffe. Examples exist of Giraffe with a line drawn connecting the animal to the tops of the heads of human-like figures, suggesting a spiritual or intellectual connection, shapeshifting or the belief that Giraffe embodied the blend of human and Divine consciousness, with their heads closer to the Heavens and hoofs on the Earth.\nOf course, the elongated neck of the Giraffe lends itself to this animal being the subject of many myths about it\u2019s evolution from a short necked creature to the long necked animal we know of today. Some tales were told of Giraffe evolving to reach food higher off the ground where there was less competition. Others told of Giraffe\u2019s long neck being the result of Divine intervention.\nBy some accounts, Giraffe was the last animal created and was formed from the leftover parts of other animals, thus explaining the Giraffe\u2019s resemblance to both Leopard, Camel and other creatures.\nSome tell the story of Giraffe\u2019s long neck as a parable explaining the importance of having a sense of purpose. According to this story, Giraffe was once the only animal who was not given a purpose, and this was a cause of strife for Giraffe. Until one day when their long neck and unusual build meant Giraffe was able to reach food needed to help the other animals survive.\nThus if Giraffe is working with you, it may be time to explore how your unique talents and skills can benefit the community. If you\u2019ve ever felt alienated for being different, Giraffe reminds you your unique gifts are actually your strengths.\nTo some, the rarity of Okapi and Giraffe, especially in South Africa, create a link between these animals. Thus, Giraffe is said to represent rain, fertility and also exclusivity or something rare or unique.\nSimilar tales from Africa paint the Giraffe as a peaceful and noble hero who saves others through the use of his unique long neck. In a story about a family of birds who had built their nest in a tree that was threatened by a growing brushfire, the birds cried out for help. But none of the other animals were suited to save their nest, with their chicks inside, from the advancing fire.\nExcept, you guessed it, Giraffe.\nAre you the one who is always getting 3 a.m. phone calls from friends in need? If you have a compassionate, peaceful nature and are always responding to the crises of others, then Giraffe may be working with you to show compassion and healing by using your unique gifts.\nIn this regard, Giraffe is associated with mercy and compassion.\nGiraffe Christianity Symbolism\nWhat do Giraffes symbolize in Christianity?\nChristian symbolism is not ripe with Giraffe lore, but these amazing creatures do make an appearance or two. Artist Piero de Cosimo, known for his naturalist elements, made sure to include noble Giraffe in his painting Vulcan and Aeolus. In some accounts, Giraffe is described as being linked to Chamois, a specific type of Antelope.\nGiraffe is also noted as one of the many animals on Noah\u2019s Ark. Some stories recount that Giraffe didn\u2019t initially have a mate and had to go off in search of a partner before boarding the Ark. By this account, Giraffe can represent the lengths to which you may go to find the perfect partner.\nEarly Christian artwork and art of the Renaissance tends to depict Giraffe as free romancing rather than being held in captivity. Giraffe has come to embody the symbolism of all that is wild and exotic, not yet tamed. A much later discovery of the constellation Camelo Pardalis, is also named for Giraffe.\nThe term \u201cZemer\u201d found in Deuteronomy is said to be a translation from Greek and Latin terms for both Leopard and Camel. Perhaps people in this era saw Giraffe as a hybrid or somehow connected to these two very different animals.\nOthers see Giraffe as a testimony to God\u2019s creativity and Divine plan, as Giraffe has such an unusual appearance yet is perfectly suited to their surroundings.\nSome associate the wording in Proverbs, warning against one becoming \u201cstubbornly necked\u201d as synonymous with being ignorant or closed off to God\u2019s wisdom, with a reference to the appearance of Giraffe as embodying flexibility. In this regard, Giraffe symbolism can relate to not being too stubborn.\nGiraffe Celtic Symbolism\nGiraffe is not a significant animal in Celtic symbolism for obvious reasons. We can imagine what early Celtic people would have thought if they had stumbled upon a Giraffe, a being no doubt bizarre and far from home.\nYet we can make connections between the Giraffe\u2019s symbolism and other elements of Celtic lore. If you feel compelled to work with the energy and symbolism of Giraffe, consider the animal\u2019s gentle, large, efficient, resourceful and protective nature.\nPerhaps, then, Giraffe will put you in the mindset of creatures more commonly found in Celtic lore such as Unicorn or even trickster animals such as Rabbit.\nWhy trickster?\nBecause in spite of their large size, Giraffe would be unlikely to bring harm. Unless you\u2019re a tasty plant. The association between Giraffe\u2019s long neck and the ability to see into different realms can also connect to the great diviners or shapeshifters of Celtic lore, even as this animal specifically was not found in Celtic lands.\nGiraffe Far Eastern Symbolism\nWhat do Giraffes symbolize in eastern cultures?\nA Giraffe\u2019s symbolism in China is influenced by the history of how they came to be brought to this region. In the 17th century, Giraffes were transported to China as gifts to nobility. They were seen as harbingers of good luck and as associated with a prosperous and successful period. As such, rulers used Giraffe symbolism to connote good fortune and status as well as peace and prosperity.\nGiraffe is also associated with Zheng He, the Chinese admiral who first introduced Giraffe to China. In this culture, the connection between Giraffe and the Divine, illustrated by the long neck, was also considered to be an omen that rulers had either a Divine blessing to reign or would be brought down in defeat.\nWhether a ruler would preside over a peaceful era was also considered to be linked to the power of Giraffe Spirit Animal.\nThe original introduction of Giraffe to India is linked to an image of Giraffe that appears on a wall of the Sun Temple in Konak, India in the 13th century.\nGiraffe meaning is also influenced by the fact that they were also associated with Unicorns, and some even thought them to be Kilin or Kirin. These are hoofed beasts similar to Unicorns. Kilin are considered important in Chinese culture as they represent the Divinity of a ruler or Emperor. They are also said to only appear during times of peace.\nThey are associated with especially wise and philosophical leaders. Thus the presence of a Divinely appointed Philosopher, King, or Queen was considered to be linked to the Kirin or Kilin and also therefore associated with Giraffe.\nAs in Celtic culture, some associate Giraffe with Unicorn when it comes to the cultural attributions of Unicorn in Japan. Namely, Unicorn is considered a Divinely inspired judge who can both bestow blessings upon the righteous and punish those who are malicious.\nAre you being guided to embrace a period of stability or to step into the role of leadership as the wise mentor or guide who oversees a harmonious project? If you are working with Giraffe energy, you may be called upon to be a peacemaker or peacekeeper.\nGiraffe can also remind us that all that is Divinely granted can also be suddenly taken away if we are not acting in accordance with our higher ideals and aspirations.\nGiraffe Tattoo Meaning\nWhat does a Giraffe symbolize as a tattoo?\nThe spiritual meaning of Giraffe may not have occurred to someone who decided to ink their body with an image of this unique animal. But the relevant spiritual symbolism still stands and the power of Giraffe is still inherent in that person\u2019s subconscious.\nGiraffe tattoos can signify good luck or prosperity, peace or harmony. A Giraffe tattoo may remind the wearer to keep their feet on the ground as they explore the divine realms above. The union of ethereal and material worlds can be conveyed through the symbol of a Giraffe tattoo.\nGiraffe tattoos can show an Ancestral link to lands where Giraffe is prominent such as the African continent. A person who is nurturing, compassionate and gentle may also choose a Giraffe tattoo to embody their unique personality.\nIf you have a talent for rising above conflicts and keeping your head above water\u2026 far above water, actually, you may consider adorning your body with a reminder of Giraffe\u2019s spiritual meaning by getting a Giraffe tattoo. If your devotion to love and family means you would search high and low for the ideal love you desire, Giraffe may also appeal to you.\nA Giraffe tattoo will definitely set you apart from the crowd. It can be a reminder to look above and beyond the immediate moment and to tap into your psychic senses and not become limited in your perception.\nAs a symbolic ambassador for the exotic and for wildlife, a Giraffe tattoo can be a reminder of the need for attention to conservation and protection of wildlife. This may be immediately clear to those who reside in lands on the African continent where Giraffe is found, but can also be a more abstract reminder of the need for greater conservation efforts worldwide.\nGiraffe Spiritual Meaning\nGiraffe\u2019s spiritual meaning transcends all cultures. Giraffe is the intermediary between the Heaven and Earth planes and also between the Earth and Air or Sky element.\nGiraffe\u2019s long neck also resembles the human spinal column, which is where the chakras are found. Thus, when we think of Giraffe\u2019s spiritual meaning, we can just as easily be reminded of the importance of balancing and aligning the Chakras along the spinal cord.\nGiraffe\u2019s large stature and tendency to be gentle and peace loving makes Giraffe an ideal symbol of peace and harmony. Everyone can live together as one big happy family when we use our gifts and talents to work around obstacles rather than competing or creating scarcity. Giraffe and tales about this animal are reminders of the importance of collaborating and sharing.\nJust as the Giraffe is said to have reached food from higher branches, leaving lower hanging fruit for those who need it, Giraffe can also be a symbolic reminder of the Pagan tenet \u201cFairly take and fairly give.\u201d\nGiraffe\u2019s spiritual symbolism reminds us to live in harmony with other beings and to not intentionally bring harm through our actions. When we work with Giraffe, we are reminded of the need to be conscious of the impact our actions have on others, from our \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d to whether or not we are walking through the world with grace or carelessness.\nGiraffe is associated with perception, long range vision and therefore clairvoyance as well.\nGiraffe Symbolic Meanings Key\nPrayer\nFlexibility\nIntuition\nPersonal Growth\nDivine Connections\nBig Possibilities\nVision & Foresight\nGentleness\nKindness\nHeightened Perspective & Awareness"}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Gorilla Facts - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/gorillas/", "text": "Gorilla Profile\nGorillas are part of the great ape family, which includes orangutans, bonobos and chimpanzees. They are predominantly ground dwelling, and inhabit forests located in numerous countries in central Africa.\nGorillas are third in line as the closest relatives to the human. Chimpanzees take first place followed by bonobos. They are the largest living primates today.\nGorilla Facts Overview\nHabitat: Jungles & Forests Location: Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 Congo, Gabon, Guinea, Cameroon, Rwanda, Uganda Lifespan: 35 \u2013 50 Years Size: 4 ft 7 in \u2013 6 ft 5in Tall (1.4 to 2 m) Weight: 300 \u2013 590 pounds (135 \u2013 275 kg) Color: Black, With Some Silver / Grey Hair Diet: Herbivore \u2013 Leaves, Shoots, Roots, Vines & Fruits Predators: No Natural Predators. Humans & Occassionally Leopards. Top Speed: 30 \u2013 35 Kph (20 \u2013 25 Mph) No. of Species:\n2 Conservation Status:\nCritically Endangered\nIn addition to being stocky, gorillas have broad chests and shoulders. They also have large hands with forearms that are shorter than their upper arm. Gorillas have a black and hairless face with large nostrils and small eyes that are set closely together.\nThere are actually two distinct species of gorillas, the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla.\nThe eastern species (Gorilla beringei) lives specifically in the east central part of Africa, and the western species (Gorilla gorilla) inhabits the west central part of Africa. The eastern gorilla are the larger of the species and have darker and longer fur.\nAdult male gorillas known as \u2018silverbacks\u2019, due to silver hair on their backs, are generally larger than their female counterparts, and can weigh between 136 to 195 kg (300 to 430 lb) and be as tall as 4 ft 7 in to 5 ft 11 in (1.4 to 1.8 m).\nUnfortunately all species (and sub-species) of gorilla are currently listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List due to habitat destruction, poaching for the bushmeat and wildlife trade.\nInteresting Gorilla Facts\n1. Of the two species of gorillas, each has two lowland and upland subspecies.\nThe western gorilla is split into two different subspecies including the Cross River gorilla and the Western Lowland gorilla. The eastern gorilla species includes the Mountain gorilla, and Eastern Lowland or Grauer\u2019s gorilla.\n2. The two subspecies have very different habitats.\nThe gorilla is mostly restricted to countries in central Sub-Saharan Africa, but the various subspecies live in different elevations. The mountain gorillas are known to inhabit higher elevations up to 4,300 metres above sea level. The lowlands species tend to stay near the valley floor in the thick rain forests on the Atlantic Coast of Africa.\n3. Of the various subspecies of gorillas, two have small populations left on the planet.\nThe Cross River gorilla contains about 250 animals still in the wild restricted to a small border area between Nigeria and Cameroon, making them the worlds rarest ape. The Mountain gorilla is also severely endangered with an estimated 880 still alive today. There are estimates of fewer than 5,000 Eastern Lowland gorillas, and over 100,000 Western Lowland gorillas in existence.\n4. Gorillas are the largest primate, with the tallest Silverback recorded at over 6ft 5in and heaviest at over 590 pounds (265 kg).\nThat\u2019s roughly 3 times heavier than an average man, when their height is somewhat similar. This indicates just how broad and muscly gorillas are.\nThey out rank monkeys, lemurs, chimpanzees, orangutans and humans as the largest primate.\n5. Gorillas are fast.\nIf you were to be chased by a gorilla, you better have wheels underneath you as they can reach speeds of over 20 miles per hour with a top speed clocked at 25 Mph.\n6. They are highly intelligent, and can learn words.\nEvidence of this comes from Koko, a gorilla that was born in captivity that was taught sign language and had a vocabulary of about one thousand signs by the age of 40. She also understood about 2,000 words in English.\n7. Mountain gorillas are generally larger, with longer, darker hair and tend to have shorter arms than their lowland gorilla cousins.\nThey also generally have a larger nose and jaw, and teeth, too!\n8. Gorillas move around by knuckle-walking.\nThis is when they rely on their knuckles (or other parts of their hands) to walk and shift location.\n9. Gorillas live in \u2018troops\u2019.\nA \u2018troop\u2019 is a group of up to thirty gorillas, which often consistent of a dominate male gorilla, a handful of females and their immature offspring.\n10. Gorillas have a fairly long lifespan.\nGorillas can live generally between 35 and 40 years in the wild. Those who are kept in zoos fair better and can live for 50 or more years. One female gorilla in a zoo in the United States lived to 60 years of age.\n11. Gorillas stand in similar heights as humans.\nAn adult male gorilla will stand between 5-feet, 7-inches to 6-feet tall. Females are slightly shorter.\n12. Gorillas arm span is significantly longer than their body height.\nThe arm span of an average adult male gorilla is between 7-feet, 7-inches and 8-feet, 6-inches. The females arm span is somewhat less than that. This is in comparison to the average human male arm span, which is usually around 1-5cm longer.\n13. They rarely go ape about anything.\nGorillas are considered to be peaceful creatures. However, there are times when a younger male will challenge a more mature one. They will typically just make a lot of noise, beating chests, baring teeth, charging forward and waving sticks until one backs down.\n14. Gorillas are not meat eaters.\nThe gorilla diet is mainly vegetarian, which includes fruit, bamboo shoots and plant stems. They also rarely drink water, as they can get all they need from the foods they consume. Adult gorillas can eat up to 30kg of food each day.\n15. They have a large repertoire.\nGorillas communicate in a variety of ways which also includes 25 different sounds, from belches, to screams, to warning calls, singing and chuckles.\n16. There is no clearly defined mating season.\nGorillas can mate any time of the year. Females mature between 10 and 12 years of age and males mature between 11 and 13 years. The gestation period is roughly 8 and-a-half months.\n17. The mother and baby gorilla spend a lot of time together.\nA newborn gorilla will weigh between three and four pounds. The mother will carry it around against her chest for a number of months until the baby can hang on to her back.\n18. The young gorilla learns fast.\nA baby gorilla will learn how to walk by the time it reaches six months of age and it will be able to follow its mother for short distances once it gets to 18 months of age. Riding on Mom\u2019s back is the safest place for the baby, even at this point in its life. It will stay with its mother until it is four to six years of age sharing her nest all the while.\n19. The young gorillas continue learning as they grow.\nYoung gorilla will learn just by imitating what it sees others around him or her doing. In fact, this is how a young gorilla will pick up many different actions and will act them out in play fights with other young gorillas.\n20. Gorillas are always on the move.\nA group of gorillas is called a troop. The troop will not spend more than a day in the same place and it is believed that this is to allow food to replenish itself after the troop moves to another location. The new location is picked by a silverback gorilla, which is more or less the leader of that troop. Food is the determining factor as to where the gorillas will move today and tomorrow.\n21. Gorilla building is believed to be more than just art.\nNest building by gorillas is no longer looked upon by researchers as just being a fine example of animal architecture. They are now saying that nest building demonstrates great tool use by the primates.\n22. Gorillas are poor swimmers.\nAs they are unable to swim naturally, gorillas will avoid rivers and large bodies of water.\nGorilla Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification"}

Not in the animal kingdom! There are tongues that soak up liquid like mops. Or tongues that can stick out 160 times a minute like a jackhammer. First, let's have a look at some awesome records:\nThe Longest Tongues in the World:\nAnimal Tongue Length Body Length Chameleon 47.2 inch (120 cm) 23.6 inch (60 cm) Giant Pangolin 27.5 inch (70 cm) 39.3 inch (100 cm) Giraffe 21.2 inch (54 cm) 236 inch (600 cm) Sun Bear 9.84 inch (25 cm) 55.1 inch (140 cm) Tube-Lipped Nectar Bat 3.3 inch (8.5 cm) 1.9 inch (5 cm) Lungless Salamander 1.9 inch (5 cm) 2.3 inch (6 cm)\nFor comparison: the longest human tongue is 3.7 inch (9.5 cm) long.\n1. Chameleon\nCategory: Slingshot\nThe most famous tongue in the world belongs to one of the most colorful animals in the world: the chameleon. In relation to their body size, it\u2019s the longest tongue in the world. It\u2019s twice as long as the animal itself (including its tail). Within a fraction of a second, it\u2019s flung towards prey like a rubber band. The insect is stuck and the chameleon just has to \u201creel it in\u201d. Imagine if humans had tongues like that. The sugar from the next table over at a caf\u00e9 - sluuurp! Or the chips straight out of the bag while watching TV - sluuurp!\n2. Giraffe\nCategory: Washcloth\nIf your eyes sting or itch, you stretch your hand out and rub them with your fingers. Not so great if you happen to be a giraffe with hooves instead of fingers. But it\u2019s not too bad, just stick your tongue out. It\u2019s 21.2 inch (54 cm) long and can easily reach a stressed eye. The giraffe\u2019s dark blue to black tongue is so hard-wearing that not even the prickliest acacia leaves a wound when the giraffe wraps its tongue around the leaves.\n3. Bat\nCategory: Mop\nThe mammal with the longest, and funniest, tongue is the bat anoura fistulata. They grow to just 1.9 inch (5 cm) long but their tongues grow to 3.3 inch (8.5 cm). These bats slurp sweet nectar out of deep flowers as a tasty snack. And you couldn\u2019t do that without a tongue! The nectar has to reach the mouth somehow, so the bat has small, fine hairs at the tip of its tongue. They soak up the nectar like a mop. Bon appetit!"}

These beautiful mammals are related to giraffes, and the resemblance can be seen in the head and neck. This is an endangered species, and their survival rests in our hands. Read on to learn about the okapi.\nDescription of the Okapi\nThese beautiful mammals appear to be a hodgepodge of different animals smacked together. They have black and white striped legs from a zebra, solid auburn body from a horse, and a long neck from a giraffe. The striped coloration extends all the way to the tail in the hind (rear) legs, and to the armpit in the front legs.\nInteresting Facts About the Okapi\nThese interesting animals don\u2019t just look strange, they have interesting behavior and characteristics as well! These endangered mammals are truly one of a kind in the animal kingdom.\nClose Cousins \u2013 Okapi are the closest living relatives to giraffes. The similarities between the two can actually be seen in a number of ways. their heads look quite similar to giraffes, and they also bear a disproportionately long neck (though not as long as a giraffe). Both animals also have dark colored, prehensile tongues used for grasping leaves.\n\u2013 Okapi are the closest living relatives to giraffes.

Creative Coat \u2013 While we may consider stripes to be bold and noticeable, they actually help the animal blend in to its environment. In the dense rainforest, sunlight can only partially filter through the leaves, creating a spotted, blotched, or striped pattern similar to this animal\u2019s markings. They also have quite oily hair, which allows raindrops to slide right off their fur.\n\u2013 While we may consider stripes to be bold and noticeable, they actually help the animal blend in to its environment.

They also have quite oily hair, which allows raindrops to slide right off their fur. Smelly My Feet! \u2013 These beautiful animals are mainly solitary creatures, and finding other animals in thick rainforest can be quite difficult. Like many other animals, okapis have an advanced scent marking system throughout their territory. Their scent glands are in their feet, which leave a smelly trail for other animals to translate when they pass through later.\nHabitat of the Okapi\nOkapi live exclusively in dense rainforests. They are perfectly adapted for forest living. Their coat pattern matches the forest, and is equipped for combating the frequent rainfall. They are shorter than their giraffe cousins to help them navigate through the trees. These animals are found exclusively in rainforest habitat.\nDistribution of the Okapi\nWild okapi are found exclusively in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Their range runs both north and east of the Congo River, and they can be found mostly in central, northern, and eastern DRC. There are small groups of animals west and south of the Congo, but they are highly fragmented from the rest of the population.\nDiet of the Okapi\nOkapis are herbivorous, meaning that they feed exclusively on plants. They will eat leaves, ferns, fungi, grass, fruit, and other plant matter.\nResearch of the animal\u2019s feces has determined that they will feed on over 100 different species of plants. When browsing for plants, they use their long tongues to help them pluck choice vegetation and bring it to their mouths.\nOkapi and Human Interaction\nUnfortunately, okapi have undergone a significant decrease in population. Habitat loss is a huge contributing factor in the decline of their numbers. Logging and land development have caused increased deforestation in their home range. They have also been directly hunted for their meat and skin, both historically and recently via illegal poaching.\nDomestication\nOkapi have not been domesticated in any way. They have, however, been successfully bred in zoos. In zoological facilities across the United States and Europe, they have been intensively bred as a safeguard for the declining population.\nDoes the Okapi Make a Good Pet\nAs an endangered species, it is illegal to own one of these animals. All animals in zoos are kept as part of a species survival plan.\nOkapi Care\nIn zoos, these animals are fed a variety of different plants. Some of the foods provided to them are alfalfa hay, yams, carrots, and acacia branches. They are also provided with plenty of exhibit space and environmental enrichment.\nOkapi are also trained using positive reinforcement. They can be taught to accept voluntary blood draws, physical examinations, ultrasounds, hoof trimming, and more.\nBehavior of the Okapi\nThis is a diurnal species, which means that they are active most frequently during the daytime. Unless a female has a calf, they are mainly solitary animals.\nWhile they do not socialize outside of breeding season, their territories do overlap in some areas. Male territories do not overlap very often, but females will frequently overlap territories with males.\nReproduction of the Okapi\nWhen the female is receptive to breeding, the male will begin courtship. After mating, the female has a gestation period of 440 \u2013 450 days. The calf can stand and walk within 30 minutes after being born! At three months old, the calf will begin to eat solid foods, and at six months the mother will wean the calf off of milk entirely."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "The Giraffe's Diet (in the Wild/Captivity/Seasons)", "url": "https://www.animalfoodplanet.com/what-do-giraffes-eat/", "text": "If you\u2019ve ever visited a zoo, chances are that you have laid your eyes upon the towering giraffe. Taking the title as the world\u2019s tallest mammal, these animals are usually loved by the public.\nWith such unique features, it\u2019s no wonder that they make a spectacle. But why do they have such long necks? And what exactly does a giraffe eat, both in the wild and in captivity?\nWHAT DO GIRAFFES EAT?\nThe giraffe is a herbivore, meaning that it only feeds on different types of plants. They are also referred to as browsers, choosing to eat from food that is higher up such as tall trees. Giraffes mainly eat the flowers, twigs, and leaves off of trees and shrubs such as Acacia, apricot and mimosa trees. They can also be seen occasionally consuming fruits and grasses.\nThese animals are recognized for their lengthy necks, two horn-like structures on the top of their heads called ossicones, and a speckling of uniquely patterned spots over the majority of their bodies.\nMeasuring around 4 to 6 meters, giraffes are able to reach their favorite meals.\nWHAT DO GIRAFFES EAT IN THE WILD?\nThere are an estimated 100,000 giraffes found in the world. You\u2019ve probably heard the giraffe described as a safari animal. This is because they can only be found naturally on the continent of Africa.\nThere are four giraffe species currently known, each of which inhabits a different geographic region. This can alter their diet or foraging ranges.\nReticulated Giraffe\nThe Reticulated giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis reticulata) is one of the better-known species of giraffe. They are most commonly recognized for their reticulated or divided, spots that take on a darker red hue.\nThese animals can be found near the Horn of Africa. There are about 8,500 wild existing individuals.\nThis species of giraffe is seen in a wide variety of habitats across the northeastern parts of Africa. Because of this, they are known to eat an expansive collection of plants, over 100 in fact.\nTheir favorite leaves tend to be off of Acacia, Almond and Myrrh trees. They will also eat twigs, bark, shoots, fruits, and seeds.\nMasai Giraffe\nAnother species of giraffe, the Masai giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi), is a bit different from the Reticulated giraffe in relation to their pattern.\nInstead of having a pattern that is more rounded, the spot edges are more jagged or ripped. They are also a darker shade of tan or brown. This species takes refuge near Kenya and Tanzania.\nThe Masai giraffe has experienced a drastic shift in their habitat. In fact, these animals used to live all over Africa, but now their range is limited to the dryer areas.\nThey almost entirely thrive off of the leaves, twigs, flowers, and bark of Acacia trees. African explorers have also documented these animals eating fruit on occasion.\nYou may have noticed a commonality between both of these African species. Giraffes sure love their Acacia, whether if it\u2019s in the form of twigs, flowers, bark or leaves.\nBut, one fact about Acacia is that they are covered in thorns. So how does a giraffe forage through this prickly plant?\nWHAT DO GIRAFFES EAT IN AFRICA?\nYou may picture Africa as being a desolate savanna with hardly any trees, but that is not always the case. Just as anywhere else, there are a variety of habitats, each of which the giraffe must find enough food to survive.\nWhat do giraffes eat in the savanna?\nThe savanna can be described as an area with grassy plains and a few scattered trees. Individuals found among the tropical savannas of Africa will roam until they find Baobab, Candelabra, and Whistling thorn trees.\nOnce striking gold, these browsers will consume the shoots, bark, leaves, flowers, and buds off of these plants.\nWhat do giraffes eat in the grasslands?\nYou might be thinking that the African savannas and grasslands are the same thing. It\u2019s true that they do overlap though there are a few differences. As the name suggests, it is overrun with grasses while savannas contain more shrubs.\nGrass species most commonly consumed by giraffes in these regions are Napier and Elephant grass. Unlike the savanna, this biome contains more of a giraffe\u2019s favorite meal.\nThe beloved Acacia trees are an abundant grassland species with plenty of leaves, bark, fruits, flowers, and shoots to eat.\nWhat do giraffes eat in the woodlands?\nIf you\u2019re a giraffe, you might want to live in a place that is blanketed with trees. Well, that is exactly what the woodlands are. The Miombo woodlands, in particular, extend across south-central Africa, Angola, and Tanzania in a belt-like range.\nThere are a large variety of shrubs and trees, including the Biombo trees that can reach 20 meters in height. Once again, giraffes will survive off of leaves, fruits, flowers, bark and buds associated with these trees.\nWHAT DO GIRAFFES EAT DURING DIFFERENT SEASONS?\nThese herbivores are found throughout Africa where food is not always available. Giraffes are known to adapt to the various seasons.\nDry Season\nThe savanna is known for being arid. When dry seasons hit, giraffes will migrate large distances in search for food. They will also expand their diet to other types of vegetation such as grasses and plants with needles instead of leaves.\nEvergreen trees tend to also be a favorite meal during this season to avoid fatigue as they contain more nutrients.\nRainy Season\nWhen rain is abundant, so is the vegetation. Even Africa has wet seasons, allowing for plant restoration. Giraffes during this time will focus their foraging efforts on gaining as much energy as they can.\nThe fruits, twigs, and leaves of deciduous plants meet this requirement.\nWinter Season\nYou may already know that Africa has a winter season, but did you know that this is the warmest time of the year? Accompanied by chilly mornings and nights, this makes it challenging for wildlife to survive.\nTo keep their energy lifted, giraffes will consume a different spikey plant, the Prickly pear. The leaves are rich with nutrients, making it a favorable winter meal.\nWHAT DO GIRAFFES EAT IN CAPTIVITY?\nNot everyone is able to travel to Africa to see these amazing giants. That\u2019s why zoos have made African wildlife, such as the giraffe, a staple.\nThe need for giraffe ambassadors has become even more prevalent since their wild relatives are on the decline. There are about 2,000 individuals found in zoos today, each of which has to be given the proper nutrition.\nEducating the public on what these animals would eat in the wild is paramount. To replicate this experience, most zoos feed their giraffes Acacia leaves.\nNext time you go to the zoo, you might notice a few piles of forage that is hung. This is to mimic the tall trees found in the wild.\nIn addition to Acacia foliage, captive giraffes are often fed nutrient-rich foods including carrots, hay, grain, and fruits. There are even specialized pellets that contain the correct amount of starch and fiber to make for the healthiest animals.\nIndividuals found in zoos have been known to live longer than their wild counterparts at about 28 years on average. With the challenges of varying seasons and predation, wild giraffes tend to survive a total of 20 to 25 years.\nHOW MUCH WILL A GIRAFFE EAT IN A DAY?\nRegardless of their living circumstances, giraffes spend the majority of their day eating. On average, a single giraffe will eat about 35 kilograms of plant material in a day. When you consider how light a leaf is, you can imagine how long it might take to reach that weight in foliage.\nWith such a large body mass, it is no wonder that these animals have to constantly eat. If they didn\u2019t spend the majority of their day foraging, then they would not have the energy to escape potential predators.\nWHAT DO BABY GIRAFFES EAT?\nBeing born in Africa, giraffes have to watch out for a number of threats. The survival of the young is dependent on how quickly they can walk.\nOnce a baby giraffe is born, it relies upon the milk of its mother to become strong. And although a newborn giraffe measures almost 2 meters in height, they cannot reach the leaves off of a tree.\nIt takes about six months for a baby giraffe to begin reaching these plants. Until then, the mother will pull foliage down for the infant.\nA fun fact about baby giraffes is their ability to run with the herd merely 10 hours after birth. This is critical in escaping predators."}

Their long neck, spindly legs, and spots set them apart. Their sheer size along with their gentle demeanor and slow movements make giraffes memorizing to watch. I would love to take an African safari to see them in the wild. I don\u2019t think I am alone in my fascination with giraffes judging from the recent popularity of April the giraffe!\nIn the past, we studied giraffes along with other African animals in our homeschool. We learned the basics of their size, habitat, and habits. One of the things that intrigued us the most was how different the giraffe was from all other animals that it shared a habitat with and how it is the uniqueness of the giraffe anatomy that makes it perfectly suitable to survive along side other animals.\nGiraffe Habitat\nGiraffes are social mammals living in herds on the savannas of sub-Saharan Africa. Savannas are grassy plains dotted with trees (usually acacia trees). Giraffes share this habitat with other animals such as zebras, cape buffalo, antelope, lions, cheetahs, and wild dogs.\nAdvantages Of A Giraffe\u2019s Long Legs And Long Neck\nWhen giraffes are born, they are already huge at 6 feet tall and around 150 pounds. Full grown giraffes average 16-18 feet tall. Males can reach 2600 lbs, while females are typically smaller at around 1800 lbs. These are large animals!\nThe great height of the giraffe can be attributed to their long legs and neck. The legs of adult giraffes along average 6 feet tall. That\u2019s taller than most full-grown human adults! Their legs appear skinny and bony with little muscle. The secret to these twiggy legs\u2019 ability to hold up all the giraffe weight is in their ligaments. Ligaments are connective tissue that hold bones together. Scientist believe that giraffes have special suspensatory ligaments in their legs that are key to the their stability and strength.\nThe necks of giraffes are their most recognizable feature. They can grow to 6 feet long and weigh 600 lbs. Although the necks of giraffes are huge, they have 7 cervical, or neck, vertebrae, just like humans. However, each cervical vertebrae of giraffes can be 10 inches long.\nThe length of the giraffe\u2019s neck gives them advantages when it comes to finding food. Giraffes are herbivores preferring the leaves of acacia trees. They can reach the high leaves of trees that no other animal can reach. This means there is no other competition for this food and other leaves and grasses closer to the ground are left for other animals.\nWhen tree leaves are not available, giraffes can, also because of their long necks, reach grasses closer to the ground. The ability to eat a range of leaves and grasses from a variety of sources gives giraffes the ability to adapt to changes in its environment. This is important as one adult male giraffe can eat 75 pounds of food each day!\nWhat Is With That Tongue?\nHave you ever seen a giraffe tongue? It\u2019s kind of shocking the first time you see this 18 inch, blue tongue spring out of a giraffe\u2019s mouth and wrap its way around a tree branch and remove its leaves. It\u2019s pretty cool actually and serves the giraffe quite well. This long tongue is perfect for the diet of the giraffe.\nGiraffes love the leaves of the acacia tree. The problem is that acacia branches are covered in thorns. These sharp thorns would injure the head and mouth of almost all animals who would dare eat the acacia leaves\u2026except for the giraffe. The giraffe\u2019s tongue is long enough to reach and remove the leaves from the acacia branch without allowing the head of the giraffe to get close enough to get injured by the thorns. The tongue is very rough and thick preventing it from getting hurt by the thorns.\nBlue? Yep. The tongue of the giraffe is dark blue or purple. Scientist think this is sunscreen for the giraffe. Since giraffes eat constantly with their tongues exposed 12 hours a day, they need protection from the sun. Can you imagine a sunburn on your tongue? Ouch!\nThe Giraffes\u2019 Special Digestive System\nGiraffes have a special type of digestive system that is very efficient. Most of what the giraffes eat gets converted into energy. Like cows, giraffes are ruminant animals. This means they have a four chambered stomach. Each chamber plays an important role in breaking down the leaves the giraffe eats.\nThe first chamber, the rumen, is more of a storage compartment where bacteria start the digestion process. When the food is broken down a bit by the bacteria, the giraffe regurgitates the food back into its mouth were it is chewed again. This regurgitated food is called cud. This is why it appears that giraffes are eating all the time!\nAfter the cud is chewed, the giraffe swallows it and it is moved through the other chambers of the stomach where digestion continues.\nDo Giraffes Have Horns?\nGiraffes do have two horn-like structures on top of their heads called ossicones. These start as cartilage outgrowths but harden over time. The ossicones of female giraffes are often thin and tufted, while the ossicones of the males are usually thicker and bald because of battling other male giraffes.\nGiraffe Anatomy And Fact Links\nDo you want more information on giraffes?

How Do They Do It?", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/giraffe-baby-film-standing-birth-news", "text": "In the African savanna, the learning curve for survival is steep and unforgiving. The strong will survive, and the rest may become meals for hungry predators. The birth of a giraffe brings this reality into view.\nGiraffe moms, or cows, are pregnant for about 15 months. This long gestation period is necessary to allow the calves to become highly developed in the safety of their mother\u2019s womb. Most newborn calves weigh in at around 220 pounds and stand over six feet tall.\nOnce the calf is born and falls to the ground, it can\u2019t waste any time standing up. Calves normally stand within 30 minutes of birth. In the video above, you\u2019ll see the first moments of a giraffe\u2019s life. While the struggle can be adorable, like watching a human child take their first stumbles, for a giraffe these moments can be the difference between life and death. (Related: One strange reason why giraffes are being killed.)\nBorn to Run\nAll animals can be placed on a spectrum of helpless to relatively self-sufficient at birth. The former, or altricial group, includes animals that cannot locomote and require intense care, like humans. Precocial animals, however\u2014like giraffes\u2014almost literally hit the ground running.\nNeuroscientist Dr. Jean-Marie Gra\u00efc of Italy\u2019s University of Padova, who has studied giraffe brains, says that at birth one of these animals is a \u201cmini-adult.\u201d\n\u201cThe nervous system is ready at birth, like it would be of a one year old [human] child ready to walk,\u201d he says. The corticospinal tract, he adds, is born ready to command the muscles, unlike in the case of a human infant.\nIn fact, the average newborn giraffe starts walking over 10,000 times faster than the typical human. Although this comparison is a bit of a stretch, considering the vast differences, it\u2019s also illustrative. One reason humans take so long to walk is because they are born with relatively large heads\u2014storing our powerful brains. In the case of humans, and other primates, that\u2019s where much of the developmental energy is concentrated.\nBut for giraffes, and other hooved animals that serve as prey to many predators, the energy is concentrated in developing muscles. It\u2019s more important for them to be quick than smart, so to speak.\nAnd for good reason. Death rates for newborn giraffes can be 50 percent or more in areas with high predator densities, says Stephanie Fennessy, director and co-founder of the Giraffe Conservation Foundation.\nPlease be respectful of copyright.

In the event of an attack, the mother will stand over her offspring and kick her legs at the attacking party. Giraffe moms are experts at hiding their calves, but they do have food and water requirements that keep them away from their offspring for many hours during the day. During parental absence, a calf is vulnerable to attack.\nWith this high rate of mortality paired with a 15-month pregnancy, one might even wonder how such a situation is evolutionarily favorable. \u201cThe clumsy initial steps, and the [baby\u2019s] movements... would seem to be signals that can attract predators,\u201d says Fred Bercovitch, executive director of a group called Save the Giraffes. Indeed: Why don't giraffe calves remain more hidden?\nBercovitch explains that it\u2019s likely because the calves have to follow their mothers shortly after birth to find nutritious foods. Better to trail mom\u2014albeit awkwardly\u2014than remain behind.\nBesides predators, giraffes also face the additional danger of being poached for their heads, which serve as trophies, as well as their tails, which serve as a status symbol in some communities. The giraffe population is declining as their habitats are fragmenting, diseases spread, and poaching persists; As of 2016 giraffes are listed as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.\nHuman threats, unfortunately, are not ones these animals can outrun."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Who is the Tallest Animal in the World? - WorldAtlas", "url": "https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/who-is-the-tallest-animal-in-the-world.html", "text": "The giraffe is the tallest existing terrestrial animal. It belongs to the genus of African even-toed ungulate mammals and classified under the Family Giraffidae. It is also the largest ruminant and is popular for its towering neck and long legs. Its range covers the countries of Chad, Niger and Somali, inhabiting mainly the savannah and woodland. Although giraffes are the tallest animals in the world, they may fall prey to several wild animals including lion, leopard, and African wild dogs. Because of its peculiar appearance, the giraffe has featured in several cultures, paintings, and books. Giraffes are classified as 'Vulnerable' by the IUCN.\nPhysical Characteristics\nA fully grown giraffe can measure up to 18.7 feet and weighs up to approximately 4,200 pounds. The male giraffe is usually taller and heavier than the female. On average, an adult male weighs 2,628 pounds while the female weighs 1,825 pounds. Despite the long neck and leg, the giraffe has a relatively short body. Both the front and the hind legs of a giraffe are of the same length. The legs have suspensory ligaments which are useful in supporting the body. The eyes are large and bulging and are located on either side of the head, giving it a greater vision from the great height. The prehensile tongue measures about 18 inches long and is purplish-black in color. The tongue aids in the grasping of foliage and also for grooming. The upper lip, which is also prehensile, also comes in handy during foraging. There are dark patches on the coat which can sometimes be orange, brown, or nearly black. The patches are separated by a white light hair. As they grow older, the male giraffes turn darker. Giraffe\u2019s skin is mostly gray and thick, allowing it to run through thorn bushed without injuries.\nGiraffe\u2019s Neck\nThe neck is extremely long and can reach up to 6.6-7.9 feet, accounting for much of the animal\u2019s height. The long neck is as a result of the unequal lengthening of the cervical vertebrae and not additional vertebrae. A cervical vertebra is about 11-inch long. The cervical vertebrae account for 52-54% of the vertebral column of a giraffe. The elongation of the cervical vertebrae takes place after birth since the mother giraffe may have a difficulty giving birth to a baby with the same neck proportion as the adult. The head and the neck of a giraffe is always held up by muscles and strengthened by nuchal ligaments.\nSeveral hypotheses have been put forward to try and explain the origin and the maintenance of the giraffe\u2019s long neck. The first hypothesis is the \u201ccompetitive browser hypothesis\u201d by Charles Darwin. He suggested that the elongation of the neck was as a result of competition for food from other small browsers. The competitive browser theory was challenged recently.\nAnother hypothesis is the sexual selection hypothesis which links the elongation of neck to the secondary sexual characteristic of the giraffe. Necks are used by the males to establish dominance through \u201cnecking,\u201d a combat of a sort involving the males. To support this theory, the male giraffe\u2019s neck is stronger, heavier, and longer than the female\u2019s neck."}

In others, outrunning predators led to animals evolving to have longer legs. Alternative evolutionary explanations for height include heat dispersal in more tropical climes, room for the efficient digestion of large amounts of vegetation, and more.\nAll species evolved to the right height for their needs. These land animals, ranging from the giraffe to the bison, needed extra height.\n1 of 8 Giraffe Most of giraffes' height comes from their necks. StanislavBeloglazov / Shutterstock No other land mammal has quite a view like a giraffe. Standing between 14 and 19 feet, giraffes are the tallest land mammals in the world. Sure, most of their height is in the neck, up to 8 feet of it, but their legs can also average about 6 feet. The giraffe's size is a significant advantage. Between the giraffe's height, good eyesight, and strong kicks, giraffes aren't often brought down, even by lions. They can live for between 10 and 15 years in the wild as a result. 11 Things You Might Not Know About Giraffes\n2 of 8 African Bush Elephant Elephants are plenty big and pretty tall, too. Peter Fodor / Shutterstock Next to the giraffe in terms of height is the elephant, specifically the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana). Males of this species have a shoulder height of 10.5 to 13 feet. The bush elephant's nearest relative, the African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), is between 7 and 8 feet at the shoulder. Given the overall size of bush elephants \u2014 they weigh about 13,448 pounds (6,100 kilograms) \u2014 they're even more difficult to prey on than giraffes. Lions attempt to hunt younger elephants, but they don't have much success. Still, the species is considered vulnerable due to poaching and the transformation of habitats into agricultural land. 13 Fascinating Facts About Elephants\n3 of 8 Ostrich Ostriches aren't Big Bird from \"Sesame Street\" tall, but they're tall. paula french / Shutterstock The ostrich is among the most recognizable birds. With their long necks and legs, an adult ostrich stands between 7 and 10 feet tall. The ostrich's long legs allow it to run at speeds up to 45 mph. Only cheetahs are fast enough to keep up with these big birds. Ostriches dig holes in the dirt to bury their eggs, and they have to lower their necks to turn the eggs with their beaks, and so, from far away, it can look like they're putting their heads in the sand. 11 Compelling Ostrich Facts\n4 of 8 Brown Bear If you think bears are intimidating on all fours, wait until they stand upright. NancyS / Shutterstock Brown bears (Ursus arctos) are a variable lot, with many subspecies. Called grizzly bears in North America, they are among the largest carnivores on the planet. On all fours, brown bears stand about 5 feet at the shoulder, but once they're up on their hind legs, they stand at 8 to 9 feet tall. Brown bears occupy a range of habitats across North America and Eurasia. Despite extinction in some locales, the brown bear is considered an animal of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Some pockets of the species struggle, mostly due to habitat destruction and poaching. 8 Amazing Facts About Grizzly Bears\n5 of 8 Alaskan Moose Moose are the largest of the deer species. David Drake / Shutterstock The Alaskan moose (Alces alces gigas) is a mighty herbivore of Alaska and the Yukon. Males reach 7.5 feet in height at the shoulder, and that's before you add the neck, head, and antlers. Moose are vegetarians and can consume up to 70 pounds of food a day. Their height makes grazing on short grasses and plants difficult. Instead, they choose bushes and taller grasses. They're also excellent swimmers because of their need to eat water plants, a source of sodium.\n6 of 8 Dromedary Camel Stand tall in the desert, camels. Wolfgang Zwanzger / Shutterstock One-humped camels, called Arabian or dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius), are the tallest of the camel species. Males reach about 5.9-6.6 feet at shoulder height, a measurement that does not include a good portion of the hump. The size of the hump varies, depending on whether the camel is using the fat reserves contained within for sustenance. Despite their impressive stature, dromedary camels are extinct in the wild and have been for almost 2,000 years. Today, this camel is semi-domesticated, meaning it may wander in the wild, but usually under the watchful eye of a herdsman.\n7 of 8 Shire Horse Shire horses are the tallest horses. Marina Kondratenko / Shutterstock Horses, despite their generally gentle nature, can be intimidating due to their size. This factor is especially true for the Shire horse. This horse breed descended from the English \"great horse,\" a kind of horse that was used by men in full armor hundreds of years ago. It's a sturdy, powerful horse. The Shire horse averages about 17 hands, or 5 feet, 7 inches tall at the withers, which is the ridge between the shoulder blades. When you add the neck and head, which will vary in size, you have one tall animal."}

Due to the lack of rain in the environment\u2014only about four inches each year\u2014trees are sparse. The animals of the savanna have developed unique skills and characteristics to take advantage of the tall grasses and limited forest.\n1 of 11 Grant's Gazelle Ivan Dupont / Getty Images A type of antelope, Grant\u2019s gazelles are common herbivores in the savanna biome. Predominantly grazers, gazelles eat shrubs and herbs but also enjoy tall grass during the dry season and, occasionally, fruit. What is perhaps most incredible about gazelles, however, is their ability to go long periods of time\u2014sometimes their entire life\u2014without drinking any water. Instead, gazelles can get sufficient water from the food they eat, making them an ideal resident of the dry savanna environment. What\u2019s more, gazelles have large salivary glands that make it easier to eat their dry diet without the help of a reliable water source.\n2 of 11 Caracal BirdImages / Getty Images Native to Africa, caracals are medium-sized wild cats that are at home in savannas as well as forests, scrub and acacia woodlands, marshy lowlands, and semi-deserts. Though primarily nocturnal, caracals have a low upper eyelid that shields their eyes from the harsh glare of the sun. And, like gazelles, caracals can go indefinitely without water, another trait that makes them well-suited to life in the savanna.\ufeff\ufeff What\u2019s more, the cat\u2019s unique ear tufts aid their survival in the savanna by camouflaging the cats in tall grasses and helping them identify the exact location of their prey.\n3 of 11 African Pygmy Falcon Brendan Ryan / Getty Images These adorable hunters are the smallest raptors in Africa and max out just under eight inches in height. Even with their small stature, pygmy falcons pack a punch; They are extremely agile and perch in high trees to better spot and target their prey. Pygmy falcons also help other residents of the savanna\u2014most notably weaver birds\u2014by sharing communal nests and reducing threats from predators like snakes and rodents. That said, pygmy falcons sometimes turn on their weaver companions. When their preferred meal of insects, lizards, rodents, and small birds isn\u2019t available, they will attack and kill weaver chicks in their communal nests.\n4 of 11 Cheetah GP232 / Getty Images One of the more well-known savanna dwellers, cheetahs live in the grasslands and open woodlands of the eastern and southern Africa savanna. Not only does the cheetah\u2019s coloring camouflage them in the savanna\u2019s grasslands, their bodies are specifically designed for hunting. Able to run up to 70 mph, the cheetah is the fastest animal on Earth. The cats have even developed slightly curved and fully retractable claws that make it easier to grip the ground when sprinting after prey. This feature also makes it easier to sink their claws into prey when the chase is over. 8 Fast Facts You Didn't Know About Cheetahs\n5 of 11 African Savanna Elephant Diana Robinson Photography / Getty Images Also known as the African bush elephant, the African savanna elephant is the largest subspecies of elephant and, in fact, the largest land mammal in the world. Savanna temperatures typically range between 68 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit, and the elephants\u2019 large ears let them radiate extra heat. Likewise, elephants can use their trunks to suck up water and mist themselves to cool off. The trunk\u2019s strong muscles also make it possible to lift over 400 pounds, which comes in handy during meal time. Elephants usually eat about 350 pounds of vegetation per day and help maintain savannas by reducing tree densities for other animals.\n6 of 11 Lion Dale Johnson / Getty Images Chances are, lions are one of the first animals you picture when you think about the African savanna. Like many other animals in this ecosystem, a lion\u2019s tan color lets it blend in with the surrounding environment. Retractable claws, similar to those of cheetahs, make it easier for lions to catch their prey, while their rough tongues help the predators get to the meat more efficiently. Lions have also evolved to survive the temperature conditions of their home by adjusting the thickness of their manes in periods of drought or high temperatures. Likewise, lions are generally nocturnal, which enables them to hunt during the evening, when it\u2019s cooler.\n7 of 11 Plains Zebra Digital Vision / Getty Images The plains zebra is the most common type of zebra, and is at home in open, grassy plains and grassy woodlands. Because of the savanna\u2019s dry season, zebras can migrate as far as 1,800 miles for food and water. They have developed a unique digestive tract that lets them consume lower quality grasses. Zebras are also well-adapted to temperatures in the savanna biome \u2014 their coats dissipate about 70% of their heat and act as natural sunscreen. And those famous stripes? The pattern makes it harder for predators to zero in on a single animal in the herd.\n8 of 11 Blue Wildebeest 1001slide / Getty Images Also called gnus, blue wildebeests are members of the antelope family, though they more closely resemble cattle. As a keystone species of the plains and acacia savanna ecosystems, these herbivores play an important role in keeping grass low and otherwise maintaining the savanna ecosystem for other local animals. Among their own adaptations for savanna life, wildebeests have long tails to swat flies and dark, vertical stripes that help them hide at night. And, because they\u2019re prey animals, wildebeests have adapted by birthing their calves in a three-week period to keep their numbers high and increase survival rates.\n9 of 11 Spotted Hyena PHOTOSTOCK-ISRAEL / Getty Images Spotted hyenas, often referred to as laughing hyenas, are the most common large carnivore in Africa. As hunters and scavengers, hyenas use animal matter very efficiently, making it easier to compete for food. This is made possible in part by how large the hyena\u2019s heart is in proportion to its body\u2014accounting for almost 1% of its body weight. Because of this unique adaptation, hyenas have high endurance for the long chases required to hunt their prey. Hyenas then cool off in watering holes and sleep in shallow pools and holes under bushes and scrub vegetation. This lets them take advantage of shade during hot days.\n10 of 11 White-Backed Vulture renATE photography / Getty Images Vultures play a vital role in maintaining the savanna by removing the remains of dead animals. The birds can scavenge on large animals, but their beaks aren\u2019t adapted to tough skin, so they can only feed on animals with soft tissue. Still, they survive by eating food other animals can\u2019t\u2014the high acidity of their stomach protects them from food poisoning. Beyond those adaptations, vultures enjoy the safety of large, scattered trees in the savanna for roosting and nesting. They also urinate on their legs and feet to cool off and kill parasites and bacteria that would otherwise threaten their health."}

Human Beings are aware of the existence of many kinds of animals, but still, they are unknown to some fun facts about animals.\nOur animal kingdom consists of millions of majestic, mysterious, and magnificent species. These amazing creatures that live on our land, beneath the oceans, and beyond will surely make you smile when you discover interesting fun facts about them.\nHere are some of the fun facts about animals from around the world that will remind you that the world is an awesome place.\n1.Koala fingerprints are so close to humans' that they could taint crime scenes.\nIf you take a closer look at Koalas hands, you'd see that they have fingerprints that are almost identical just like humans.\nIn fact, they're so similar that not even careful analysis under a microscope can easily distinguish when it involves loopy, whirling ridges on koalas' fingers from our own.\n2.Parrots will selflessly help each other out.\nResearchers have discovered that parrots will voluntarily help each other obtain food rewards and perform selfless acts.\nAccording to a 2020 study published in Current Biology co-author Auguste von Bayern noted, \"African grey parrots were intrinsically motivated to assist others, albeit the opposite individual wasn't their friend, in order that they behaved very pro-socially.\n3.Prairie dogs kiss.\nPrairie dogs are quirky creatures as they're giant rodents, they dig massive underground homes, and that they kiss. When they seem to be sweetly sharing a smooch they are actually touching their front teeth to identify each other.\nThe BBC explains that scientists believe prairie dogs kiss and cuddle more when they are being watched by zoo visitors because they enjoy the attention.\n4.The mantis shrimp has the world's fastest punch.\nIt's the mantis shrimp that has the world's fastest punch than a boxer, traveling at about 50 mph.\nAccording to Science its little fists are \"accelerating faster than a .22-caliber bullet\". National Geographic also shared the tale of Tyson a mantis in April 1998, an aggressive creature who smashed through the quarter-inch-thick glass wall of his cell.\n5.The world's oldest known breed of domesticated dog dates back to 329 BC.\nDogs are well known for being man's best friend and this relationship goes back longer than you might expect. Consistent with Guinness World Records, the oldest known breed of domesticated dog goes all the way back to 329 BC.\"There are carvings found in Sumer which represent a dog, which resembles a Saluki, which dates back to 7000 BC.\"\n6.And the oldest evidence of domesticated cats dates back 9,500 years.\nAccording to Guinness World Records reports humans have been domesticating cats for over 9,500 years.\nIn 2004 it was proved \"bones of a cat were discovered within the Neolithic village of Shillourokambos in Cyprus. The position of the cat within the ground was next to the bones of a person's, whose similar state of preservation strongly suggests they were buried together.\"\n7.Bottlenose dolphins are even more right-handed than humans.\nAccording to Scientific American \"Around 70-80% humans are right-handed and the remaining are left-handed\". And the same goes for bottlenose dolphins.\nA team of Florida's Dolphin Communication Project noticed the feeding behavior of bottlenose dolphins and found that the animals were turning to their left side 99.44 percent of the time, which \"actually suggests a right-side bias\".\n8.Cows painted with zebra-like stripes can avoid being bitten by flies.\nCows have to deal with the annoying pesky flies. Farmers can now protect their animals by painting them with zebra-like stripes.\nA study of PLOS One published in 2019 states that \"the numbers of biting flies on Japanese Black cows painted with black-and-white stripes were significantly less than those on non-painted cows and cows painted only with black stripes.\" This worked because the stripes cause a sort of motion that confused them much within the way that optical illusions.\n9.Capuchin monkeys wash their hands and feet in urine.\nCapuchin monkeys wash their feet and hands in urine to urge comfort or sex.

That's because they need a secret handshake or password.\"\nCowbirds lay their eggs in other bird's nests, which suggests that their little ones eventually got to reconnect with their own kind when the time is true. And when that point comes, the young birds have a trick for deciding whom to succeed in bent, simply they use \"a specific chatter call\" to interact with one another.\n12.Pigeons can do the math.\nOne of the studies of 2011 published in the journal Science found that birds are capable of doing math. During the study, the pigeons were asked to compare nine images, each containing a different number of objects.\nThe researchers found that the birds were able to rank the images in order of how many objects they contained. You might think of pigeons as not that smart but they're actually quite intelligent!\n13.Frogs can freeze without dying.\nAccording to Kenneth Storey, a professor at Carleton University \"We have false springs here all the time where it gets really warm and all the snow melts and then suddenly bam the wind comes from the north and it's back down to -10 to -15 Celsius and they're fine\". Frogs undergo repeated freeze-thaw cycles.\n14.Reindeer eyes turn blue in the winter.\nAccording to the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, \"the eyes of Arctic reindeer change color through the seasons from gold to blue, adapting to extreme changes of sunshine levels in their environment.\"\nThe change in color impacts how light is reflected through the animals' retina, and improves their vision. Reindeers have beautiful baby blues eyes but only in the winter!\n15.Sloths can take up to a month to completely digest a single leaf.\nEverything about life is slow for these sleepy mammals. With its slow metabolism, it's going to take the sloth a month to digest one leaf.\nFor comparison, it takes the typical human 12 to 48 hours to ingest, digest, and eliminate waste from food.\n16.Adult cats only meow at humans.\nAccording to the ASPCA, while \u201cKittens meow to let their mother know they\u2019re cold or hungry, but once they get a bit older, cats no longer meow to other cats.\nBut they continue to meow at people throughout their lives.\u201d Cats mostly do this to get human\u2019s attention. Next time the cat wants your attention, it will make \u2018miaow\u2019 again!\n17.Painted turtles survive winter by breathing through their butts.\nPainted turtles need to adapt to frozen ponds, which restrict their access to the air above the water. In the winter, Painted Turtles do something called brumation, which may be a period of dormancy, almost like hibernation. During brumation, these turtles use their butts for breathing. This process is called cloacal respiration.\n18.Snow leopards don't roar.\nAccording to a study of 2010 published in the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, scientists researched why some cats have a higher-pitched meow than others. Through this study, they found that it's not the size that determines a kitty's call, but its habitat.\nSnow leopards have less-developed vocal cords than their fellow large cats, this means that they can't roar, but make a purr-like sound called a chuff.\n19.Squirrels will adopt orphans.\nAn evolutionary biologist Andrew McAdam said, \u201cSocial animals, including lions and chimpanzees, are often surrounded by relatives, so it isn't surprising that a female would adopt an orphaned loved one because they need already spent tons of your time together.\u201d\nAccording to the study of the University of Guelph, animals will take in the orphaned pups of their late family members. Turns out, squirrels have an intense motherly instinct.\n20.Moths experience love at first scent.\nWell, love, at first sight, is not only meant for humans but the same goes for a moth.\nWhen a male moth catches a whiff of a female moth, he'll travel miles to find her\u2060 based on her scent alone.\nAccording to the experts at Audobon, \"they don't know what the female sounds like, or even what she looks like. But when they smell her, boy, do they know it, and they use her seductive musk to track her down.\"\n21.Ravens are masters of deception.\nA 2002 study published in Animal Behaviour found that these birds have the ability to deceive each other. The entire corvid family which includes crows, ravens, and jays is exceptionally intelligent. Ravens have also been known to play pranks on one another and to tease other animals.\n22.Cats recognize their own name but choose not to respond.\nIn a 2019 study published in Scientific Reports, researchers discovered that cats can recognize their own name but they don't necessarily feel obligated to respond.\nSorry, cat owners, your pet does know when you're calling their name, yet they're ignoring you.\n23.Cows produce more milk when listening to slow music.\nResearchers at the University of Leicester School of Psychology found that slow music can reduce stress in cows and increase the amount of milk they produce by 3% as opposed to more upbeat tunes.\n24.Catfish have taught themselves how to kill pigeons.\nIn southwestern France, a group of European catfish has learned to kill pigeons, launching themselves out of the water to grab the sunbathing birds.\nResearchers have no idea why they hunt the birds but guess it could be because of declining prey.\n25.Dragonflies create a heart with their tails while mating\nDragonflies even create a combined heart-shaped with their tails when mating. Dragonflies symbolize change, transformation, adaptability, mark a sign of spiritual growth, and emotional maturity seeing one of these flutterings around has a special meaning. Not only this, but they also embody love in many ways.\n26.Penguins propose to each other with pebbles\nJust like humans propose to each other by exchanging a ring, penguins also use the same method but with a pebble. When penguins choose a mate, they give a small stone over to them, which represents their lifelong commitment to each other. This one really pulls on your heartstrings!\n27.Ghost crabs growl using teeth in their stomachs.\nGhost crabs can growl at their enemies sort of a dog. crabs make fearsome noises using their teeth located within the stomachs. Ghost crabs utilize a special animal acoustic communication system.\nThey can make different sounds by striking the ground with their claws, rubbing their claws together to make a rasping sound, rubbing their legs to make a bubbly noise, and rubbing the teeth inside their stomachs to make a growling sound.\n28.Female lions do 90 percent of the hunting.\nAccording to CBS News \"Lionesses, not male lions, do the majority of hunting for their pride\".\nWhile male lions attract their fair share of attention thanks to their impressive men, it's the female lions who do the bulk of the work when it comes to feeding their families. 29. Some sharks glow in the dark.\n29. Sharks glow in the dark\nThe researchers, from Belgium and New Zealand, found that some shark species produce a glow that only other sharks can see.\nAccording to CNN this glow \"helps sharks identify each other and even fight against infection on a microbial level.\"\n30.Baby Tasmanian devils make life-long friendships.\nIf you have best friends who have been around since you were a child, then you have something in common with Baby Tasmanian devils.\nResearch has shown that Tasmanian devils form bonds when they're young, engage in friendly sleep-overs, that last for the rest of their lives.\nSo these are the 30 amazing fun facts about animals that will shock you.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "10 facts about wombats! - National Geographic Kids", "url": "https://www.natgeokids.com/uk/discover/animals/general-animals/facts-about-wombats/", "text": "There\u2019s more to these Aussie animals than meets the eye! So come on gang, let\u2019s find out some fantastic facts about wombats\u2026\nFacts about wombats\u2026\n1) Wombats are marsupials\nLike their tree-climbing cousin, the koala, wombats are marsupials. This means that they are part of a particular group of mammals, who have pouches where their newborn young develop.\nWombat babies are born super small and helpless, so the pouch is a safe place for them to grow up and get ready for the world!\nDid you know? Kangaroos, koalas, and wombats might not look alike, but they\u2019re all marsupials! Plus, their adorable babies are all known as joeys.\n2) There are three different species of wombat\nThese are the common wombat (also known as the bare-nosed wombat), the Southern hairy-nosed wombat, and the Northern hairy-nosed wombat. All three species live in Australia, including on the island of Tasmania. They have a variety of habitats, including mountains, forests, and grasslands!\n3) Wombats aren\u2019t as small as you might think!\nAn adult wombat usually grows to about a metre long \u2013 the same as a medium-sized dog. They can weigh up to 40 kilograms, and have wide, strong feet which are great for digging!\nAs well as being bigger than expected, wombats also live for a surprisingly long time. The oldest wombat ever, a large male known as Patrick, was 32 when he died!\n4) Wombats are mostly nocturnal\nThese clever critters spend their nights foraging for food, or digging new tunnels, entrances, or exits for their ever-expanding burrows! They are herbivores, so most of their time is spent grazing on native grasses.\nWombats usually spend their days tucked away in their underground homes. However, they do sometimes come out to sunbathe and warm up, especially when the weather is very cold.\n5) Wombats can run at speeds of up to 40km per hour!\nGood luck stopping a rampaging wombat! These amazing animals can move surprisingly quickly when they need to, and can sustain this speed for up to 90 seconds. There are even reports of humans being knocked over by charging wombats!\n6) Wombat poo is cube-shaped (yes, really!)\nA wombat\u2019s intestines have a curious ability \u2013 they shape their poop into angular cubes.\nWombats often mark their territory using their poo, and so scientists believe that the square-sided shape is designed to stop the poop from rolling away, ensuring the smelly signals stay put!\n7) During bushfires, wombat burrows become places of shelter for many other animals\nWombat burrows, known as warrens, can be huge! These underground homes can contain tunnels over 200 metres long.\nAnd these warrens don\u2019t just serve as homes for wombats \u2013 they can become vital shelters for other small mammals, too. During bushfires, the tunnels stay cool, offering protection from the flames. Rock wallabies, bettongs, skinks and even little penguins have been seen using wombat warrens to escape fires, or hide from predators.\nA black-footed wallaby was once spotted using a wombat burrow even more than the wombat owner. This sneaky intruder visited nearly 2,000 times in eight weeks!\n8) In prehistoric times, herds of giant wombats roamed Australia!\nThese mega-marsupials formed a group of animals called Diprotodon, which lived in Australia during the Ice Age. Diprotodons were about 1.8 metres tall and weighed as much as 2,800 kilograms \u2013 roughly the same as a rhinoceros!\n9) Their pouches face backwards\nMost marsupials have their pouches on their fronts, but wombats have theirs facing backwards. This protects wombat joeys in the pouch from being sprayed with dirt, while their mother digs in the ground.\n10) The Northern hairy-nosed wombat, is critically endangered\nSadly, there are only 115 Northern hairy-nosed wombats left on Earth. Due to food shortages and droughts, this super species has been driven out of their historic habitats. They now live in just two tiny locations in Queensland, Australia.\nLuckily, conservationists are working hard to help. In the 1980s, just 35 Northern hairy-nosed wombats were left alive \u2013 so things are already improving!\nThank you to Jeremie Barnier, Alois B\u00fchlmann, Laura Barry, Meg Jerrard, and Nico Smit for the images used in this article.\nWe hope you enjoyed our facts about wombats!

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Amazing Facts about Spotted Hyenas | OneKindPlanet Animal Education", "url": "https://onekindplanet.org/animal/spotted-hyena/", "text": "Amazing Facts About the Spotted Hyena\nThe Spotted Hyena is the largest of the hyena family which also includes the brown hyena, the striped hyena, and the aardwolf. They have an unusual appearance due to their long powerful neck, uneven leg length (front legs are longer), and short thick yellow-grey fur which is covered in a spot pattern. A short mane of hair stands upright on the Spotted Hyenas back, creating a \u201cMohican\u201d hairstyle for the hunter!\nDo Spotted Hyenas have the same spots?\nNo! Every Spotted Hyena has a different set of spots, and this variety of patterns allows individuals to be recognised easily.\nWhere do Spotted Hyenas live?\nSpotted Hyenas can be found in a range of habitats within Sub-Saharan Africa. From semi-desert and savannah to woodlands and mountains, these strong mammals can survive as high up as 4100m! Currently, the largest populations lie within the Serengeti (Tanzania and Kenya) and the Kruger National Park (South Africa).\nHow do Spotted Hyenas keep cool?\nUnlike other mammals, the Spotted Hyena does not use a den for resting. Instead, they make use of shaded holes and pools during the day, and splash around in water holes to cool down!\nWhat do Spotted Hyenas eat?\nAs a predator, the Spotted Hyena eats the most meat out of all the hyena species. An average meal for these patterned creatures can include up to 14.5kg of meat! Typical prey consists of wildebeest, zebra and various antelope species, although if living near livestock they are known to steal a sheep or two! When scavenging, Spotted Hyenas can eat larger animals such as giraffes and elephants, and can even fully digest their bones.\nWhat if they can\u2019t find their typical prey?\nSpotted Hyenas have been found to hunt and catch fish, tortoises and pythons in order to survive! It seems this intelligent species can escape hunger in many ways. Evolution has also allowed the Spotted Hyena to be very efficient in its water use, which is perfect for desert-living individuals!\nDo Spotted Hyenas have any rivals?\nThe main rival for the Spotted Hyena is the lion as they live in similar habitats with similar prey choice. Often the Spotted Hyena can do all the hard work that leads up to a kill, only to be approached by a hungry group of lions who steal it away! Fights can break out in this situation, so Spotted Hyenas need to be always alert. If working in a group, they are capable of scaring the lions away.\nSpotted Hyenas can also compete with one another during a feed, speeding up to see who can finish first!\nAre Spotted Hyenas sociable?\nYes! Groups of hyenas are known as clans. Clans can include up to 100 members. Unlike many other species, females are larger than males and take charge of the clan!\nCommunication is through fascinating vocalisations, including their signature giggle. Spotted Hyenas tend to laugh when they are feeling excited or nervous, and make a whooping noise to call for their young or warn off predators. Within the clan, Spotted Hyenas say hello by squealing and groaning.\nWhat happens when they have young?\nSpotted Hyenas usually give birth to young within den areas and upgrade them to a \u201ckindergarten\u201d area shortly after. This allows them to meet other cubs and compete for dominance, without the helping hand of their mother. One their status has been proven, Spotted Hyenas teach their cubs how to hunt and protect themselves!\nWhat is the biggest threat to the Spotted Hyena?\nThe population of Spotted Hyenas is estimated to be between 27-47,000, and they are known to be of Least Concern status on the IUCN Red List. However, this number is decreasing as a result of poor public perception that is leading to persecution.\nWhen living in an unprotected area, the Spotted Hyena is targeted by hunting, trapping, and poisoning. This is because of concern that they can kill livestock, although the actual level of predation is thought to be low. Drought and deforestation may also be affecting the Spotted Hyena by reducing available habitat and altering the food chain.\nWhat can be done to help?\nIncreasing the extent of protected areas within the hyena range and improving the level of protection and enforcement will be key to sustaining a healthy population of hyenas in the long-term. Equally important, however, is working with local people within to address their negative perceptions and to resolve any conflicts that may arise. The IUCN published a \u201cHyena Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan\u201d back in 1998 that sought to address persecution and to promote livestock protection plans for worried farmers. Various anti-predation farming methods have been trialled since its launch, and visiting tourists are also now engaged with Spotted Hyena conservation.\nFun facts about the Spotted Hyena!"}

Baby dogs, called \u201cpuppies,\u201d and baby cats, called \u201ckittens,\u201d are abundant in our everyday lives. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the cutest baby animals nature has blessed us with.\n1. Baby Giraffe\nA baby giraffe is called a \u201ccalf,\u201d and in spite of its long, spindly legs, it will be able to stand on his own within half an hour of being born, and will be running with his mother just 10 hours later! Giraffes are endangered, which means that every baby giraffe is a boon to the world\u2019s giraffe population. And, of course, baby giraffes are just plain cute.\n2. Baby Elephant\nHaving spent between 1.5 and 2 years developing inside it\u2019s mother\u2019s womb, the baby elephant comes into the world weighing a whopping 250 lbs. (113 kg), and measures about 3 feet tall. Baby elephants drink milk from their mothers for the first two years or so, drinking as much as 3 gallons a day.\n3. Baby Orangutan\nThe baby orangutan is, in many ways, like a human baby \u2013 born with scrunched face, and wrinkled hands and feet. In fact, the orangutan shares nearly 97% of its DNA with humans! Although the orangutan is commonly seen in zoos, the species is actually endangered.\ndiv>\n4. Baby Hedgehog\nBaby hedgehogs are sometimes called \u201choglets,\u201d but they\u2019re always called cute! Newborn baby hedgehogs are pale pink and bare. Their quills (prickly spines) begin to show very soon after birth, and they continue to grow, as their fur comes in, over the next few weeks.\n5. Baby Duck\nBaby ducks are called \u201cducklings,\u201d and their covering of yellow fuzz makes them simply adorable. Baby ducks can\u2019t swim until their feathers come in, when they are 8-10 weeks old. Until that time, they are kept warm and safe by their mothers.\n6. Baby Deer\nThe baby deer, called a \u201cfawn,\u201d has spots to keep him hidden while in the brush and trees. Many people who see fawns alone assume it has been orphaned, but the truth is, their mothers leave them alone for short periods of time, while they hunt. Deer are very careful not to lead hunters back to their babies.\n7. Baby Cat (Kitten)\nBaby cats are called \u201ckittens,\u201d and these fuzzy critters worm their way into the hearts of humans the world over. Kittens seem to have no end to their energetic play. Baby cats sleep around 18 hours each day, saving up all that stored energy for fun and games.\n8. Baby Panda\nBaby pandas are among the smallest babies born in the animal kingdom. Each panda cub weighs only about 3 ounces (100 grams), and is gently carried around in its mother\u2019s arms or mouth.\n9. Baby Sheep\nCalled \u201clambs,\u201d baby sheep make the same \u201cbaaa\u201d sound that their parents make, only cuter! Baby sheep are the subject of the popular nursery rhyme, \u201cMary Had a Little Lamb.\u201d\n10. Baby Seal\nA baby seal is called a \u201cpup.\u201d Seal pups can swim almost immediately after birth, and by the time he is two days old, baby seal can hold his breath under water for two whole minutes.\n11. Baby Rabbit\nIt is quite difficult to not get the warm and fuzzies over baby rabbits, which are called \u201ckits.\u201d Bunny rabbits are born bald, but their super-soft fur begins to appear within days.\n12. Baby Pig\nA baby pig, called a \u201cpiglet,\u201d weighs about 3 lbs. (1.5 kg) at birth, but quickly begins putting on weight. In spite of the pig\u2019s reputation as being \u201cdirty\u201d animals, they are actually quite clean. The reputation comes from the pig\u2019s habit of rolling in mud to keep cool!\n13. Baby Fox\nThe baby fox is called either a \u201cpup,\u201d a \u201ckit,\u201d or a \u201ccub.\u201d Although the fox is a member of the dog family, it is the only member of that family that can retract its claws, like cats do. The baby fox, and their parents, of course, has another cat trait \u2013 vertical pupils.\n14. Baby Horse\nThe baby horse has a different name, depending on its gender. A female baby horse is called a \u201cfilly,\u201d and a male baby horse is called a \u201ccolt.\u201d A baby horse of either gender can be called a \u201cfoal.\u201d A foal is born with spindly legs, yet, with a number of practice runs, and the help of its mother, it can stand within about 30 minutes of birth.\n15. Baby Skunk\nBaby skunks are called \u201ckits.\u201d Although skunks have a reputation for spraying stinky musk in self defense, the baby skunk cannot do that until they are about a month old.\n16. Baby Chinchilla\nThe baby chinchilla is called a \u201ckit.\u201d Baby chinchillas are born with fur, and weighing in at only about 1 ounce (35 grams). This South American rodent has such amazingly soft fur, it has been bred specifically for that fur.\n17. Baby Penguin\nBaby penguins, called \u201cchicks,\u201d must fight their way into the world by pecking away at the shells of their eggs. This process can take as many as three days, but once a baby penguin is hatched, it is well cared-for by its parents.\n18. Baby Dog (Puppy)\nDogs come in all shapes and sizes, and no matter what type of dog people prefer, everyone loves puppies! Puppies play hard, pretending to be fierce, seemingly with endless energy. But puppies nap hard too \u2013 in fact, baby dogs sleep about 14 hours of every day.\n19. Baby Polar Bear\nBaby polar bear cubs come into the world weighing only about a pound, and with fur so fine it looks like they are bald. Mother polar bear keeps her tiny cubs well-protected inside her den until they are about 2-3 months old.\n20. Baby Otter\nBaby otters, called \u201cpups,\u201d are born weighing more than polar bear cubs, tipping the scales at a whopping 5 lbs. Baby otters are so playful, that their mothers are known to wrap them in kelp (sea weed), in order to keep them in one place while she hunts to feed the family.\n21. Baby Donkey\nThe baby donkey, called a \u201cfoal,\u201d is born into a family known to be very intelligent, and powerful. Baby donkeys are playful and affectionate, bonding not only with their fellow donkeys, but with their human handlers.\n22. Baby Tiger\nTiger cubs are born into the world weighing just about 2 lbs. (1 kg), with a long way to go to their full growth at about 600 lbs. (270 kg). During that time, baby tigers learn to hunt, and practice their fierce growls.\n23. Baby Lion\nA baby lion may be called either a \u201ccub,\u201d a \u201cwhelp,\u201d or a \u201clionet.\u201d These cute cubs come into the world with a lot to learn in order to claim their position as \u201cking of the jungle.\u201d\n24. Baby Cheetah\nCheetahs are known to be the fastest animals on land, and while baby cheetahs depend on their moms to protect and feed them, they are well on their way to becoming fierce predators. The baby cheetah follows his mom wherever she goes, and roughhouses with its siblings every chance it gets.\n25. Baby Raccoon\nBaby raccoons, called \u201ckits,\u201d or \u201ccubs,\u201d are kept safe in their dens until they are about three months old. At that time, they start foraging for themselves, often roaming away from their mothers for whole nights at a time.\n26. Baby Llama\nThe baby llama has an unusual name, being called a \u201ccria.\u201d Baby llamas almost never have siblings, but they live in their family unit, or herd.\n27. Baby Goat\nBaby goats, called \u201ckids,\u201d are some of the cutest, most playful animals on the farm! A baby goat will zoom around the yard, jump on anything he can find (even the roof if he can get a boost!), and will taste-test just about anything.\n27. Baby Opossum\nThe baby opossum is called a \u201cjoey,\u201d and is born just the size of a jelly bean! The baby possum crawls into its mother\u2019s pouch, where it stays, safe and warm, for about 100 days before venturing out into the world.\n29. Baby Miniature Horse\nLike it\u2019s larger cousin, the baby miniature horse is called a \u201cfoal.\u201d As adult miniature horses grow to be only about 3 feet tall, baby miniature horses are quite small indeed!\n30. Baby Chimpanzee\nThe baby chimpanzee travels with its mother, clinging to her belly, until he\u2019s about 6 months old. Much like human babies, they then spend about 10 years at mom\u2019s side, learning how to use tools, build nests, and find food.\n31. Baby Koala\nBaby koalas, known as a \u201cjoeys,\u201d cling to their mothers\u2019 backs as they climb around in the eucalyptus trees that grow their favorite food. Koalas are not bears, as some people think, but marsupials. This means the baby koalas are carried in mom\u2019s pouch until they are big enough to get piggy-back rides!"}

So come on gang, let\u2019s discover some wonderful walrus facts\u2026\nWalrus facts\n1. There are two sub-species of walrus\nWalruses can be found in the far north of our planet. They live in the Arctic \u2013 a vast wilderness of snow, ice, and sea.\nThe Arctic landscape is so large and varied, that walruses that live there have developed slightly different characteristics, in order to adapt to the particular part they live in \u2013 these are known as sub-species.\nAtlantic walruses live in coastal areas from Canada to Greenland (in the Atlantic Ocean), while Pacific walruses live in the northern seas above Russia and Alaska (in the Pacific Ocean). Cool!\nBET YOU DIDN\u2019T KNOW! The scientific name for a walrus is \u2018Odobenus rosmarus\u2019. That\u2019s Latin for \u2018tooth-walking sea-horse\u2018!\n2. Walrus tusks can be over 90cm long!\nSpeaking of teeth, walruses have some whopping canines! Both male and female walruses grow long tusks, which help them adapt to Arctic life.\nThese massive, marine mammals use their tall tusks like ski poles, digging them into sand, snow and ice to help them haul their enormous bodies out of the freezing ocean waters! Plus, they\u2019re great for smashing through tough ice from below, creating breathing holes for swimming walruses to catch a breath.\n3. Thick layers of blubber protect walruses from the cold\nThese massive animals don\u2019t carry all that weight around for no reason! The thick layers of blubber (fat) stored beneath their skin helps walruses stay insulated, keeping them warm and protected from cold. In fact, thanks to all that brr-illiant blubber, walruses are able to withstand freezing temperatures, as low as -35\u00b0C!\n4. Walruses weigh up to 1.5 tonnes!\nEven baby walruses are huge! These chunky critters, known as calves, can weigh up to 75kg at birth \u2013 that\u2019s the same weight as some adult humans!\n5. Their huge size comes from a steady diet of molluscs, crustaceans, and worms!\nWalruses grab shellfish like clams from the sea floor, but they also enjoy sea cucumbers and mussels. Adults will sometimes hunt fish, while some huge adult males have even been recording stalking seals.\nAMAZING ADAPTATIONS! Walruses have super sensitive whiskers, which help them detect food at the bottom of the ocean. Once they\u2019ve located a tasty snack, walruses can be surprisingly speedy swimmers, reaching speeds of up to 35km/h to chase down their prey!\n6. Walruses can sleep in water!\nSometimes, walruses will forage in places where there\u2019s no nearby ice or land for them to haul themselves out onto for nap. That\u2019s why they have handy \u2018pharyngeal pouches\u2018 \u2013 air sacs on their throats that inflate like pillows!\nOnce their pouches are filled with up to 50 litres of air, walruses can doze off, snoozing in a vertical position and kept safe from drowning by their portable pillow \u2013 genius!\n7. Walruses can live for up 40 years\nWalruses have very few natural predators, and their huge size makes them a challenging opponent! Only an orca or a large polar bear would dare try to take on an adult walrus\u2026\n8. These astonishing animals are very sociable, but can be aggressive\nA walrus colony is a noisy place! These animals live in large groups, known as herds, which gather together on land. Out of the water, the walruses loudly bellow and snort at one another to communicate!\nDuring the mating season, male walruses can become very aggressive as they fight for females using their tall tusks. Yikes!\n9. Indigenous Americans are the only people allowed to hunt walruses\nSadly, humans are the biggest predator that the walrus has ever faced. During the 1700-1800s, walruses were almost hunted to extinction, as their meat, tusks, oil, and skin were valuable materials.\nNow, walrus hunting is illegal for everyone except for indigenous groups like the Inuit, for whom walruses are still a major life resource.\n10. Walruses are very sensitive to changes in their environment\nDespite their formidable size, walruses are easily spooked! In walrus herds, any sign of danger can cause stampedes as the animals flee land and head towards the safety of water.\nThanks to Helene Berger; Kira Ph\u1ea1m; Caterina Sanders and Jay Ruzesky for the images used in this article.\nDid you enjoy our wonderful walrus facts?

Some examples of these animals are yak, sheep, goats or deer. However, there is more to it as there are also different types of ruminant animals. In this AnimalWised article we're going to talk about the four main groups of ruminant animals. We'll include a list of examples and include other fun facts about these animals. Keep reading to learn more!\nWhat are ruminant animals?\nRuminant animals are polygastric, meaning their stomach is divided into compartments. Some of the compartments have microorganisms that ferment the cellulose in the vegetables they eat into cud, which is easier to digest. Consequently, ruminant animals are also herbivores. Ruminant animals are characterized by their method of digesting food in two phases. Like all animals, they start their digestion after eating food. However, before the digestive process is complete ruminant animals regurgitate their food to chew it again and add saliva. There are four large groups of ruminants. We will list them and give you some examples so that you can fully understand what ruminants are and know one when you see it.\n1. Bovines and Cattle\nMost ruminants belong to the family of bovids, Bovidae. Within that group we find the subfamily of bovines or Bovinae, which includes cattle. These are probably the best known ruminant animals. As you will see below, some animals names are followed by the \u2020 symbol, which means they are extinct. Below is a list of some bovine animals: Anoa\nAuroch \u2020\nBanteng\nBison\nBongo\nBuffalo\nCow, Bull, Ox\nEland\nFour-horned antelope\nGaur\nGayal\nK\u00e9wel\nKudu\nKouprey\nImbabala\nNildai\nNyala\nSaola\nSitatunga\nTamaraw\nWater buffalo\nWild yak\nWisent\nYak\nZebu Did you know... Camelids are not considered ruminants as they do not have a glandular fore stomach. Learn more in our article about the differences between camels and dromedaries. Did you know... that buffaloes, water buffaloes and bison are easily confused?\n2. Ovines and sheep\nAlso within the family of the bovids we can find the subfamily Caprinae, the goat-antelopes. Within that subfamily we find the genus Ovis, the ovines or sheep. The second largest group of ruminants are the ovines, ruminant animals best-known and appreciated for their milk and wool. There are not as many different types as there are in the cattle group but we can still give you a considerable list of ovine animals: Argali\nBighorn sheep\nDomestic sheep\nMouflon\nSnow sheep\nTrinhorn sheep\nUrial There are many different subspecies of domestic and wild sheep, and most of them are named for their native region and habitat. Did you know... Despite being closely related and belonging to the same subfamily, goats and sheep underwent a phylogenetic separation. That happened in the last stage of the Neogene period, which started 23 million years ago and finished only 2.5 million years ago. In geological time, that's only yesterday!\n3. Caprines and goat-antelopes\nThe third group of ruminant animals we examine is that of goat-antelopes, or caprines. The subfamily Caprinae is a cousin to the Bovinae, as they both belong to the Bovidae family. Within this subfamily you can find the ovids, which we separated so as not to mix up goats and sheep. Some caprine ruminants other than sheep include: Alpine ibex\nArabian tahr\nBharal\nBarbary sheep\nChamois\nChinese goral\nChinese serow\nDwarf blue sheep\nGrey goral\nHimalayan serow\nHimalayan tahr\nJapanese serow\nLong-tailed goral\nMarkhor\nMountain goat\nMuskox\nNilgiri tahr\nNubian ibex\nPyrenean chamois\nReg goral\nRed serow\nSiberian ibex\nSpanish ibex\nSumatran serow\nTakin\nTaiwan serow\nWalia ibex\nWest Caucasian tur\nWild goat (includes the domestic goat as a subspecies) Did you know... Through remastication, ruminants are able to reduce the particle size of their food to ensure that their body can assimilate and digest it.\n4. Deer\nTo complete our full list of ruminant animals, we will now look at a very beautiful and noble group of ruminants: Deer. Deer is the general name for the members of the family Cervidae, which includes different subspecies and genera, altogether including more than 90 species. Some examples of deer include: American wapiti or elk\nBarasingha\nBawean deer\nBrocket\nCalamian deer\nChital\nEld's deer\nEurasian elk\nFallow deer\nHog deer\nHuemul\nMaral deer\nMarsh deer\nMindanao mountain deer\nMindoro deer\nMoose\nMule deer\nMuntjac\nPampas deer\nP\u00e8re David's deer\nPhilippine sambar\nPrince Alfred's deer\nPud\u00fa\nRed deer\nReindeer or caribou\nRoe deer\nRusa deer\nSambar deer\nSika deer\nSwamp deer\nTaruca\nThamin\nThorold's deer\nTufted deer\nWater deer\nWhite-tailed deer Did you know... The now extinct Irish elk was one of the largest deer that ever existed? These animals could reach more than 2 m (6.9 ft) tall, and their antlers were a stunning 3.65 m (12 ft) wide. It is believed that Irish elk became extinct more than 7,000 years ago, but the reasons why it happened haven't been found yet.\nMore examples of ruminant animals\nThere are more than 150 species of ruminants in the world, but confusingly enough they don't necessarily include all those in the suborder Ruminantia. Other ruminants outside those groups include: Addax\nAntelope\nBeira\nBlackbuck\nBluebuck\nBontebok\nChevrotain\nDibatag\nDik-dik\nDuiker\nGazelle\nGerenuk\nGiraffe\nGrysbok\nGoa\nHartebeest\nImpala\nKlipspringer\nKob\nLechwe\nMusk deer\nOkapi\nOribi\nOryx\nPronghorn\nPuku\nReedbuck\nRhebok\nSaiga\nSpringbok\nSteenbok\nSuni\nTopi\nTsessebe\nWaterbuck\nWildebeest\nZeren"}

But how long do giraffes live on average, and what\u2019s it like to be a giraffe?\nIn this article, we will cover what the average giraffe life cycle is like, as well as some of the oldest living giraffes held in captivity. There could be a record-breaking giraffe living at your local zoo! Let\u2019s learn more about these unique creatures now.\nThere\u2019s no real way to tell or track how long giraffes live in the wild. Craig Fraser/Shutterstock.com\nHow Long Do Giraffes Live?\nGiraffes live at least 25 years, some living closer to 30 in captivity. There\u2019s no real way to tell or track how long giraffes live in the wild. It is likely they live fewer years, but a fully grown giraffe may live longer than we think!\nThe same cannot be said for young or newborn giraffes. In the wild, nearly 60% of young giraffes perish at the hands of predators, usually lions or crocodiles. Most young giraffes will survive once they reach their second year of age, but their time before this is fraught with predation.\nAdult giraffes are much more capable of fending off predators with their very powerful kicks. However, most giraffe species are considered endangered, and many subspecies are extinct in certain areas of Africa.\nThis is why conservation in zoos is very important. Many giraffes live long lives in captivity, and many zoos have healthy breeding programs in order to keep the species alive. Later in this article, we\u2019ll discuss some of the giraffes that have lived the longest, most of them mother giraffes!\nRegardless, giraffes don\u2019t appear to have the same extreme lifespans of other large megafauana from Africa such as elephants. The world\u2019s oldest elephant reached 89 years old. By comparison, the world\u2019s oldest (known) giraffe died on December 6, 2021 at the age of 31. The giraffe, named Mutangi, was a great-grandma and lived to the age of 31.\nFor now, let\u2019s talk more about the average giraffe life cycle.\nGiraffes live at least 25 years, some living closer to 30 in captivity. iStock.com/miroslav_1\nThe Average Giraffe Life Cycle\nFrom birth to death, the giraffe leads a very interesting life. Their lives are almost as unique as their coats, as the pattern of their spots is unique to every single giraffe, just like our own fingerprints. Let\u2019s learn about their life now.\nNewborn, or Calf\nNewborn giraffes are impressive in that they are capable of walking within an hour of being born. They are also sturdy and capable young creatures, as they have to survive a large drop when they are born. Female giraffes can only give birth standing up, and they have a 15-month gestation period.\nMany newborn giraffes average about six feet in height from the moment they are born. This height will only increase over the next year, almost doubling after 12 months on their mother\u2019s milk. However, this is the time of life that is most dangerous for a giraffe to be in.\nNewborn giraffes are impressive in that they are capable of walking within an hour of being born.\nYoung Giraffe\nYoung giraffes remain in their herd until they are at least 15 to 18 months of age. Many male giraffes leave their herd and join all male herds, but some female giraffes will remain in the herd that they were born in.\nIf a giraffe can survive its first year or two, it\u2019s survival rate goes up exponentially. This is because a giraffe will reach its full height during this time. Their necks alone average 6 feet tall, which is how tall the giraffe was when it was born!\nAdult Giraffe\nAdult giraffes reach sexual maturity between 4 to 7 years of age. By this point in their life, giraffes are capable herbivores, scouring the land for leaves in their herd. Giraffes have been known to come and go from their herds as they please, though a herd environment offers the most protection to them.\nOne of the reasons that giraffes may be more endangered than other animals is their breeding cycles. Giraffes will only give birth to one baby at a time, and the gestation period is very long. However, these animals may or may not ever give birth, as lone giraffes have been recorded in the wild just as often as herds.\nWild adult giraffes use their height to their advantage. Given how tall they are, most giraffes can see predators coming from a significant distance away. This helps them stay safe, and allows them to warn one another to enemies. Giraffes are usually very quiet mammals, however.\nGiraffes will only give birth to one baby at a time, and the gestation period is very long. umat34/Shutterstock.com\nSome of the Oldest Giraffes Ever Recorded\nCurious how long some giraffes live in captivity? Here is a list of some of the oldest giraffes ever recorded:"}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Do all giraffe have horns? - Giraffe Conservation Foundation", "url": "https://giraffeconservation.org/facts/do-all-giraffe-have-horns/", "text": "Giraffe horns are not actually called horns but ossicones which are boney projections of the skull covered with furred skin. Both female and male giraffe have ossicles.\nGiraffe are born with their ossicones, however, they are only small boney cores surrounded by cartilage that lie flat and are not attached to the skull to avoid injury during birth. Soon after birth, the ossicones begin to grow and ossify (the process of forming bone from a cartilage) and by the time giraffe reach sexual maturity at 3-5 years the ossicones will be composed only of bone and fully attached to the skull.\nBoth female and male giraffe have a main pair of ossicones at the top of their head. While female ossicones are often thin and tufted with hair, male giraffe normally have thicker ossicones that become bald on top as a result of frequent necking. In some giraffe species males grow a second pair of ossicones behind the first pair on the back of the skull, as well as a prominent median (middle) ossicone on the forehead. This median ossicone of the male adult northern and reticulated giraffe are on average considerably larger than those of the Masai and southern giraffe \u2013 a key morphological feature which further divides giraffe into different species.\nAs male giraffe fight with each other, the bones of the ossicones and skull continue to accumulate boney deposits or ossifications that add weight over time, enabling them to deliver ever heavier blows during necking contests. Fatal combat is rare but does occur."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "South African giraffe - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_giraffe", "text": "The South African giraffe or Cape giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa) is a subspecies of giraffe ranging from South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique. It has rounded or blotched spots, some with star-like extensions on a light tan background, running down to the hooves.\nIn 2016, the population was estimated at 31,500 individuals in the wild.\nTaxonomy and evolution [ edit ]\nThe IUCN currently recognizes only one species of giraffe with nine subspecies. The Cape giraffe, along with the whole species, were first known by the binomen Camelopardalis giraffa described by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in his publication Die S\u00e4ugethiere in Abbildungen nach der Natur mit Beschreibungen (The Mammals illustrated from Nature with descriptions) during his travel in the Cape of Good Hope in 1784. Although, it is also stated that Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert described and given the binomial name Giraffa giraffa whilst also identifying the nominate specimen of said species under the ternary name Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa in 1785.\nFollowing Schreber's description of the South African giraffe, several specimens were described by other naturalists and zoologists since the end of the 18th century under different scientific names, which are all considered synonyms of Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa today:\nG. giraffa capensis by Lesson, 1842\nby Lesson, 1842 G. giraffa australis by Rhoads, 1896\nby Rhoads, 1896 G. giraffa wardi by Lydekker, 1904\nby Lydekker, 1904 G. giraffa infumata by Noack, 1808\nDescriptions [ edit ]\nTwo bull giraffes drinking. Their mostly convex spots with irregular incisions are typical of the South African subspecies.\nThe South African giraffe has dark, somewhat rounded patches \"with some fine projections\" on a tawny background colour. The spots extend down the legs and get smaller. The median lump of males is less developed.: 52\nDistribution and habitat [ edit ]\nThe South African giraffe is found in northern South Africa, southern Botswana, southern Zimbabwe, and south-western Mozambique. After local extinctions in various places, the South African giraffes have been reintroduced in many parts of Southern Africa, including in Eswatini. They are common in both in and outside of protected areas. South African giraffes usually live in savannahs and woodlands where food plants are available. Giraffes are herbivorous animals. They feed on leaves, flowers, fruits and shoots of woody plants such as Acacia.\nSouth African giraffes live in a fission-fusion society system based on things such as sex, age, season, and kinship. This allows them to adapt better to environmental changes around them.\nThreats [ edit ]\nThe International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the body that administers the world's official endangered species list, announced in 2016 that it was moving the giraffe from a species of Least Concern to Vulnerable status in its Red List of Threatened Species report. That means the animal faces extinction in the wild in the medium-term future if nothing is done to minimize the threats to its life or habitat.\nIn captivity [ edit ]\nSouth African giraffes are not very common in captivity. As of 2010, there are around 45 South African giraffes breeding in zoos. At present, the South African giraffe population is estimated at 37,000 individuals, showing a marked increase of over 150% over the past three decades. it has been discovered that approximately 12,000 of privately owned farms, ranches, and national parks maintain the affected giraffe populations, in which they are commonly distributed across these private areas rather than their own habitat.\nGallery [ edit ]\nReferences [ edit ]"}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Animal Adaptation: Facts (Science Trek: Idaho Public Television)", "url": "https://sciencetrek.org/sciencetrek/topics/animal_adaptations/facts.cfm", "text": "Animal Adaptation: Facts\nPolar bears in the Arctic. Zebras on the African plains. Sea turtles in the ocean. Lizards in the desert. There are so many different kinds of animals all over the world! How are animals able to live in so many different kinds of places? The answer is adaptations. An adaptation is a characteristic that helps an animal survive in its habitat. All animals must be able to obtain food and water, protect themselves from harm, withstand the climate, and reproduce young so the species doesn't become extinct. So, any animal who successfully survives on land or in water has physical or behavioral adaptations that help it to accomplish those goals. An adaptation can be a body part, body covering, body function, or behavior that increases an animal's chances of survival in a particular place. Animals develop these adaptations over time to match the environment where they live. The process of natural selection means that animals with traits that help them survive are more likely to live and pass on those traits to their offspring. Those adaptations happen over long periods of time, as animals adapt to the conditions of the environment. It takes many generations for adaptations to develop. Although habitats provide food, water and shelter that animals need, there is more to survival than just the habitat. It is their own adaptations that allow animals to get food, stay safe, and reproduce within that specific habitat. Without their adaptations, the species could not thrive in that environment. Animals live everywhere on Earth. Some places on Earth are very hot and some are very cold. Some places have a lot of water and plants, and some have very little. Animals can live in many different places in the world because they have special adaptations for the area in which they live. For example, a monkey with agile limbs and a long tail for climbing is well adapted to the jungle, but would have a hard time in the cold, treeless polar regions. A shaggy, wooly musk ox is comfortable in the Arctic, but would not do well in a tropical climate. Adaptations are what allows such a diversity of animal species to live on Earth's land, seas and skies. Through adaptations, animals have found ways to inhabit every environment on earth! Let's take a look at some of the amazing adaptations animals have developed.\nPhysical Adaptations Physical adaptations include body parts, body coverings, and physiological characteristics that help animals survive, find food, and stay safe. Adaptation Facts for Kids: Kiddle Encyclopedia Body Parts The shape of a beak, the type of feet, the placement of eyes, the presence of whiskers, the shape of the nose or ears, and the sharpness of teeth are all examples of structural adaptations which help different animals to survive. As shown in the picture on the right, different kinds of birds have adapted different kinds of beaks that help them obtain their particular source of food. Beaks come in all shapes and sizes. For example, a hawk has a sharp, curved beak to tear its food into small pieces. A hummingbird has a long, thin beak to reach into flowers and get nectar. A parrot has a strong, thick beak to help it crack fruits and nuts. A pelican has a long beak with a pouch to help it scoop fish out of water. All kinds of body parts may be adaptations. Horses and zebras have flat teeth for grinding their food (grass), while lions have sharp teeth for tearing their food (meat.) To escape predators, zebras also have excellent hearing and eyesight and powerful legs for running and kicking. Birds have hollow bones that help them fly. Ducks have oil glands that keep their feathers from becoming water-soaked, and webbed feet that help them to swim. A woodpecker not only has a strong, sharp beak for drilling holes, but it also has a very long barbed tongue to catch insects, two toes that point backward to help with climbing trees, and a stiff tail for support on the tree. Alligators have eyes and nostrils placed on top of their heads, allowing them to keep most of their body underwater so their prey cannot see them. For river otters, whiskers are an adaptation that help them feel their way through tight spots both on land and in water. Badgers have sharp claws for digging burrows and tunnels and for obtaining food. Because they live underground, excellent vision is not an adaptation that they need; badgers and moles often have poor eyesight. Learn more about physical adaptations. Animals in the desert have special adaptations that help them conserve water and survive a habitat with extreme temperatures and lack of shelter. Camels have humps where they can store fat, allowing them to go without food and water for periods of time. Camels also have two rows of long, thick eyelashes to protect their eyes from blowing sand, and their nostrils can be closed as well. Their broad, leathery hooves act like snowshoes to prevent them from sinking in the sand. Other desert animals have different adaptations. Jackrabbits have large ears that keep them cool by spreading out their body heat. Fennec foxes have thick fur on the bottoms of their feet so they can walk on the hot desert ground. Learn more about desert adaptations. Adaptation Facts for Kids: Kiddle Encyclopedia In polar habitats, animals also have important adaptations that allow them to keep warm and survive extreme cold. For example, the penguin lives in the Antarctic and swims through icy cold water. Its feathers are tightly packed and layered like roof shingles. These special feathers keep cold water out and keep body heat in. The penguin's eyes have special lenses that allow it see both above and below the water. Its powerful wings help it swim through the water, and its feet help it steer as it swims. Being able to stay warm, see well, and swim quickly helps the penguin find food and avoid predators. In the Arctic, polar bears have webbed front paws that are shaped to propel them through the water. The bottoms of their feet are covered with hairy bumps that grip the ice and keep them from slipping, and a layer of blubber insulates them from the cold. Learn more about polar adaptations. Similar animals will often have different adaptations depending on where they live. For example, desert foxes have large ears for heat radiation, while Arctic foxes have small ears to retain body heat. Snowy owls have heavily feathered legs and feet, while elf owls, which live in warm, southern climates, have lightly feathered legs. Animals who live in the oceans have unique adaptations that allow them to move through water and defend themselves from marine predators. For example, sharks have streamlined bodies for fast swimming, and noses with special sensors that let them sense electric fields put out by other fish and animals. Stingrays swim along the ocean floor, with their eyes on top of their bodies and their mouth on the bottom, so they can see while they're swimming and still take in food they find in the sand. Lobsters use their claws to crush their food and their strong tails to move backward on the ocean floor. Harbor seals have four flippers to help them swim, with hind flippers to propel them forward and forward flippers to help them steer. Learn more about ocean adaptations. Some physical adaptations have more than one purpose. Horns and antlers may be used by animals to protect themselves, to fight with others for territory, or to attract a mate. A crab's hard shell protects it from predators, from drying out, and from being crushed by waves. Sometimes, multiple species have adaptations that suit each other. For example, pollinating insects are co-adapted with flowering plants, with body parts that are designed to work together. In Africa, oxpecker birds sit on the backs of zebras and pick off lice and bugs for food, which benefits both animals. Body Covering and Coloring Body coverings are an important adaptation for many animals. Mammals living in cold climates have thick fur to keep the heat in. Those living in warm climates have much thinner coats of hair or fur. For birds, feathers are an adaptation that serve several purposes: they keep birds warm in cold weather and cool when it's hot, allow them to fly, and help them attract mates. Reptiles are covered with scales that serve to protect their bodies from environmental conditions. Fish have overlapping scales that not only protect them from injuries, but also reduce water resistance when the fish is swimming. In addition, many fish are covered with a layer of slime which helps them move more quickly through the water. Another important adaption is known as camouflage. Many animals have colors or patterns that help them blend in with their habitat so they can successfully find food or hide from predators. Stripes and spots can help both predator and prey animals blend into their environment. Animals with spotted fur often live in forested areas. The jaguar's spots help it blend in with the small patches of sun that reach the shady rainforest floor, while the snow leopard, who lives in snowy, wooded mountains, has spotted fur that helps it hide among the trees and snow. Some green insects can look just like leaves on a tree. Brown rattlesnakes blend in with the rocks, soil and dry grass where they live. Bright-colored tropical fish can blend in with coral reefs. Cuttlefish and leaf frogs can change their appearance to match their surroundings. The chameleon is a lizard that can change its skin color for camouflage. The snowshoe hare's fur color shifts with the season: it is brown in the summer and white in the winter to blend in with the snow. Learn more about camouflage. Snowshoe Hare Leaf Insect Gecko Sometimes coloring is an adaptation with a different purpose than camouflage. For example, the male peacock's colorful tail display is used to attract a mate. Some poisonous frogs and butterflies have bright, vivid colors that make them stand out from their surroundings and serve as a warning to predators to stay away. Caterpillar mimicking a stick Owl butterfly For some animals, their appearance mimics a non-food object, or they resemble a harmful or distasteful animal that predators avoid. This adaptation to imitate something else to fool predators is called mimicry. For example, some butterflies have big spots that mimic the eyes of a large animal such as an owl. Some insects, such as the walking stick, resemble a twig, while the hawkmoth looks just like a tattered dead leaf. These disguises help them survive, as predators do not attack twigs or leaves. The nonpoisonous king snake has coloring that makes it look like the venomous coral snake, so predators leave the king snake alone. The harmless viceroy butterfly resembles the bitter-tasting monarch butterfly, so predators avoid the viceroy butterfly too.

For example, many desert animals do not have sweat glands, which lets them retain moisture so they don't have to drink much. Some animals don't need to drink water at all, as they get all the water they need from the insects, plants and seeds that they eat. Some rodents have special kidneys that return water to the bloodstream instead of losing it through urination. Crocodiles have internal glands that get rid of the salt they consume when they swallow their saltwater prey. There are internal defensive adaptations such as snakes producing venom in their bodies, skunks producing bad-smelling spray, horned toads squirting blood from their eyes, and millipedes secreting toxins through their skin. Still other animals have bodies that secrete slime, like snails who use it to glide smoothly across the ground, or hagfish who choke their attackers with slime. Another adaptation is specially developed senses of hearing, smell, or sight that far surpass human abilities. For example, the African elephant has 2,000 scent receptors in its nose, compared to humans' 400 receptors. A peregrine falcon's eyesight is so acute that it can spot a mouse a mile away. Some animals utilize senses beyond the five senses humans have. These sensory adaptations include echolocation which allows bats to locate their prey by sending out sounds that bounce off other objects, and infrared detection, which allows snakes to sense heat radiation from prey species at night. Most adaptations do not operate singly, but rather work together to ensure the animal's survival. Most people know that the giraffe has a very long neck that helps it reach leaves in the tops of trees (a body-part adaptation), but what may be less obvious is the giraffe's extra-large heart that pumps blood up that long neck to reach its brain (a physiological adaptation.) In addition, it has a spotted coat for camouflage, an 18-inch tongue that can wrap around branches, and the ability to drink 12 gallons of water at once when it comes upon a scarce water hole. All of these adaptations, working together, help the giraffe succeed in its environment.\nBehavioral Adaptations Like physical adaptations, behavioral adaptations improve animals' chances for survival. These are inherited behaviors that animals don't have to learn. You may have heard these behaviors referred to as instinct. A bird building a nest or a lion preying on a zebra are examples of instinctive behaviors. One of the most important behavioral adaptations is living together in groups. These groups are often referred to as herds, families, colonies, flocks and packs, but there are many unique names for animal groups such as a pod of whales, a school of fish, or a pride of lions. These groups may consist of hundreds of animals or just a few. Living in groups allows animals to help each other find food, defend against predators and care for young. When many zebras stand or move together in a group, the abundance of stripes makes it more difficult for a lion to pick out and hunt one individual zebra. Although a fully grown bison is safe from most predators, bison live in herds and form circles to protect their young. Some predators such as wolves hunt as a group, working together to bring down larger prey. And many animals huddle together in cold weather to share body warmth. Another behavioral adaptation is migration. Migrating animals travel from one place to another depending on seasonal conditions. Migration is an adaptation that helps some animals cope with the climate and find places to obtain food and have their young. Birds, whales, bats and monarch butterflies are well-known for their annual migration between northern and southern regions. Some animals migrate a short distance from high mountains to lower valleys, while others cover large parts of the globe with their migration routes. For example, the Arctic tern travels 25,000 miles in its annual migration. Learn more about animal migration. Hibernation is another adaptation that allows some animals to successfully survive when weather conditions are harsh and resources are scarce. A hibernating animal goes to sleep or is dormant during cold weather. They remain safe by hiding in dens or burrows. Their heartbeat and breathing slow down. They do not have to use up energy looking for food because their bodies live off their stored fat or food. Bears, bats, chipmunks, frogs, and many other animals hibernate during the winter. Some animals are referred to as nocturnal, which mean they are active at night. For desert animals, this adaptation allows them to search for food when temperatures are cooler. Other animals burrow into the ground during the day to avoid the harsh conditions during the day. Many behavioral adaptations are defensive. These behaviors are designed to help animals protect themselves from danger. A blowfish (right) has the ability to puff up its body to twice its normal size to scare off attackers. Possums go stiff and \"play dead\" to make predators think they are not alive. The three-banded armadillo can curl itself into a ball where it is protected by its armor. A porcupine turns its quills toward a threatening intruder. A nesting killdeer will pretend to be injured to lure a predator away from her young. A rattlesnake has a unique adaptation: at the end of its tail it grows interlocking, hollow segments. When threatened, the snake coils into a circle and shakes its tail, warning intruders to stay away. Still other behavioral adaptations have the purpose of courtship. In order for the species to continue, animals must attract a mate and have young. The male sage grouse attracts a female by inflating his neck pouch and fanning his feathers. Some male penguins offer stones for nest-building as gifts to the females. The albatross performs an elaborate courtship ritual where he dances, leaps, sings, and points his beak to the sky. Male elk \"bugle\" to attract females and to announce dominance over other males. Not all animal behaviors are adaptations. A raccoon who repeatedly seeks food in a local trash can, a deer who stays away from a yard with motion-activated night lights, or a bird who avoids bad-tasting insects after eating one, are all exhibiting learned behaviors. These behaviors may help the animal survive, but they will not be passed on to the next generation.\nPrey, Predator, and Scavenger Some animals eat other animals (predators), some try to keep from being eaten (prey), and others clean up the remains of dead animals (scavengers.) Predators are not villains - like all organisms, including humans, they are getting the energy (food) they need to survive. Each creature is necessary to the cycle of life. All animals in a natural ecosystem have a different \"job\" or ecological niche, and all adaptations help organisms to be successful in their niches. Whether an animal is predator or prey, it must have necessary adaptations to live another day, or it will not survive. Many prey animals have developed a variety of adaptations to protect themselves from becoming a predator's dinner. In order to survive, prey animals rely on camouflage, warning signals, well-developed senses, weapon-like body parts, and defensive behaviors. Predators also have camouflage coloring and blend in with their surroundings, but for them the purpose is to hide when hunting prey. Other adaptations that make an animal a successful predator include body parts like sharp teeth, strong jaws or razor-like talons, physiological adaptations such as producing deadly venom, and behaviors like hunting in groups and stalking (sneaking up on) their prey. Even scavengers have special adaptations. They use their excellent sense of smell to find their food - dead animals. Why does a vulture have a featherless head? This bird often feeds by putting its head into the bodies of dead animals. After it eats, its bare skin is exposed to the sun's heat which kills harmful bacteria that might have rubbed off from the decaying meat. A clean head keeps a vulture healthy, so it can live another day. In addition, the digestive track of vultures has an adaptation that allows vultures to not get sick from any diseased animals that they eat. In all habitats, adaptations make the complex, interconnected food webs work.\nAdapting to Environmental Change Over time, environments can change and become drier, wetter, hotter, colder, darker or sunnier. Since adaptations develop to help animals survive in a specific habitat, what happens if the environment begins to change, and those adaptations no longer help the animal? If an animal's food source disappears, adaptations that help them find that food will no longer be useful. Sometimes even a small change in temperature or water quality can mean big problems for animals that have adapted to survive under certain conditions. Altered environments have meant extinction for some animals. When habitats change, in order to survive animals must either move to new areas, or respond to those changes through adaptations. For example, a species living in water that becomes more acidic might adapt by slowly shifting its own body chemistry. Dark and light colored peppered moths, Wikimedia Commons Adaptations may cause an increase or decrease in populations of animals with certain traits. An example of a changing adaptation is the case of the peppered moth. The peppered moth uses camouflage to blend in with the trees it perches on, in order to avoid being eaten by birds. About 200 years ago, light-colored peppered moths were common, while dark-colored peppered moths were rare. The lighter moths were more difficult for birds to see against the light-colored tree trunks and light-colored lichen on the trees, so they were more likely to survive. However, during the Industrial Revolution many forests became polluted with layers of black soot from the burning coal used in factories. Trees became darker, and the light-colored lichen was gone. The lighter moths stood out against the dark trees and became easy prey for birds. After the trees became darker, the dark-colored moths were better camouflaged and less likely to be eaten. They became more likely to survive and pass on their dark-colored genes to their young. Over time, the dark colored moths became the more common of the two color forms. Today, climate change and rising temperatures threaten many animals who are adapted to certain conditions. While some organisms may not survive in their usual habitats, it is possible that we will see changing adaptations in some species. One example is the colored feathers of the tawny owl. This owl comes in two colors, pale brown and gray. The gray color helps it to blend in with snowy trees to hide from predators. Due to rising temperatures, there has been less snowfall in some areas. Because of the decreased snow, there has been an increase in brown-feathered tawny owls in the past 40 years.\nPlant Adaptations Do plants have adaptations too? Yes! Just as with animals, plants must be adapted to their environment. And just as with animals, adaptations help plants survive the climate conditions, defend against predators, and reproduce. Tropical plants Arctic plants Plants make their own food using water and sunlight absorbed through their leaves. Many plants have special chemicals in their cells that help them grow toward sunlight, an adaptation known as phototropism. Another plant adaptation is leaf size. Since water usually escapes from plants through the leaves, plants that live in dry climates have thick stems and small leaves. The leaves may also be coated in wax that reduces water loss and prevents the plant from drying out. Plants in moist climates have big, wide leaves that absorb lots of sunlight. In windy, cold climates, plants are usually short with small leaves. Short plants are more protected from wind. More than 99 percent of Antarctica is covered with ice, but a few plants still grow close to the ground there, mostly lichens and mosses. Desert plants Some plants protect themselves from predators with leaves that contain poisonous oils that irritate or even kill an organism that tries to eat them. Other plants have thorns to keep predators away. In desert plants such as cacti, sharp spines and thick skin also protect the cactus's water store from predators. Like animals, plants must reproduce. This is done through seeds that need sunlight, water, and a place to grow. Special adaptations help seeds move to new areas where they can grow. Some trees have adapted so that heat from wildfire opens their seed cones and disperses the seeds. Some plants have seeds with hard coats that float down rivers or streams to take root somewhere else. There are plants that have seeds with hooks or barbs that attach to animals' fur to be carried away. Some seeds are heavy and fall down to the ground, while others have \"wings\" and are light enough to be carried long distances by the wind. Some plant adaptations can even help establish new habitats through seed dispersal. Learn more about plant adaptations.\nHow Do Humans Mimic Animal Adaptations? The most important human adaptation is our large brains which allow us to think and solve problems. Animal adaptions often give humans good ideas about surviving in different habitats. When humans develop ways to live more successfully based on observing animals, it is called biomimicry. How do animals give us ideas for staying dry on a rainy day? We wear slippery, water-resistant raincoats that makes rain run off like a duck's feathers do. How do people use the idea of a turtle's hard shell to keep safe? We put on bike helmets to protect our heads. How do animals give us ideas for moving through water? Divers use flippers like those of sea turtles to propel them in the water. How do animals give us ideas about staying warm when it is cold? Early humans in cold climates copied animal adaptations by wrapping themselves in furry animal skins to keep warm. To this day, people put on warm, thick coats in cold weather. Sleeping bags and jackets are often made of bird feathers for insulation. Baseball players put dark marks under their eyes, like a cheetah or a meerkat, to cut down on sun glare. Competitive swimmers use special swimsuits modeled after sharkskin. The sleek front ends of high-speed trains are based on the long, streamlined beak of the kingfisher bird. People can learn a lot from animal adaptations! Learn more about biomimicry."}

The most obvious difference between monkeys and apes is that apes do not have tails.\nA few isolated monkey species do not have tails either, but they are the exception rather than the rule.\nThe great apes, which are the human being, the orangutan, the gorilla, the chimpanzee and the bonobo, are much larger than monkeys and much more highly evolved.\nThe gibbon, which has many aspects of both monkeys and apes, is truly its own separate creature, although it is often lumped in with either apes or monkeys by virtue of many different arguments, both scientific and not so scientific.\nWe have separated the gibbons and offer their own article. We have also separated the baboon into it's own page because it is so well known, but the baboon is in fact an Old World monkey with the customary large size and non-prehensile tail..\nMonkeys are highly intelligent and active primates that are broken into two groups known as Old World monkeys and New World monkeys.\nThe Old World monkeys (including baboons) inhabit Africa and Asia, and are more closely related to apes. They are generally larger than New World monkeys, have more elongated faces, and have a tail that is not \"prehensile\".\nNew world monkeys are five families of primates that inhabit Central America, South America and some parts of Mexico. New world monkeys are generally smaller, have more flattened faces and have \"prehensile tails\" which they are capable of gripping with.\nThe prehensile tail is slim, muscular and very long, usually longer than the body length, and can easily support the weight of the entire monkey. These tails often have a patch of bare rough skin called a tactile pad or friction pad, that helps in grasping objects.\nWhile the tail is used primarily to assist in climbing and keeping the hands free for foraging and carrying, some monkey species will use it almost as an extra hand to hold and manipulate food items.\nNew world monkeys often use their tails to grab each other during wrestling and play, and will wrap their tails around each other for comfort.\nThe Old World baboons are the largest of the monkeys with males reaching almost 4 feet long and weighing nearly 80 pounds. The tiny pygmy marmosets of the New World rain forests are the smallest monkeys and can be as tiny as 4 inches and 4 ounces!\nof monkey hands and tails\nProboscis Monkeys - Old World\nSpider Monkey - New World\nOld World monkeys are most quickly differentiated from New World monkeys by looking at their tails.\nThe Old World monkeys have non-prehensile tails that can not grip. The New World monkeys have long. slim prehensile tails that they may climb with and that they can carry and manipulate items with.\nThe most dexterous tail in the monkey kingdom belongs to the spider monkey. These monkeys can hold, carry and even catch items with their tails, and will gesture with them as well.\nThere is a small bare area of rough skin on the underside of the last vertebra in the tail. This \"tactile pad\" has many nerve endings like a fingertip, which aids in delicate tasks like peeling a banana.\nThe prehensile tail is surely a product of the New World monkeys densely forested environment. Most New World monkeys are largely arboreal, spending the majority of their time high in the forest canopy, and some never leave the trees at all.\nWhile many Old World monkeys like the baboons, spend most of their time on the ground walking around on all fours like a dog.\nAnother area of monkey anatomy that shows some variety is the hand. All of the great apes have opposable thumbs meaning that the thumb can be swiveled around so that the pad of the thumb faces the pads of the fingers and can be brought together in a \"pincer\" grip.\nLikewise, all of the Old World monkeys have opposable thumbs.\nBut many New World monkeys, including marmosets, spider monkeys and capuchins do not have opposable thumbs.\nThese animals thumbs range from completely unopposable where the thumb can not be rotated, as in the marmoset and the tamarin, pseudo-opposable where there is partial rotation of the thumb to the side of the hand, and a third situation, as in the spider monkey, where the thumb is actually a very small digit - only 15% the length of the other fingers, and has very little use at all.\nThe New World monkeys life high in the trees no doubt plays a part. Using all five digits together to encircle a branch with more of a cupping motion rather than grasping, seems more effective when speed and mobility are of the essence.\nWith a tail that is able to help as well as its hands, the spider monkey swings from limb to limb with incredible ease, and with a thumb that is always in harmony with the rest of the hand.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Bachelor males may live either in small groups, or completely alone. Proboscis are similar to lions in that when a new male displaces the dominant male, he may kill the existing infants.\nThis is not the typical monkey lifestyle however. Most monkeys live in social groups from 5 to 30 individuals, and separate into pairs for a few days while mating takes place.\nOften there is a change that signals both the males and females readiness to mate, including swelling of the genitals, and reddening of both the genitals and sometimes the face.\nFemales may mate with several males and usually give birth alone.\nSome species, like macaques and baboons, give birth on the ground, but many others make nests up in the trees.\nOne infant is standard, and the baby will be held close to the chest for a few hours to up to two weeks before they graduate to riding on the mothers back.\nInfant monkeys live exclusively on mothers milk for as many as three months, but even after starting solid food, they will continue to nurse for up to a year.\nIn some species, there is some mild cooperation within the group in the rearing of young, but the mother is mostly responsible, and most male monkeys do not treat their own offspring with any special interest.\nYoung monkeys are agile, active and incredibly curious. The most advanced monkey species have their own culture, including greatly varied \"accents\" to their vocalizations, even from troop to troop of the same species.\nLittle ones are taught social codes, local ways to gather and handle food, hunting techniques, seasonality of fruits and nuts, the safest places to sleep and eat.\nLike humans and apes, monkeys have been seen to demonstrate actions in order to teach young ones. In one such instance a mother macaque was observed repeatedly washing a piece of fruit until the toddler caught on and began dipping his own lunch in the river. - Amazing Monkey Facts\nmonkey face\nthe many faces of monkeys\nThere are over 260 known species of monkeys, all of whom display their own distinct look. Colors and patterns, Mohawks and mono-brows, variations in eye shape, skull, nostril, and ear structure, bare skin to fur ratios, and overall proportions produce a slide show of differences unrivaled by any other animal group. Forward facing eyes and color vision no doubt played a part in the development of so many wonderful mugs! - Monkey Facts.\nmarmosets and tamarins\nGolden lion tamarin, Emporer tamarin, pygmy marmoset, cotton-ear marmoset\nThe marmoset genus is made up of 22 species of New World monkeys including the worlds smallest monkey, the pygmy marmoset. There are 16 species within the tamarin genus.\nMarmosets and tamarins differ in jaw shape and skull construction but otherwise have a very similar appearance and lifestyle. They are the smallest monkey species and differ from other monkey families in several ways.\nTheir teeth are specially designed to strip open the bark of trees exposing the sap inside. Some marmoset species may get up to 70% of their diet from tree sap. Otherwise they will eat insects, birds eggs, flowers and fruits.\nMarmosets and tamarins have more primitive brains than other monkeys, and they have claws on their hands and feet as opposed to the flat nails that other monkeys and apes have.\nThese beautiful little monkeys have an amazing variety of face and head decorations, from the flowing red locks of the Golden Lion tamarin, to the feather like extensions of the cotton eared marmoset, to the outrageous mustache of the emperor tamarin.\nThese monkeys almost always give birth to twins. Double adorable!\ndifferent monkey species\nGolden monkeys and black and white colobus monkeys\nThe tremendous variety of monkey species lead to differing lifestyles, habits and appearance.\nMany New World monkeys are largely arboreal and some, like the marmosets and Tamarins may spend their entire lives in trees, never touching the ground.\nThe largest of the Old World monkeys the baboons, have a completely different experience. Living similiar to a pack animal, moving in fairly large groups on the ground, walking usually on all fours.\nThey are still good climbers and will hunt small prey and gather fruits in the trees, but also scavenge around on the ground like dogs might, with their noses low to the ground.\nMany of the Old World monkeys are built for life on the ground, with stronger, wider and more developed lower bodies, while the New World spider monkeys have tiny hips and legs as thin as their arms.\nnight monkey\nMost Old World monkey species sit down fully on their buttocks much as humans do when resting and eating giving them a sort of \"little old man\" quality, while the New World monkeys rest on flexed haunches, more like a cat.\nWhile the majority of monkey species are diurnal - out and about by day- there is an entire family of New World monkeys known as \"night monkeys\" eleven nocturnal species who have large forward facing round eyes like an owl for night vision.\nEqually diverse are the temperatures and habitats monkeys may be found in. Many monkeys naturally live in hot - even sweltering- desert or rain forest environments, but there are some species that live in ice and snow like Japans amazing macaques.\nThese monkeys range farther North than any primate species living in the highlands of central Japan where the snowfall is extensive.

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Zebra images!\nZebra Classification and Evolution\nThe Zebra is a large species of equine that is natively found roaming the grassy plains of sub-Saharan Africa. They are the largest and most distinctive wild horses with bodies that are patterned with white and black stripes, the exact placement of which is unique to each individual. There are three different species of Zebra that are found in Africa which are the Common Zebra (also known as the Plains Zebra and the Burchell\u2019s Zebra), the Grevy\u2019s Zebra (also known as the Imperial Zebra) and the Mountain Zebra. Zebras are incredibly sociable animals that can travel vast distances in search of fresh grass and water but are severely threatened throughout much of their natural range due to increasing levels of human activity. Today, both the Grevy\u2019s Zebra and the Mountain Zebra are considered to be endangered species and although the Common Zebra is more widespread and numerous, there have been sharp population declines in certain areas.\nZebra Anatomy and Appearance\nZebras are heavy bodied animals that are perfectly designed for speed with their long and slender legs and narrow hooves helping them to reach speeds of 40kph when running. In the same way as horses, they only have a single toe on each foot which they walk on the tip of and is protected by their tough hooves. Their black and white stripes are unique to each individual and help them to identify each other when in the herd. Zebras have long necks and heads that mean they can easily reach the grass on the ground and a mane that extends from their forehead and along their back to the tail. The pattern of their stripes varies between the species with Grevy\u2019s and Mountain Zebras having narrower stripes and white undersides, while the Common Zebra has broad stripes that cover its entire body. The Grevy\u2019s Zebra is not only the largest of the Zebra species but is also easily identifiable by its large, rounded ears.\nZebra Distribution and Habitat\nZebras are animals that are found inhabiting the open grasslands and plains of East and Southern Africa where they spend almost of their time grazing on the grasses. The Common Zebra is the most numerous and has the widest natural range throughout East Africa where they are found roaming the grassy plains. The Mountain Zebra can be found grazing on the mountain grasslands of South-West Africa, while the Grevy\u2019s Zebra is confined to the arid grasslands and sub-desert steppe throughout Ethiopia, Somalia and in northern Kenya. Zebras have evolved to run incredibly fast so they are able to escape from dangerous predators and so rely heavily on the open plains for their survival. Although the Common Zebra has been least affected, all three species of the animal are at risk from population declines due to the loss of their natural habitats caused by by increasing levels of human activity.\nZebra Behaviour and Lifestyle\nZebras are highly sociable animals that roam the savanna in herds for protection from predators. The Grevy\u2019s Zebra occupies herds more loosely than the other species with a stallion (male) patrolling enormous territories of up to 10 square kilometres, with mares (females) and their foals grazing freely and occasionally forming small groups that feed together. Both the Common Zebra and the Mountain Zebra inhabit their native regions in long-term herds that split into smaller family groups which are led by a dominant stallion and contain between one and six mares with their young. Their strong social bonds can make them very affectionate towards one another, often grooming each other using their teeth. During the mating season, males will fight fiercely for the right to breed with the females and do so by rearing up on their back legs whilst kicking and biting one another.\nZebra Reproduction and Life Cycles\nThe Zebra is a relatively slow-developing mammal with females not being able to first breed until they are at least a few years old. After a gestation period that can last for between 10 months and a year, the female gives birth to a single foal that is born with its stripes, mane and also has a little patch of hair in the middle of its tummy. Zebra foals are able to stand within minutes of birth which is vital to ensure that they are able to run away to escape from predators. They are able to begin eating grass after a week and are weaned by the time they are 11 months old. Young Zebras remain with their mother until they are mature at around three years old when the males leave their natal herd to join an all-male bachelor group, while females stay with their mother. These bachelor groups begin to challenge the dominant stallions to try and take over the harem during the mating season.\nZebra Diet and Prey\nThe Zebra is a herbivorous animal meaning that it only eats plant-matter in order to gain the nutrition that it needs to survive. The majority of the Zebra\u2019s diet (in fact around 90%) is comprised of a wide variety of different grasses with other plant matter including leaves and buds making up the rest. They use their sharp front teeth to nibble on the tough ends of grasses before grinding them up using the flat molars along its cheeks. Due to the fact that grass has little nutritional value, Zebras must spend between 60% and 80% of the day grazing. Common Zebras are often seen drinking at water holes which they do every day but, due to the fact that the Grevy\u2019s Zebra and the Mountain Zebra inhabit drier, more arid regions, they often don\u2019t drink for several days at a time. In the dry season Zebras can travel vast distances in search of fresh grass and water holes that haven\u2019t yet dried up, with the Grevy\u2019s Zebra also known to dig into the ground of dried up river beds to access the water underground. For a complete analysis of their diet, give our \u2018What Do Zebras Eat?\u2019 page a read!\u201d\nZebra Predators and Threats\nThe Zebra is a large and powerful animal that despite being herbivorous can easily outrun many of its predators. Zebras are preyed upon by Lions, Leopards, Hyenas and African Wild Dogs, along with numerous other large carnivores such as Crocodiles when they are crossing rivers or drinking. Although their first instinct is to run away, Zebras are sometimes known to attack the animal that is threatening it by kicking and biting. However, when danger is spotted, Zebras alert one another of the threat and by running away from their predator as a tight herd, they often either confuse or simply intimidate their attacker. The biggest threat though to Africa\u2019s remaining Zebra populations is the increasing encroachment on their natural habitats by people, with the loss of their open plains to grazing for livestock and to clear land for agriculture.\nZebra Interesting Facts and Features\nThe stripes of the Zebra remain a slight mystery to science even today as they were once thought to camouflage them into the natural light and shade of their surroundings to confuse predators, as once running as a herd, it is extremely difficult to remain focused on a single animal. The formation of the stripes on their rear end of the Zebra differs greatly between the three species with Common Zebras having horizontal stripes on its haunches where those of the Grevy\u2019s Zebra curve upwards. These patterns on their rear ends are thought to differ so greatly so that members of the same herd are able to easily identify the individual at the front of the pack when running. As with other male horses, Zebra stallions are known to curl their top lips up which is thought to heighten their sense of smell. This so-called \u201chorse laugh\u201d is thought to prove vital for the male to be able to detect when a female is ready to mate.\nZebra Relationship with Humans\nDue to the free-roaming nature of Zebras and over vast distances, the increasing human presence throughout the world has meant that Zebras have been affected by the loss of their habitats throughout much of the natural range. However, one of the most intriguing things about Zebras to people is that because they are so closely related to other equines including Horses and Donkeys, Zebras has actually been able to breed with them to produce a hybrid foal, known as a Zonkey (Zebras and Donkeys) or as a Zorse (Zebras and Horses). Although it is not thought that the two species would naturally be able to mate in the wild due to geographical differences, a number of both Zonkey and Zorse individuals now exist around the world. Zebras are thought to have natural protection to certain parasites which has led people to breed Horses and Donkeys with Zebras to produce an animal that has the character and size of a Horse or Donkey but with the power and resilience of a Zebra. As with other cross-breed offspring though, Zonkeys and Zorses are infertile and so are unable to reproduce themselves.\nZebra Conservation Status and Life Today\nToday, two out of the three Zebras species are listed by the IUCN as animals that are Endangered and therefore face extinction from their natural habitats in the future. The Grevy\u2019s Zebra and the Mountain Zebra are found in increasingly isolated regions and their numbers continue to fall throughout their natural ranges. The Common Zebra is an animal that is listed as being Near Threatened by extinction in the wild and although they are still widespread and numbers appear to be relatively stable, they like the other species, are threatened by habitat loss throughout much of their natural range.\nView all 11 animals that start with Z"}

Juvenile hoatzins have a claw at the \u2018elbow\u2019 joint of each of their wings. The species nests above water, and if threatened, the juveniles drop into the water. Using their claws, they are able to climb back into the nest once the danger has passed.\nThe species also has an unusual way of digesting its food, which consists largely of green leaves. The food is broken down by bacteria in a special area in the bird\u2019s crop (the expandable storage area in a bird\u2019s throat), in a similar way to that in which cows digest grass.\nThe fermenting leaves in the hoatzin\u2019s crop give off an unpleasant aroma.

It has black and white plumage and a strikingly-colored head and bill.\nLike other vultures, it is primarily a scavenger. It feeds on carrion that it finds on the forest floor. Due to its size and strength it is able to prevent other scavenging birds from feeding on the carrion until it has had its fill.\nReturn to Index\nLeafcutter Ant\nNumber of species: 47\nGenera: Atta / Acromyrmex\nWhere found: Central & South America\nThey may be small, but leafcutter ants are some of the most amazing \u2013 and important \u2013 animals that live in rainforests.\nThese industrious insects build nests that are up to 30 m (98 ft.) across. These huge nests are home to over 8 million insects!\n(There are many countries in the world whose human populations are smaller than the number of leaf cutter ants that live in just one nest!)\nPerhaps even more amazingly, leafcutter ants grow their own food in special \u2018fungus gardens\u2018 within their immense nests!\nLong trails of leafcutter ants can often be seen carrying leaves from the rainforest canopy to their nest. The leaves are fed to the fungus, which in turn is fed to the ants\u2019 larvae.\nYou can find out more about leaf cutter ants on this page: Leafcutter Ant Facts\nReturn to Index\nLemur\nNumber of species: around 100\nSuperfamily: Lemuroidea\nWhere found: Africa (Madagascar)\nLemurs are small primates found in the rainforests of Madagascar.

The rainforest is just one habitat in which this versatile animal is able to live; it\u2019s equally at home in savannas, woodlands and grasslands.\nThe spots on a leopard\u2019s coat are called \u2018rosettes\u2018. One way of telling leopards and jaguars apart is by looking at their rosettes. A leopard\u2019s rosettes are empty, whereas those of a jaguar are filled with smaller black spots. Leopards are also slightly smaller than jaguars.\nLeopards are incredibly strong, and are known to carry their prey up trees.

With powerful jaws tightly packed with sharp teeth, piranhas have a reputation for being dangerous predators.\nThis fearsome reputation isn\u2019t entirely deserved. Piranhas aren\u2019t top of the rainforest food chain, and are just as likely to end up as dinner for other animals.\nMany piranhas, rather than being purely carnivorous, are actually omnivores who feed on plant matter as well as on meat.\nPiranha attacks on humans are rare, and seldom result in serious injury.\nThere may be over 60 species of piranha (scientists are unsure of the exact number). The largest piranha species is the red-bellied piranha, which grows up to 50 cm (20 in) in length.\nYou can find out more about piranhas on this page: Piranha Facts.\nReturn to Index\nPoison Dart Frog\nNumber of species: around 170\nFamily: Dendrobatidae\nWhere found: Central & South America\nMost of the 170 or so species of poison dart frog have brightly-coloured skin.

These tree-dwelling animals spend nearly all of their lives hanging upside-down from branches in the rainforest canopy.\nSloths move very slowly and have a low metabolism (the rate at which the body uses energy). This is an adaptation for living on leaves, which contain very little energy. Moving slowly also helps sloths stay hidden from predators such as the harpy eagle.\nBecause sloths are such slow movers, algae often begins to grow in their fur, giving them a green color. This is actually beneficial to the sloths, as it camouflages them among the leaves.\nYou can find out more about sloths on this page: Sloth Facts\nReturn to Index\nSouth American Lungfish\nScientific name: Lepidosiren paradoxa\nConservation status: Unassessed\nWhere found: South America\nThe South American lungfish is one of six species of lungfish alive today.

Two sub-species are yet to be assessed. The only sub-specie, the Angolan giraffe is of least concern.\nAlso Read| A Science teacher explains: Fascinating facts about dinosaurs\nWhere can we find giraffes in India?\nIt is believed that a specie Bohlinia entered China and northern India in response to climate change. From there, the genus Giraffa evolved and entered Africa. Further climate changes caused the extinction of the Asian giraffes. The ecosystem in which giraffes live is called the savannah. The Indian subcontinent is not conducive for giraffes. We can see them in some of the zoos across the country.\nWhat is the average height of a giraffe?\nThe average height of an adult giraffe is 4.6 \u2013 6.1 m.\nWhat\u2019s so special about a giraffe\u2019s heart?\nA giraffe has the biggest heart among all the animals. A giraffe\u2019s heart weighs roughly 11.34 kg and measures approximately around 61 cm long.\nWhy does a giraffe not get dizzy when it raises its head quickly from the ground to 15 feet high?\nThe giraffe has a characteristic that belongs to it alone, apart from any other animal, a kind of sponge in the base of the brain. This network of small blood vessels \u201crete mirabile\u201d behaves like a sponge that absorbs blood when the animal leans forward. The mesh expands its vessels to contain the blood that enters the brain and to prevent an increase in pressure. However, for the giraffe, intraocular pressure (fluid pressure inside the eyes) is twice as high. (The intraocular pressure in humans is approximately 100 mm Hg, and the giraffe\u2019s is double that.) Conversely, when the giraffe raises its head, causing a negative effect on the pressure, this sponge engorged with blood immediately infuses the brain until the heart pushes blood to the head. This particular evolutionary development leads a special mechanism to compensate for the substantial effects of hydrostatic pressure. The arteries of the neck are supported by ringed muscles that push blood to the brain. The valves in the jugular vein fight gravity by preventing the rapid descent of blood into the brain when the head is lowered, and they direct flow towards the heart.\nDo giraffes sleep and when? How much do they sleep in a day?\nIn the wild, giraffes almost never lie down because of vulnerability to predators. They usually sleep standing, sometimes sitting. When giraffes sleep, they curl their necks and sleep for about five minutes at a time, sleeping no more than 30 minutes a day.\nAre giraffes intelligent and how do we know if they are?\nThey are brilliant animals. They are known to be very good at adapting to their environment. When drinking water, giraffes have learned to gulp in order to avoid predators while in a vulnerable position. When it comes to sleeping, being able to move in a matter of seconds in the body of a 1300 kg animal is not easy. They have adapted to be able to survive on 30 minutes or less of sleep a day.\nZoo interns have shared that giraffes can recognise their given names. They are also very intelligent when it comes to food. The giraffes at the zoo were fed at 11 every day. Sure enough, by 10.45 am each day they would be at the feeding deck waiting. They also knew that the cardboard box meant leaves of lettuce. They would even become extra greedy sometimes and try to sneak extra pieces out with their long tongues thinking they wouldn\u2019t be seen. The intelligence of giraffes is a factor in how quickly they adapt behaviourally in response to changing external stimuli.\nGiraffes have a very interesting social structure. The females generally bond very well together so you will see them in small herds with about 10-12 members. Although giraffes have been seen in larger groups, it has been observed that these larger groups are for extra protection of the young while eating. These larger groups mainly consist of females.\nWhat do they eat and how much in a day? Do they drink water?\nIn the wild, giraffes primarily eat the leaves and twigs of acacia, mimosa, and wild apricot trees (also various trees and shrubs in the genera Commiphora and Terminalia). They even eat some fruit.\nGiraffes may eat up to 75 pounds (34 kilograms) of food per day. They spend most of their day eating, because they get just a few leaves in each bite. Their favourite leaves are from acacia trees. If water is easily available, like in zoos, they can drink 10 gallons (38 litres) a day.\nHow fast can a giraffe run?\nA giraffe can run up to the speed of 60 km/h.\nCan a giraffe sit down? Can they jump? Can they kick?\nGiraffes can sit down but they usually don\u2019t sit because of vulnerability to predators. Giraffes do not jump. A giraffe can kick in any direction and in a manner of ways, and its kick can not only kill a lion, but has even been known to decapitate (behead) it.\nHow do giraffes give birth?\nGiraffes give birth while standing up after a gestation period of 13-15 months. The calf enters the world from quite a height. They fall 6 feet to the ground with hooves and head first.\nIf a lion and a giraffe fight, who would win?\nA lion and a giraffe are no match for a fight. A lion can never beat a giraffe due to its colossal size and height. A giraffe is so tall that a lion can never reach its throat for a bite, which is how it usually tackles big animals. When hunting adult giraffes, lions try to knock the lanky animal off its feet and pull it down.\nWhat is their lifespan?\nThe average life span of a giraffe is 25-28 years.\n(Source: With inputs from http://www.bornfree.org.uk, jocelyndelhotalgiraffes.blogspot.com, news.nationalgeographic.com, giraffeconservation.org.)\n(The writer is Lead, Curriculum \u2013 Science & Math at Shiv Nadar School.)"}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Sloth Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Sloth-facts.html", "text": "sloth Facts\nPortrait of an Sloth\nThe word \"sloth\" means \"inclined to laziness and inaction\", and the amazingly placid and extremely slow moving sloth would certainly appear to live up to its name.\nThe sloth is almost entirely arboreal, spending over 95 percent of its existence high up in the trees of Central and South America.\nWith the help of extremely specialized claws, sloths eat, sleep, breed and give birth all while dangling from the tallest branches of cecropia trees. Sloths come in two and three toed varieties and are related to anteaters, who have similarly formed long arching toenails.\nSloths exist on a diet almost entirely of leaves, which is such an inferior source of nutrition and energy that it shapes their whole lifestyle. They end up spending almost every waking moment quietly munching on leaves with little time for grooming or any other activities.\nThe lack of grooming leads the sloths dense coat to actually grow algae during the rainy season, giving them a greenish tinge.\nWithin the sloths belly is a sea of micro bacteria that help to breakdown and eventually digest what they eat. The process takes so long that a leaf consumed in August might not be eliminated until October.\nWith so much effort exerted to extract a minimum of nutrients, the sloths metabolism is amazingly slow- the slowest in the entire animal kingdom. - Sloth Facts\nthe sloths very special equipment\nAll of the sloth species have numerous amazing adaptions, not only for an arboreal life high in the trees, but also for a life lived in an inverted position.\nSloths do not build nests, instead they find a leafy area and simply fall asleep hanging completely upside down with all four limbs grasping a branch.\nThree toed sloths rear legs, feet and claws are shorter than the front and both two-toed and three-toed sloths have three toes on the rear legs.\nThere is a suggestion that all sloths are three-toed because the front \"toes\" are actually \"fingers\".\nThe claws on the front feet are about 4 inches long, and can be used as a weapon when the sloth is cornered. The claws on all four limbs curve in toward the wrist creating four large, natural hooks. Muscle power is not required for the sloth to grip branches, in fact sloths have about 30% less muscle mass than other mammals of equal size.\nIt is the construction of the claws and limbs, and a natural retraction of the ligaments that creates the \"gripping reflex\" of the sloth. A sloth spends approximately 85% of its life hanging completely upside down, mainly because it requires no effort.\nThe entire sloth is designed for a life of inversion. All of its internal organs, including the heart, liver, spleen and stomach, are rearranged inside its body cavity so nothing gets crushed or obstructed.\nEven the fur on the sloths torso and limbs grows in the opposite direction than it would in other animals with the follicles pointing up the arms and away from the belly so the hairs guide rain water and debris to the ground.\nAs an example of the effortlessness with which sloths dangle from the highest limbs, it is not uncommon for a sloth to pass away and remain securely hooked to its final branch. - Sloth Facts\nsloth reproduction\ntwo toed sloth mother and baby\nSo we know that the sloth is incredibly slow. It takes about a month to digest a leaf, about a minute to move 15 feet and about 6 hours to make it to the bathroom and back.\nBut there is one thing that sloths do with amazing speed, and that one thing is sex.\nSloth females come into heat about once a year and they let the whole neighborhood know it. Normally demure, a lady sloth in heat screams continually until a male finds her or her season passes.\nShe generally does not leave her own trees and just waits for a suitor to arrive. Then, once a gentleman makes his way up to her, it is basically first come first served without any posturing or foreplay.\nIn fact, the whole experience from first contact to completion of deed may only be a matter of seconds. In some species the male may stay for a day or two and there may be several matings, but in other species the male departs right after a single 6 second act of intercourse.\nThe mother sloth gives birth to one pup after about 4 months of pregnancy. The baby is born fully furred, eyes open, and generously clawed. It is basically a miniature adult without the fauna developed in its fur yet, of course.\nThe pup clings to its mothers belly most of the first few months of life and begins to munch on leaves at about 2 months old.\nA baby sloth usually leaves its mother after a year or so, sometimes just moving a tree or two away, but generally has no contact with her once independent. - Sloth Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

That creature, most probably, lived on the ground.\nSo, although they appear to be very similar, they are better described as animals that evolved in the exact same way due to habitat, rather than being closely related. This is called convergent evolution and is a result of creatures changing in the same ways due to exposure to the same circumstances, and arriving at a very similar result that appears to be more closely related than it actually is.\nIn fact, the two-toed sloths actual closest relative is the now-extinct ground sloth. The ground sloths, including the gigantic megatherium or giant ground sloth existed throughout the southern United States up till about 10,000 years ago and was larger than an elephant.\nThese creatures probably lived in groups, as elephants do, and walked on all fours. They had curved claws like the modern sloths and walked on the sides of their feet like anteaters do, because the claws were over a foot long! - Sloth Facts\nwhat's the difference between three-toed and two-toed sloths?\nbrown-throated three-toed sloth\nmaned three-toed sloth\nHoffmanns two-toed sloth (hind foot is also in photo)\nThe three-toed sloth is kind of adorable, and has become a bit of an Internet darling. Most of the photos used in wallpapers and t-shirts are of either the brown-throated or pale-throated three-toed sloth.\nThese two species also have the characteristic dark eye patches that trail down to the neck. Three-toed sloths have fur on their faces, tiny, stumpy tails, three toes on both the front and rear feet, rear legs much shorter than front, and smaller noses than two-toed sloths.\nThe three-toed sloths also have extra neck vertebrae which allow them to swivel their heads 270 degrees around. Because of major skeletal differences like this, two-toed sloths are in a separate zoological family from three-toed.\nTwo=toed sloths are larger and faster and eat a more varied diet of fruits and insects along with leaves. This gives them a bit more energy than their smaller relatives, and they move about more freely in a larger range. Two-toeds have bare flesh on their faces, very large, wet noses, no visible tail (there is a tail vertebrae inside the body) and, of course, two toes on the front feet, three on the rear.\nTwo-toed sloth species are also completely nocturnal, sleeping motionless and almost invisible in the treetops all day long and not moving until after dark. There has been very little field research done on them for this reason, and so, as mysterious an animal as the three-toed sloth is, the two-toed sloth is an even deeper mystery.\nThree-toed sloths spend some time active during early morning or dusk so can be observed more easily. The three-toed in particular, has a tremendously mat-like body of thick fur, that it never grooms.\nThe fur becomes home to both vegetation and insects. Entire colonies of moths may live in their fur, and algae and lichen grow abundantly - particularly in rainy season- providing exceptional camouflage.\nSloths have long, thick, sticky tongues covered in a carpet of tiny, rear-ward pointing spikes that they can pull leaves in with. They have a four-chambered stomach like a cow, to process all the vegetation, but short intestines that don't extract as much energy.\nTheir bodies do not regulate temperature effectively and they must move to sunny spots to warm up. In cold rainy weather their temperature drops and they become inactive. Cold spells can be dangerous for sloth populations because they must move about to eat, but can't get warm enough to move. - Sloth Facts\nsloth lifestyle - pay it forward\nSloths live in very dense rain forest where the tops of mangrove, cecropia and trumpet trees form the famous \"canopy\"- a tangle of branches that can allow a creature like the sloth, or other small arboreal animals like monkeys and lizards to travel sometimes for miles across the rain forest, treetop to treetop, without ever touching the ground.\nAlthough their entire range may expand for several trees, there are many sloths, particularly the smaller, less active three-toed species that spend their entire lives in the limbs of just one single large tree.\nOnce every five to seven days the sloth will climb down to the ground and relieve itself at the base of the tree, burying its feces in basically the same area every time.\nThe buried stool breaks down quickly and provides excellent fertilizer for the parent tree.\nAlthough it is not known why they risk leaving the tree to defecate and don't simply relieve themselves from a branch, their habit of burying their stool at the roots of the tree they live in is an interesting example of the circle of life. - Sloth Facts.\na few more sloth facts\nthree-toed sloth on the ground\nThe sloth has the slowest metabolism of any mammal on Earth.\nSloths take about 25 days to digest one leaf.\nThe ancestors of todays sloth were as big as African elephants\nBoth two-toed and three-toed sloths have three toes on their hind limbs.\nThe sloth takes a potty break only once a week\nSloths sleep hanging completely upside-down\nThe sloths fur is home to algae, lichen and even moths.\nThe sloth turns green in the rainy season due to algae growing on its fur. - Sloth Facts"}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Porcupine Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Porcupine-facts.html", "text": "porcupine Facts\nPortrait of a Porcupine\nThe porcupine is a large, round, slow-moving rodent with a spectacular means of defense. It's muscular body is covered with up to 30,000 long, hollow and pointed quills. The North American porcupine is one of the world's most recognizable animals because of it's body full of prickly spines, that are essentially modified hairs.\nThe porcupine cannot throw it's quills, but if a predator makes contact, the spines easily detach and lodge mercilessly in the attackers skin, causing stinging pain when entering, and tearing the flesh upon extraction.\nAlthough the quills themselves are not poisonous and can't kill, it is possible that numerous spines lodged in an animals face, eyes, or mouth can render them defenseless, or unable to eat or hunt, and a lingering death may occur.\nMost predators willingly allow these imposing animals a very wide path, and porcupines can be observed peacefully trundling along quite impervious to virtually anything, as they search for nuts, berries and buds to eat. They are relatively fearless, but if danger approaches the porcupine gives lots of warning of the pain it can unleash.\nPorcupines have a musky odor that is described as being similar to very rank human body odor. that The musk intensifies if the porcupine is stressed, which should be enough of an alert, but in the event that a dog or bear cub presses the issue, porcupines will chatter their teeth, stamp their feet and rattle their quills together to make a series of intimidating sounds.\nIf the threat gets too close, the porcupine may swing it's rear around and strike the aggressor with it's tail. and when in full attack mode, the porcupine lunges backwards, thrusting dozens of raised quills towards the intended target.\nThe razor sharp quills easily dislodge on contact and have scale-like barbs that pull them a little further into the victims skin with every movement.\nOnly the cougar and the rugged little fisher, which is a type of weasel, regularly kill and eat North American porcupines, and only during lean times. Golden eagles and great horned owls have also been reported hunting them, but in general, porcupines remain unmolested as they go about their business.\nPorcupines are cathemeral, meaning they may be active night or day. They are herbivorous, eating leaves, shoots, buds, fruits and nuts. Although they appear awkward, and are husky to say the least, porcupines of North and South America are actually arboreal and forage, eat and sleep in the trees.\nporcupines!\nThe porcupine is the third largest rodents in the world, behind only the capybara and the beaver. There are about 2 dozen species of porcupines, and these are broken into the Old World porcupines and the New World porcupines.\nThe Old World porcupines are ground-dwellers, and usually live in pairs or small groups. They include the largest porcupine species, the African Cape porcupine, whose extremely long spines (up to 20 inches), can be raised like a crest to make them appear twice as large.\nThe New World porcupines include the familiar, tree-dwelling North American porcupine, also known as the Canadian, or common porcupine. There are about 7 sub-species of North American porcupine, all varying only slightly in size and coloration. They have very long guard hairs that give them a \"fluffy\" appearance, with tens of thousands of quills hiding below.\nAlso from the New World are the amazing prehensile-tailed porcupines of Central and South America, which have naked, prehensile tails, bulbous noses and a prehistoric or even alien appearance.\nporcupine species\nCape Porcupine\nAsiatic brush-tailed porcupine\nRodents make up about 40% of all the mammal species on Earth. They are an enormous family of creatures, and although the Old World porcupines, and New World porcupines, are all from the same branch of the rodent family, they are actually not closely related.\nThe major difference between Old and New world species is that the Old World porcupines live on the ground and often in small groups, while the New World porcupines are mostly solitary and live in trees.\nOld world species range throughout Africa, Asia and Europe, and include brush-tailed porcupines that are only about 4 pounds, to the largest porcupine species, the African cape porcupine, which can be almost 3 feet long and 45 to 60 pounds.\nThe Cape porcupines form monogamous pairs and stay together to raise their 2 to 4 youngsters, called porcupettes. Male Cape porcupines have even been known to raise babies on their own, if the mother passes.\nThe New World porcupines are the North American porcupine, also known as the Canadian or common porcupine, the tree porcupines, and a few other species including the stump-tailed porcupine.\nThe tree porcupines are found in the rainforests of Central and South America. They are covered with dense quills, except for their large noses, bellies and the end half of their tails.\nThe end of the tail is naked, and can grasp limbs and support the animal like a fifth limb. It is not as versatile as a monkeys tail, with which monkeys can actually hold and manipulate items, but is used mostly for support while climbing and reaching for fruits in the trees.\nThe Brazilian porcupine is a prehensile tailed variety that reaches about 24 inches in body length, with a tail that is about 19 inches long. They can weigh up to 15 pounds and spend their days sleeping in the treetops of the Brazilian rainforest.\nAt night, they cruise through the trees eating fruits, twigs, buds, flowers and nuts. They have strong, curved toes that wrap around branches, and a roughened pad on the bottom of the tail helps with grip. These animals occasionally come down from the trees to eat crops or flowers. On the ground, these specialized feet don't conform well to walking. The going is slow and the porcupine will roll up in a ball if it feels threatened, leaving just a shroud of spines to contend with.\nThere are also two species of rat-like porcupines, one native to Africa and the other to Asia, called brush-tails. They have short quills over their bodies and a tuft of quills on the tail which they use as a club when threatened. Brush-tailed porcupines are mostly nocturnal and more omnivorous than the other species, eating insects and small lizards as well as vegetation.\nBrazilian prehensile-tailed porcupine\nporcupine lifestyle\nThe North American, or common porcupine is designed for life in the trees. They have curved claws and powerful curved feet to grasp and climb. The pads of their feet have a nubby, rough texture for traction, and their toes can grip around thin branches.\nIn fact, the porcupine regularly holds on with just it's back toes, stretching to reach young buds at the tips of delicate tree limbs. It is this lust for tender greenery that finds porcupines tumbling from the tree tops on a surprisingly regular basis.\nThe impact may shake numerous quills loose, and leave a smattering of spines on the forest floor. They may also impale themselves on themselves during such an event, which is why nature has coated each quill with a penicillin-like grease that prevents infection.\nCommon porcupines live alone, only coming together to mate. They are mostly nocturnal, but do forage during the day upon occasion. They are exclusively herbivorous eating fruits, nuts, buds and flowers. They have ever-growing front molars that are orange in color, and are capable of chewing right through the bark of mature trees. They will de-bark trees during the winter when food is scarce, and can cause some damage to forests this way.\nIn comparison, the largest porcupine species in the world, the African crested porcupine, and the African Cape porcupine which are very similiar sub-species, is a ground-dweller that can reach 60 pounds in size. They eat roots and bulbs, and regularly raid farmers crops. They spend the heat of the day in burrows or under rocky outcrops, and start foraging at dusk.\nThese animals are monogamous, and may actually mate for life. They live in small family groups, and the male plays a large role in the care of offspring. - Amazing!\ncrested porcupine\nporcupine reproduction\nMalayan porcupine babies\ncrested porcupine mother and baby\nThe North American porcupine is generally a solitary animal. The female comes into season once a year, and attracts potential mates with urine marking and shrill calls in the night. Multiple males may be lured to her, and may engage in fairly aggressive battles that include clawing and biting and swinging their tails at eachother.\nDuring mating season, areas with large porcupine populations will show the results of such battles in lost quills scattered across the forest floor, and the mating calls of both sexes can be heard for miles.\nMale porcupines are acustomed to being punctured by rivals, and remove quills from their own skin by grasping it with their teeth and twisting. When the battles are over and one male emerges victorious, he still must wait for the female to get in the mood.\nHe will choose a perch in her tree, on a lower limb than her, where he can intercept any other males, and keep an eye on her.\nTo woo her, he will spray her with a stream of urine loaded with male pheromones. These chemicals usually stimulate the female, and arouse her. She will climb down to the ground, the male following, and when she is ready she will raise her tail over her back.\nThe male must manage the copulation situation very carefully, and mating can only be accomplished with the females complete cooperation. She is only receptive for a short window of 6 to 12 hours, and the pair will mate several times until the male is exhausted and climbs away home.\nFemale porcupines are pregnant for about 7 months. This is a long pregnancy for a rodent - consider that the larger beaver has a gestation period of 124 days - and it is reflected in how developmentally advanced the newborn is.\nThe porcupine baby, called a porcupette, comes into the world with eyes open and a full coat of spines, but the quills are soft and rubbery, and only harden when exposed to the air. After only about an hour of life outside the womb, the baby porcupine is climbing and nursing, and it's quills are hardened weapons.\nBabies begin to forage for solid food after just two weeks, and are weaned at 3 or 4 months. They stay with mom for about 6 months, with some hanging around for more than a year before heading out on their own.\nPorcupine mother and baby\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Keratin is a common substance in the bodies of most mammals and forms hardened, generally nerve-less structures like fingernails, hair and feathers.\nIn fact, the porcupines quills, although often described as enlarged, modified hairs, are actually closer in construction to feathers. The quill is hollow, like the shaft of a feather, and in the case of some African species, can be as wide as drinking straws. They are raised up away from the body by thin muscles under the skin, and operate like venetian blinds, in rows, much as feathers are organized across the body. All the porcupines have some barbing, usually on the tip of the quill, but the brush-tailed porcupine has small saw-tooth barbs lining the sides of each quill, like the tines on a feather.\nPainful going in, the quills of most porcupines cause even more pain when they are extracted. That's because the tips of each quill have hundreds of microscopic, backward-facing barbs that look much like fish scales. These barbs are flexible and allow the tip of the quill to penetrate deep into the skin, then splay out and bend against the skin when pulled out, anchoring the barb and requiring more force to remove, causing additional tearing as a result.\nThe barbs may cause damage to flesh, and slow, unpleasant deaths of unfortunate victims may result from starvation through the inability to hunt or eat, but infection rarely, if ever, occurs.\nWhy? Because the quills are covered with a thin layer of greasy secretions that actually inhibit the growth of bacteria.\nSo why would an animal that defends itself with such a merciless weapon, provide it's victim with protection from infection? Because sometimes, the victim of the porcupines vicious quills, is the porcupine itself, or, occasionally a family member.\nUsually it takes a bit of an event for accidental punctures to occur. Something like an aggressive encounter, or more often a fall from a tree.\nImagine your a slow moving, rounded, rodent slipping off a tree branch hurtling to the ground, and anywhere you land is a pile of spikes. Well at least you won't get a nasty infection while your waiting to heal.\na few more porcupine facts\nPorcupines can't throw their quills\nPorcupines have a strong, musky \"wet dog\" smell\nThough they are a little clumsy, porcupines are built for climbing\nAfrican cape porcupines have 20 inch quills\nPorcupine quills are hollow\nPorcupine guard hairs are used to make a Native American headress called a \"roach\"\nThe quills have barbs on the tips that cause them to burrow deeper into the skin and make them hard to remove\nThe fisher, a very tough weasel species, regularly eats porcupines\nSome porcupines have prehensile tails like New World monkeys\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Primates\nFamily Cercopithecidae\nGenus Papio\nCommon Porcupine - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT boar sow porcupette, pup,\npiglet solitary GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD array,prickle U.S.A., Canada woodland, brush flower buds TOPSPEED ENDANGERED AVG WEIGHT AVG LENGTH 6 mph no 18 - 35 pounds 25 - 35 inches QUILL # QUILL LENGTH AT BIRTH HARDEN 30,000 4 - 10 inches quills are soft 1 -2 hours ESTRUS GESTATION BIRTH LENGTH BIRTHWEIGHT 1 x year 7 months 6 inches 12-16 ounces RAISED BY # OF YOUNG AT BIRTH CAN CLIMB mother 1 eyes open 2 hours WEANED INDEPENDENT MATURITY LIFESPAN 16 weeks 8 months 10 months 8 - 15 years"}

Here's how you can get your own child to fall in love with the lovely long-necked mammal \u2013 because the more people that care about the animal (now critically endangered), the better.\nThe first time I saw giraffes up close was when I was an adult. I was in the night zoo in Singapore. There was a giraffe enclosure where you can sit and watch the giraffes munch on the leaves and go about their nightly rounds. The light was low, the sky was clear and I sat there just watching them pace the enclosure for almost an hour.\nGraceful yet awkward, cuddly yet lanky, horns that don\u2019t threaten, spots that don\u2019t repeat, growls we can\u2019t hear and alert, never sleeping for longer than a few seconds... That day, I knew I had the soul of a giraffe.\nI grew up in India and, as the stereotype goes, we fed cows that came to our doors on festivals, we watched peacocks and elephants looked after in temples, monkeys that jumped over roofs and snatched what you ate. We went on special Fridays to leave milk and eggs for snakes inside snake pits. Yes, scary! But it is a culture that respected animals as being spirits of our lives. Every animal has a canon of stories behind it.\n'I wanted to find out their story'\nWhen I saw my first giraffe, that was my first instinct. I wanted to find out about their story. How did they get their name, the spots and their calm attitude? I loved that they lived in herds and looked after each other.\nWhen Lantana Publishing asked to set the third book in the series of Mummy and Baby bedtime books in Africa, after You\u2019re Safe With Me (in a tropical rainforest) and You\u2019re Snug with Me (in the polar), I jumped at the chance to tell the story of a young giraffe who wanted to grow up quickly. That became You\u2019re Strong with Me.\nThese three books have been illustrated by the amazing, Kate Greenaway medal-shortlisted Poonam Mistry, who uses her unique style to bring the words to life, finding new things each time you read the stories.\nUnlike humans, giraffe babies start walking and running in a few hours after their birth. But does that mean they can manage the rough wilds of their habitat on their own? Like all children, giraffe calves too need time to learn about their surroundings, their families, nature of their predators and the cycle of life in the wild.\n5 giraffe books to try\nTo celebrate the launch of You\u2019re Strong With Me (the story of a baby giraffe discovering the world around her and her mother, who keeps her strong with the wisdom of a parent), I thought I should share some of my favourite giraffe stories.\n1. Zeraffa Giraffa by Diane Hofmeyr and Jane Ray\nI love this story because it\u2019s a historical event but also because I wonder what Zeraffa was thinking in her new surroundings and how much Atir kept her strong during that trip.\nRead our book review\n2. Giraffe Problems by Jory John and Lane Smith\nThe giraffe in this book reminds me of my own childhood, when I was very self-conscious about being thin. People called me 'grass tripper' or 'speck in the wind'. Funnily enough, I did try scarves and other things as an adult to cover my self-consciousness. Giraffe Problems is a great book for kids and adults who think others have it better, and then later realise that everyone feels that way. There is no one way to be beautiful.\nRead our book review\n3. Abigail by Catherine Rayner\nI love this book because I have a nephew who is six months shy of five, and loves counting everything. He counts things that move, things we eat and everything in-between. He never gives up until he finishes his counting. A great book with a wonderful pull-out at the end.\n4. Giraffes by Laura Marsh for National Geographic Kids\nMy other nephew loves facts. Like many kids his age, he remembers much of the facts told to him and the ones he reads. I love this book because it\u2019s easy to read and yet covers the key facts about giraffes.\n5. A Giraffe and a Half by Shel Silverstein\nMy final favourite is this wonderful poem by Shel Silverstein. Giraffes are so unique that they should be in more poems or perhaps in all poems. First, you have to read the 'half' in an American accent to rhyme with 'giraffe' and then you will find things growing on the 'giraffe and a half'. Finally, he sheds all of that back and turns back into a normal giraffe. If you haven\u2019t read it, find the book now.\nEnjoy reading all the books in the list and also You\u2019re Strong With Me. If you\u2019re sitting under a tree, watch out for the oxpecker bird and the giraffe eating the leaves above you!"}

As you stand head height with our herd.\nAll our giraffes are male so they live together quite happily. In Africa, they live in small numbers and the males and females (and their calves) stay apart, only coming together to mate.\nOur giraffes are hybrid, this means they are a mixture of some of the nine sub-species and as such we will never breed from them. Many years ago (before we knew about all the sub-species) \u2018giraffe\u2019 were bred with \u2018giraffe\u2019. Today modern zoos, only breed giraffe of the same sub-species together. However, we are still part of a managed breeding programme and an important part of that breeding programme is to provide a home for hybrid males so other zoos can continue breeding.\nThey don\u2019t call it a \u2018Camelopardalis\u2019 in Latin for nothing you know. Due to the slight hump on their back and the spotted patchwork pattern on their skin they were once referred to as a camel-leopard!

There are three species of zebra: Plains or Burchell's zebra (Equus quagga or E. burchellii), Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi), and mountain zebra (Equus zebra).\nAnatomical differences between the zebra species are fairly sparse: In general, the mountain zebra is smaller and has evolutionary differences associated with living in the mountains. Mountain zebras have hard, pointed hooves that are well-suited for negotiating the slopes and they have conspicuous dewlaps\u2014a loose fold of skin underneath the chin seen often in cattle\u2014which the plains and Grevy's zebras do not.\nVarious species of asses, including the African wild ass (Equus asinus), have some stripes (for instance, Equus asinus has stripes on the lower portion of its legs). Zebras are nonetheless the most distinctively striped of the equids.\nWestend61/Getty Images\nSpecies\nEach species of zebra has a unique stripe pattern on its coat which provides researchers with an easy method for identifying individuals. Grevy's zebras have a thick black hairy strip on their rump that extends towards their tail and a broader neck than the other species of zebras and a white belly. Plains zebras often have shadow stripes (stripes of a lighter color that occur between the darker stripes). Like Grevy's zebras, some plains zebras have a white belly.\nZebras can cross breed with other members of equus: A plains zebra crossed with a donkey is known as a \"zebdonk,\" zonkey, zebrass, and zorse. The plains or Burchell's zebra has several subspecies: Grant's zebra (Equus quagga boehmi) and Chapman's zebra (Equus quagga antiquorum). And the now-extinct quagga, once thought to be a separate species, is now considered a subspecies of the plains zebra (Equus quagga quagga).\nHabitat and Distribution\nMost zebra species live in arid and semi-arid plains and savannas of Africa: Plains and Grevy's zebras have different regions but overlap during migrations. Mountain zebras, however, live in the rugged mountains of South Africa and Namibia. Mountain zebras are skilled climbers, inhabiting mountain slopes up to elevations of 6,500 feet above sea level.\nAll zebras are extremely mobile, and individuals have been recorded to move distances of greater than 50 miles. Plains zebras make the longest known terrestrial wildlife migration, a whopping 300 miles between the Chobe River floodplains in Namibia and the Nxai Pan National Park in Botswana.\nDiet and Behavior\nRegardless of their habitats, zebras are all grazers, bulk, roughage feeders that need to consume large daily quantities of grasses. They are also all full migrant species, migrating seasonally or year-round depending on seasonal vegetation changes and habitat. They often follow long grasses that grow after the rains, altering their migration patterns to avoid adverse conditions or find new resources.\nMountain and plains zebras live in family groups or harems, typically consisting of one stallion, several mares, and their juvenile offspring. Non-breeding groups of bachelors and occasional fillies also exist. During parts of the year, the harems and bachelor groups join together and move as herds, the timing and direction of which are determined by seasonal vegetation changes in habitat.\nBreeding males will defend their resource territories (water and food) that range between one and 7.5 square miles; the home range size of non-territorial zebras can be as large as 3,800 square miles. Male plains zebras ward off predators by kicking or biting them and have been known to kill hyenas with a single kick.\nRobert Muckley / Getty Images\nReproduction and Offspring\nFemale zebras sexually mature at the age of three and give birth to between two and six offspring over their lifetimes. Gestation periods are between 12 and 13 months, depending on species, and the average female gives birth about once every two years. Male fertility is far more variable.\nReproductive pairing is played out differently for different species. While plains and mountain zebras practice the harem strategy described above, Grevy's zebra females do not join males in harems. Instead, they form loose and transitory associations with many other females and males, and females of different reproductive states group themselves into sets that use different habitats. Males do not ally with the females; they simply establish territories around water.\nDespite their stable long-term harem structure, plains zebras often coalesce into herds, forming multi-male or uni-male groups, providing polygamous opportunities for males and polyandrous opportunities for females.\nDiana Robinson Photography/Getty Images\nConservation Status\nThe Grevy's zebra is listed by the IUCN as Endangered; the mountain zebra as Vulnerable; and the plains zebra as Near Threatened. Zebras once roamed all habitats in Africa, with the exceptions of rain forests, deserts, and dunes. Threats for all of them include habitat loss resulting from drought associated with climate change and farming, continuing political upheaval, and hunting.\nSources"}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Lion images!\nThe lion is Africa\u2019s apex predator\nThe lion is one of the largest, strongest, and most powerful felines in the world, second only in size to the Siberian Tiger. They are the largest cats on the African continent. While most big cats are solitary hunters, lions are incredibly sociable animals that live together in family groups called pride. They are some of the world\u2019s most popular animals.\nIncredible Lion Facts!\nBetween 1993-2014, the IUCN estimated the population of lions decreased by 42%. Due to poaching and habitat loss, its estimated there may be fewer than 20,000 lions left today.\nWhile lions are generally social animals, prides generally consist of 80% females. For this reason, only about one in eight male lions survive to adulthood. Groups of male lions sometimes band together, controlling vast swaths of territory. One famous band of male lions in South Africa\u2019s Kruger National Park controlled over 170,000 acres and was estimated to kill more than 100 rival lions and cubs.\nLions are animals that have long been kept in zoos and in captivity. In 18th century England, the price of admission to the Tower Menagerie (the pre-cursor to the London Zoo) was three pence, or a cat or dog to be fed to the lions!\nThe largest lion ever recorded weighed 690 pounds and was shot in South Africa in 1936. Ancient lions were even larger than today\u2019s largest lions, and reached up to 1,153 pounds!\nThe lion is considered one of the \u201cAfrican Big Five.\u201d\nFor our full list of incredible lion facts, see our 13 mind-blowing lion facts page.\nLion Scientific Name and Classification\nThe scientific name for lions is Panthera leo. The genus Panthera is of Greek origin and comprises big cat species such as tigers, lions, jaguars, and leopards that have the ability to roar. Leo is the Latin word for lion.\nThere are two types of lion subspecies. One is named Panthera leo melanochaita and lives across South and East Africa. The second lion subspecies has the scientific name Panther leo leo and lives in West Africa, Central Africa, and Asia. You may see references to African and Asiatic lions. Up until 2017, there were two recognized subspecies, the African and Asiatic lions, but scientists reclassified lions that year. For more information on the types of lions see our full lion classification guide.\nLion Anatomy and Appearance\nLions have a short coat of tawny or golden fur with a long tail that has a tuft of longer fur at the end. The markings on their coats are much fainter than the bold stripes and spots displayed on other felines which helps these large carnivores in going unseen when stalking prey in the long grasses. Lions have strong and powerful jaws that contain 30 teeth in total which includes four fang-like canines and four carnassial teeth that are perfectly designed for slicing through flesh.\nLion Mane\nThe lion is one of the largest cats in the world with males being taller and heavier than females and displaying a mane of long hair around their faces (in fact, it is the only case in the feline world where males and females actually look different). Thought to be connected with testosterone levels, the mane of the male lion ranges from blonde to red, brown, and black in color and covers their head, neck, and chest.\nWhite Lions\nSeveral big cat species have been observed in the wild with color mutations, such as the white tiger or black panther. Likewise, there is an uncommon color mutation of lions that leaves their coat extremely pale.\nUnlike white tigers which are albino \u2013 that is, lacking in color pigments in their coat \u2013 the coat of white lions is caused by recessive traits. The uncommon nature of white lions led to them being captured and moved into captivity in the second half of the 20th century.\nToday, white lions are bred across many zoos and wildlife parks. For example, in North America, six white lions are located at Parc Safari near Montreal, Quebec as of 2020. However, they\u2019re now being reintroduced back into environments in South Africa and are successfully breeding and hunting in their native environments.\nLion Distribution and Habitat\nHistorically, Lions would have been found throughout much of Africa and even in parts of Europe and Asia as well. Today, however, they have been pushed into more isolated pockets of their once vast natural range with the remaining African Lion population now only found in countries in sub-Saharan Africa. There is also still a small population of Asiatic Lions found inhabiting a remote part of the Gir Forest in India.\nDespite their dwindling numbers, Lions are actually incredibly adaptable animals that can and will inhabit very dry climates as they get most of the moisture they need from their food. They prefer areas of open woodland, scrub, and long grasslands where there is not only plenty over cover but also a wide variety of prey. They are only not found in areas of rainforest or far into deserts.\nLion Population \u2014 How Many White Lions Are Left?\nLike other big cat species, the lion is under threat from habitat loss and hunting. Between 1993 and 2014, the population of lions decreased by 42%. The IUCN\u2019s last assessment places the adult population between 23,000 to 39,000 mature individuals. Today, lions as a species are listed as \u201cVulnerable,\u201d a step above being declared \u201cEndangered.\u201d\nWhile the Africa lion\u2019s population likely numbers over 20,000, Asiatic lion populations are estimated to number just 600 individuals. Asiatic lions are limited to just a single wildlife sanctuary in India that measures just 545 square miles (1,400 sq. km). Further growth in the population of Asiatic lions will rely on reintroduction into new habitats in India.\nExtinct lion species and subpopulations\nScientists believe that 10,000 years ago lions were the most widespread mammal outside of humans. However, today their range is a fraction of its historical size. This comes from the extinction of two unique lion species near the end of the last ice age and habitat loss that has reduced the range of lions\nBarbary lion\nThe Barbary lion used to live across the North Coast of Africa, with a range that stretched from Egypt to Morocco. Until recently, it was believed to be a distinct subspecies of lion, but research now shows it\u2019s genetically similar to Asiatic lions.\nThe Barbary lion was largely hunted to extinction in the 19th century. The last documented sighting was in Algeria\u2019s Atlas Mountains in 1942 (although, skins were found on illegal markets into the 1980s, suggesting the Barbary lions may have survived longer), leaving the lion regionally extinct in North Africa. Today, Barbary lions aren\u2019t recognized as unique subspecies, but for much of the 20th century, they were believed to be.\nCape lion\nThe Cape lion used to live in South Africa and was defined by a darker mane than many other lion populations. Today, the Cape Lion is recognized as a subpopulation rather than a different species or subspecies. There have been no lions found in the Cape lion\u2019s range since 1858.\nCave lion (Panthera leo spelaea)\nThe Cave lion was a species of lion that stretched across Eurasia and into Alaska and went extinct with the collapse of the mammoth steppe about 12,000 years ago. The species lived across all of continental Europe and many archeological drawings of lions from that area depict cave lions. The species was larger than today\u2019s surviving lions. In recent years, a number of frozen cave lion cubs have been discovered in Russia\u2019s permafrost.\nAmerican lion (Panthera leo atrox)\nAnother lion species that disappeared roughly 12,000 years ago during a period of global climate change, the America lion\u2019s ranged stretched across most of the modern-day United States and Mexico. The American lion is notable for being the largest lion species. Its habitat was similar to today\u2019s African lion, with it hunting across large grasslands on large mammals like bison, deer, and even mammoths.\nLion Behaviour and Lifestyle\nLions are unique among cats as they live together in strong social groups. A pride is made up of 5-15 related females and their cubs along with a generally single male (small groups of 2 or 3 though are not uncommon). Male Lions patrol a territory of around 100m\u00b2 marking trees and rocks with urine and roaring to warn off intruders. Although male Lions can defend their pride to great effect, their position in the pride is constantly under threat from other males who try to take over their patch and if successful, they will kill any cubs that were sired by the previous male. Despite their enormous size, male Lions actually do hardly any of the hunting as they are often slower and more easily seen than their female counterparts. The Lionesses in the pride hunt together meaning that they are not only more successful on their trips, but they are also able to catch and kill animals that are both faster than them and much bigger.\nLion Roar\nLion roars can be extremely loud, reaching about 114 decibels in volume. Their roar is loud enough to breach the pain threshold of human hearing! Lion roars are louder than any big cat, and can be heard from a distance of about 5 miles away (8 km). The ability to roar at such a high volume is due to unique adaptations in the lion\u2019s vocal folds. Lions generally roar as a warning and to defend their territories. Beyond warning off males, lion roars also allow members of the pride to find one another as its sound can travel such long distances.\nLion Reproduction, Cubs, and Lifespan\nBoth male and female lions are able to reproduce between the ages of two and three but despite this, they will often not breed until the pride has been firmly established. After a gestation period that lasts for nearly four months, female lions give birth to between one and six cubs that are born blind and are incredibly vulnerable in their new surroundings. The fur of lion cubs is covered in darker spots that help to camouflage them into their den to protect them whilst the adults have gone out to hunt.\nSadly, however, less than half of cubs make it to be a year old and four out of five have died by the time they are two, generally either from animal attacks or starvation. Remarkably though, the female lions in the pride will have their cubs at around the same time and will help to suckle and care for the cubs of other females. Lion cubs suckle on milk until they are about six months old and although they won\u2019t begin actively hunting until they are about a year old, lion cubs start to eat meat after 12 weeks or so.\nLike most big cats, lions live about 10 to 15 years. In captivity, lions have lived quite a bit longer than in the wild. In 2016, the Philadelphia Zoo was had to euthanize a 25-year old female lion after it began suffering from limited mobility.\nLion Diet and Prey\nThe Lion is a large and carnivorous animal that survives only by eating other animals in order to sustain itself. Lions eat a diet that consists of buffalo, wildebeests, and even giraffes. Depending on the abundance and variety of prey species within their territory, Lions primarily catch gazelle, zebra, and warthog along with a number of antelope species by following the herds across the open grasslands. They will not turn their noses up though at hunting alone should the situation arise and will happily steal the kill of another animal. Once the animal has been caught though, circumstances change as the females will allow the male Lion to eat first before indulging themselves. The cubs however are at the bottom of the pile and have to be content with what remains once the adults have finished.\nUnlike other felines, lions are not solitary hunters but instead, the lionesses work together in order to chase down and catch their prey with each female having a different strategic role. This strategy allows them to kill animals that are both faster and much larger than they are. A study of 1,300 lion hunts found that when hunting individually, their success rate on hunts was 17-19%. However, when hunting in groups, success rates jumped to 30%.\nOn average, lions eat about 17 to 20 lbs (8 to 9 kg) of meat per day. Males can about 100 pounds in a day (43 kg), while females can eat 55 pounds (25 kg).\nFor a complete analysis of the diet of lions, make sure to read \u2018What Do Lions Eat? 15 Foods They Hunt.\u2018\nLion Predators and Threats\nThe lion is the most dominant predator within its environment meaning that other animals pose little or no threat to them, with the exception of hyena packs that can cause fatal damages to lions particularly when they are on their own and food is about. Lions are seen as a great threat by many other species including both giraffes and elephants which are easily capable of fatally injuring a lion to try and warn it off.\nMore than other species, the significant threat to lions is other lions. In South Africa\u2019s Sabi Sands a group of male lions formed a coalition that\u2019s believed to have killed more than 100 lions across a territory that eventually ranged across 170,000 acres. Male lions will often kill one another while attempting to seize control of prides, and then will also kill cubs of prides to ensure a gene pool that\u2019s not theirs is passed on.\nLion numbers have also been severely affected by diseases passed through hyenas from wild dogs, with more than 1,000 lions having died from canine distemper between 1993 and 1997.\nLion Relationship with Humans\nHowever, the biggest threat to Lions is people who not only kill them out of fear (and historically as trophies) and the encroachment of agriculture and cities. Lions have been admired and feared by people for centuries, but due to both hunting and growing human settlements, lions have been wiped out from a vast portion of their historical natural range.\nAlthough they do not naturally see people as prey, African Lions have been known to sneak into villages (sometimes of great size) to find food, and are known to attack up to 700 people every year, with Lions being responsible for 100 human fatalities annually in Tanzania alone. In 1898, two Lions in Kenya (known as Tsavo lions \u2013 a pair of mane-less Lion) became famous for killing and eating over 130 rail-road workers over a period of around 9 months.\n3 more lion facts\nRemember to read our full lion facts page to get a full list of the most incredible facts on this remarkable species. You\u2019ll find facts like:\nYoung lions practice role playing!\nYoung Lion cubs spend a great deal of time playing together which actually helps them to develop their hunting techniques. This method of role-playing in cubs also helps females to determine whether or not they would be suited better to chasing and cornering prey, or catching and killing it.\nLions have small hearts and lungs and must rely on stealth and teamwork\nThe Lion has large paws with soft pads underneath and sharp retractable claws on the end of each toe which aid them in running, climbing and catching their prey along with also being good defense mechanisms. The structure of their feet and legs means that they are also able to jump distances over 10 meters. Lion hearts weigh about 1,175 grams, which in relation to their body size is significantly smaller than many of the herbivores they hunt. Their heart and lung size means lions can only exert themselves for small distances and must rely on teamwork and sneaking up close to prey before beginning their hunt.\nThe world\u2019s most famous lion survived a plane crash\nOne of the most famous depictions of a lion is the roaring lion at the start of film\u2019s from MGM studios. To raise publicity for this lion, in 1927 MGM flew their mascot across the country, but in a flight from San Diego to New York the plane crashed.

They average about 20 inches at the shoulder and range from 20 to 40 pounds, with males being quite a bit larger than females.\nThe caracal is also known as the Persian lynx and the gazelle cat.\nThe most distinctive caracal characteristics are the long tufts of black hair on the tips of the ears.\nThe actual function of these tufts is not known, although some speculate they may keep insects or sunshine out of the eyes, or even be used to communicate with other caracals.\nCaracals are typically solid colored reddish tan with a lighter underbelly and white \"eyeliner\" that sets off their beautiful features. Black eyebrow markings complete the picture.\nJust as there are solid black leopards and jaguars, caracals can also be found in solid black. Black caracals are very rare, and may occur side by side in the same litter as normally colored caracals.\nThey are powerfully built, with long, sturdy legs that act like springs, allowing them to leap straight up and snatch Birds right out of the air.\nThe hind legs are longer than the fronts, and the topline slopes slightly from the hips to the shoulders..\nThe tail is bobbed at about a 3/4 length, but is well-muscled and used as a rudder in the air.\nAlong with birds, caracals eat an assortment of small animals, rodents, rabbits, reptiles and occasionally large insects.\nThey have also been known to take down prey much larger than themselves, including small antelope and goats.\nThe caracal is a solitary animal, active mostly at night. Their nocturnal tendency make them a rare sight, and their cunning and agility make them highly proficient hunters.\nThey mark their large territories with urine and claw marks, and though they may not run into eachother, they keep track of, and know the scent of the other caracals in the area.\nDuring the breeding season they will pair off for a day or two to mate, but once impregnated the female drives the male away.\nShe may use an abandoned burrow or cave as a den, but usually just finds a secluded area of thick underbrush next to a rock or tree, where she will have 2 to 4 kittens.\nCaracal kittens are born with their eyes closed and their ears curled up. It takes a full three weeks for the characteristic ears to unfurl.\nThe caracal was a prized creature in ancient Egypt, but was particularly prominent in ancient Chinese culture.\nThey were tamed, kept on jeweled collars and leashes, and given as gifts to guests and nobility.\nTheir hunting and leaping skills were put on display in competitions where several caracals were released into a flock of pigeons.\nWagers were taken as to which cat would snag the most hapless birds.\nToday, the caracal is occasionally kept as a pet, but they have never been domesticated and owning one requires alot of dedication and preparation.\nThey are, big, powerful animals with a strong prey drive and the desire to roam which can make them destructive and frustrated in the wrong environment.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Zebra Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Zebra-facts.html", "text": "zebra Facts\nA glorious fixture of the African landscape, the zebra is a very flashy member of the normally mousy-colored horse family. Sporting a robust body of bold stripes, the zebra spends its busy life on the move seeking the best grazing in the mostly dusty world of the African savanna.\nBecause its skin is dark, many experts suggest that the zebra is a black (sometimes brown) furred animal with white stripes, while others will argue that the zebra has black stripes on a white field, pointing out the animals white undersides.\nNo matter, the effect is dazzling, and provides this gregarious herd animal with a confusing defense of fluctuating dark and light motion. When a group of zebras rumbles passed a lion, leopard or cheetah, it is virtually impossible for the predator to pick out just one individual target. For the zebra, as is the case with many herd animals, there is great security in numbers.\nThere are 3 main species of zebra. The most familiar are the plains zebras of which there are 5 subspecies each with slight variations in not only stripe pattern but color as well, some being decidedly brown instead of black. Of these, the Grant's, a hearty animal true, bold black and white stripes that grow wider as they reach the rump, is the classic zebra in type.\nAlthough there are some more populous sub-species, and interbreeding occurs, the Grants remains one of the most iconic sights on the African plains. The mountain zebras consist of 2 subspecies most easily distinguished by the fishbone pattern across the top of the rump. Mountain zebras also have a dewlap - a flap of loose skin at the throat, the function of which is unclear.\nFinally, the Grevy's zebra is in its own sub genus and is more donkey-like. It has thinner more numerous, and closely spaced stripes, often brown in color.\nAll the zebra species are herd animals, highly social and dependent on the camouflaging effect of a mass of striped bodies for survival. Constantly moving, always alert for danger, zebras have surprisingly good eyesight, and it is believed that, despite being monochrome themselves, they actually see the world around them in full color. - Zebra Facts\nWhy does a zebra have stripes?\nEven at the edge of a watering hole there is danger, but zebras love a crowd. The herd instinct draws them together, the exquisite skin often keeps them in one piece in more ways than one.\nImagine a crouching lion or hidden crocodile trying to select just one target in a dazzling sea of stripes. For well-camouflaged animals such as the zebra, it is more often movement and not the outline of a form that attracts the predator to an individual. A stilted gait, the bobbing head that comes with a lame leg, a stumble, a hesitation, the curtain of healthy companions rush away and the target is revealed.\nBut despite being every bodies favorite meal, the plains zebra is an extraordinarily successful animal, and though nature channels are rife with scenes of tragic endings, the majority of zebras lead long lives of 15 to 20 years. Even with territories dwindling as human-kind encroaches, the plains zebra herds are over 3/4 of a million animals strong. - Zebra Facts\nzebra reproduction\nZebra mothers and foals\nThe very social zebra requires the safety and comfort of a herd to survive. Two types of zebra herds exist, one being made up of a \"harem\" of females and their foals escorted by 1 stallion, the other being a \"bachelor herd\" of males who are either too young, too old, or too timid to gather a harem of their own.\nStallions are males at least 5 years of age who have fought with other males for the right to accompany and mate with the females in the harem. The females have a hierarchy and will often walk in line in the order in which they joined the group.\nThe senior mare will make most of the decisions for the herd, leading them to pastures and watering holes. The stallion will bring up the rear or patrol the flanks on the lookout for predators and other males who might steal his mares away.\nPregnancy lasts for a year and the newborn struggles to its feet in a matter of minutes. The skull of a newborn zebra is less than 1/2 the length of its mothers, but the babies legs are 95% the length of hers.\nSpeed really matters in the perilous world of a baby zebra and within moments of birth the infant is on its feet and ready to run, keeping to the center of the herd as much as possible and dodging the large hungry jaws of cheetahs, hyenas, lions and crocodiles on a daily basis. The mother does the parenting and will nurse the foal for up to 18 months.\nYoung males will leave the herd at between 1 and 2 years of age to join a herd of bachelors. Likewise, young females will leave when they come into their first estrus joining with a new dominant male who has chased away all suitors.\nBecause both the males and the females leave their original herd, the harems that are formed are actually groups of unrelated females who form strong bonds and live together as a family, usually their entire adult lives. - Zebra Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

When a bachelor herd approaches a \"super herd\" the stallions greet them as a unit and work together to fight them off.\nWhen the battles are over the stallions will return to their own harems. Within the \"super herd\" the harem structure remains intact with each mare remaining devoted to only her stallion, and each stallion keeping to his own mares. - Zebra Facts\nzebra identification guide - a tale of some tushies\nLook to the rear when trying to identify a zebra species or subspecies.\nOur first example is the broad black stripes of the famous Grant's zebra (the rare Selous zebra is similar).\nSecond: The 2-toned \"shadow\" stripes, and sometimes stripe- less legs of the Burchell's. (the Chapman's and Crawshay's zebras are similar)\nThird: The Grevy's has narrow, close-set, often brown lines, a prominent dorsal stripe with white outline and plush dark dorsal hair. The stripes do not go under the belly.\nFourth: The \"fish bone\", or \"gridiron\" pattern across the top of the rump of the mountain zebra. The mountain zebra tends to have the biggest variation in stripe width across the body (see small inset photo) with narrow, close-set stripes on the ribs changing abruptly to broad, wide-set stripes on the sides of the buttocks. Stripes do not go under the belly. Without a top view you can usually still identify the mountain zebra from the side- look for the tips of the fish bones! -Zebra Fact\nwhich zebra is this?\nSo which zebra species is the mother/son duo in the photo to the left? Yes! - A Grevy's zebra mare and foal.\ngrant's zebra\nBeefy build, thick neck, big, broad, black stripes it is the Grant's zebra. A mother and baby Grant's zebra in glorious black and white! Just look at the length of that foals legs - baby you were born to run!.\nBurchell's zebra\nIf the zebra has the Grant's sturdy build, but thinner two-toned stripes it is one of three subspecies. The Burchell's zebra, the Chapman's zebra and the Crawshay's zebras occasionally inter-breed and make positive identification tricky, but of the three, the Burchell's is the most common. In fact, the Burchell's is the most populous of all the zebra species. This is most likely a Burchell's zebra mare and foal. - Zebra Facts!\na few more zebra facts\nContrary to some claims, zebras, like all other equines, identify each other by smell and vocalization, not by their stripes.\nThe zebras stripes make it more difficult for predators to target one individual out of the herd.\nAlbino zebras occasionally occur in the wild. Often called \"golden zebras\" they are not true albinos, but have pale tan or golden stripes and light brown or even blue eyes."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Anatomy of a Giraffe - Animals | HowStuffWorks", "url": "https://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/giraffe-neck1.htm", "text": "\" \" HowStuffWorks 2008\nCertain characteristics of giraffe necks give them a flexibility rivaling any Slinky. The first feature is the way that the vertebrae in the neck, called the cervical vertebrae, are joined together. Remember that giraffes have seven of these bones, just like we do. However, giraffe cervical vertebrae are bound together with ball-and-socket joints [source: Owen]. These are the kinds of joints that link your arm with your shoulder and offer a 360-degree range of motion. Also, the joint between its neck and skull permits the giraffe to extend its head almost completely perpendicular to the ground.\nMoving down to where the neck meets the back, we find the second important anatomical feature for the giraffe's slinkiness. We call the vertebrae in the top portion of our backs the thoracic vertebrae. In humans, thoracic vertebrae are joined at the middle of the bone to provide added stability; and our cervical vertebrae fuse at the front and back for more mobility. Giraffe anatomy doesn't follow this same construction, and its first and second thoracic vertebrae are bound in the same way that its cervical ones are, with ball-and-socket joints [source: Dagg and Foster]. That adaptation gives the giraffe an extra point of flexibility. It also accounts for the giraffe's signature hump [source: Encarta].\nAdvertisement\nThis highly flexible, yet heavy, body part is integral to the gangly animal's movement. Watch a giraffe and you'll notice that the neck moves back and forth with its stride. That's because the weight and motion of the neck guides the giraffe's center of gravity [source: Dagg and Foster]. The animal also tosses its neck to and fro to help it rise to a standing position on its spindly legs. You can compare this to when we swing our arms up over our head to pull us out of bed in the morning.\nAs another result of the long neck, a giraffe's blood has a long journey to travel. For that reason, the anatomy of a giraffe is quite amazing. The animal has a specialized cardiovascular system that keeps blood moving adequately to the brain and heart when it moves its neck and head around, ensuring that bending down to take a sip of water won't cause a possibly lethal head rush [source: Dagg and Foster]. Giraffes' blood vessels are equipped with valves that prevent blood from backtracking due to gravity [source: Wood and Johansen]. They also have a higher concentration of red blood cells, larger hearts and tighter skin, especially around their legs, which help circulate blood better [source: Dagg and Foster].\nKeeping everything chugging along, the giraffe also breathes at a relatively slow rate. Its enlarged lungs compensate for the trachea's extensive length, as the air travels up that long highway of a neck.\nRelated HowStuffWorks Articles\nMore Great Links\nSources"}

Fortunately, a giraffe\u2019s tongue has thickened papillae, which helps to protect it from these vicious thorns. Additionally, thick saliva is also believed to help protect giraffe\u2019s tongue and mouth against the defensive mechanisms of their favourite food.\nThe colour of the tongue is best described as black, blue or purple with a pink base/back. It is generally assumed that the front part of the tongue has such dark coloration to protect it during frequent sun exposure while eating and prevent the tongue from getting sunburned, however, no one really knows."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Heads up! The cardiovascular secrets of giraffes", "url": "https://knowablemagazine.org/article/living-world/2021/heads-up-cardiovascular-secrets-giraffes", "text": "To most people, giraffes are merely adorable, long-necked animals that rank near the top of a zoo visit or a photo-safari bucket list. But to a cardiovascular physiologist, there\u2019s even more to love. Giraffes, it turns out, have solved a problem that kills millions of people every year: high blood pressure. Their solutions, only partly understood by scientists so far, involve pressurized organs, altered heart rhythms, blood storage \u2014 and the biological equivalent of support stockings.\nGiraffes have sky-high blood pressure because of their sky-high heads that, in adults, rise about six meters above the ground \u2014 a long, long way for a heart to pump blood against gravity. To have a blood pressure of 110/70 at the brain \u2014 about normal for a large mammal \u2014 giraffes need a blood pressure at the heart of about 220/180. It doesn\u2019t faze the giraffes, but a pressure like that would cause all sorts of problems for people, from heart failure to kidney failure to swollen ankles and legs.\nIn people, chronic high blood pressure causes a thickening of the heart muscles. The left ventricle of the heart becomes stiffer and less able to fill again after each stroke, leading to a disease known as diastolic heart failure, characterized by fatigue, shortness of breath and reduced ability to exercise. This type of heart failure is responsible for nearly half of the 6.2 million heart failure cases in the US today.\nWhen cardiologist and evolutionary biologist Barbara Natterson-Horowitz of Harvard and UCLA examined giraffes\u2019 hearts, she and her student found that their left ventricles did get thicker, but without the stiffening, or fibrosis, that would occur in people. The researchers also found that giraffes have mutations in five genes related to fibrosis. In keeping with that find, other researchers who examined the giraffe genome in 2016 found several giraffe-specific gene variants related to cardiovascular development and maintenance of blood pressure and circulation. And in March 2021, another research group reported giraffe-specific variants in genes involved in fibrosis.\nAnd the giraffe has another trick to avoid heart failure: The electrical rhythm of its heart differs from that of other mammals so that the ventricular-filling phase of the heartbeat is extended, Natterson-Horowitz found. (Neither of her studies has been published yet.) This allows the heart to pump more blood with each stroke, allowing a giraffe to run hard despite its thicker heart muscle. \u201cAll you have to do is look at a picture of a fleeing giraffe,\u201d Natterson-Horowitz says, \u201cand you realize that the giraffe has solved the problem.\u201d\nCREDIT: C. AALKJ\u00c6R & T. WANG / AR PHYSIOLOGY 2021\nNatterson-Horowitz is now turning her attention to another problem that giraffes seem to have solved: high blood pressure during pregnancy, a condition known as preeclampsia. In people, this can lead to severe complications that include liver damage, kidney failure and detachment of the placenta. Yet giraffes seem to fare just fine. Natterson-Horowitz and her team are hoping to study the placentas of pregnant giraffes to see if they have unique adaptations that allow this.\nPeople who suffer from hypertension are also prone to annoying swelling in their legs and ankles because the high pressure forces water out of blood vessels and into the tissue. But you only have to look at the slender legs of a giraffe to know that they\u2019ve solved that problem, too. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we see giraffes with swollen legs? How are they protected against the enormous pressure down there?\u201d asks Christian Aalkj\u00e6r, a cardiovascular physiologist at Aarhus University in Denmark who wrote about giraffes\u2019 adaptations to high blood pressure in the 2021 Annual Review of Physiology.\nStay in the Know\nSign up for the Knowable newsletter today\nIn part, at least, giraffes minimize swelling with the same trick that nurses use on their patients: support stockings. In people, these are tight, elastic leggings that compress the leg tissues and prevent fluid from accumulating. Giraffes accomplish the same thing with a tight wrapping of dense connective tissue. Aalkj\u00e6r\u2019s team tested the effect of this by injecting a small amount of saline solution beneath the wrapping into the legs of four giraffes that had been anesthetized for other reasons. Successful injection required much more pressure in the lower leg than a comparable injection in the neck, the team found, indicating that the wrapping helped resist leakage.\nGiraffes also have thick-walled arteries near their knees that might act as flow restrictors, Aalkj\u00e6r and others have found. This could lower the blood pressure in the lower legs, much as a kink in a garden hose causes water pressure to drop beyond the kink. It remains unclear, however, whether giraffes open and close the arteries to regulate lower-leg pressure as needed. \u201cIt would be fun to imagine that when the giraffe is standing still out there, it\u2019s closing off that sphincter just beneath the knee,\u201d says Aalkj\u00e6r. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know.\u201d\nCREDIT: E. BR\u00d8NDUM ET AL / AMERICAN PHYSIOLOGICAL SOCIETY 2009\nAalkj\u00e6r has one more question about these remarkable animals. When a giraffe raises its head after bending down for a drink, blood pressure to the brain should drop precipitately \u2014 a more severe version of the dizziness that many people experience when they stand up suddenly. Why don\u2019t giraffes faint?\nAt least part of the answer seems to be that giraffes can buffer these sudden changes in blood pressure. In anesthetized giraffes whose heads could be raised and lowered with ropes and pulleys, Aalkj\u00e6r has found that blood pools in the big veins of the neck when the head is down. This stores more than a liter of blood, temporarily reducing the amount of blood returning to the heart. With less blood available, the heart generates less pressure with each beat while the head\u2019s down. As the head is raised again, the stored blood rushes suddenly back to the heart, which responds with a vigorous, high-pressure stroke that helps pump blood up to the brain.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether this is what happens in awake, freely moving animals, though Aalkj\u00e6r\u2019s team has recently recorded blood pressure and flow from sensors implanted in free-moving giraffes and he hopes to have an answer soon.\nSo \u2014 can we learn medical lessons from giraffes? None of the insights have yet yielded a specific clinical therapy. But that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t, says Natterson-Horowitz. Even though some of the adaptations are probably not relevant for hypertension in humans, they may help biomedical scientists think about the problem in new ways and find novel approaches to this far-too-common disease."}

Here I talk about what sounds giraffes make. From bleats, mews, coughs, grunts and snores from senior giraffes, and even hisses from young giraffes, giraffes make a diverse array of noises to communicate. They even make infra-sound whooshes that are hard for people to hear.\nThe Sound a Giraffe Makes Is an Animal Mystery\nAlthough it isn't really a mystery, the question \"what sound does a giraffe make?\" has been a bit of a puzzle to animal behavior researchers. Is it sound or is it sounds? How many different sounds do giraffes make? Do they have a vocabulary? How do they communicate? Somebody has to know.\nNow, with audio evidence from researchers and first-hand knowledge from zookeepers and giraffe managers, we can finally attempt to answer that question.\nDo giraffes make sounds? This giraffe does. Pixabay CC\nMature Giraffe Sounds vs. Young Giraffe Sounds\nAll giraffes have vocal cords and make sound, but what sounds do they make? And what do those sounds mean? That depends on the age of the giraffe.\nElder Giraffe Sounds\nEmpirical and anecdotal evidence from zookeepers and giraffe managers supports that mature giraffes primarily snort and grunt, but a recent eight-year-long, three-zoo study recorded over 940 hours of a third sound\u2014humming\u2014heard only at night.\nSometimes jokingly referred to as being similar to a husband's snore, this sound was described by a Wired article as being at the low-end level of human hearing at a frequency of about 92Hz. This borders the frequencies often referred to as infra-sound. Check out the audio recording below!\nRecorded evidence suggests that as they mature, their vocabulary begins to consist primarily of infra-sound \"whooshes\" of air, or that nighttime \"humming\" discovered by researchers.\nYoung Giraffe Sounds\nHowever, young giraffes are a different matter. That same data collected from zookeepers attributes as many as 12 different sounds to young giraffes.\nYoung giraffes make all types of sounds, including grunts, moans, snores, bellows, snorts, coughs, bleats, mews, hissing, whistle-like cries, and flute-like sounds.\nDocumented Sounds Giraffes Make\nSound Used by: Meaning Snorts and Grunts Male/Female Danger/Alarm Snores and Hisses Male Fighting/Confrontations (sometimes used as danger alarm signal) Moans and Grunts Male Fighting/Confrontations Loud coughs Male Sexual courting Bellows and Whistles Female Female communication with young Hissing Female Scolding/correcting young Bleats and Mews Young male and female Used by young giraffes indicating alarm, fear, or wants\nSo What Is This \"Humming\" Sound Giraffes Make?\nA study published by BMC Research Notes found that giraffes primarily use infra-sound to communicate.\nThe study did not address the empirical research that has concluded that it is the young giraffes that make the most sounds humans can hear. Nor could they positively conclude that mature adult giraffe sounds are more limited in the sounds they make.\nAlong with that research came this sound clip from BMC.\nSo far, this gentle giraffe humming has only been heard and recorded at night.\nZoo managers and giraffe keepers say they had never heard this humming until the researchers played the audio recordings, so they can't be certain it isn't just a version of giraffe snoring!\nWhat's up With Giraffe Snorts and Grunts?\nGiraffes will communicate alarm or danger by stamping their feet and emitting loud snorts or grunts.\nOccasionally they will use snoring and hissing sounds, but these are usually only heard during fights. Yes, male giraffes do fight, and yes, it is usually over mating.\nA group of giraffes exhibiting the alarm soun hesborn king'asia CC\nWhat Does It Mean When a Giraffe Bellows, Whistles, Bleats or Mews\nLike mothers and their children everywhere, mama giraffes have a special set of sounds they use just with their offspring.\nThey use loud bellows when searching for the kid(s) which can be heard as much as a mile away, and whistling or flute-like sounds for other communications, like calling them home.\nAnd if the kid needs a scolding? That's another time giraffe hissing is heard.\nYoung giraffes generally only mew or bleat when they are under a year old.\nSnorts, Grunts, Hisses: The \"Aggressive\" Giraffe Noises\nIt seems male giraffes are the fighters of the family. Although there are territorial fights and disputes, the most common cause for male-to-male fights and confrontations are over dominance in mating issues.\nGiraffe fighting sounds are loud snorts and moans, with grunts thrown in, (using a \"danger\" sound), to intimidate the other male.\nThe following video shows aggressive male behavior that ends in the defeat of one of the males. The giraffes in this scene are shown \"swinging\" their heads at each other.\nSo When a Giraffe Makes a Raucous Cough, What Does That Mean?\nLove is in the air, and so are raucous coughs emanating from a six-foot throat.\nGiraffes use loud coughs to court the females they want to mate with. The louder, and more raucous the cough, the more ardent the desire. And of course, the bigger the male, the bigger the throat, and the more deep and impressive the resonating coughs.\nIt might not sound like \"whispering sweet nothings\" to us, but to female giraffes, those coughs are a real turn-on.\nMAle and female giraffe courting sounds Pixabay CC Composite Image\nWhere Do Giraffes Live?\nThe world's population of wild giraffes are on the African continent, in its deserts, savannas, and grasslands.\nThere are some forested giraffe habitats in Kenya, but these are the exception rather than the rule.\nGiraffe Facts for Kids and Adults\nThe scientific name for giraffes is Giraffa camelopardalis, of the family Giraffidae.\nGiraffe's necks are approximately six feet long and can weigh up to 600 pounds.\nGiraffes have the same number of neck vertebra as humans; seven.\nMale giraffes can grow up to 18 feet tall and weigh 3,000 pounds.\nNewborns are approximately six feet tall when born.\nA giraffe's tongue can be 18 to 20 inches long.\nGiraffes only live for 15 to 25 years in the wild.\nGiraffes can run almost 35 mph for a brief time.\nA giraffe's heart can be up to two feet long and weigh 25 pounds.\nGiraffes have muscles in their arterial vascular system that act like \"check valves\" that keep them from getting dizzy or blacking out when they raise or lower their heads, which could be a distance of 15 to 20 feet.\nA giraffe's feet are cloven but shaped like a dinner plate and up to 12 inches across.\nA giraffe's tongue is usually black, or blackish blue.\nOne More Giraffe Trivia Fact!\nMother giraffes give birth standing up, which means a newborn's introduction to the world is a six-foot drop to the ground!\nBut they are usually up and walking in minutes.\n(Mom carries the baby for 14 to 15 months)\nSources\nBaotic, A., Sicks, F. & Stoeger, A.S.

Twelve hours later rangers reported hearing gunshots, and they later discovered three bullet-riddled giraffe carcasses rotting in the sun. \u201cIt was horrible for me and the team,\u201d Hamlin says\u2014\u201dthe crushing realization that most likely it was these guys, the ones we\u2019d seen.\u201d\nHamlin decided to document the aftermath of the tragedy (watch the video above) to raise awareness about poaching in the park, which is managed by the nonprofit organization African Parks in association with the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature, a government agency.\nGaramba is Africa\u2019s second oldest national park and has been hit hard by poaching in recent years as civil unrest has escalated in the region. Its rhinos have been wiped out, and elephants have suffered huge losses. The same goes for its Kordofan giraffes, one of Africa\u2019s nine giraffe subspecies.\nPlease be respectful of copyright.

Meanwhile men from neighboring South Sudan target the giraffes for their meat to feed impoverished villagers. But the massive bodies (giraffes can grow to 18 feet and weigh up to 3,000 pounds) of the three giraffes were intact\u2014only the ends of their tails were missing.\nAccording to Leon Lamprecht, joint operations director for African Parks, men \u201cuse the tail as a dowry to the bride\u2019s father if they want to ask for the hand of a bride.\u201d The long black hairs are often turned into fly whisks.\nOne of the dead giraffes had a satellite collar and was being monitored by Garamba\u2019s rangers. \u201cWhat an absolute waste,\u201d Lamprecht says.\n3:33\nThis story was produced by National Geographic\u2019s Special Investigations Unit, which focuses on wildlife crime and is made possible by grants from the BAND Foundation and the Woodtiger Fund.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Serval | San Diego Zoo Animals & Plants", "url": "https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/serval", "text": "Grassy home: Servals live near thickly planted streams and rivers in the savannas of central and southern Africa. Unlike many other cats, these small felines love to climb, leap, and play in water. They are crepuscular to avoid the heat of the day, although they do hunt at night when needed. Servals often share their savanna habitat with caracals and may compete with them for prey. Leopards, wild dogs, and hyenas are serval predators. If needed, a serval can climb a tree to escape.\nServals are perhaps the best hunters in the cat world. While other wild cats are successful in just one of every five or six attempts to kill prey, servals make a kill in about half of all tries.\n\"Wait and see\" is the serval's main hunting strategy. A hungry cat waits in the tall grass at dawn or dusk, using its huge ears to listen for approaching prey before pouncing on its meal. Instead of chasing down a target like a cheetah would, the serval takes a giant leap up into the air and then forces its body weight down upon the victim, trapping it beneath the front paws until the cat can deliver a deadly bite to the neck. This method is efficient and quick.\nThe serval has a varied diet, eating birds, reptiles, frogs, crabs, and large insects. Standing on its hind legs, a serval can jump more than 9 feet (2.7 meters) straight up to grab a bird right out of the air! But small rodents are its most frequent prey item, and a serval doesn\u2019t hesitate to reach a long leg down into a rodent's burrow to snatch a meal out of the tunnel! Ultrasonic hearing ability allows the serval to hear the high-pitched communication of rodents. The cat\u2019s long, curved claws can also hook fish and frogs right out of the water.\nWith its many hunting styles, varied diet, and fantastic hearing, the serval is well equipped to be the most successful predator of all the cats.\nAt the San Diego Zoo and San Diego Zoo Safari Park, servals are fed a ground-meat diet made for zoo carnivores, with a few small items for variety throughout the week (a mouse here and there, a couple of fish, a bone twice a week to keep the teeth clean)."}

Here's our list of the animals with the most prolonged gestation periods.\nHuman mothers have a relatively long gestation period compared to the rest of the animal kingdom, but a few animal mothers go even further.\n1 of 12 Elephants john michael evan potter / Shutterstock Elephants have the longest gestation period of all mammals, carrying their young for 18 to 22 months before giving birth. Long developmental periods are common among highly intelligent animals. Since elephants are the largest living and biggest-brained land animals in the world, there's a lot of development for elephants to do in the womb. 13 Fascinating Facts About Elephants\n2 of 12 Manatees Liquid Productions, LLC / Shutterstock You might not know if a portly manatee is pregnant simply by looking at the animal, but this gentle giant carries its young for nearly 13 months. Lounging around in the water all day helps to relieve some of the extra weight, but a manatee mother is still owed plenty of respect for her patience. 10 Manatee Facts You Didn't Know\n3 of 12 Camels irabel8 / Shutterstock Camels are known for their stubborn and crabbish personalities, but consider this: camels have a gestation period of 13 to 15 months. The month in which conception occurred can shift the birthdate, with November conceptions pushing the birth 18 days longer than a May conception. Other camelids, such as llamas, also have a long gestation period\u2014about 330 days (11 months). 8 Fascinating Facts About Camels\n4 of 12 Giraffes Coldimages / Getty Images Giraffes have gestation periods anywhere from 400 to 460 days (13-15 months). Despite being the tallest land animal in the world, the mother gives birth standing up\u2014so the baby needs to be big enough to brace for a long fall. (Interestingly, the fall is typically what bursts the embryonic sac.) With lions and other predators nearby, the world is a dangerous place for baby giraffes when they first come into the world\u2014part of the reason for the long delay. 11 Things You Might Not Know About Giraffes\n5 of 12 Velvet Worm Pedro Bernardo / Shutterstock Not all animals with long gestation periods are large mammals. There are some worm-like animals that bear live young, including the velvet worm. This bizarre-looking creature carries its young for as long as 15 months. Despite the name, they aren't true worms and they aren't made of velvet. Their bodies are covered with sensory hairs, which gives them a velvety appearance. They are considered close relatives of both arthropods (spiders and insects) and true worms (like the earthworm)\u2014making them especially interesting to paleontologists.\n6 of 12 Rhinoceros john michael evan potter / Shutterstock It might not come as a surprise that rhinos\u2014because of their sheer size\u2014are next on the list, with a gestation period of about 15 to 18 months, depending on the species. This long gestation period is also an obstacle to replenishing the population. All five species of rhinoceros are endangered or considered vulnerable, and three of the five are considered critically endangered.\n7 of 12 Walruses U.S. Geological Survey / Flickr / Public Domain Walruses have the longest gestation period of all pinnipeds (a group of mammals that includes seals and sea lions), carrying their young for as long as 15 to 16 months. Seal and sea lion mothers don't get off easy and carry their offspring for about 330 and 350 days, respectively. Walruses also have the lowest reproductive rate of any pinniped. 8 Facts About the Wonderful Walrus\n8 of 12 Whales and Dolphins Jan Daly / Shutterstock Whales and dolphins, grouped under the cetacean umbrella, are known for their high intelligence, complex societies, and peaceful personalities\u2014so it's no surprise that they also take a lot of care in developing their young. Although all species have different gestation periods, orcas have the longest period among dolphins at about 17 months. Some sperm whales\u2014the largest living predators\u2014have been known to carry their young for up to 19 months.\n9 of 12 Black Alpine Salamanders Thomas Huntke/ Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA 3.0 DE Black alpine salamanders are amphibians that live in the Central and Eastern Alps and give birth to live young. Their pregnancies can last from two to three years, depending on the altitude at which the salamanders live. They typically bear two fully developed young. This salamander's life expectancy has been estimated to last from 10 to even 20 years.\n10 of 12 Sharks VisionDive / Shutterstock Unlike most fish, sharks are K-selected reproducers\u2014meaning they produce a small number of well-developed young as opposed to a large number of poorly developed young. Pregnancy length can vary significantly by species. The spiny dogfish shark can carry young for about two years, while basking sharks can do so for as long as three years. The frilled shark can wait 3.5 years before giving birth.\n11 of 12 Tapirs Nick Fox / Shutterstock A tapir may appear to be a cross between a pig and an anteater, but it's actually most closely related to horses and rhinos and shares a similarly long gestation period. A tapir calf is born after 13 months in the womb. Newborns have special brown- and beige-striped markings that help camouflage them from predators, but the pattern fades after a few months when the young tapir becomes more mobile. 8 Surprising Facts About Tapirs"}

Its landscape comprises of savannah grasslands, mountainous highlands, the Great Rift Valley, and lake basins. The county has gained international fame for its diverse wildlife that comprises of large populations of the world\u2019s largest mammals. Most of the wildlife is found in its national parks and game reserves.\n10. African buffalo\nThe African buffalo (Cape buffalo) is one of the Big Five game animals in Kenya. The savanna subspecies is endemic to the mopane grasslands of Mount Kenya and Aberdare National Parks as well as the floodplains of the Maasai Mara. The Cape buffalo is identified by its gray-brown coat with the older bulls bearing white circles around their eyes and face. A distinct characteristic of these bulls is their enormous curved horns that almost meet over the forehead. The massive animal is usually hunted for trophy and game meat. It is also nicknamed as \u201cBlack Death\u2019\u2019 due to its aggressive nature. Nursing females and solitary males are reported to attack over 200 people annually.\n9. Crocodile\nThe African Nile crocodile predominant in Kenya is the largest freshwater predator in Africa. It is also one of the largest reptiles in the world growing up to 16 feet in length and weighing 1,650 pounds. The best place to catch a glimpse of this agile predator is at the Mara and Telek rivers during the wildebeest migration as they pounce on the animals crossing the rivers. They are also reared at the Mamba Village Resort in Nairobi and Mombasa. Nile crocodiles are opportunistic apex predators taking on any animal within their range. They are social animals known to share basking spots and large sources of food including carcasses. The aggressive vicious reptile has been reported to be a major source of human-wildlife conflict in Kenya responsible for hundreds of human deaths annually.\n8. Giraffe\nThe giraffe is the tallest living terrestrial animal iconic to Kenyan wildlife. It is identified by its extremely long neck and legs, distinctive coat pattern, and a horn-like ossicone. There are three subspecies of the giraffe found in Kenya namely: reticulated giraffe only found in Samburu National Park, Rothschild's giraffe endemic to Lake Nakuru National Park and Giraffe Centre, and the Maasai giraffe found in Tsavo, Amboseli, and Mara Game Reserves. Giraffes are browsers feeding mainly on the twigs of the Acacia tree. Occasionally, they have been spotted licking dried meat off the bones of carcasses. Giraffes are social animals that live in herds comprising of related females with their offspring, or unrelated adult males.\n7. Genet\nGenets are cat-like animals with long bodies, bushy ringed tails, retractile claws, large ears, and a pointed muzzle. The genet lives in the savannah woodlands of Maasai Mara, Amboseli, Tsavo, Samburu, and Mount Kenya National Parks in Kenya. It is mainly nocturnal hence seldom sighted. It spends its days sleeping in abandoned burrows, hollow trees, rock crevices, or up on high branches. The genet is a solitary forager that hunts at night, after which it returns to the same hideout each day. Its diet consists of small animals such as rodents, birds, fruits, reptiles, and insects. The animal is solitary, although families are found to share a territory demarcated using a substance secreted through the musk gland.\n6. Lesser kudu\nThe Lesser Kudu (Tragelaphus imberbis) is a forest antelope that inhabits the arid scrublands of Marsabit and Tsavo national parks in Kenya. It is distinguished from its close relative, the greater Kudu, by the lack of a beard, the presence of more pronounced vertical white stripes branching towards the sides, and two white patches underneath the neck. Lesser Kudus are browsers and predominantly feed on young shoots, twigs, and leaves. Kudus are shy creatures that spend much of their time hiding in the dense thicket and only come out to feed at dusk or dawn. Male kudus are timid and mainly solitary while the females are gregarious living in herds with their fawns.\n5. Wildebeest\nThe wildebeest, commonly known as gnu, is a member of the Bovidae family together with other even-toed horned ungulates. It is distinguished by its large, box-like head with curving horns. The blue wildebeest is found in Kenya where it inhabits the short grass savannah plains of Maasai Mara National Reserve. It is the most abundant big game species and groups with zebras as a strategy for minimizing predation. Being merely nomadic, the blue wildebeest performs the spectacular annual migration through the Mara River between July and October. The migration pattern is usually in response to rainfall variations in the Mara and Serengeti Game Reserves.\n4. Elephant\nThe African bush elephant is the largest living African mammal endemic to the savannahs and forests of Kenya. Elephants have distinctive features including a long tusk usually used for breathing and grasping objects. The second incisors of the upper jaw are modified to form two tusks that grow at about 7 inches in a year. Female elephants live in families where a family may comprise of one female and her offspring or several related females and their calves. Bulls leave the family upon reaching puberty and may live alone or join other male groups. IUCN has listed the African elephants as nearly threatened due to constant poaching its tusks for ivory. Elephants are found in abundance in Amboseli, Maasai Mara, Mount Kenya, and Aberdare National Parks.\n3. Lion\nThe African lion is a subspecies of the Panthera leo melanochaita population predominant in East Africa. It is the largest African cat inhabiting the savanna grasslands of Samburu, Maasai Mara, Tsavo, Meru, and Nairobi National Parks. Male lions are distinguished by a brown mane around the neck that gets darker with age. Female lions do not have a mane. Unlike other big cats that are solitary, African lions are social and live in prides of up to 20 members. Within the pride, lionesses do most of the hunting, where they approach their prey stealthily. Their hind legs are adapted for pouncing while the forelegs are grabbing and bringing down prey. Their main diet comprises of wildebeests, buffaloes, zebras, and antelopes.\n2. Hyena\nHyenas are feliform carnivoran animals inhabiting the woodland, savannah, grassland, and mountainous regions. The striped and spotted hyenas are the most common species found in Kenya. Spotted hyenas are predators and usually kill most of their prey while stripped hyenas are largely scavengers. Hyenas are mainly nocturnal but are frequently sighted during the day near lion and cheetah kills as they wait to scavenge. They are usually spotted sleeping in abandoned aardvark holes or in large burrows where they can dig up to one meter below the surface.\n1. Rhinoceros\nThe African black rhino is one of the Big Five game animals inhabiting the grasslands and open savannah in Kenya. Rhinos are characterized by the presence of one or two horns made of keratin and a fibrous protein on the upper part of their snout. White rhinos have a wide mouth adapted for grazing while black rhinos have a pointed upper lip adapted for browsing. The northern white Rhino, which was found in the country, was the only remaining male in the world but died in captivity at Ol Pajeta Conservancy. Rhinos have been classified under IUCN Red List as critically endangered species due to frequent poaching for ivory trade in Asia."}

A scent gland on each foot leaves behind a sticky, tar-like substance wherever they have walked, marking their territory. Okapis have a great sense of smell. By checking the ground, an okapi can tell if another okapi has been there. Males also mark their territory by urine spraying. Normally silent, female okapis vocalize only when they are ready to breed.\nOkapi newborns can stand up within 30 minutes of birth and nurse for the first time within an hour of birth. They have the same coloring as an adult but have a short fringe of hair along the spine, which generally disappears by the time they are 12 to 14 months old. Mothers hide their newborn calves in a safe, secluded spot, returning regularly to allow the calf to nurse. This helps keep predators from finding a hidden newborn until it has had a chance to grow and gain strength. An okapi calf starts trying solid food at just three weeks old. Calves triple their size by the end of their second month but do not reach full adult size until three years of age.\nOkapis are very shy. Their reddish brown-black coat camouflages them in the deep forest. In the thick trees and underbrush, okapis rely on their hearing to warn them of danger. Their huge ears pick up even the softest sounds coming from any direction. They listen for leopards, which hunt adult okapis, as well as smaller wild cats, which can attack a young calf.\nSan Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance conservation scientists discovered that okapis have a secret language. They watched okapis closely and recorded their sounds. They heard coughs, bleats, and whistles quite often, but it wasn\u2019t until they returned to the Sensory Ecology Lab to examine their recordings closely that they realized okapis also use other calls with very low frequencies. These calls are so low, in fact, that we humans cannot hear them at all! It\u2019s only when we look at recordings via specialized computer software that these infrasonic mutterings become visible.\nOur conservation scientists then recorded our okapis around the clock to find out why they use these low-pitched calls. One explanation is that these calls have evolved for communication between Mom and her baby while she\u2019s out foraging. In this situation, Mom can \u201ccheck in\u201d with her offspring without alerting potential predators of the fact that her baby is vulnerable. Predators remain unaware of these chats, as, like us, they cannot hear sounds so low in pitch. It\u2019s the okapi version of students who text message each other in class so that the teacher is unaware that they are \u201ctalking.\u201d"}

When the baby giraffe emerges, it drops to the ground. This fall can be about 6 feet, and it helps the giraffe's umbilical cord break. At birth, baby giraffes weigh in at about 100 to 150 pounds and are 6 feet tall.\nFor giraffes, the process of reproduction starts when a male giraffe drinks a female's urine to determine whether or not she is in heat."}

Much of this random knowledge gets lost in the ether, leaving us to speculate about things like dinosaur divorce rates or amphibian dance moves. But we still catch an awful lot, providing us with plenty of interesting\u2014if not always actionable\u2014facts about our fellow fauna.\nThe list below is a tribute to such trivia. From extinct penguins to newly identified wasps, these tidbits reflect the depth of our own species' curiosity about nature\u2014and our skill in shedding new light on it. As you peruse these facts, imagine all that went into discovering each one. We embrace their randomness here, but most hail from a robust body of knowledge about the animal in question.\nSo without further ado, here are 36 random animal facts that may interest you.\nAnatomy\nTreehugger / Russell McLendon\n1. Octopuses have three hearts. One pumps blood around the body, while the other two pump it to the gills. Oh, and that blood is blue, thanks to high copper levels!\n2. Owls don't have eyeballs. They have eye tubes.\n3. Polar bears have black skin. This helps it to absorb heat from the sun to stay warm in an Arctic climate, and it likely protects the bear from harmful UV rays.\n4. A human brain operates on about 15 watts.\nAbilities\nTreehugger / Russell McLendon\n5. Butterflies can taste with their feet, using something called chemoreceptors that help them to identify plants. Females select the correct leaf on which to lay eggs by \"drumming\" it with her feet to release juices.\n6. Animals with smaller bodies and faster metabolism see in slow motion.\n7. Dogs' sense of smell is about 100,000 times stronger than humans', but they have just one-sixth our number of taste buds.\n8. Reindeer eyeballs turn blue in winter to help them see at lower light levels. (They're golden-colored in summer.) No other mammals are known to have this ability.\n9. A single strand of spider silk is thinner than a human hair, but also five times stronger than steel of the same width. A rope just 2 inches thick could reportedly stop a Boeing 747.\nTreehugger / Russell McLendon\n10. The claws of a mantis shrimp can accelerate as quickly as a .22-caliber bullet. Scientists must keep them in thick plastic tanks because their punches can break glass.\n11. A sea lion is the first nonhuman mammal with a proven ability to keep a beat. A female sea lion named Ronan was trained to do it by scientists, who then showed she could transfer that skill to a song with a different beat that she had not heard before.\n12. Squirrels can't burp or vomit. Nor can any other rodent. This happens to be why rat poison is so effective; other mammals tend to expel any toxic substance they ingest.\n13. The extinct colossus penguin stood as tall as LeBron James.\n14. Honeybees can flap their wings 200 times every second.\nSurvival and Adaptation\n15. A type of \"immortal\" jellyfish is capable of cheating death indefinitely.\n16. Cats and horses are highly susceptible to black widow venom, but dogs are relatively resistant. Sheep and rabbits are apparently immune.\n17. Sharks kill fewer than 10 people per year. Humans kill about 100 million sharks per year. They should be much more scared of us than we are of them.\n18. Tardigrades are extremely durable microscopic animals that exist all over Earth. They can survive any of the following: 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 Celsius), -458 degrees F (-272 C), the vacuum of space, pressure six times stronger than the ocean floor and more than a decade without food.\nBehavior\nTreehugger / Russell McLendon\n19. Wild dolphins call each other by name. They let out a unique whistle to identify each other and will respond if they hear their own call played back.\n20. Young goats pick up accents from each other. This means they join humans, bats, and whales as mammals known to adjust their vocal sound to fit into a new social group.\n21. Humpback whale songs spread like \"cultural ripples from one population to another.\"\n22. Elephants have a specific alarm call that means \"human.\"\nTreehugger / Russell McLendon\n23. There's a place on Earth where seagulls prey on right whales. They dive-bomb the calves that are coming up to breathe air and take bites of blubber out of their backs. The calves' skin is thinner than adults' and they have to come up for air more frequently, making them more exposed and vulnerable to attack.\n24. Horses use facial expressions to communicate with each other. Researchers have identified 17 discrete facial movements in horses.\n25. Azara's owl monkeys are more monogamous than humans. They live together as families, with two parents and offspring, for up to nine years or when one of them dies. Fathers are highly involved in caring for their young.\n26. Male gentoo and Adelie penguins \"propose\" to females by giving them a pebble. These are precious because the penguins use them to build their nests, and they can be hard to find along the barren Antarctic shoreline. If the female accepts the pebble, the pair bonds and mates for life.\nTreehugger / Russell McLendon\n27. Barn owls are normally monogamous, but about 25% of mated pairs \"divorce.\" They do so if breeding is unsuccessful.\n28. African buffalo herds display voting behavior, in which individuals register their travel preference by standing up, looking in one direction and then lying back down. Only adult females can vote.\n29. If a honeybee keeps waggle-dancing in favor of an unpopular nesting site, other workers headbutt her to help the colony reach a consensus.\n30. The bone-house wasp stuffs the walls of its nest with dead ants.\nBonus Weird Animal Facts\nTreehugger / Russell McLendon\n31. Less time separates the existence of humans and the Tyrannosaurus rex than the T-rex and the stegosaurus.\n32. Animals have some unusual group names. For instance, a group of parrots is known as a pandemonium. Buffalo form an \"obstinacy\" and rhinoceroses a \"crash.\" You may have heard of a \"murder\" of crows, but what about an \"exaltation\" of larks?\n33. Warmer weather causes more turtles to be born female than male.\n34. A supercolony of invasive Argentine ants, known as the \"California large,\" covers 560 miles of the U.S. west coast. It's currently engaged in a turf war with a nearby supercolony in Mexico.\n35. By eating pest insects, bats save the U.S. agriculture industry an estimated $3.7 to $53 billion per year.\n36. Fourteen new species of dancing frogs were discovered in 2014, raising the global number of known dancing-frog species to 24."}

Giraffes belong to the family Giraffidae with their closest relative being the okapi whose natural habitat is the northeast region of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The giraffe's long neck is one of the animal\u2019s most distinctive feature, and it allows them to reach various food sources located high in trees. Giraffes also have a distinctive spot pattern unique to each. At one point there were eight species of giraffes, but seven have gone extinct. The single living species of the giraffe has nine subspecies scattered across the African continent.\nSubspecies of Giraffe\nToday, giraffes are found in Niger, Chad, Sudan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Somalia, Zambia, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Botswana, and South Africa. Each of the nine subspecies of giraffes has its own geographic range among the countries list above.\nReticulated Giraffe\nOne of the most well-known species of giraffe is the reticulated giraffe that inhabits the horn of Africa. Its natural range extends across three countries, which include Kenya, Somalia, and Ethiopia with an estimated population of 8,500 wild individuals. Due to the low population, the reticulated giraffe is considered vulnerable with various organizations cooperating to increase the population.\nRothschild Giraffe\nThe Rothschild giraffe, with a population of about 1,671 wild individuals, is one of the most endangered species of giraffe. The native population is currently limited to two states of Kenya and Uganda. They favor savannahs and woodland regions with some of the best spots to see them in the wild being the Kenyan Lake Nakuru National Park and the Ugandan Murchison Falls National Park.\nWest African Giraffe\nThe West African giraffe is an endangered giraffe subspecies that inhabits the Sahel region of West Africa. The subspecies is unique due to its spots which are of a lighter shade than other giraffes. The West African giraffe once occupied an extensive range of territory across Africa, but the population has reduced to 400 individuals. A herd located in the southwest of Niger is the only self-sustaining herd globally.\nNubian Giraffe\nThe Nubian giraffe is a vulnerable subspecies of giraffe extinct in three countries where it was once prevalent in Eritrea, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Egypt. At the moment populations of Nubian giraffes are present in five states in Sub-Saharan Africa including Sudan, Uganda, South Sudan, Kenya, and Ethiopia.\nSouth African Giraffe\nThe South African giraffe is also referred to as the Cape giraffe and has a range covering nations in the south of Africa from Mozambique to South Africa. At 31,500 wild individuals, the population of South African giraffes is more significant than other subspecies.\nAngolan Giraffe\nThere are approximately 13,000 wild Angolan giraffes inhabiting its habitat that covers four southern African states of Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Zambia. There are about 20 Angolan giraffes in captivity.\nRhodesian Giraffe\nThe Rhodesian giraffe only lives in a single country, Zambia. There are approximately 550 individuals all of which reside in the South Luangwa Valley. No Rhodesian giraffes live in captivity.\nKordofan Giraffe\nThe Kordofan giraffe is a subspecies of the giraffe with a wild population of about 2,000 individuals. The subspecies is relatively smaller than other types of giraffes. They are found in Central African Republic, southern part of Chad, Northern region of Cameroon, and probably Sudan.\nConservation of Giraffes\nThe global population of giraffes is estimated to be 80,000 individuals who are a significant decline from the 1999 population comprising of 140,000 individuals. The Giraffe Conservation Organization is one of many organizations working to ensure an increase in the global population."}

Here are seven amazing facts about them that you might not have known...\n1. They have super strong tongues\nGetty Images Their long tongues help them to get hard-to-reach food\nGiraffes have strong tongues that help them to get their food - and to get it fast.\nAn average giraffe's tongue is around 40-50cm long.\nThey use their tongues - like humans would use their hands - to grab food.\nTheir long tongues help to give giraffes enough force to rip leaves off acacia trees while avoiding the thorny spikes on the branches.\n2. They have incredible eyesight\nGetty Images Giraffes can see for miles!\nGiraffes definitely don't need glasses!\nThis is because of where a giraffe's eyes are located on their heads.\nIt gives them panoramic vision - meaning their vision is much wider than most mammals.\nThis helps for spotting predators and seeking out watering holes and trees from far away.\n3. Their pattern is unique\nGetty Images Each giraffe has its own unique pattern!\nJust like human fingerprints, no two giraffes have the same spot pattern.\nAnd each of the different species of giraffe have very different types of spot patterns when you look at them closely.\n4. They sleep standing up\nGetty Images Their legs might look spindly, but they are strong\nGiraffes spend most of their lives standing up; they even sleep standing up!\nThey do sometimes give their legs a rest, but all that standing is ok as their legs are very strong.\nIn fact scientists think that a groove in the giraffe's lower leg bone - which is much deeper than in other animals - helps keep their spindly-legs strong and allow them to support their bodyweight.\n5. Giraffes are tall, no REALLY tall!\nGetty Images STRETCH! Giraffes really are the tallest animals in the world\nGiraffes are world's tallest living mammals thanks to their incredibly long necks.\nA male giraffe can grow up to 5.5 metres tall (that's taller than a double-decker bus!).\nThe tallest giraffe is called Zulu and currently lives at Pembrokeshire zoo!\n6. They're social animals\nGetty Images Giraffes love to hang out in groups\nGiraffes usually roam around in groups called \"towers\".\nSimilar to a pack or a herd, towers usually have around 15 members which are led by a male adult giraffe with the rest being made up of young males and females.\n7. This ancient giraffe was the biggest ever\nScience Photo Library What the large relative of the giraffe may have looked like one million years ago\nThe largest giraffe relative ever to have existed is thought to have been the Sivatherium giganteum.\nIt's believed to have lived one million years ago in Africa and Asia and had a shorter neck and legs than giraffes of today."}

Animals that are considered mammals include warm-blooded vertebrates that have hair or fur and whose babies drink milk. Unlike other animal types like birds and insects, all mammal babies drink milk that comes from their mother\u2019s bodies. This is one of the key ways to know if an animal is a mammal. See the complete list of mammals.\nReptiles Lizards, dinosaurs, crocodiles, turtles, and snakes \u2013 all belong to that ancient and stout class of animals known as the reptiles. This is a diverse group with more than 10,000 different species and a huge representation in the fossil record. Once the dominant land vertebrates on the planet, reptiles still occupy just about every single ecosystem outside of the extreme north and south. See the complete list of reptiles.\nFish Fish are aquatic vertebrates. They usually have gills, paired fins, a long body covered with scales, and tend to be cold-blooded. \"Fish\" is a term used to refer to lampreys, sharks, coelacanths and ray-finned fishes, but is not a taxonomic group, which is a clade or group containing a common ancestor and all its descendants. See the complete list of fish.\nBirds Birds, members of the class Aves, include more than 10,400 living species. Their feathers distinguish them from all other classes of animal; no other animals on earth have them. If you see an animal with feathers, it\u2019s undoubtedly a bird. Like mammals, birds are warm-blooded vertebrates with four-chambered hearts. However, they are more closely related to reptiles and are believed to have evolved from dinosaurs. See the complete list of birds.\nAmphibians The official class of amphibians is Amphibia. To have the classification of an amphibian, an animal must be a vertebrate, require water to survive, be cold-blooded, and spend time both on land and in water. Though other animals only live on land or in the water, amphibians have the unique ability to thrive equally in both. Amphibians cover over 6,000 different species across the globe, but about 90% are frogs. See the complete list of amphibians.\nInvertebrates The definition of an invertebrate is any animal that does not have a backbone or vertebral column. The most prolific and easily recognizable members of the invertebrate family are insects. It\u2019s estimated that upwards of 30 million individual species of invertebrates may exist accounting for between 90-95 percent of all organisms on the planet. See the complete list of invertebrates.\nInsects All insects are part of the taxonomical phylum Arthropoda, and they are collectively referred to as arthropods. It is common to see this name misspelled as \u201canthropod,\u201d but this is not the correct term. They can be found in nearly every environment on the planet, and they currently account for over half of all known living organisms in the world. They have undergone many cycles of evolution depending on the resources available to them.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "artiodactyl | Definition, Diet, & Facts | Britannica", "url": "https://www.britannica.com/animal/artiodactyl", "text": "The remaining artiodactyls (i.e., the suborder Ruminantia ) are all ruminants (cud chewers), the most primitive of which are the chevrotains (Tragulidae), with nine species in Asia and one, the water chevrotain , in West Africa. The chevrotains are clearly remnants of a group that was once more numerous and widespread. Deer (Cervidae) are basically Eurasian and have not spread into sub-Saharan Africa, although they have reached the Americas. There are about 30 species, the greatest number being concentrated in South America and tropical Asia . The giraffe and the okapi (Giraffidae), two distinctive African species, are closely related to deer. The pronghorn (Antilocapridae), although sometimes called pronghorn antelope , is not a true antelope; it is the only survivor of a stock of ruminants that was very successful in the Neogene Period in North America (about 23 million to 2.6 million years ago). The family Bovidae is primarily African and Eurasian, with a few members in North America. Bovids are advanced artiodactyls, many of which live in open grassland and semi-arid areas.\nThe order Artiodactyla contains nine families of living mammals, of which the Bovidae (antelopes, cattle, sheep, and goats) is by far the largest, containing nearly 100 species. There are five Eurasian and four African species of pigs (family Suidae) and two Central and South American species of piglike peccaries (Tayassuidae). The two hippopotamus species (Hippopotamidae) are African. The more familiar large species were until recently widespread throughout Africa south of the Sahara and in the Nile Valley; the pygmy hippopotamus has a restricted distribution in West Africa . The camel group (Camelidae) was formerly abundant in North America, the now extinct North American stocks having produced the camelids of South America (wild guanaco and vicu\u00f1a , domestic llama and alpaca) and the Old World dromedary and Bactrian camel.\nNative artiodactyls are absent only from the polar regions and from Australasia, but many have been introduced into Australia and New Zealand . In Australia the position of medium and large herbivores is occupied by kangaroos. Through most of its evolutionary history, the order was absent from South America; only within the last few million years have some groups entered that continent. The occurrence of the majority of living artiodactyls in the Old World is a recent phenomenon; a considerable variety once inhabited North America .\nArtiodactyls were once the dominant herbivores (plant-eating mammals) of almost every continent. They are an important link in the chain by which the sun\u2019s energy, having been used by green plants, is made available to other forms of life. They tend to be medium-size or large animals. If they were any smaller, they would compete with rabbits and the larger rodents. And if they were larger, they would compete with elephants and rhinoceroses, the largest of terrestrial herbivores. The success of artiodactyls has depended on skeletal adaptations for running and on the development of digestive mechanisms capable of dealing with plant foods; none is adapted to flying, burrowing, or swimming. The individual species tend to be fairly narrowly adapted, in comparison with other mammals, but many of them nonetheless have broad distributions.\nImportance to humans\nArtiodactyls have long been exploited by humans for economic purposes. At Olduvai Gorge in East Africa there is clear evidence of the use of antelopes for food almost 2 million years ago. In Europe during Paleolithic times (about 30,000 years ago) Cro-Magnon man depended heavily on the reindeer. By this time the use of animals other than as food had become established; skins were used as clothing and footwear, and bones were used as tools, weapons, and accessories.\nThe domestication of animals was a major advance in human history. Domestication of herd animals probably arose gradually, perhaps before agriculture. Domesticated goats and sheep are first known from the Near East at some date close to 7000 bce. Cattle and pigs were domesticated at some subsequent date but certainly before 3000 bce. In South America the llama, now used for transport, and the alpaca, which provides a source of wool, were developed from guanacos by the Incas or their predecessors. The dromedary (Camelus dromedarius), domesticated in Arabia, was introduced into the Southwestern United States, southwestern Africa, and inland Australia in the 19th century. A large feral population now exists in Australia.\nIn addition to providing meat, milk, hides, and wool, artiodactyls have served man in a number of other ways. In Kashmir, the underfleece, or pashm, of the Siberian ibex (Capra ibex) and of local domesticated goats has been used as the basis for the manufacture of cashmere shawls. In southwestern France, pigs have been used to locate underground truffles (the fruiting bodies of certain edible fungi).\nNo group of mammals is more extensively hunted than the artiodactyls. Sport hunting of various deer supports a multimillion-dollar industry in North America and Europe. In many cultures hunting has been reserved for monarchs or the aristocracy. In the centuries after the Norman Conquest of England, the forest law provided severe punishment for the slaughter of deer and boars. P\u00e8re David\u2019s deer (Elaphurus davidianus) of China now survives only because it was preserved first in the hunting park of the emperors of China and later by the Duke of Bedford after the slaughter of the Chinese herds at the end of the 19th century.\nWild ungulates were the primary source of meat for human populations long before the appearance of modern man. Prehistoric man hunted the large mammals of his environment with an ever increasing effectiveness that was certainly instrumental in his survival. The extent to which man was involved in the extinction of some of the larger Pleistocene animals (i.e., those that were abundant 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago) is still being investigated. There is now known to have been a wave of late Pleistocene extinction of large mammals, including artiodactyls; in North America this wave reached its zenith about 9000 bce. Many animals also became extinct in Africa, where long-horned buffalo and large relatives of hartebeests survived until very recently. More of the large mammals have survived in Africa than elsewhere, but the reason for their survival is not known. A second, probably final, wave of extermination of the larger mammals has taken place with the spread of European culture and firearms in the past 300 years. It has been marked by wanton slaughter and has ultimately produced an interest in conservation. It now seems, however, that the unprecedented demands on the environment being made by rapidly expanding human populations will result in a nearly complete extinction of large wild mammals."}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Leopard Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Leopard-facts.html", "text": "leopard Facts\nPortrait of a Leopard\nThe leopard is the smallest of the four Big Cats, but is probably the most powerful pound-for-pound. They have amazingly strong necks and shoulders, and are able to carry prey often heavier than themselves, high up into the branches of trees where other predators can't reach.\nThe leopard's climbing ability sets it apart from the other big cats and has made it the most successful of the group as far as its numbers in the wild.\nAlthough leopards in Asia are critically endangered, the African leopard is quite numerous and estimates are that there are close to 500,000 wild leopards in existence.\nThat number is nearly ten times the number of all wild lions, tigers and cheetahs combined.\nTheir tree climbing prowess doesn't just give them the means to keep their kills safe, it also provides them a quick escape from the many animals on the African plains that can make life tough.\nThe leopard is a gifted, swift and effective hunter, but it is less than half the size of a mature lioness, has nowhere near the pugnacious tendencies of a hyena, and wouldn't stand a chance against a pack of African wild dogs.\nWhile the cheetah hunts in daylight in plain sight of any other predators that might want to steal it's prey, the leopard hunts almost exclusively by night, and it is a notoriously silent killer. One of the things that makes the rare man-eating leopard so incredibly lethal.\nAn older or injured leopard that can no longer take wild game, may find an easier mark in a nearby African village.\nWhile the man-eating tiger will kill humans mostly out in its own territory, leopards who resort to preying on humans are so swiftly deadly that they have been known to take people from their beds without other house mates hearing. - Leopard Facts\ncool leopard facts\nAsiatic lions\nThe leopard is a stunningly beautiful animal with a coat of buff to bright orange strewn with circles of spots called \"rosettes\". Sometimes their spots are actually square in shape.\nThere is also a type of coloration known as melanism which is an increase in dark pigment of the skin and fur which occurs in about 6% of all leopards and results in what is known as a \"black panther\".\nFrom a distance, Black panthers appear to be solid black in color, but close up you can actually see black spots on the coat.\nThe other spotted big cat, the jaguar, is very similar in appearance to the leopard and easily mistaken for one. Jaguars are generally much larger and more bulky than leopards and have much broader, rounder heads with smaller ears and eyes.\nBecause of their bulk, they do not share the leopards excellent climbing abilities, and so their lifestyle is more like that of a tiger than a leopard.\nMelanism occurs in jaguars as well, at approximately the same rate as in leopards, and the term \"black panther\" applies to melanistic individuals of both species.\nstunning leopards\nleopard reproduction\nleopard mother and baby\nLeopards are loners and live the most solitary lives of all the big cats.\nIn fact, unless they are paired up during a few short days of mating, adult leopards are almost never seen together.\nThe only time leopards spend in close company is the first 1 1/2 to 2 years of life spent with mom. After that, and once the youngster leaves, they have no further contact with their mother, and no contact at all with their father who never hangs around after mating is over.\nLeopards mark their territories in the same way as many cats do, with scent marking using urine sprays and sight markings leaving deep claw marks in selected tree trunks.\nA male leopards territory is thought to be three times as big as the females, and will overlap or completely encompass one or more females home ranges. Even so, they will avoid each other, making husky coughing type sounds as they patrol to let others know its time to clear out.\nConfrontations are rare because great effort seems to be taken to have no close contact, but they will keep tabs on each other by visiting the sites that their neighbors regularly mark and scent.\nFemales come into season several times a year until impregnated. When looking for a mate she makes a rowling sound similar to a house cat in heat.\nA male and female will pair up for 4 or 5 days, after which the male leaves for good.\nThe pregnant female will find a safe den and have a small litter of 1 to 3 cubs on average. More than 3 is possible, but rare. Newborn leopard cubs are a dark grey in color, an abundance of fuzzy fur, and very faint - if any- spots.\nLeopards, particularly in Asia, regularly give birth to just one cub. Because of this, and because of the leopards naturally seclusive lifestyle, survival rate is actually very good for young leopards compared to some other cats.\nOne of their most common enemies are snakes who may find little cubs alone, waiting for their mother to return from a hunt. Lions are a threat as well, and lions will kill young leopards if given a chance.\nLions have also been known to actively pursue and kill adult leopards without any interest in eating them. Solitary male lions in particular seem to make almost a sport out of trying to catch both leopards and, even more often, cheetahs.\nThe leopards greatest defense and greatest asset is how it lives its life, quietly and with unparalleled stealth. - Leopard Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

The other subspecies, spread through little pockets along Southern Asia, India, and up through the Russian far east.\nAt the highest Northern altitudes, leopards can be found living in mountain regions where the temperatures regularly dip below freezing. In some areas they live alongside Siberian tigers, but tend to exist along the snow line and avoid areas that get any real snow accumulations.\nAll of the Asian subspecies are endangered, and some may even be extinct to date.\nThe exceedingly rare Amur leopard of Korea, China and East Russia is on the crest of extinction with numbers of less than 30 in the wild.\nThe leopards notorious stealth, however, makes it hard to determine true numbers, and the leopard, no matter where its home range may be, remains by far the most difficult big cat to record and photograph.\nthe balancing act\nThe leopard is a very large carnivore with exceptional hardware that would give it the edge in allot of tough neighborhoods.\nIn areas of Asia where tigers are not in their range they are king of the jungle. But out on the African plains, the leopard is definitely not the apex predator. Surrounded by lions, hyenas and African wild dogs, harassed by vultures, jackals and even baboons, a hungry leopard must not only kill quickly and quietly, but also take its bounty to the trees in a hurry.\nLeopards stash large kills in the crooks of branches where they can eat in peace and even leave the carcass for a few days with some confidence that heavy lions and non-climbing pests just can't reach the cache.\nHaving the power to take down and maneuver very large prey, coupled with the agility to climb higher than the competition, works hand in hand, as a large kill does not go to waste on the floor of the savanna..\nWith a large kill the leopard will climb to a safe height, eat its fill, and then return for a number of days to feast on the carcass, occasionally having to fetch body parts from the ground if they become detached while it feeds.\nA somewhat surreal and gruesome sight to see, a leopard may have a favorite tree with particularly handy niches for hanging corpses, and in Central Africa it is not unheard of to see whole antelope, gazelle, even immature giraffe carcasses hanging from a tree thirty feet off the ground. - Leopard Facts\nand the leopards far removed\nThere are two cat species regularly referred to as leopards that are not closely related to the true leopard. Both the snow leopard and the clouded leopard are in the subfamily pantherinae and are not big cats.\nThere are attempts to classify the snow leopard as a member of panthera, with the belief that it is actually related to the Siberian tiger, but the snow leopard lacks the ability to roar, which has separated that genus for decades.\nBoth the snow leopard and the smaller clouded leopard live in mountainous areas of Asia including the Himalayas.\nThe snow leopard exists in higher altitude and is specially equipped for freezing temperatures with exceptionally thick fur and a very stocky build.\nThe clouded leopard lives in dense forest and is rarely seen. It has massive fangs and claws for its size, and a beautifully marbled coat.\nBoth of these cats are considered an evolutionary stepping stone from smaller cats like the ocelot, to the true big cats.\na few more leopard facts\nThe leopard is the best climber of the big cats..\nLeopards can drag prey twice their size high up into trees to keep them from scavengers\nThere are more leopards in the wild than lions, tigers and cheetahs combined.\nA leopards spots are really circles of spots called \"rosettes\" that may be round or square in shape depending on the region.\nLeopards hang their kill in trees.\nAlthough they are rarely in groups, a group of leopards is called a \"leap\" or a \"prowl\"\nLeopards can be found both in rainforests and in the snow covered wilderness of Siberia\nLeopards are also known as panthers.\nA black panther is a leopard with melanistic coat coloration.\nBlack panthers have faintly visible spots..\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Carnivora\nFamily Felidae\nGenus Panthera\nSpecies pardus\nSub-species\n9 subspecies\nLeopard Facts - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT leopard leopardess cub solitary GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD leap, prowl Africa, Asia jungle, savanna rabbit, gazelle ENEMIES AVG.

White rhino: Near threatened. Indian rhino: Vulnerable.\nLifespan (in wild):\nWeight: 500kg -2,500kg\nBody length: 2.5m-4m long\nTop speed:55km/hour\nDiet: Herbivore Habitat: grassy plains, rainforests and swamps.\n1) Our planet is home to five species of rhinoceros \u2013 the black rhino and the white rhino, which live in Africa, and the Sumatran, Javan and Indian (or greater one-horned) rhino, which inhabit the tropical forests and swamps of Asia.\n2) These brilliant beasts are known for their awesome, giant horns that grow from their snouts \u2013 hence the name \u201crhinoceros\u2019, meaning \u201cnose horn\u201d. Javan and Indian rhinos have one horn, where as the white, black and Sumatran rhinos have two.\n3) These incredible creatures are some of the biggest animals in world! The largest of the five species is the white rhino, which can grow to 1.8m tall and and weigh a massive 2,500kg \u2013 that\u2019s the weight of 30 men!\n4) Despite their huge size and strength, these bulky beasts don\u2019t prey on other animals for food. They\u2019re herbivores, and instead like to munch on lots of grass and plants at night, dawn and dusk.\n5) During the heat of the day, these magnificent mammals can be found sleeping in the shade or wallowing in muddy pools to cool off. They love to get mucky, in fact! Mud protects their skin from the strong sun (like a natural sunblock) and wards off biting bugs, too.\n6) For the most part, rhinoceroses are solitary animals and like to avoid each other. But some species, particularly the white rhino, may live in a group, known as a \u2018crash\u2019. These crashes are usually made up of a female and her calves, although sometimes adult females (called cows) can be seen together, too.\n7) Males (called \u2018bulls\u2019), on the other hand, like to be left alone, unless in search of a female to breed with. They\u2019re very territorial, too, and mark out their area of land with, believe it or not, poop! In fact, rhinos often use pongy piles to communicate with each other, since each individual\u2019s dung smells unique.\n8) They may rarely hang out with each other, but they spend a lot of time with their feathered friends! Rhinos are often seen with Oxpeckers (or \u2018tick birds\u2019) perched on their back, which live off the pesky parasitic insects living in the rhino\u2019s thick skin. The birds\u2019 loud cries also help alert their big buddies of potential danger, too!\n9) Because of their huge bodies, strong horns and thick, armour-like skin, rhinos have no natural predators. Nevertheless, these brilliant beasts get frightened easily! When they feel threatened, they\u2019re instinct is to charge directly at whatever has spooked them \u2013 whether it be another animal or a harmless object!\n10) Sadly, it\u2019s estimated that there are only around 29,000 rhinos left in the wild, compared to 500,000 at the beginning of the 20th century. The main threat to these beautiful animals is illegal hunting, largely because their horns are used in traditional folk medicine, particularly in Asia.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Amazing Facts about the Camel | OneKindPlanet Animal Education", "url": "https://onekindplanet.org/animal/camel/", "text": "Image by Robert Balog from Pixabay.\nAmazing Facts About the Camel\nWe all know camels for their distinctive humps and fascinating ability to survive weeks to months without drinking, but did you know they can run at up to 40 mph (65kph)? They are desert-dwelling animals that are now mostly domesticated, with very few still free to roam wild. In fact, they play such an important role in Arabic communities that there are over 100 words for camel in the Arabic language!\nWhy do some camels have one hump and others two?\nThey are two different species. Asian camels, known as Bactrian camels, have two humps, while Arabian camels, known as Dromedary camels, have one.\nHow many species of camel are there?\nThere are three species of camel alive today: Dromedary, Bactrian, and wild Bactrian. Dromedary and Bactrian are both domesticated. Wild Bactrian camels make up only a small percentage of the world\u2019s camel population and are critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. They inhabit desert areas of China and Mongolia.\nWhat is inside a camel\u2019s hump?\nIt\u2019s not water \u2013 it\u2019s fat! When food is hard to find, camels can break down the fat in their humps as a source of nutrition.\nFun fact: If a camel has not eaten in a while, its humps may droop as the fat stores start to empty! They will stand up straight again once they find food and restock their fat supply.\nStoring fat in this way also helps with controlling body temperature. By storing fat in humps instead of elsewhere on their bodies, they reduce their heat insulation which helps keep them cool during the hot desert days.\nHow do camels survive without water?\nNow we know camel humps are not full of water; how do camels survive without drinking for days at a time?\nTheir bodies are well adapted to store water, and when they drink, they drink a lot. In fact, a thirsty camel can drink around 30 gallons at a time! That means they take on a lot and lose very little through urine, faeces and things like sweating \u2013 despite the high temperature, they rarely sweat!\nThey are also able to lose up to 40% of their body weight without a problem!\nWhat adaptations help camels live in the desert?\nApart from their humps and ability to go for long periods without food and water, camels have many adaptations to help them live in the hot sandy desert."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "15 Hippopotamus Facts - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/hippopotamus/", "text": "Hippo Profile\nThe hippopotamus, or hippo, is native to sub-Saharan Africa and is a large, mostly herbivorous mammal.\nThe name hippopotamus comes from an ancient Greek word that translates to mean \u2018river horse\u2019 and the hippo is the third-largest land mammal following the elephant and rhinoceros.\nHippo Facts Overview\nHabitat: Rivers, lakes & mangrove swamps Location: sub-Saharan Africa, Colombia Lifespan: 40 \u2013 50 years Size: 13 \u2013 18 ft (4 to 5.5 m) Weight: 1,760 \u2013 3,530 pounds (800 \u2013 1,600 kg) Color: Grey, black, brownish purple Diet: Herbivore \u2013 Grass & fruit Predators: Crocodiles, lions & hyenas can prey on baby hippo. Adults, don\u2019t generally have predators. Top Speed: 40 Kph (30 mph) No. of Species:\n2 Conservation Status:\nVulnerable\nThe hippo can be found in lakes, rivers and mangrove swamps. Male hippos are known as \u2018bulls\u2018, female hippos are \u2018cows\u2018, and babies are \u2018calves\u2018.\nTerritorial males will control a pre-determined stretch of water, which will include a group of five to thirty females and their young. This group of hippos is actually known as a \u2018bloat\u2018.\nThe main reason why hippos are often found near bodies of water is that this is how they stay cool and prevent sunburn. During the hot daytime a hippo will either stay in water or mud in order to cool down.\nHippos may be seen near each other at rest, but feeding is done in solo and they are not territorial on land. The hippo generally grazes after dusk when it is cooler.\nThey are characterized by their barrel-shaped torsos. The hippo mouth is wide and open which contains large canine tusks. They have bodies that contain little hair, short columnar legs and can weigh up to 4,400 pounds for males and females are slightly smaller at 2,800-pounds.\nThere are two species of hippo, the modern hippopotamus and the pygmy hippopotamus, which is native to the forests and swamps of West Africa, primarily in Liberia.\nThe female hippo has a gestation period of eight months. Baby hippos are born underwater and will weigh between 55 and 100-pounds and will be about 4-feet long. They must swim to the surface in order to take their first breath of air. A normal birth rate is a single calf, but twins are not uncommon.\nMothers are very protective of their young and calves are often left together in \u2018nurseries\u2019 which are usually watched by one or more adults. While in these nurseries, the baby hippos will engage in play fights which prepare them for when they must fend for themselves.\nWhile the hippo used to be found all over the sub-Saharan area of Africa, their modern habitat is much smaller \u2013 barely a fraction of the size! This loss of habitat is one reason why they\u2019re now considered a vulnerable species.\nInteresting Hippo Facts\n1. Hippos are the deadliest large land animal on the planet\nThe Hippopotamus is one of the most dangerous animals in the world, killing an estimated 500 people a year in Africa.\nThey are extremely aggressive, unpredictable, have sharp teeth and can crush a human or predator to death with relative ease due to their size.\nIn one 2014 case in Niger, a boat was capsized by a hippo and 13 people were killed.\n2. Hippos love the water!\nThe hippopotamus is a semi-aquatic mammal. This means that even though they\u2019re a mammal like humans, dogs, cats, and other similar species, they spend a majority of their life in the water. Their historic habitat even included the Nile River.\nThey love the water so much that the Greeks had named them river horses!\nHowever, they only spend their days in the water. By night, they\u2019re on the land and grazing for up to 6 hours.\n3. There\u2019s only one wild herd famous outside of Africa\u2026\nAnd it has its roots entangled with Pablo Escobar!\nDuring his time, Escobar ran a private zoo which featured hippopotamuses. After he left, however, they escaped into the wild and continued to thrive in Colombia, where they are now part of a herd of at least 80.\nSince the hippo is an invasive species in this area that could damage the river ecosystems and native wildlife, there are now efforts to help reduce their ability to reproduce, providing a more humane way to halt the growth of the herd.\n4. The hippo is a victim of ivory poaching\nWhen you think about poaching and ivory, you probably think about rhinos and elephants. However, the hippopotamus is also a victim of this crime, which is another reason aside from habitat loss that they\u2019re endangered.\nWhile they may not have tusks or horns, the hippo\u2019s front teeth are made of ivory. This ivory is harder than an elephants, making it more durable but more difficult to carve.\nThe incisors can reach 40 cm (1 ft 4 in), while the canines reach up to 50 cm (1 ft 8 in).\n5. They can eat around 35 kg of grass in a single night\u2026every night!\nEver heard the saying \u201chungry as a hippo\u201d? There\u2019s more truth to that than meets the eye!\nDuring the night, when hippos return to land, they spend up to six hours grazing on grass and any fallen fruit they might stumble across. In a single night, a single hippopotamus can easily eat 35 kilograms of grass!\nNot sure just how impressive that is? Some other things that weigh around 35 kilograms are a small sofa, a chest freezer, a single twin bed (frame and mattress included), and medium size dryer.\nImagine eating an entire dryer\u2019s worth of weight in your favorite food every day!\n6. Hippos can open their mouths at almost 180 degrees\nHippos can open their mouths over 50cms wide, and their jaw hinge is located far back, allowing them to open at almost 180 degrees.\nHippopotamus bite force measures 12 600 kPa. By comparison, a lion\u2019s bite force is only 4500 kPa.\nThe hippopotamus, with his ferocious jaw force, unique mouth size and sharp teeth, can easily bisect a human body in a single bite!\n7. They can reach top speeds over 40 kph\nAt a first glance, you may think that the hippopotamus is one of the slowest animals around. After all, they have odd proportions and weigh a ton (literally).\nHowever, while they\u2019re not the fastest animal by far, the hippopotamus can reach top speeds over 40 kph when they\u2019re running on land. This is around the same speed as a moped!\nAs a result, a human has no hope of out running one of these massive mammals. That\u2019s one reason why hippos kill more humans in Africa each year than any other species, including big cats.\n8. Predators are only really a threat when a hippo is alone\nTaking a quick look out our hippopotamus profile, you\u2019ll notice that these mostly water dwellers have quite a few predators both in the water and on land. From big cats to hyenas to crocodiles, there are many animals that pose a threat to the hippopotamus.\nHowever, only when they\u2019re alone.\nThere\u2019s a reason that hippos travel in dense herds. While they\u2019re easy targets alone, an entire herd of hippopotamuses can easily throw their weight around.\nWith the strongest bite strength of all land animals and a knack for aggression, the hippopotamus can easily defend itself so long as its not out numbered. They\u2019ve even been known to chase down human boats!\n9. Hippos can\u2019t swim\nThe most surprising fact of them all? Hippos can\u2019t swim!\nThat\u2019s right, despite how much they love the water and having webbed feet, hippos aren\u2019t actually the best swimmers. They aren\u2019t even swimmers at all! Instead, they have such a high body density that they sink right to the bottom of the river where, instead of swimming, they gallop through the water.\nTurns out they earned the name \u201criver horse\u201d for many reasons! Fortunately hipppos can hold their breath for up to 5 minutes.\n10. They weigh as much as a car\nAdult male hippos can weigh about 3,300-pounds with females reaching 2,800-pounds. Very large males can grow to 4,400-pounds with exceptional large ones reaching 5,800-pounds.\n11. A Hippo can live to become a senior citizen\nThe average lifespan of a hippopotamus is between 40 and 50 years.\nHowever, the oldest living hippo in captivity set a record when she died in 2017. Bertha was a resident of the Manila Zoo in the Phillipines. At the time of her death she was 65.\n12. Hippos can be traced back about 52-million years ago\nA total of six species of Hippopotamus are extinct with three of them being subspecies of the Malagasy Hippopotamus.\nThese species were much smaller in size than the modern hippo with the last of them disappearing in the past century.\nThere are also three species of the European Hippopotamus that have become extinct.\n13. Hippos engage in \u2018muck-spreading\u2019\nThis involves marking territory with their own faeces \u2013 by spinning their tail which acts as a fan to spread their faeces over a greater area!\nGross!\n14. They can sleep underwater\nHippos are able to sleep while fully submerged underwater, intermittently surfacing to the surfce using a reflex that allows them to take a breath, before sinking back down \u2013 without waking up!\nWhen completely submerged, their ears and nostrils fold shut to keep water out.\n15. The IUCN lists hippos as vulnerable\nHippos are thought to have a stable population estimated between 115,000 and 130,000 animals.\nSadly however, hippos are considered vulnerable due to loss of access to fresh water and being subject to poaching.\nHippo Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification"}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Africa's Big Five - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Africas-Big-five.html", "text": "africa's big five\nAfrica's Big Five does not refer to the five biggest animals in Africa,it is a list of the five most difficult African animals to hunt on foot...\nThat is not to say that they aren't \"big\", but giraffes and hippos are clearly larger than leopards.\n\"Africa's Big Five\" is also occasionally misinterpreted to mean the five most dangerous animals in Africa. All the animals in the \"Big Five\" have killed human beings, but are not statistically the most dangerous animals.\nThe real test was from a hunting stand point, and big game hunters over the years have declared these five animals to be the most difficult to track down and persue in their native habitats. Danger is a consideration, but hippos actually kill more people than any of the Big Five, yet aren't on the list because they apparently are not as difficult to hunt.\nThe cape buffalo\nThe cape buffalo is perhaps the most dangerous of the \"Big Five\", particularly if it is injured. They are notorious for seeking revenge on hunters in the bush, turning the tables, tracking down those who shot at or injured them, and sometimes attacking and even killing entire hunting parties.\nKnown as the \"Black Death\", the biggest danger in hunting them is that they are so physically dense and muscular that it may take several shots to bring them down. Angered and in pain they may charge and kill the hunter before the bullets have any effect.\nthe african elephant\nThe African elephant is the largest land animal and also one of the most intelligent. They live in family groups made up of females and their youngsters, headed by a wise matriarch. The elephant is extremely social and has shown evidence of compassion and empathy, as well as indications that they mourn dead relatives. Elephants will examine and caress the bones of dead friends and relatives for years after their passing and have been seen to walk deliberately off course to visit a the site of a family members passing.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

They are significantly smaller than lions and tigers, and occasionally even fall prey to a hungry lion. The jaguar is native to south and central America, and once roamed the southern United States. Both leopards and jaguars are buff to yellow to orange in color with black or dark brown spots in a classic \"rosette\" pattern. Black individuals occur fairly regularly, the result of a melanism gene. The spots can still be seen on the black fur as subtle shading. Both black leopards and black jaguars are popularly called black panthers, although they are not a separate species and black individuals will occur side by side in the same litter with normally colored cubs. Leopards and jaguars are difficult to tell apart if the location is unknown The jaguar is generally a stouter animal with a proportionately rounder head, fuller cheeks and smaller eyes and ears. It is sometimes stated that the leopard does not have a dot at the center of the circles of dots on its coat known as \"rosettes\", or that the center of the rosette on the jaguar is darker than the body color, but both jaguars and leopards vary greatly in this regard and coat pattern is not a reliable means of identification.\nThe african lion\nNative to Africa and a tiny portion of India, the lion is the most unique of these cats. Adult male lions display a full ruff of shaggy hair around their heads known as a mane.\nThis is not just special for a big cat, it is very rare among any mammals to have such obvious physical distinction between the sexes. The lion is also a very social cat with an interesting and complicated pride dynamic.\nThe king of beasts also has the loudest roar of the four roaring \"big cats\" - naturally!\nthe rhinocerus\nBlack rhinos and white rhinos are both native to Africa. They are actually both basically shades of grey in color, and their top lip is a far better way to tell them apart.\nThe white rhino eats low grasses on the plains and has a wide, straight top lip to shave grass blades close to the ground.\nThe black rhino dines on different types of vegetation, including buds and shoots in the brush. They have a pointed top lip that is prehensile to wrap around buds and leaves and pull them off branches.\na few more facts about \"Africa's Big five\"\nThe cape buffalo is known as the \"Black Death\"\nThe lion has the loudest roar of all the big cats\nElephants make some noises that are too low for us to hear\nCape buffalo can weigh as much as 2000 pounds"}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Hyena Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Hyena-facts.html", "text": "Hyena Facts\nOne of the least known hyena facts is that they are actually accomplished hunters, not just sneaky scavengers. Although they resemble both dogs and cats, the three species of hyenas and the aardwolf are in their own separate and very unique family called Hyaenidae.\nThe most well-known is called the spotted hyena, also known as the laughing hyena due to the unusual and eerie sounds it makes. After the African lion, the spotted hyena is the largest carnivore in Africa, weighing up to 180 pounds and standing up to 30 inches at the shoulder. These are complicated, intelligent, and highly social animals with a really awful reputation.\nFor centuries hyenas were said to have the souls of the damned trapped inside of them, and when a clan is on the hunt, calling and squealing to one another, it certainly sounds like cackling demons.\nIn addition, female spotted hyenas have very unusual genitalia that outwardly resemble that of a male. This shocks even many modern cultures who fear it as a sign of anarchy or the work of the devil.\nAnd, of course, hyenas have long been considered scurrilous and sneaky scavengers, but they are actually skilled hunters and clans will organize to take down prey as large as zebra. Most clans hunt and kill the majority of what they eat, but, like all the animals of the African plains, they will also steal absolutely anything that isn't nailed down.\nAlthough they are zoologically classified in their own family, hyenas share tendencies with both felines and canines. Like canines they hunt by running down their prey and grabbing it with their mouths, not their paws. But, like felines, they groom themselves often and scent-mark their territory.\nUnique to hyenas are their amazing bone-crushing teeth. Short, powerful canines are on display towards the front of the jaw, but deep in the back of the jaw where they can exert the most leverage, are massive carnassials which pulverize the entire skeletons of prey as big as wildebeast. So much bone material is consumed that the hyenas droppings have a chalky white color.\nSocially, the spotted hyena lives in a matriarchal society quite rare in the world of mammals. Females are larger, more muscular and definitely more aggressive. The highest ranking male in the clan is generally subordinate to the lowest ranking female. These spotted hyena clans are rude, boisterous, highly social groups that spend allot of time pushing and shoving but will ultimately spend the afternoon siesta snuggled in a huge shaggy pile. - Hyena Facts\nThe Artful Hyena\nThe older the hyena, the gnarlier their ears are. Why? Because although they are tight-knit and extremely dependent on eachother, the members of a hyena clan spend alot of time beating eachother up.\nMost interesting and unique is that it's the females doing most of the damage.\nFemale hyenas actually have more testosterone then males, can be about 30% larger, and significantly more muscular. Why this arrangement? Nobody is really sure, but the hyena is a very successful species that has adapted to many situations over thousands of years.\nIn ancient Egypt, spotted hyenas were raised and harvested for their meat, occasionally being kept as rather large and messy pets. More recently, as humans have encroached further and further into their world, hyenas have learned the skills of dodging traffic and dumpster diving.\nOn the savanna, hyenas center their lives around a specific territory well marked by community \"latrines\" where the entire clan will leave mounds of chalk-colored feces.\nHyenas have such powerful teeth and jaws that they will eat every inch of a carcass - including the bones. When the bones are digested they turn the hyenas excrement a very distinctive off-white color, so piles of white poo mean \"this land is ours!\" - Hyena Facts\nBaby hyena\nOne of the most amazing hyena facts is that they are almost impossible to sex. Their appearance, habits and sounds are already weird, but when it comes to sex, there is no more confusing creature than the spotted hyena. Unusually high testosterone levels in female spotted hyenas create not only larger, stronger and more aggressive girls, but also transform the female sex organs.\nThe clitoris of the female spotted hyena is a tube-like pseudo penis 6 to 7 inches long that looks almost identical to a male penis. Completing the illusion, the labia are fused together in what appears to be a scrotum.\nThese organs make it nearly impossible for even experienced hyena observers to tell the difference, and have caused many to believe that hyenas are clans of devilish hermaphrodites whose cackles mock the norm.\nBut actual intercourse is no laughing matter, it is a delicate and stressful process where a submissive male must somehow arch his way under the female and insert his penis into a dangling tube.\nThe female urinates and gives birth through the urogenital canal which runs down the center of the clitoris. Birth is extremely difficult due to the length of the canal, and death during the first delivery is about 1 in 10. Subsequent deliveries are easier. There are usually two cubs delivered, but fighting between the cubs often occurs, particularly if they are the same sex, and the weaker sibling will often perish in the first weeks.\nYoung males will leave the clan at about 2 years, females will remain for life. - Hyena Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Hence the common question \"is a hyena a dog or a cat? Or maybe a bear?\" Fact is, hyenas are hyenas, or more scientifically, members of the small 4 species family called Hyeanidae.\nIn the carnivore family tree are two main groups, feliformia, or \"cat-like\" carnivores, and caniformila, or \"dog-like\" carnivores. The ancestors of the modern hyena were cat-like tree dwellers that spawned not only cats but civets, mongoose and binterong.\nSo hyenas are in the sub-order feliformia, along with all modern felines. But over the course of evolution, hyenas developed many of the behaviors and physical features of the dog species that lived in the same environment. Because those behaviors and physical attributes were effective adaptions to the environment and filled a similar ecological niche, this is called concurrent evolution, and it is why hyenas look and act so much like African wild dogs even though they do not share the same ancestors.\nUltimately, hyenas are hyenas, or more scientifically four species in the very specialized family Hyaenidae. They share biological ancestors with cats but developed more like dogs. Among modern animals, they are most closely related to the civets which are medium sized carnivores that resemble weasels, but also have their own separate family. - Hyena Facts\nlaughing all the way\nmath and the next meal\nJust like in any rough neighborhood, the kids on the Savanna find safety in numbers.\nFive hyenas might steal a fresh kill from a lion, Ten African wild dogs can take a zebra carcass from a hyena, and a big enough gang of vultures will drive just about everyone away from whatever is left.\nHolding on to a meal on the plains comes down to stealth, intellect, courage, and -most important- your peeps beside you.\nWhile lions, hyenas and wild dogs all hunt and kill much of their own prey, stealing is part of the rhythm, and plunder keeps you fat, but the vulture does not hunt at all, and is the only true scavenger in this circle of adversaries. .. Hyena Facts\nother hyena species\nFor those who might find the common spotted hyenas appearance slightly off-putting we offer the two uncommon cousins, the straggly brown hyena, and the amazingly odd, joker-face of the striped hyena.\nSmaller and far less populous than the spotted hyena, these two species somewhat mirror the spotted in lifestyle and fill the same ecological niche. The biggest difference, however, is 'tude.\nWhile the infamous spotted hyena is pugnacious and will defend itself with startling ferocity, the striped hyena and the very shy brown hyena will actually \"play dead\", similar to a opossum, when faced with a threat. So, even for the rugged spotted hyena it's true - our closest relatives can be the source of our deepest embarrassment! - Hyena Facts\na few more hyena facts\nHyenas were long believed to be hermaphrodites because the females genitalia look almost exactly like the males. The females pseudo-penis is actually more like a tube, and mating is quite an elaborate and difficult production.\nbecause the females genitalia look almost exactly like the males.

Most history books tend to gloss over the more gruesome details of what such fights entailed. For example, history books rarely tell you about . . .\n10 The Suicides\nSome people who fought against animals in the Colosseum were well-trained men and thought of it as a career. A great deal of them, however, were unarmed criminals or prisoners of war who were thrown to the animals with virtually nothing to defend themselves.\nAs you can imagine, such a fate was terrifying for even the most hardened of men. Many prisoners killed themselves with whatever they had on hand rather than risk being killed by whichever strange beasts lined up for the morning show.\nFor example, one German prisoner killed himself by forcing a sponge down his own throat. And not just any sponge\u2014this was a lavatory sponge that inmates used to wipe their anuses. Other stories involve prisoners making murder suicide pacts with each other, like the 29 Saxon prisoners who all fatally strangled one other to avoid death in the arena. How the last one alive managed to kill himself isn\u2019t recorded, but considering \u201cchoking on a sponge of human excrement\u201d was an option, we\u2019re guessing it wasn\u2019t pretty.\n9 The Fighting Killed Off Whole Species\nThe sheer quantity of slaughter in the Colosseum saw the number of lions, jaguars, and tigers plummet across the globe. According to some, Roman hunting absolutely \u201cdevastated the wildlife of North Africa and the entire Mediterranean region,\u201d wiping some species of animal off the map entirely.\nFor example, after one particularly brutal set of games in which 9,000 animals were slaughtered, the hippo disappeared from the river Nile. Creatures like the North African elephant, which was also commonly used as a war elephant during the time, were wiped of the face of the Earth completely.\n8 Few Bestiari Ever Survived\nBecause the majority of bestiari were prisoners of war or other such undesirables, they were almost always ill-equipped for the task of slaughtering a rampaging wild animal. In the highly unlikely event a bestiari actually managed to kill the animal he was forced to fight, another would almost certainly be let loose before he\u2019d even finished celebrating.\nThe ancient Greek philosopher Strabo once described the plight of a particularly unlucky bestiari who was first sentenced to be killed by a boar. When the boar accidentally fatally gored its handler, leaving the guards no choice but to kill it, a wild bear was brought in to the arena instead to kill the prisoner. In an unbelievable stroke of luck, the bear then refused to leave its cage, once again leaving the prisoner alive and the guards with the frustrating task of killing the bear. Not ones to be deterred, the Romans finally brought into the arena a caged leopard, which happily tore out the bestiari\u2019s throat.\nSome people just don\u2019t have any luck, do they?\n7 Commodus And The Ostriches\nEmperor Commodus (played by Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator) took great pleasure in slaughtering animals and people in the arena. He enjoyed it so much that in one day alone, he reportedly killed more than 100 bears. Though we don\u2019t know exactly how Commodus managed such a feat, scholars agree he probably just stabbed them while they stood tethered and helpless.\nThough such actions paint Commodus as a poor fighter, he was reportedly a crack shot with the bow, which he liked to prove by decapitating ostriches in full sprint with crescent-shaped arrows. Commodus would then brandish or even throw the decapitated heads at members of the crowd or his own senate, either as a warning or a sign of his madness.\n6 Elephants Crushed Deserters\nDamnatio ad bestias (\u201ccondemnation by wild beasts\u201d) was the act of condemning criminals to death by animal attack in the arena. Unlike the betiarii, who stood at least a small chance at defending themselves, those condemned via damnatio ad bestias were either defenseless, tied to the spot, or just naked and armed with a wooden weapon.\nThe very first case of damnatio ad bestias in Roman history occurred when Aemilius Paullus sentenced a group of army deserters to death in 167 BC. To make it interesting, he ordered them crushed to death by a horde of elephants. The spectacle proved so popular that death by animals became a part of everyday life for the Romans\u2014literally. Every morning, a Roman citizen could go to the arena to watch such executions take place before an afternoon of actual gladiatorial combat.\n5 Public Hunts\nThe killing of animals was usually left to trained professionals or unarmed prisoners. But on rare occasions, the general public got the chance to kill rare and exotic animals for their own enjoyment.\nEmperor Probus turned one of the most famous chariot racetracks in Rome, the Circus Maximus, into an actual forest around 280 AD. Into this forest, he released hundreds, if not thousands, of ibexes, sheep, ostriches, and other beasts.\nAfter the forest had been suitably filled with hapless herbivores, the public was then permitted to enter and hunt animals for fun. As a bonus, they could keep anything they killed. The following day, Probus had 400 lions and 300 bears stabbed to death, because the public apparently still wasn\u2019t satisfied with all the free ostrich meat they\u2019d received the day before.\n4 Orpheus Against The Bears\nAccording to legend, the hero Orpheus was a musician of such skill that he could charm all living things with nothing more than a lyre. The Romans loved this legend and tried to recreate it many, many times. They\u2019d dress a condemned criminal up like Orpheus, give him a lyre, and then throw him into an arena full of angry bears, normally ones that had been starved or beaten.\nSometimes, though, the Romans would put a further twist on the myth and crucify the man playing Orpheus before exposing him to the bear. Mostly, however, the Romans were a little more sporting and the criminal was free to defend himself with the lyre he\u2019d been given. This went about as well as you\u2019d expect. Then again, it could have been worse . . .\n3 Carpophorus\u2019s Rape Giraffes\nBesides the bestiari, arena competitors included better-trained, voluntary fighters called \u201cvenatores.\u201d Carpophorus is likely the most famous of them all. He once killed 20 wild beasts in a single day, straight-up strangling some of them to death.\nHowever, Carpophorus had another talent that we want to discuss today. Along with being an expert killer of animals, he was also a rather skilled trainer of them. Carpophorus trained multiple animals, including giraffes, to rape women. To accomplish this, Carpophorus would wait for female animals to be in heat so he could collect samples from them to arouse the male of the species. Carpophorus would then rub these samples against slaves or homeless women he\u2019d tempted to the arena. According to one account, \u201cCarpophorus used up several women before he got the animals properly trained.\u201d\nThe reasoning behind such madness was, like with the sad case of prisoners forced to dress as Orpheus, to reenact Greek or Roman myths. In particular, these involved Zeus, who liked to take the form of various animals before having his way with women.\nOne story involves a woman accused of poisoning five being raped by a jackass, before Carpophorus ended the ordeal by releasing wild animals into the arena to ease her suffering.\n2 Prolific Killer Animals\nIf you hadn\u2019t already guessed by now, the Romans didn\u2019t exactly take good care of the animals they intended to fight or kill. Most animals, to save on the cost of housing and feeding them, would be killed outright after each games, since, well, replacements were easy to come by. However, exceptions existed.\nAccording to the famed Roman philosopher Cicero, one lion in the arena killed an astounding 200 men before it was finally slain. Other notable animals include the group of 18 elephants who stormed the crowd in an escape attempt. The elephants were originally to be killed by a group of men armed with darts, but they smashed through the fence separating them from the crowd. To stop this from ever happening again, the Romans placed a large trench between the arena and the crowd for future events.\n1 No Animals Had To Die\nPerhaps the most cruel aspect of all is that the animals brought to the arena never really needed to be killed. We don\u2019t mean that killing animals for sport is wrong\u2014the Romans had little patience for that argument. We mean that the animals proved perfectly capable of entertaining the crowds while staying alive.\nFor example, trained elephants who danced, bowed, and did other tricks delighted the crowds. In fact, elephants were noted as being one of the only creatures the crowds didn\u2019t like to see being killed. Writers of the era note that spectators would boo upon seeing elephants killed, thinking them smart and gentle creatures.\nOther stories tell of the crowd being in awe of just seeing crocodiles sit in a ditch full of water. That\u2019s it\u2014no one stabbed them, and they didn\u2019t fight anything. People were happy just to look at them, as though in a zoo. Another time, a crowd of thousands once sat and laughed their heads off at the sight of a bunch of leopards running in a straight line.\nThe crowd was literally just as happy to see the animals run in a circle or sit and do nothing, but the Romana decided to kill them anyway to spice things up.\nKarl loves him some history and has been writing an ongoing series about ass-kicking athletes, found here. He also has a Twitter account, because of course he does."}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "23 Astonishing Blue Whale Facts - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/blue-whale/", "text": "Blue Whale Profile\nThe Blue Whale is a marine mammal, that\u2019s believed to be the largest animal that has ever lived, far bigger than even the largest dinosaur. They habitat the Antarctic Ocean, the North Atlantic, North & South Pacific and Indian Oceans.\nThey are members of the order Artiodactyla and family Balaenopteridae (or \u2018Rorquals\u2019), the largest group of Baleen whales, which includes the Humpback Whale.\nBlue Whale Facts Overview\nHabitat: Antarctic Ocean, North Atlantic Ocean, North & South Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean Location: Virtually all oceans. Lifespan: 80 \u2013 110 Years Size: 80 \u2013 108 ft (24 \u2013 30 m) Weight: 330,000 \u2013 441,000 pounds (150 \u2013 200 tonnes) Color: Deep Blue-Grey Diet: Krill (Shrimp-like crustaceans) Predators: No Natural Predators. However, there have been some Killer Whale attacks. Top Speed: 50 Kph (31 Mph) No. of Species:\n1 Conservation Status:\nEndangered\nThe Blue Whale (Balaenoptera musculus) prefer the deep ocean, rather than coastal waters or bays, and can be found living in any of the oceans located around the globe.\nThey tend to spend the warmer months feeding in the polar regions, and will participate in extensively long migrations to the Equator as winter approaches.\nBlue Whales live typically between 80 and 90 years, with some reaching up to 110 years of age.\nThey have a carnivore diet, but despite their size, these massive sea creatures prefer to eat some of the tiniest marine life. Blue Whales feast on plankton called krill, which is a small animal that resembles shrimp. Due to the relative sizes of both the blue whale and krill, they can consume as many as 40 million krill, or 8,000 pounds (3,600 kg) of it daily.\nBlue Whales can grow to over 30-metres in length, but are extremely graceful swimmers. They typically have a cruising speed of around 8-kilometres per hour, and can hit top speeds of up to 50 kph. They are also great divers, plunging down to depths of 500-metres, to seek krill to snack on.\nBecause the blue whale is the largest animal to live on the planet, it has few predators. However, shark attacks and killer whales can injure or kill a blue whale. More commonly, they succumb to injuries sustained with collisions with large sea vessels.\nThe global population of blue whales is uncertain, but based on research from the IUCN, the global total for the species is estimated to be between 10,000-25,000 and classed as endangered.\nInteresting Blue Whale Facts\n1. The mouth of the blue whale contains a row of plates that are fringed with \u2018baleen\u2019, which are similar to bristles.\nThe bristles are used to filter food from the water that the whale takes in its mouth when feeding. A mouthful of water for the Blue Whale is about 5,000-kilograms of liquid and plankton. As the whale forces the water out of its mouth, the bristles act to capture and trap the food. The whale then licks the bristles clean with its massive tongue, which allows it to swallow the plankton.\n2. The tongue of the blue whale is as big as an elephant.\nAside from cleaning krill from the plates in its mouth, the blue whale tongue weighs about as much as an elephant, or a daily car.\n3. The blue whale was once hunted for whale oil.\nIn the 1900\u2019s blue whales were extensively hunted, which severely impacted their population. Hundreds of thousands of them were massacred for their oil, which is obtained from their blubber. Historically whale oil was widely used in oil lamps, and to make soap and margarine.\n4. Blue whales were hunted almost to extinction, until they were protected in 1966.\nThe hunting for whale oil was so excessive that records suggest approx. 380,000 whales had been caught. The International Whaling Commission deemed the blue whale as a protected animal which has allowed it to breed safely.\n5. The blue whale population size is slowly increasing.\nHowever, their population has not grown back to previous levels. Pre whaling, there were estimated to be around 240,000 blue whales globally. The numbers today are estimated to be between 3-11% of the pre-1911 population size.\n6. A blue whale weighs as much as 200 tonnes. Or, 150 Honda Civics.\nThey are the heaviest animals known to ever live on the planet.\n7. Blue whales make few friends in the water.\nAlthough it is common for them to just swim around the many oceans on the planet alone or in a pair, the blue whale will from time to time swim in a small group. Where food is readily available, as many as 60 blue whales may come together.\n8. The blue whale is not only the world\u2019s largest animal, but also the loudest.\nThe human ear can\u2019t pick them up underwater, but the blue whale happens to make the loudest noise of any animal, up to 188 decibels, which is louder than a jet engine. The blue whale talks with low frequency moans, groans and pulses.\n9. The blue whale has incredible hearing.\nBecause the Blue Whale communicates with sounds that are such a low frequency, under the correct conditions, one can communicate with others and be heard as far as 1,600-kilometres away.\n10. Although a mostly solitary animal, the blue whale forms bonds.\nProbably due to the long lifespan of the blue whale, it has the ability to form an attachment to another living creature that spends time with one.\n11. Actions displayed by blue whales appear that they have feelings.\nThis belief is backed up by how whales that wash ashore will show affection towards those who rescue them as if so say thank you.\n12. The reproductive cycle for the blue whale is rather slow.\nBreeding occurs just once every three years. Pregnancy is usually between 11 and 12 months.\n13. Following such a slow reproductive cycle, blue whale families are small.\nUsually females will give birth to just one calf.\n14. A Blue whale calf is anything but a little baby.\nThe newborn calf will weigh as much as 2,700-kilograms and measure 8-metres or more in length.\n15. A Blue whale calf grows fast.\nThe calf will gain roughly 90-kilograms of weight per day in its first year of life.\n16. The Blue whale calf has a huge appetite.\nAs it is suckled in the water, a calf will consume over 600 liters of mother\u2019s milk per day in its first year.\n17. Blue whale mothers nurture their young.\nA female will lift her newborn calf to the water surface in order for it to take its first breath of air. Other females that may be nearby will help by nudging the newborn in an effort to encourage it to break the surface and breathe.\n18. Blue whales have a blowhole to breathe, similar to our nose!\nWhen one surfaces, it exhales through the blowhole at the top of its body. A cloud of pressurized air is sent as much as 9-metres in the air due to the force of exhalation. They tend to come up for air between every 5-15 mins \u2013 but can go for longer without breathing.\n19. Blue whales have a huge heart.\nAside from having feelings and showing affection, the average blue whale heart is as big as a mid-sized car. The beating of this massive heart can be heard as far as 2-mile away. Their blood vessels are so wide you could swim through them. What we are saying is, they are big. Very big.\n20. The blue whale resembles a well-known sea craft.\nWhen viewed from above, aside from having fins and a fluke, the Blue Whale can easily be mistaken for a submarine \u2013 as it has the same basic aerodynamic shape.\n21. The steering equipment is relatively small on a blue whale.\nThey use their flippers for maneuvering around under water, but the blue whale flipper is just 12-percent of the overall size of the mammal.\n22. Killer whale (Orcas) rarely attack adult blue whales, but may prey on young calves occasionally.\nTypically, killer whales pick on prey smaller than them. While blue whale are quite passive, due to their sheer size, it usually deters groups of killer whales.\n23. Research suggests ship strikes are a threat to blue whales, although relatively minor.\nWhale-ship collisions might be partly behind the low blue whale population counts, despite international protections since 1966. Howeber, studies suggest the risk is still fairly low, and that reducing the speed limit of vessels in shipping lanes helped reduce strikes by 80%.\nBlue Whale Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification\nKingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Artiodactyla Infraorder: Cetacea Family: Balaenopteridae Subfamily: Balaenoptera Species Name: Balaenoptera musculus\nSubspecies List"}

Critically endangered LC NT VU EN CR EW EX Least Concern Extinct Current Population Trend : Increasing\nBoth black and white rhinoceroses are actually gray. They are different not in color but in lip shape. The black rhino has a pointed upper lip, while its white relative has a squared lip. The difference in lip shape is related to the animals' diets. Black rhinos are browsers that get most of their sustenance from eating trees and bushes. They use their lips to pluck leaves and fruit from the branches. White rhinos graze on grasses, walking with their enormous heads and squared lips lowered to the ground.\nBehavior\nExcept for females and their offspring, black rhinos are solitary. Females reproduce only every two and a half to five years. Their single calf does not live on its own until it is about three years old.\nBlack rhinos feed at night and during the gloaming hours of dawn and dusk. Under the hot African sun, they take cover by lying in the shade. Rhinos are also wallowers. They often find a suitable water hole and roll in its mud, coating their skin with a natural bug repellent and sun block.\nRhinos have sharp hearing and a keen sense of smell. They may find one another by following the trail of scent each enormous animal leaves behind it on the landscape.\nRhino Horn and Threats to Survival\nBlack rhinos boast two horns, the foremost more prominent than the other. Rhino horns grow as much as three inches a year, and have been known to grow up to five feet long. Females use their horns to protect their young, while males use them to battle attackers.\nThe prominent horn for which rhinos are so well known has also been their downfall. Many animals have been killed for the hard, hairlike growth, which is revered for medicinal uses in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. The horn is also valued in North Africa and the Middle East as an ornamental dagger handle.\nThe black rhino once roamed most of sub-Saharan Africa, but today is on the verge of extinction due to poaching fueled by commercial demand for its horn."}

They hunt as well, taking birds, insects and other small game.\nLiving in woodlands and eucalyptus forests on the Australian island state of Tasmania, devils can be seen out and about during daylight hours, but do most of their stalking and scavenging at night.\nThe growls, whines and cantankerous sounds of the devil are its single most fascinating characteristic, and it really isn't clear why they are so incredibly noisy, but the manic and popular cartoon character of the same name is quite accurate: massive head, full body, extra cranky. - Tasmanian Devil Facts\nTasmanian devil Personality\nTasmanian devils fight allot, and are known for their fierceness, but they will often use a few clever techniques first, before resorting to full out combat.\nWhen a dispute finds two devils face to face, their skin will flush red, turning the ears crimson, and they will gape their impressive jaws at each other, screaming and growling the whole time.\nIf the situation is stressful enough, the devil will release a musky odor that would clear most rooms. Finally, they will emit a stacatto sneeze that is sometimes so violent they loose their footing.\nIf all else fails, its time to rumble, and most devils have the scars to prove it.\nIt's not hard to snap a photo of a Tasmanian devil with its mouth agape - the familiar pose is used in many instances throughout the day, and expresses everything from joy to rage to the Tas version of nervous laughter.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Once the most powerful male sends weaker competition fleeing, he must prove his worth to his sweetheart. The mating pair will engage in loud, highly aggressive wrestling sessions, and if the female is not impressed, she will move on to another fellow.\nIf the male is powerful and dominant enough, the two will mate several times over the course of a few days. Both males and females may mate with numerous partners during the season, and it is actually possible for one litter of babies to have two, three, or even four different fathers.\nAfter about three weeks of pregnancy the female Tasmanian devil finds a comfortable den and settles in.\nShe will give birth to as many as 30 tiny babies that are blind, hairless, and less than the size of a single grain of rice. They are effectively still just embryos, and must make it to the mothers pouch in order to continue development.\nWithout their mothers help, an army of squirming babies crawl through a forest of belly-hair from the birth canal to the mothers pouch, which is a distance of about 4 inches, (a long trip for a grain of rice).\nThen, in a true example of \"survival of the fittest\" the baby Tasmanian devils find only four teats in the mothers pouch. The four that make it to a teat first survive, the rest perish.\nFour months later, the tough little devils emerge from moms pouch and explore their world.\nThe sound of a litter of devils play fighting is blood-curdling and constant, and by the time they are eight months old, they start off on their own, complaining the whole way.\na devils life in three easy steps\nLike a miniature African lion the always ravenous Tasmanian devil is a \"gorge feeder\" filling up to the brim as long as food is available and then collapsing flat on the ready-to-bust belly, legs outstretched, to digest the huge meal.\nIt goes like this -\nStep One: Scurry about wailing and complaining till you find something dead.\nStep Two: Eat till you're ready to explode.\nStep Three: Sprawl out like a bear-skin rug and process, process, process...\ndevil facial tumor disease\nIn the late 1990's an unusual cancer began to appear in the wild populations of Tasmanian devils.

On average, the lion is the tallest of the big cats, but the Siberian tiger tends to be considerably longer and heavier.\nThe ultimate apex predator and an awesomely beautiful creature, the adult male lion has a flamboyant ruff of remarkably long hair around the head and neck known as a mane, which begins to develop when he is about 10 months old.\nAlthough it has been speculated that the purpose of the mane is to provide protection in fights with other males, it is more likely an indication of fitness, condition and virility and it's color has been found to be linked to testosterone levels.\nLions with darker manes had more testosterone, and were found to be more appealing to female lions, and more intimidating to male opponents.\nAn adult male African lion is over 400 pounds and 4 feet tall at the shoulder. They are equipped with enormous fangs and incredibly powerful necks, forelimbs and claws that allow them to hunt, on average, the largest prey of any land animal.\nRegularly taking down 600 pound plains zebras and 1,300 pound cape buffalo, African lions will also take on giraffes and even elephants in the right situation.\nCompared to other cats, lions are very social animals and live in groups of 5 to 25 individuals called prides. The pride is made up of several related adult females, their cubs, and some adult males.\nThese pride males, often brothers, may come and go, and even be members of more than one pride at a time. They must continually prove themselves as established pride leaders, fending off all other males in serious, sometimes fatal fights.\nThe females hunt together, only occasionally being helped by the male members, but when the hunt is over, the adult males, generally 30 to 40 percent larger, eat first.\nMany adult male lions, however, live alone or in small \"bachelor\" groups, not bold enough or strong enough to take on established males. And pride leaders themselves, worn down from constant battles, will eventually succumb to a stronger rivals and retreat back to a solitary lifestyle.\nAfrican lions roam the grasslands and vast savannas of central and south Africa, The smaller, lighter colored Asiatic lion lives in the jungles of south Asia in very small numbers. - African Lion Facts\nking of the jungle?\nAsiatic lions\nKing of the Jungle? Of the 20,000 lions in the wild, only 500 - 525 highly endangered Asiatic lions live in the Gir jungle of India.\nThe familiar African lion lives on the savanna grasslands of central and southern Africa.\nAsiatic lions are also called Persian lions or Indian lions. They are a bit smaller than African lions, have distinctive skin folds that can be seen running along the sides of the torso, and a much sparser mane.\nThey have been actively protected by the Indian government for the last 30 years, and their small jungle territory was declared a national park where human activity is prohibited.\nThanks to this concerted effort the number of Asiatic lions in the wild has increased from a low of about 250 individuals to over 500 in a fairly short period.\nAwesome African Lions\nAfrican lion reproduction\nlion cub close-up\nThe female lion is poly-estrus, which means she may ovulate up to 4 times a year until she is impregnated. When in estrus or \"heat\", she will pair up with a male of the pride for a few days during which time they will mate repeatedly.\nHer pregnancy takes 3 1/2 to 4 months and when ready to deliver she will leave the pride to find a good nesting spot. She delivers 2 to 4 cubs and remains secluded with them for several weeks before returning to the pride and introducing the new members.\nThis is a dangerous time for mother and cubs, and she will usually fast for days while tending to her young. When she returns to the pride with the new cubs she is greeted with much nuzzling, inspecting and celebrating.\nThe cubs will be nurtured by the whole pride at this point, and if cubs are orphaned, another lioness will usually adopt them and even nurse them.\nFemale cubs will live with the pride their entire lives and never leave. Male cubs will leave the pride, usually driven off by the adult males, when they are about two years old. They will live alone, or band together in small groups of \"bachelor\" males called \"coalitions\" Many male lions will never return to a pride, and will never mate.\nOnly the strongest and boldest will attempt to takeover a pride by driving the established males out. Once a new male or new group of males take over, they will often - but not always- kill the youngest cubs in order to begin their own families.\nThe mothers are helpless against this, but in the life of a lioness this doesn't happen often. New males may come in every two years or so, and if the timing is right, the cubs may be old enough not to be harmed.\nThe main catalyst for the killing of the cubs appears to be an attempt to free up those mother lions to mate again, and, in fact, lionesses who lose their cubs for almost any reason will come back into heat very quickly. - African Lion Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

They may spend years alone or in small bachelor groups of other males called rouges, often made up of brothers.\nAs they mature and grow, they prepare to return to the pride or neighboring prides and unseat the dominant males, in fierce, sometimes fatal battles. If they succeed they will often kill any cubs from the former king.\nNow, as the dominant males, they will mate with the females in the pride as they come into season, and otherwise doze in the sun or sleep in the shade up to 20 hours a day, waiting for the females to catch dinner.\nThey will battle any males who try to overthrow them, and eventually they will loose the fight, after only a few months or short years of glory, and sometimes to one or more of their own sons.\nBanished again from the pride, older and war-weary, they most likely spend the rest of their years on the outside of the pride looking in.\nKind of a thorny crown, don't you think? - African Lion Facts\ngood hair goes a long way\nRivaled only by the horse, the male African lion in full mane is a true icon of the animal kingdom.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "10 facts about zoos | Freedom for Animals", "url": "https://www.freedomforanimals.org.uk/blog/10-facts-about-zoos", "text": "Animals should not spend their entire lives in captivity simply to fulfil our desire to see them. Here are our top ten facts about zoos that you need to know...\n1. Zoos are miserable places for animals\nIn 2010, a Freedom for Animals undercover investigator filmed sick animals left untreated and dead animals to rot on floors at Tweddle Farm Zoo. Freedom for Animals had to take rabbits to a vet to have infections treated and after our expose local police confiscated a monkey who had been kept alone and given cake and other junk food to eat.\nThink safari parks are better than \u2018traditional\u2019 zoos? Woburn Safari Park was keeping its lions locked into small enclosures for 18 hours a day. A government zoo inspection report in 2010 said: \u201cThe animals were very crowded and there was no provision for individual feeding or sleeping areas. There was no visible environmental enrichment. Some of the lions exhibited skin wounds and multiple scars of various age, some fresh, some healed.\u201d\nIn late 2012, another safari park was shamed as West Midland Safari Park was exposed for providing white lion cubs to a notorious circus animal trainer, who sent them to a traveling circus in Japan. The Lions remain in the circus today.\nA government-funded study of elephants in UK zoos found \u201cthere was a welfare concern for every elephant in the UK.\u201d 75% of elephants were overweight and only 16% could walk normally, the remainder having various degrees of lameness. Less than 20% were totally free of foot problems.\n2. Zoos can\u2019t provide sufficient space\nZoos cannot provide the amount of space animals have in the wild. This is particularly the case for those species who roam larger distances in their natural habitat. Tigers and lions have around 18,000 times less space in zoos than they would in the wild. Polar bears have one million times less space.\n3. Animals suffer in zoos\nA government-funded study of elephants in UK zoos found that 54% of the elephants showed stereotypies (behavioural problems) during the daytime. One elephant observed during day and night stereotyped for 61% of a 24-hour period.\nLions in zoos spend 48% of their time pacing, a recognised sign of behavioural problems.\n4. Animals die prematurely in zoos\nAfrican elephants in the wild live more than three times as long as those kept in zoos. Even Asian elephants working in timber camps live longer than those born in zoos.\n40% of lion cubs die before one month of age. In the wild, only 30% of cubs are thought to die before they are six months old and at least a third of those deaths are due to factors which are absent in zoos, like predation.\n5. Surplus animals are killed\nA Freedom for Animals study found that at least 7,500 animals \u2013 and possibly as many as 200,000 \u2013 in European zoos are \u2018surplus\u2019 at any one time.\nAnimals are regularly \u2018culled\u2019 in UK zoos. In 2006 the whole pack of wolves at Highland Wildlife Park were killed after the social structure of the pack had broken down. In 2005 two wolf cubs and an adult female were shot dead at Dartmoor Wildlife Park. The vet reported: \u201cSelective cull due to overcrowding and fighting in the pack\u201d and \u201cFurther cull of cubs needed\u201d. In 2001 a DEFRA zoo inspection of Dartmoor Wildlife Park in October 2001 found that \u201cseveral significant dead animals\u201d were stored in a food freezer \u201cfor taxidermy in the future\u201d.\nThe European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) said in 2007 that member zoos were being actively encouraged to kill unwanted animals, including tigers, if other zoos did not want them and if they were hybrids. It said that such animals take up space and keeper time.\nIn 2010, zoo trade bodies rallied to the defence of a German zoo which was prosecuted for breaching animal welfare laws after it killed three tiger cubs because they were not pure-blooded (hybrid).\nIn 2011, an expos\u00e9 of Knowsley Safari Park led by Freedom for Animals following information provided by a whistleblower showed the safari park to be in contravention of legislation on disposal of carcasses as well as raising queries over handling of firearms. A former employee of the safari park alleged: \u201cculling was being used as a means of training instead of being carried out in the kindest and most humane way.\u201d\nIn early 2014, there was global outrage when Copenhagen Zoo killed a healthy young giraffe called Marius. The event triggered a worldwide debate on culling in zoos and it was admitted by zoo spokespeople that thousands of healthy animals are deliberately killed in European zoos alone each year.\n6. UK zoos are connected to animal circuses\nFreedom for Animals exposed a UK zoo in 2009 that was a member of the trade body BIAZA (which supposedly upholds the highest standards) as having a breeding connection with a controversial animal circus. Noah\u2019s Ark Zoo Farm had been breeding camels from the Great British Circus for several years and in 2009 obtained three tigers from the circus.\nA female tiger at the zoo had three stillborn cubs and another who died at three weeks old. The mother also died.\nThe same zoo was found to doing business with another circus animal trainer in 2013. This was the same trainer who had been sold lion cubs by West Midland Safari Park and sent them to a traveling circus in Japan.\n7. Animals are trained to perform tricks\nMany zoos train animals to perform tricks as if they were in a circus. Performing sea lions, birds and elephants can be seen at many UK zoos.\nSome training of elephants has been done using electric goads. Freedom for Animals infiltrated a training session held at Blackpool Zoo in 1998 and filmed elephants being trained to lift their feet and head, hold sticks in their mouths and jabbed with elephant hooks in the shoulder and head.\nIn 2010 it was revealed that an elephant at Woburn Safari Park had previously been trained using an electric goad .\nBlackpool Zoo proudly publicised its training of a baby sea lion for shows in mid 2013 . This is in spite of the fact that the UK Government has agreed to ban similar shows in circuses on the basis that: \u201cwe should feel duty-bound to recognise that wild animals have intrinsic value, and respect their inherent wildness and its implications for their treatment\u201d.\n8. Animals are still taken from the wild\nIn 2003 the UK government gave permission for the capture of 146 penguins from a British territory in the South Atlantic (Tristan da Cunha). Those who survived the seven-day boat journey from Tristan to a wildlife dealer in South Africa were sold to zoos in Asia .\nIn 2010, Zimbabwe planned to capture two of every mammal species found in Hwange National Park and send them to North Korean zoos. This included rhinos, lions, cheetahs, zebras and giraffes as well as two 18-month-old elephants. The plan was only stopped after international pressure by a coalition of organisations including Freedom for Animals.\n70% of elephants in European zoos were taken from the wild .\nA Freedom for Animals study found that 79% of all animals in UK aquariums were caught in the wild. Sea Life aquariums admitted to taking animals from the wild as recently as 2013, but refused to provide information on how many of the animals held by them were wild-caught.\n9. Zoos don\u2019t serve conservation\nZoos claim to breed animals for eventual release to the wild but breeding programmes are primarily to ensure a captive population, not for reintroduction.\nLions are popular in zoos, but the vast majority \u201care \u2018generic\u2019 animals of hybrid or unknown subspecific status, and therefore of little or no value in conservation terms .\nZoo director David Hancocks said: \u201cThere is a commonly held misconception that zoos are not only saving wild animals from extinction but also reintroducing them to their wild habitats. The confusion stems from many sources, all of them zoo-based\u2026 In reality, most zoos have had no contact of any kind with any reintroduction program.\u201d\nCaptive breeding is considered by some conservation scientists to be a diversion from the reasons for a species\u2019 decline, giving \u201ca false impression that a species is safe so that destruction of habitat and wild populations can proceed\u201d.\nZoos spend millions on keeping animals confined, while natural habitats are destroyed and animals killed as there is insufficient funding for protection. When London Zoo spent \u00a35.3 million on a new gorilla enclosure, the chief consultant to the UN Great Ape Survival Project said he was uneasy at the mismatch between lavish spending at zoos and the scarcity of resources available for conserving threatened species in the wild.\n\u201cFive million pounds for three gorillas when national parks are seeing that number killed every day for want of some Land Rovers and trained men and anti-poaching patrols. It must be very frustrating for the warden of a national park to see\u201d.\nMeasures to protect giant pandas\u2019 habitat also supports hundreds of species of mammals, at least 200 birds, dozens of reptiles and over half of the plants known to exist in China .\nIn 2013, Freedom for Animals revealed that the UK\u2019s largest aquarium operator, Sea Life, could trace less than 3 pence per visitor to in situ conservation projects.\n10. Zoos fail education\nA Freedom for Animals study of UK aquariums found that 41% of the animals on display had no signs identifying their species \u2013 the most basic of information.\nA US study found no compelling evidence for the claim that zoos and aquariums promote attitude change, education, or interest in conservation in visitors. The study authors urged zoos to stop citing a zoo-funded study which claimed an educational benefit from visits \u201cas this conclusion is unwarranted and potentially misleading to consumers.\u201d\nIn 2010, a Government-commissioned study found that \u201cConcerns remain, however, with regard to the lack of available evidence about the effectiveness\u201d of conservation and education projects in zoos.\nAnimals in zoos are suffering.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Llama Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Llama-facts.html", "text": "Llama Facts\nPortrait of a Llama\nOne of the most impressive llama facts, is that llamas were instrumental in the building of the ancient city of Machu Picchu. The llama was domesticated in Peru between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago. It is a member of the camel family, and shares a few features of the camel such as a long neck and a cleft top lip, but it does not share the camels ability to survive long periods without water.\nThere are four very similar looking camel type animals in South America, known, not surprisingly, as the South American, or New World camels. They are the llama and the alpaca, which are domestic animals, and the vicuna and the guanaco which are wild species.\nLlamas and alpacas are both descended from the guanaco, which still roams free across the mountains of South America. Peruvian people in the Andes mountains captured and tamed the guanacos, using them for milk and meat.\nEventually, careful, selective breeding created the llama, an animal that was considerably larger, and could be used to carry loads along steep mountain roads in high elevations. Llamas were essential to the development of civilization in the Andes, and eventually to the rise of the Inca Empire.\nThey carried building materials for the creation of great masterpieces such as the incredible mountain city of Machu Picchu, and the use of their dung allowed people to plant vital crops such as corn, in otherwise very difficult farm land.\nThe llama, and its smaller cousin the alpaca, which is used mostly for its wool, are completely domesticated animals, and are not found in the wild. They are specially suited to life in the cold, high altitudes of the Andes mountain range, which stretches across the South American nations of Peru, Argentina, Chile, Ecuador and Bolivia.\nLiving in rarefied air, at altitudes of up to 13,000 feet above sea level, their specialized blood has oval shaped corpuscles and high amounts of red blood cells which allow for added oxygen absorption. They also have advanced lung capacity and massive hearts.\nLlamas have soft, padded, cloven feet designed for negotiating rocky areas. They have two separate, long toes with a nail on the end of each, that allow for excellent traction on rocky surfaces, and they are strong and agile climbers, using their long necks for balance.\nwild guanaco in the Andes mountains\nLlamas have large eyes and excellent vision, designed for life in the mountains where the sky is bright, and snow falls regularly. To help with glare and avoid snow-blindness, their eyes are designed with special sunshades built in, that look like a curtain of ruffles hanging in the eyeball, and close like Venetian blinds when needed.\nLlamas ruminate, meaning they ferment food in their stomach, and then regurgitate and re-chew it, but they are not considered ruminants, because they have three chambers in their stomach instead of four. The stomach allows them to digest very difficult vegetation, and extract as much nutrition as possible. In facts, with one less chamber than a sheep, the well-designed llama still extracts about 20% more nutrients from the same foodstuffs.\nThe coat of the llama is made of strong, soft fibers and can be weaved into a sturdy cloth used for making bags, coats and blankets. Llama wool is processed just like sheeps wool, by shearing the fur annually. A single llama can produce about 4 pounds of wool, which tends to be lite weight and very warm.\nllama lifestyle\nLlama in the Andes - the \"Silent Brother\"\nLlama at Machu Picchu\nThe llama is a sacred animal in the culture of the Andean people, who call them \"silent brothers\". Images of llamas appear throughout the art of the culture dating back thousands of years, and occur almost as often as images of the sun.\nThe llama is, in fact, a relatively quiet animal, communicating with a series of clicks, gurgles and hums, and it is also remarkably clean, with little of the odor one might expect from such a large animal. Their dung is surprisingly low-odor as well, and most llamas will use the same place to relieve themselves, making them easy to clean up after.\nUnlike the camel, however, llamas need fresh water daily, although they drink considerably less than a horse or cow of comparable size.\nOur domestic partner for thousands of years, the llama was used as a food source, its milk was used to make an assortment of dishes, its wool was used to make blankets and traditional clothing, its dung was used as fertilizer, and in dried form, could be burned for fuel.\nOver the years, modern conveniences have overtaken the importance of the llama in civilization, but this peaceful, beautiful animal, which comes in an assortment of fabulous colors and seeks out human attention, has found its way into all corners of the world not just as a source of wool, but as a companion animal. Llamas and alpacas as pets number in the hundreds of thousands in the United States.\nKept simply as pets, their neat habits and social personalities had made them very popular. They require minimum shelter and are not fussy about food. In a very convenient remnant of their wild days, when they needed to mark the perimeters of their territories, all members of the herd use a communal \"dung pile\", so cleaning up the pasture is a snap.\nAs a testimony to the popularity of these creatures, an activity known as \"llama trekking\" is offered by some llama farms, where visitors pay a fee to lead a llama around the property on a little nature walk.\nLlamas are herd animals that live in large social groups and need company desperately. Solitary llamas will bond with other animals in an attempt to ease their loneliness. The natural process is for dominant males to gather a harem of females and guard them from the intrusion of other males. So farmers have found a way to exploit the natural guarding tendencies of the male llama, by using them as a kind of sheepdog.\nA single male llama introduced to a herd of sheep, alpaca, or similar smaller herding animal, will quickly become attached, claim the herd as their own, and defend them, quite successfully from animals such as fox and coyote.\nLlamas, as it turns out, can be incredibly brave, bold, and fearless in the face of predators, but in the face of multiple attackers or larger animals like mountain lions or wolves, the llama is very vigilant and will sound a piercing alarm. Occasionally, ranchers have reported stories of scuffles overheard in the night, and the trampled bodies of coyotes, wolves and even small bears being found in the llama pen in the morning - Amazing!\nLlama facts on reproduction\nbaby llamas and baby alpacas\nllama mother and cria\nLllamas are like stallions in that adult males left intact can be difficult to handle, may pester and constantly try to mount females and even other animals, and may fight, sometimes violently, with other intact males.\nAt two years of age, young male llamas sprout 6 new teeth designed specifically for fighting, and appropriately called \"fighting teeth.\" These teeth, four on top, and two in the bottom jaw, are hooked, rearward facing, and razor sharp. Male llamas will use them against eachother by slashing at ears, legs, and even genitals! That's a real stunner as far as llama facts go!\nFighting teeth are removed from most llamas as soon as they come in, and most male llamas that are not used for breeding are gelded, just like stallions, making them much safer to have around.\nWhen breeding, a single male llama is usually kept with a small herd of females, and without competition, things remain peaceful. Llamas and alpacas are one of the few animals that mate with the female in a kush position, lying with her legs folded under her.\nFemale llamas have a long pregnancy of 11 months. The other females will gather around the mother when she's ready to deliver, calming her, and looking out for danger. She usually has a two-part labor, where the head first appears, and then she may stand around for a few minutes with the babies head and front feet protruding, before pushing again. Llamas generally give birth standing up, and the baby is stimulated by dropping to the ground.\nThe llamas tongue doesn't stick out far from the mouth, so she doesn't lick the baby as most mammal mothers do.\nThey generally have a single baby, and the baby llama is called a cria, which is a Spanish word for baby. The cria has incredibly long legs, and can stand and walk within the first 40 minutes. Youngsters are weaned by about 8 months old.\na baby llama is called a cria\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Sometimes, however, we simply don't care for the form of expression. But to llamas, spitting is just part of their vocabulary.\nLiving in herds with constantly changing dynamics, these complicated animals challenge eachother for dominance and status, and spitting is one of the ways that they show their contempt or superiority.\nThe best thing about llama spit is that they usually give plenty of warning, including raising their chins, pinning their ears, and giving a preliminary spit that includes the spiffing sound and a little saliva, but none of the runny green juice they are saving up if you're not paying attention.\nAfter they spit, they hang their lower lip in an expression called \"sour mouth\" in reaction to the stomach acid they just projected.\nLllamas don't spit often, and they never spit without a reason, especially in their own minds.\nFemales spit specifically to show disinterest in a male who wants to mate. This is such a common behavior that llama breeders use a \"spit test\" to determine if a female is pregnant or not. If she ignores him or shows interest, she may need to be bred again, but if she spits at him, she's is most likely pregnant and no longer needs his services.\nDominant llamas will spit if subordinates don't clear out at the food trough.\nLlamas will spit during fights and in self-defense in general.\nAnd a male llama trying to establish dominance will spit on his competition, and invite him to neck wrestle.\nFinally, there are those that suggest that llamas spit on you because they think your family. The theory is that if you coddle them and bottle feed them as babies, they grow up thinking you're just one of the gang, and spit on you accordingly.\nLikewise, if you are clearly the boss, and the llamas respect your authority, you should be safe from a spit-wad.\nOn the other hand, if you act too tough, and a sensitive llama feels threatened, well, here we go again...\nwhat's the difference between llamas and alpacas?\nalpacas on left and llamas on right\nThere are several differences between llamas and alpacas, but the most obvious is the difference in size. Llamas are about 42 to 48 inches at the shoulder, while alpacas are only 32 to 36 inches at the shoulder. Alpacas are usually less than 200 pounds, while llamas may be as much as 450 pounds.\nIf you're just looking at a photo and can't judge the size, the ears are the easiest way to tell. Llamas ears have an inward curve to them and are referred to as \"banana-shaped\", while alpaca ears are straight and a little blunter. The alpacas muzzle is shorter, the head is more rounded and the cheeks are fuller. Some alpacas look quite a bit like the Ewoks from Star Wars.\nIf you're viewing the body, alpacas have a slightly curved topline, while the llamas back is straight.\nAlpacas don't have guard hairs, so their coat is soft and silky. They usually have very full top-knots as well. They are much more shy, and sometimes even timid or skittish compared to llamas. People who have worked with both, say that alpacas are more like cats, while llamas are more like dogs - in a very broad sense.\nWhile llamas were bred for thousands of years as pack animals, alpacas were bred almost exclusively for their wool, and they come in two different types. The Huacaya has soft, plush fiber like a sheep, and the Suri, has a long, silky, separated coat that looks a little like dreadlocks.\nThese animals produce a cloth more luxurious than cashmere, and the alpacas themselves can be worth, beleive it or not, hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nalpacas closeup\na few more llama facts\nLlamas have been domesticated for about 5,000 years\nThe llama has specially shaped blood cells to store oxygen in high altitudes\nMale llamas grow sharp \"fighting teeth\" and may damage eachother if they aren't removed\nLlamas were used to carry the building materials during the construction of Machu Picchu\nLlama herds hum in unison\nA baby llama is called a cria\nAlpacas and llamas often interbreed, and the result is called a huarizo\nSome alpacas are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, do to their exceptional wool, called \"fiber\"\nAlpaca fiber is softer than cashmere\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Artiodactyla\nFamily Camilidae\nGenus Lama\nSpecies glama\nLlama - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT macho hembra cria group GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD herd South America mountains hay TOPSPEED ENDANGERED AVG WEIGHT AVG HEIGHT 35 mph no 250-400 pounds 42-48 inches\nat shoulder ESTRUS GESTATION BIRTH HEIGHT BIRTHWEIGHT induced 11 months 24-26 inches 20-30 pounds RAISED BY # OF YOUNG AT BIRTH STANDS UP mother 1\neyes open 40 minutes WEANED INDEPENDENT MATURITY LIFESPAN 8 months 1 year 2 years 15-25 years"}

The Galapagos Islands nearest mainland, Ecuador, lies 600 miles (970 kilometres) to the East. The Galapagos archipelago, with a population of around 30,000, is a province of Ecuador, a country in northwestern South America, and the islands are all part of Ecuadors national park system. The main language on the islands is Spanish.\nGalapagos consists of 13 main islands, 6 smaller islands and 107 rocks and islets (a small island). The islands first appeared on maps in about 1570 in those drawn by Abraham Ortelius (a cartographer (map maker) and geographer, generally recognised as the creator of the first modern atlas) and Mercator (a Flemish cartographer). The islands were called \u2018Insulae de los Galopegos\u2019 (Islands of the Tortoises).\nThe Galapagos Islands were made famous as the islands that formed Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution after his exploration in HMS Beagle in 1835.\nThe Galapagos archipelago has been known by many different names, including the \u2018Enchanted Islands\u2019 because of the way in which the strong and swift currents made navigation difficult.\nThe term \u2018Gal\u00e1pagos\u2019 refers to the Spanish name given to the Giant Land Tortoises known to inhabit the islands.\nThe Galapagos Islands are a living laboratory where most of the animals and birds have no fear of man. The isles are mainly well known for their wildlife, flightless birds, giant reptiles and wild plant life which play a major part in the earths ecosystem. Many say that these islands are a bird-watchers paradise.\nThe endemic (unique) flightless birds are so human-fearless, they can be approached very closely and will not retreat away from you, something you will not find anywhere else.\nAnother unique attraction on the islands, are the giant tortoises, the giant tortoise is also the islands icon, used on souvenirs, stamps and the National Park logo.\nOne of the most amazing things about the climate of the islands is, although the islands are tropical and warm, the surrounding ocean can be extremely cold.\nThe plant life of Galapagos is just as extraordinary as its wildlife, although it has received less attention and publicity. There are many threats facing the vegetation, however, and world attention is currently focussed on raising funds for botany campaigns to safeguard endangered species and control the many invasive plants introduced to the islands by humans."}

The caribou has a short, stocky body that conserves heat, but its legs are long to help it move through the deep snow. Its winter coat provides insulation from the cold, and its muzzle and tail are short and covered in hair.\nThe caribou\u2019s hooves are large and hollowed out. These make a handy tool for scooping up lichen, an important food source, that\u2019s under snow. Although caribou can withstand the cold temperatures and harsh terrain of the Arctic tundra, they have a tough time coping with insects in the summer. They have been known to run for kilometres just to escape the hordes of pesky bugs!\nThe caribou is the only member of the deer family where both males and females grow antlers. The antlers of the female are smaller than those of the male, but they are carried for a longer period of time. Male caribou shed their antlers in November or December, after mating. Females will often carry theirs until June, after they have given birth, to help them defend food sources while nursing their calves.\nCaribou live all across Canada and are present in the northern regions of all the provinces, except Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. But even with such a large range, these animals are in danger. Recent studies show that of the 51 herds that live in Canada, at least 20 are in decline. Not a single one is growing.\nFast Facts: Caribou\nScientific name: Rangifer tarandus\nAverage weight: 55 kilograms to 318 kilograms\nAverage lifespan: 10 to 15 years\nAntler Antics\nUnlike other members of the deer family, both male and female caribou sport antlers for part of the year.\nEither/Or\n\u201cReindeer\u201d is the name given to caribou in Scandinavia and Russia, but reindeer and caribou are actually the same species, rangifer tarandus.\nExtended Family\nThere are several subspecies of caribou.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffe Anatomy | Neck, Hide and Horns of a Giraffe", "url": "https://animalcorner.org/giraffe-anatomy/", "text": "As you can see from the diagram below, the Giraffe is a very tall animal measuring a maximum of 19 feet (6 metres). The neck is a remarkable feature on a giraffe. It is still a mind-boggling characteristic of this animal.\nDuring evolution, like most mammals, the giraffes internal system synchronized to suit its lifestyle and the special valves grew simultaneously with the giraffes heart and neck. The legs on a giraffe are also very long and if you look at the picture, you will see that the front legs are longer than the back legs. This gives the giraffe the \u2018sloped back\u2019 look.\nGiraffe Neck\nA giraffes neck can measure over 1.5 metres (5 feet) in length, however, it contains only seven vertebrae the same number as in most other mammals, including humans. These vertebrae are extremely long and are separated by very flexible joints. At the base of the neck, the thoracic vertebrae have spines that project upward, forming a hump over the shoulders. These bones support muscles that hold the neck upright, in the same way that cables hold up a construction crane.\nThe giraffes neck is so long that body modifications had to be required during evolution from shorter-necked animals like the Okapi. The heart of the giraffe would have to be very large in order to pump blood to the brain whilst the giraffe was bent over having a drink. Unfortunately, too much blood being pumped to its brain at one time would be fatal. This is why it does not happen. The giraffe has special valves in the vessels in its neck to ensure that the blood flow is adequate. These special valves are called \u2018Eukaryote\u2019.\nGiraffe Hide\nGiraffes hides are a spectacular array of polygon shaped patches, usually brown in color. This hide is unique to each giraffe \u2013 no two hides are the same. Giraffes hides also help them to camouflage from predators in trees and woodland. The polygons are larger on the body than on the face and limbs and their underbelly usually has no pattern at all. Giraffes have short, dense fur with a unique pattern of dark patches that range from beige to chestnut brown.\nAlthough no two giraffe skin patterns are exactly the same, some regional patterns are so common and distinct that zoologists have identified a number of giraffe subspecies based on the patterns. One of the most striking of these subspecies is the reticulated giraffe, which has large brown patches separated by thin contrasting lines, making a pattern that looks like broken paving. Another variety, the Masai giraffe, has patches with complex jagged outlines. In all giraffes, the coat color tends to become darker with age.\nGiraffe Horns\nThe heads of both male and female giraffes have a pair of hair-covered horns called ossicones, which are permanently covered by skin and ending in a tuft of black hair. Male giraffes use their horns to playfully fight with one another. The horns of male giraffes are larger than those of female giraffes, growing up to 25 centimetres (about 10 inches) long.\nAs male giraffes age, calcium deposits form on their skulls and other horn-like bumps develop. Giraffes can have up to three of these large bumps, two in the rear of the skull and one in the forehead region, so that it may look like they have five horns.\nThis characteristic which is found in no other mammal is linked to the fights that male giraffes stage to establish dominance for mating.\nTheir small horns on top of their heads are covered in hair and are quite often used in combat between males (bulls), particularly when conflicting for dominance over a mating partner. The horns on female giraffes are quite smaller and more tufty.\nGiraffes have a small hump on their backs. Giraffes have a spotted pattern similar to that of a leopard. For a long time people called the giraffe a camel-leopard, because they believed that it was a combination of a camel and a leopard. This is where the giraffes species name comes from.\nGiraffes long tongues, which measure about 18 \u2013 20 inches long, act like a hand and allow the giraffes to grab hold of leaves and twigs and drag them into its mouth.\nJust like cows and goats, the giraffe is also a ruminant animal which means they have a four part chamber stomach. Giraffes chew their food, but later regurgitate it, chew it again and then swallow it. It is only after the food has been swallowed for the second time that it passes through the four stomach chambers."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Giraffidae - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffidae", "text": "Family of mammals belonging to even-toed ungulates\nThe Giraffidae are a family of ruminant artiodactyl mammals that share a common ancestor with cervids and bovids. This family, once a diverse group spread throughout Eurasia and Africa, presently comprises only two extant genera, the giraffe (one or more species of Giraffa, depending on taxonomic interpretation) and the okapi (the only known species of Okapia). Both are confined to sub-Saharan Africa: the giraffe to the open savannas, and the okapi to the dense rainforest of the Congo. The two genera look very different on first sight, but share a number of common features, including a long, dark-coloured tongue, lobed canine teeth, and horns covered in skin, called ossicones.\nTaxonomy [ edit ]\nEvolutionary background [ edit ]\nShansitherium and Palaeotragus microdon, two giraffids from the Miocene of Asia and, two giraffids from the Miocene of Asia\nThe giraffids are ruminants of the clade Pecora. Other extant pecorans are the families Antilocapridae (pronghorns), Cervidae (deer), Moschidae (musk deer), and Bovidae (cattle, goats and sheep, wildebeests and allies, and antelopes). The exact interrelationships among the pecorans have been debated, mainly focusing on the placement of Giraffidae, but a recent large-scale ruminant genome sequencing study suggests Antilocapridae are the sister taxon to Giraffidae, as shown in the cladogram below.\nThe ancestors of pronghorn diverged from the giraffids in the Early Miocene. This was in part of a relatively late mammal diversification following a climate change that transformed subtropical woodlands into open savannah grasslands.\nThe fossil record of giraffids and their stem-relatives is quite intensive, with fossil of these taxa include Gelocidae, Palaeomerycidae, Prolibytheridae, and Climacoceratidae. It is thought the palaeomerycids is the ancestral group that given rise to the prolibytherids, climacoceratids and the giraffids, all three forming a clade of pecorans known as Giraffomorpha. The relationship between the climacoceratids and giraffids is supported by the presence of a bilobed canine, and have been postulated into two hypotheses. One is the climacoceratids were the ancestors of the sivatheres, as both groups were large, deer-like giraffoids with branching antler-like ossicones, while an extinct basal group of giraffoids, canthumerycines, evolved into the ancestors of Giraffidae. Another more commonly supported hypothesis is climacoceratids were merely the sister clade to giraffids, with sivatheres being either basal giraffids or descended from a lineage that also includes the okapi. While the current range of giraffids today is in Africa, the fossil record of the group has shown this family was once widespread throughout of Eurasia.\nBelow is the phylogenetic relationships of giraffomorphs after Solounias (2007), S\u00e1nchez et al. (2015) and R\u00edos et al. (2017):\nClassification [ edit ]\nHelladotherium, now extinct Skeletal illustration of, now extinct\nBelow is the total taxonomy of valid extant and fossil taxa (as well as junior synonyms which are listed in the brackets).\nFamily Giraffidae J.E.Gray, 1821\nCharacteristics [ edit ]\nTwo giraffes\nThe giraffe stands 5\u20136 m (16\u201320 ft) tall, with males taller than females. The giraffe and the okapi have characteristic long necks and long legs. Ossicones are present on males and females in the giraffe, but only on males in the okapi.\nGiraffids share many common features with other ruminants. They have cloven hooves and cannon bones, much like bovids, and a complex, four-chambered stomach. They have no upper incisors or upper canines, replacing them with a tough, horny pad. An especially long diastema is seen between the front and cheek teeth. The latter are selenodont, adapted for grinding up tough plant matter. Like most other ruminants, the dental formula for giraffids is 0.0.3.33.1.3.3. Giraffids have prehensile tongues (specially adapted for grasping).\nThe extant giraffids, the forest-dwelling okapi and the savannah-living giraffe, have several features in common, including a pair of skin-covered horns, called ossicones, up to 15 cm (5.9 in) long (absent in female okapis); a long, black, prehensile tongue; lobed canine teeth; patterned coats acting as camouflage; and a back sloping towards the rear. The okapi's neck is long compared to most ruminants, but not nearly so long as the giraffe's. Male giraffes are the tallest of all mammals: their horns reach 5.5 m (18 ft) above the ground and their shoulder 3.3 m (11 ft), whereas the okapi has a shoulder height of 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in).\nDistribution [ edit ]\nThe two extant genera are now confined to sub-Saharan Africa. The okapi is restricted to a small range in the northern rainforest of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Although the range of the giraffe is considerably larger, it once covered an area twice the present size \u2014 all parts of Africa that could offer an arid and dry landscape furnished with trees.\nBehavior [ edit ]\nThe social structure and behavior is markedly different in okapis and giraffes, but although little is known of the okapi's behavior in the wild, a few things are known to be present in both species:\nThey have an ambling gait similar to camels, with their weight supported alternately by their left and right legs, while their necks maintain balance. Giraffes can run up to 60 km/h (37 mph) this way and are documented to have covered 1,500 km (930 mi) in the Sahel during the dry season.\nThe dominance hierarchy, which has been well-documented among giraffes, has also been seen among captive okapis. An adult giraffe head can weigh 30 kg (66 lb), and if necessary, male giraffes establish a hierarchy among themselves by swinging their heads at each other, horns first, a behavior known as \"necking\". A subordinate okapi signals submission by placing its head and neck on the ground.\nGiraffes are sociable, whereas okapis live mainly solitary lives. Giraffes temporarily form herds of up to 20 individuals; these herds can be mixed or uniform groups of males and females, young and adults. Okapis are normally seen in mother-offspring pairs, although they occasionally gather around a prime food source. Giraffe are not territorial, but have ranges that can dramatically vary between \u2014 5 and 654 km2 (1.9 and 252.5 sq mi) \u2014 depending on food availability, whereas okapis have individual ranges about 2.5\u20135 km2 (0.97\u20131.93 sq mi) in size.\nGiraffes and okapis are normally silent, but both have a range of vocalizations, including coughing, snorting, moaning, hissing, and whistling. Giraffes have been suggested to be able to communicate using infrasonic sounds like elephants and blue whales.\nNotes [ edit ]\n^ A grade of giraffids. ^ A paraphyletic grade of palaeotragines ancestral to Sivatheriinae."}

Most ruminants have a four-chambered stomach and two-toed feet. The upper incisors are reduced or sometimes absent. Camels and chevrotains, however, have a three-chambered stomach and are often referred to as pseudoruminants.\nRuminants eat quickly. However, they are unable to digest grasses, foliage, and other types of plant material directly, for their bodies do not produce enzymes capable of breaking down cellulose. Digestion occurs sequentially in a multichambered stomach. In ruminants with a four-chambered stomach, ingested plant material is stored in the first chamber, called the rumen, where it softens. They later regurgitate this material, called cud, and chew it again to further break down its cellulose content, which is difficult to digest. The chewed cud goes directly to the other chambers of the stomach (the reticulum, omasum, and abomasum), where it is further digested with the aid of various essential microorganisms that live in the stomach. The pseudoruminant digestive process is very similar, also involving regurgitation and cud chewing, though the stomach is divided into three chambers."}

Sharp. Please Note: Each coloured link within the article will lead you to a related topic on a different page of this site. However while the text is part of the original article, the links are not. The author of this article may or may not agree with the views expressed on those pages, or anything else on this site.. Also See Scientific Facts in The Bible & The Case For Christianity Also See The Trilobite\u0092s Eye: An Embarrassment to Evolution and The Cleaner Fish\n(Both Below) A fundamental concept of the theory of evolution is that of gradual change from a \"primitive,\" less complex organism into a highly structured organism over an imagined period of millions of years. How valid is this idea? Can we really verify the evidence supporting this idea? There are many animals existing today that totally defy evolution by their very existence. This chapter will give examples of some of these animals and explain the problems they pose the theory of evolution. The logical frame of reference used in concluding that these animals could not have been the product of evolution is called an indirect proof. The way this works is to assume the opposite of what you wish to prove, proceed logically until you reach a contradiction or an impasse, then conclude that the alternative is true. In this chapter, we will use the concept of indirect proof with evolution, proceed logically until we reach an dead end, leaving creation as the only other alternative. The realization that each animal is an interdependent, interrelated system was the greatest factor that influenced me to believe that evolution could not have occurred. To survive in a particular environment, an animal has to have features that work in that environment. For example, air breathing animals needs lungs. Flying creatures need wings. If evolution is valid, transitions from one environment to another had to have occurred. If such transitions are impossible, evolution is impossible! Gradual evolutionary change from one species to another requires many mutations and genetic changes. But, the fossil record exhibits anything but gradual change. There is a gap between living systems and non-life, invertebrates and vertebrates, fish and amphibians, amphibians and reptiles, reptiles and birds, reptiles and mammals, and mammals and man.\nDolphins and Whales\nWe can demonstrate one such transition problem by using the example of dolphins and whales. These mammals bear their young alive and breathe air, yet spend their entire lifetime in the sea. Presumably, in order for dolphins and whales to have evolved, they must have originated from a land mammal that returned to the water and changed into a sea creature. But dolphins and whales have so many remarkable features upon which their survival depends that they couldn't have evolved! It would be a lot like trying to change a bus into a submarine one part at a time, all the while it is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The following is a list of transitions evolutionists have to account for in the dolphin in its evolution from some unknown land dwelling pre-dolphin: \u00d7 The nose would have to move to the back of the head. \u00d7 Feet, claws, or tail would be exchanged for fins and flippers. \u00d7 It would have to develop a torpedo shaped body for efficient swimming in the water. \u00d7 It would have to be able to drink sea water and desalinize it. \u00d7 It's entire bone structure and metabolism would have to be rearranged. \u00d7 It would need to develop a sophisticated sonar system to search for food. Could the dolphin acquire these features gradually one at a time over a period of millions of years? What about the transitional stages? Would they have survived with just some of these features? Why is there a total absence of transitional forms fossilized? Consider the whale and its enormous size in comparison with the plankton it feeds upon. The whale is a nautical vacuum cleaner, with a baleen filter. While it was \"developing\" this feature, what did it feed upon before? For me, it takes a great stretch of the imagination to picture the evolution of dolphins and whales.\nThe Duckbill Platypus |\nThe explorer who first saw a hide of the duckbill platypus thought that it was composed of the hides of several different animals sewn together as a joke. Later, when a preserved specimen was brought to him for dissection, he finally declared it outrageous, but genuine! The more you study the duckbill platypus, the more problems you find for evolutionists. Here is a list of some of its features: 1 \u00d7 It is a furbearing mammal. \u00d7 It lays eggs, yet suckles its young. \u00d7 It has a ducklike bill, which has built within it a heat sensitive worm finding radar. \u00d7 Its tail is flat like a beaver's, yet furry. \u00d7 It has webbed feet in front, clawed feet in the rear. \u00d7 The reproductive systems are uniquely different from the rest of the animal world, but mostly mammalian in nature. \u00d7 The only other known monotreme, or egg-laying mammal is echidna or spiny anteater. Except for the fact that it lays eggs, it is about as different as you can get from the platypus. Can you imagine what a pre-platypus might have looked like? Nothing in the fossil record gives us a clue about the origin of this animal, which is an outrage to evolutionists. This animal does very well in its natural environment in spite of its unusual features. To look at it, it would appear that this animal was pieced together from a variety of completely different animals.\nThe Koala\nKoalas are marsupials that spend nearly their entire lives high in eucalyptus trees. Their diet consists of eucalyptus leaves toxic to humans. They survive without drinking water or shelter, survive high temperatures by panting, and a well insulated coat protects them from the cold.  One of the greatest \"advances\" of man according to the theory of evolution is the grasping hand with the opposable thumb. But, many apes also have a foot with an opposable great toe. Not to be outdone, the koala not only has an opposable great toe, but two opposable digits on each hand. Now, also, the first digit of the foot lacks claws, but the second has two claws! Consider the evolutionist's argument for a claw to migrate from one toe to another over eons of time! One might imagine a double mutation, one that would delete a gene from one place and paste it elsewhere, or you could just believe that the koala was created that way. This would be like a baby born without a fingernail on the index finger, but two fingernails on the middle finger. What about the unique pouch that opens aft? This feature is similar to that of the wombat, which is a completely different animal than the koala. What could the ancestry of the koala have been to account for these features, especially since transitional forms are missing in the fossils? Most marsupials are confined to the isolated continent of Australia. Why then is the opossum so widespread in America? It is highly unlikely that one species of marsupial would be so highly removed from its ancestors.\nThis Theory Is For The Birds!\nProponents of the theory of evolution would have us believe that reptiles began to grow appendages on their back as extensions of scales, and these appendages supposedly developed over periods of millions of years into wings and feathers. Then, they believe that these reptiles began to climb trees and attempted to jump out and fly. Imagine all the ancestral birds attempting to do this until one day one of them had wings structured properly and took off and flew. There is nothing that is gradual about a transition from a land environment to an air environment, or a land to sea, or sea to land. Such a transition does not take millions of years, either you can fly or you can't; either you breathe air or have gills. One of the most complex structures in the animal kingdom is the feather. The feather is lightweight, yet very strong and sturdy. It is made up of a network of fibrils that interconnect with one another in such a way providing the best economy of surface area for the weight. There is a main stem serving as the main support for the feather. It branches out into tributary stems, each of which branches again until they interconnect by using hooks and barbicels. How would a reptile react to feathers on his back? He'd probably pull them out! Such structures in a transitional form would be detrimental to a reptile. Some birds have unique structures that enable them to perform specialized functions in nature.  The woodpecker is such an example. He has special shock absorbers in his beak and skull providing protection from the severe migraine headaches that might otherwise result from his hazardous occupation. Imagine all the poor pre-woodpeckers knocking themselves out, getting their beaks stuck in trees until this feature \"evolved.\" Most birds have three toes in front and one behind. The woodpecker has two in front and two behind to enable him to grasp onto the side of a tree and peck away. He also has stiff tail feathers to support him and a long sticky tongue designed for fishing the insects he feeds on out of the holes he pecks in the trees. We have to conclude, God designed him for his special occupation. Consider the water ouzel, a bird that not only flies in the air, but swims underwater with his wings!5 He also strolls on the bottom of the stream, overturning rocks with his beak and toes to feed on various water creatures. Air sacs provide buoyancy, enabling him to rise to the surface. He \"blows his tanks\" to submerge. Since he does not have webbed feet, he uses his wings as underwater oars. He normally makes his nest behind a waterfall, through which he must pass to reach his front door. He makes his nest out of living moss, which is kept alive from the spray of the cascade. How many eons of diving school did this bird endure before he mastered the delicate balance of the air and water environments? These unique air sacs will either work, or they won't. These functions would have to be perfected before our skinnydipping friend would ever discover the juicy morsels on the bottom of the stream. Bird migration poses a problem for evolutionists. How does one account for birds like the Arctic tern that migrates from pole to pole, and returns to the same nesting spot each year? How does one account for this apparent design if we rule out creation by God? The Phalarope is a bird who doesn't follow the normal pattern where the male gathers the food and the female sits on the eggs. Instead, it is the male who has to assume all the housewifely chores of nest building, incubation, and family feeding. Only one of two options is available: either juggling of the genders existed from the beginning or \"Mother Nature\" had to experiment with some bizarre transitional match making.  Consider, though, the broader picture. What was the origin of sex and the roles each sex plays? Courtship behavior, sex roles and reproductive activity vary almost from species to species. This is an indicator of special creation. When did the two sexes diverge? According to evolution, a long slow process over millions of years created the sexes. But, reproduction is either asexual or sexual, there is no in-between. Even if some mutation created a male sexual creature, it would not reproduce unless the same mutation occurred in matching female as well! The smallest bird in nature, and one of the most amazing is the hummingbird.  Weighing only 1/14 of an ounce, he has much in common with a helicopter, flying backward and sideways and hover in midair. Its rate of metabolism is so high that it must feed almost constantly. But, since there are no rods in the hummingbird's retina for night vision, its vital processes shut down to a state of hibernation at night. The nest of the hummingbird is not much bigger than a postage stamp, made out of thistledown and cobwebs. But, built into this pintsized bird is one of the most complex flight mechanisms known. Consider the following: Hmmmmmmmmm!! \u00d7 In the feathers, the quill is considered stronger for its weight than any structure designed by man. \u00d7 Flexibility of the quill allows the primary feathers at the wing tip to bend upward with each downbeat of the wing. This produces the equivalent of pitch in a helicopter. \u00d7 The quill constantly changes shape to meet the requirements of air pressure and wing position. \u00d7 The leading vane of the feather is narrower than the trailing vane. This feature causes the wing to operate like a propeller to give both lift and propulsion. \u00d7 The wing is an efficient doublejointed foresail, the inner half sloping at a slight angle to give lift like the wing of an airplane, while the outer half acts like a propeller. \u00d7 There is a jet assisted takeoff mechanism. A tuft of feathers at the junction of the wing adds extra airfoil surface during landing and takeoff. \u00d7 Enlarged muscles to operate the wings; almost 3/4 the weight of the bird. \u00d7 Higher metabolism, temperature, blood pressure, and a hyperactive heart contribute to the bird's success. \u00d7 A remarkable system of respiration where the hollow bones provide an air sac system, providing buoyancy, a reservoir for respiration and an air conditioner. \u00d7 Air flows into the lungs in only one direction, providing a continuous supply of oxygen. \u00d7 Other features: streamlining, retractable landing gear, camouflage, migration navigation, and hibernation. It is unreasonable to suggest that the hummingbird \"developed\" all of these features as a product of evolution gradually over millions of years. Time and chance cannot produce such design and order. Only God can! Also See Where Did Birds Come From?\nAnother Fishy Story! The Anableps is a fish that spends his life on the surface of the water. Although he is a rather small fish, he poses a big problem for evolutionists. You see, his eyes are divided in half, the top designed for seeing in air out of the water, and the bottom for seeing below the surface of the water.  What were the transitional forms like? What kind of evolutionary \"pressure\" could have caused half an eye to gradually evolve to see out of the water?\nThe Archer Fish\nThe Archer fish overcomes a problem in sea to air ballistics. He squirts water at his prey, which are bugs and flies. His mouth has a built in groove that channels the water like a squirt gun. But the biggest problem is his aim. He has to overcome the refractive difference from water to air in order to accurately hit his prey.  If you ever looked at a spoon in a glass of water, you would understand the problem. The refractive quality of water makes it appear to be broken in half. Again we marvel at God's design.\nA Fish Goes Fishing!\nConsider the angler fish, who has an appendage dangling in front of his mouth that attracts other fish, and when the prey gets close enough, chomp! The angler fish lives at great depths and has to handle a lot of water pressure. But the biggest problem for evolutionists is the fact that the male of the species doesn't eat! By an amazing process, he attaches himself to the female, and the blood streams of the two merge! Imagine the changes the male would have had to go through in order to evolve this gradually over a period of millions of years! Like the angler fish, the decoy fish also lures its prey by means of a bait. One of its fins resembles a small fish standing out in contrast to the rest of the body, which blends in well with the environment. The prey, as it approaches the decoy fish, sees only the fishy looking fin and does not realize that it is part of a much bigger fish.\nFlytrap Claptrap\nImagine the fun that the Creator had in making the Venus Flytrap, the carnivorous plant. What a problem for an evolutionist this creates! On the surface of the trap are trigge r hairs causing an action potential similar to a nerve response, closing the trap.  The plant then secretes digestive juices and the dying insect gives off weak solutions of sodium and ammonium ions, causing the trap to close more firmly. In order for a Venus Flytrap to be functional, the plant must have in place a full-formed trap mechanism complete with trigger hairs, digestive glands, living bars, and action potential response before any insects could be trapped. Also, the trap would have to have the capability of responding to the sodium ions secreted by the dying ants and flies so that the proper narrowing and digestion could occur. Recent research regarding the flytraps has found that ants are a more common prey than flies. Scientists formerly believed that a scent was secreted by the trap, attracting the insects. This idea was ruled out after intensive observation, finding that the most frequently trapped insects were either poor fliers, clumsy fliers or non-flying forms that walk into the trap accidentally. Another result of this study is the conclusion that the flytraps do quite well, grow, produce flowers, set seed, and fully propagate without ever eating a single insect. Why would such a structure \"evolve\"? Since there is no significant advantage to the trap forming by itself, I would rather believe that God created it as a curiosity.\nEvolution Croaks!\nFossils of supposedly ancient frogs show that frogs have always resembled frogs. This is one of the problems evolutionists face, that many modern animals are very much like their fossil counterparts, with no evolutionary change apparent over the imagined millions of years. Gerald H. Duffett  outlines a method of linking together vital functions of the frog as proof of creation. He provides detailed diagrams linking together these functions, showing that no single entity is fully functional alone and that other entities are required to make each entity fully functional. The following is a summary of his \"linkological\" evaluation of the frog. 1. Air 2. Tiny lungs 3. No trachea 4. No neck 5. Undifferentiated Vertebrae 6. No thorax 7. No abdomen 8. No diaphragm 9. No ribs 10. Pectoral girdle shields heart and absorbs shock 11. No rib muscles 12. Urostyle 13. Hind legs for leaping 14. No larynx 15. Glottal epithelial flaps 16. Vocal pouches 17. Croak 18. Single Ventricle 19. Atria receive oxygenated blood 20. Cutaneous respiration 21. Amplexus 22. Fore limbs 23. Highly vascular skin 24. Mucus 25. Nuptial pads on males 26. Poikilothermy (cold-blooded) 27. Hibernation 28. Low ambient temperature 29. Webbed feet 30. Pond water 31. External fertilization 32. Gamete release 33. Identification of opposite sex 34. No external auditory meatus 35. Tympanic membrane on head surface 36. No air under water 37. No need for a secondary palate 38. Nostril closes 39. Vomerine teeth on roof of mouth 40. Eyeballs are retractable to aid swallowing From this list of entities, Dr. Duffett compiles an entity link list connecting each of these features together into a matrix of interrelationships. The existence of such a network of links is clear evidence of a creator! Complex systems such as this do not come about by chance. From the above list of features, he compiles an exhaustive list of over 60 different links where each feature cannot exist without the other. Here are some examples: From: To: 1 2 Air being less dense than water would not allow frog to dive for cover if lungs were not small. 1 20 Air diffuses through skin to enter blood capillaries. 2 3 Tiny lungs are not only too puny to have a reinforced windpipe leading to them, but they are subsidiary to skin. 2 19 Atria receive blood equally oxygenated because skin is as efficient as a respiratory surface as tiny lungs. 2 30 The much greater density of water compared with air prevents frog from carrying large lung full of from pond surface to pond bottom. 3 4 No point in having a neck if no trachea is present. 8 6 No diaphragm so no boundary in trunk to separate thorax from abdomen. Therefore, no thorax. 8 7 No diaphragm so no boundary in trunk to separate thorax from abdomen. Therefore, no abdomen. 13 10 After jumping with hind limbs, pectoral girdle absorbs shock of landing on hard ground. 14 40 No larynx means that swallowing must therefore be performed by muscles pulling eyeballs into head to push food in esophagus. 20 19 Skin respiration causes blood leaving skin to be oxygenated as blood leaves tiny lungs. 20 23 Skin respiration is possible because that organ is richly supplied with blood vessels. 20 30 Oxygen dissolved in water can diffuse into skin both when frog is in the pond and when frog is on dry land provided that its skin remains moist. 23 19 Rich blood supply to skin ensures that oxygen diffuses into frog. 30 34 Frogs would become deaf if water entered their ear holes so they have no external auditory meatus on their heads. 37 40 No eye socket bones and no secondary palate allow eyeballs to be retracted by muscles and so help pushfood into esophagus. Mr. Duffett's \"linkological\" approach illustrates the thorough systems analysis God used when He created the frog. It is important for us to use an approach like this when evaluating any creature in nature. Interdependence between entities can be documented through this linkological evaluation, showing that one system cannot exist without the other. This requires instant creation of these entities in order for functionality to exist. The probability of even two of these entities occurring by chance independently in the same organism at the same time is extremely remote. But the frog exhibits over 60 such interdependent entities!\nCreation Wins By A Neck\nHave you ever wondered why the giraffe's brain doesn't explode when he stoops to get a drink of water? Or, why he doesn't pass out when he raises his head back up again? It's because God has specially created valves in his neck which close off the enormous flow of blood needed to raise it to the giraffe's great height.  The giraffe has a powerful heart almost two feet long to make sure the blood supply gets to his brain. But if he did not have the special valves in his arteries which regulate his blood supply, his brains would explode under the pressure. Also, there is a special sponge underneath the giraffe's brain which absorbs the last pump of blood. Now, when he raises back up, that sponge squeezes that oxygenated blood into his brain, the valves open up, and he doesn't pass out. Now, could this mechanism have evolved? No way! If the first giraffe had a long neck and two foot long heart, but no mechanism to regulate it, when he first stooped to get a drink of water, he would have blown his mind. Then, after he had blown his mind, he would have thought to himself, \"I need to evolve valves in my arteries to regulate this!\" No, he would have been dead! The giraffe's long neck couldn't have evolved; it needed to be completely functional in the first place. ********* In Simple Terms..The Giraffe is an unusual animal that contains an interesting design mechanism. Did you know that a full grown giraffe's heart weighs over 24 pounds and pumps 16 gallons a minute? Because the giraffe's heart is much larger than his head, a series of special one-way, back-flow preventer valves are needed in the neck to regulate the flow of blood to the head, especially when the giraffe is bending down to get that much needed drink of water. Without these valves, the immense blood pressure coupled with gravity would make for one nasty headache and other such repercussions. Elastic blood vessels in the giraffe's head allow harboring of enough blood to prevent the giraffe from passing out when bent in this position. The creationist points out that this intricate design mechanism is, you guessed it, a design! The evolutionist will have you believe that this system evolved with time, that eventually a giraffe mutated merrily along until the valves properly formed in the neck and the elastic blood vessels sufficiently formed in the head (along with other details left out here). [http://www.evolutionfairytale.com/giraffe1.htm]\n*********\nI'll Scratch Your Back; You Scratch Mine!\nStructured throughout nature is interdependence. In I Corinthians 12, we have the illustration of the body of Christ and its members functioning as an organism. Likewise, organisms in nature need each other to fulfill their roles. A curiosity I studied in microbiology class was a microorganism called Mixotricha Paradoxa that lives in the gut of Australian termites.  When it was first discovered, it looked as if it was covered with a bunch of curly hairs. Looking at it closer, it was revealed that these were not hairs at all, but spirochetes, which were a totally different type of microorganism. On the Mixotricha, there were bumps or appendages where the spirochetes attached, and a bacillus which lodged on the other side of the bump. The spirochetes provided a means of locomotion for the entire colony of microorganisms. They are three totally different germs that decided to live together in a community. So, what you have is an interdependence between a large microorganism, a spirochete, a bacillus, an Australian termite, and even the trees the termite feed upon. I suppose if you are an evolutionist, you would have to believe that at one point in time they formed a committee and decided to all work together; the Mixotricha \"developing\" bumps where the spirochetes could bury their heads and behind which the bacillus could hide; all of whom \"decided\" to live in the gut of a termite. Interdependence and ecology are problems for evolutionists. These principles demonstrate that there are delicate balances between all of the different species on the earth and that each is dependent upon the other. Which evolved first, a species or the food it feeds upon? Reproduction provides an illustration of the problem that interdependence causes for evolutionists. The old \"Which came first, the chicken or the egg\" dilemma may cause a lot of laughter, but it still doesn't make the problem go away. For those who believe the Biblical account of creation, the answer is simple: it was the chicken originally created by God. I like to look for telltale statements evolutionists make. For example, they say that \"the aardvark is the only surviving example of an obscure mammalian genus.\"  Translation: they can't find any other animal enough like it to classify it, nor can they find any fossilized transitional forms. With a pig's snout, donkey ears, and sharp claws for burrowing, it is unique. The same holds true for the panda and the giant anteater. They have a combination of features that defy the traditional rules of classification. Creationists, since they don't have to explain transitions from one species to another, have the simplest explanation for the origin of life. Those who reject the Biblical explanation are now having a more difficult time in the face of strongly negative evidence against evolution. Some scientists like Frances Crick and Fred Hoyle, unwilling to accept a Christian perspective, believe the concept that life was imported to earth by space aliens or on a meteorite. Others are adhering to the \"hopeful monster\" theory or the so-called \"punctuated equilibrium\" theory, the idea that massive changes took place all at once. In effect they believe that a reptile mutated, laid an egg and a bird hatched out. But it would have to happen twice in the same place to provide a mate for the new emerging species. As a way to solidify the creationist position, we contemplate the scenario for the theory of evolution: examine the animal as it exists today in its environment, and visualize the supposed gradual \"adaptation\" from one environment to another. Analyze each feature of the animal and show how these features came to be. For the most part, evolutionists can only come up with speculation, and little fossil evidence to support it. For review, let us examine the assumptions of evolution, which are all, by their nature, incapable of experimental verification. All of these involve a certain series of presumed events in the past. Even if it were possible to duplicate these experimentally, it does not mean that they occurred at all. Therefore, since evolution is beyond direct experimental verification, no honest man can state with certainty that the world is the product of an evolutionary process. The assumptions of evolution are listed as follows: Non-living things gave rise to living things (spontaneous generation). Spontaneous generation occurred only once, and did not repeat at any time. Viruses, bacteria, plants and animals are all interrelated; all from the same source. The protozoa gave rise to the metazoa. The invertebrates are interrelated. The invertebrates gave rise to the vertebrates. The vertebrates and fish gave rise to the amphibians, the amphibians to the reptiles, and the reptiles to the birds and mammals. Evolutionists would ask us to take these assumptions and believe them in faith. \"After all, how could all of these scientists who have spent dedicated years in research be so wrong?\" Creationists have no quarrel with the data and the facts found by scientists. What we disagree with are the conclusions drawn from this data. Important facts conflicting with the theory of evolution have been glossed over, ignored, or thrown out as \"experimental error\". Scientific data is subject to interpretation. That is the function of theories. Theories must be revised to fit the facts, and if a theory is irreconcilable to the facts, discard it..

June 2001. \"The Trilobite\u0092s Eye: An Embarrassment to Evolution\"\n\u00a9 2002 by Stephen Caesar One of the most remarkable clues to the existence of an Intelligent Designer behind the astonishing complexity of the animal world is the eye of the trilobite. Trilobites are extinct invertebrates that swarmed the oceans in uncountable numbers during earth's early history. The creature's most notable feature was its phenomenally advanced, complex eyes. According to evolutionary theory, animal eyes developed gradually over countless eons from light-sensitive cells to the eyes we have today. Trilobite eyes upset this speculation-based scenario. Under old-earth evolutionary assumptions, trilobites flourished 500-400 million years ago, close to the dawn of animal life on the planet. Given this assumed chronology, trilobites should have had fairly primitive eyes, since the creatures existed so early in earth's zoological history. However, trilobites' eyes are much more complex than what they ought to have been at that (alleged) stage in animal evolution. Furthermore - and even more upsetting to evolutionists - this astounding complexity appeared rather suddenly, rather than as the result of untold millennia of slow, gradual development that's unmistakably visible in the fossil record. Richard Fortey, Merit Researcher at the Natural History Museum in London and visiting professor of paleobiology at Oxford University, stated: \"We know that the first trilobites already had a well-developed visual system. Indeed, the large eyes found in the genus Fallotaspis, from Morocco, prove that sophisticated vision goes back at least 540 million years to the Cambrian period\" (2000: 70). On another trilobite genus, Phacops, he commented: \"Clearly a very sophisticated structure (even more so than the [usual] hexagonal-lensed trilobite eye), Phacops's crystal eye is a sports coupe in the age of the boneshaker\" (Ibid. 71). Prof. Fortey pointed out not only the sudden appearance of trilobites' complex eyes, but (perhaps unwittingly) the apparent design behind them, as if an intelligent agent had specially modeled them far in advance of what blind chance could have done. This is most noticeable in the problem of \"spherical aberration,\" in which a trilobite's orb-shaped eyes would have caused vision distortion in the same way that, if you looked through a glass marble, the objects on the other side would appear to be grossly distorted - not to mention upside down. The trilobite eye is specifically, ingeniously designed to prevent this, as Fortey observes: \"Euan Clarkson [of the University of Edinburgh] and University of Chicago physicist Riccardo Levi-Setti discovered that something strange had happened to the calcite in the lower part of each Phacops lens: magnesium atoms were present in just the right quantity to correct the spherical aberration. For every bend to the left, there was a compensating bend to the right. This corrective layer made a bowl within the lens; the trilobite had thus manufactured what modern opticians term a doublet. The animals with these eyes may have seen more complete images of an object than their hexagonal-lensed fellows. All this [supposedly occurred] 400 million years ago\" (Ibid. 72). Of course, Prof. Fortey, being an old-earth evolutionist, would chalk it all up to evolution over countless millions of years. Despite this pre-established bias, he has nonetheless cast doubt on the unproven claim that the trilobite eye, with its astounding complexity and sudden appearance, came about over eons with the help of pure chance. Reference: Fortey, R. (2000). \"Crystal Eyes.\" Natural History 109, no. 8: 68-72. The Cleaner Fish\nCleaner fish are fishes that provide a service to other fish species by removing dead skin and ectoparasites. They \u0093will swim into a shark's mouth and eat remnant food particles from the shark's teeth. The cleaner fish departs with a satisfied appetite, and the shark is happy because his teeth are cleaned in the process. The shark does not allow any other kinds of fish into its mouth without chomping down for a good lunch. Indeed, what other fish would dare attempt to swim into a shark's mouth! This type of relationship is called a symbiotic relationship. Creationists point out that these relationships clearly represent a design that could not have occurred by chance. Evolutionists have a very difficult time explaining how these types of relationships could evolve with time. Nevertheless, an evolutionist will somehow have us believe that the cleaner fish eventually figured out he could go in the shark's mouth, and the shark eventually figured out that he should let him so as to maintain proper dental hygiene\u0094.

Why did these animals form their friendships? Some of them, like the lions, dogs, and elephants, are known for forming strong social relationships or even networks in the wild. In the absence of their prides or packs, it makes sense that they would seek other animal friends outside of their species. Other more solitary animals may form a parent-child relationship with animals that they spend time with or that helped raise them, especially if their parents are gone.\nWhatever the reason may be, unusual friendships like these show that animals may be far more emotionally complex than many of us believe. Yet as complex, as they are, these funny animals also have their hilarious moments when playing with their friend. Thanks to wildlife photography or the animal owners adept eye that resulted in these funny animal pictures. Maybe the friendships aren\u2019t so unusual after all!\n1. Bubbles the African Elephant and Bella the Black Labrador\nImage credits: Barry Bland\nDespite the extreme difference in size, Bubbles the elephant and Bella the black lab have become great friends. Bubbles was brought to a safari reserve in the U.S. after she was rescued from ivory poachers in Africa, while Bella was left there by a contractor for the park. The two are great to see together, especially when Bella uses Bubbles as a diving board! (read more)\n2. Bea the Giraffe and Wilma the Ostrich\nImage credits: PA\nBea and Wilma have become great friends during their time together at Busch Gardens in the U.S. The two share a huge 65-acre enclosure, so they aren\u2019t forced to spend time together \u2013 they do so willingly.\n3. Tinni the Dog and Sniffer the Wild Fox\nImage credits: Torgeir Berge\nTinni the dog and Sniffer the wild fox have been the best of friends since they met in the forests of Norway. Torgeir Berge, Tinni\u2019s owner, does what he can to keep up and photograph the pair as they play in the woods. (read more)\n4. Torque the Dog and Shrek the Owl\nImage credits: Solent News and Photos\nTorque adopted Shrek the owl chick when he was just 6 months old himself. Shrek was removed from his mother\u2019s care because handlers were afraid that she might eat him when stressed. He\u2019s doing great now, and the two have become inseparable pals.\n5. Fred the Labrador and Dennis the Duckling\nImage credits: SWNS\nThings were looking grim for Dennis the duckling when his mother had been mauled by a fox. Fred the Labrador and his owner Jeremy, however, found and rescued Dennis. Dennis and Fred have been buddies ever since. Fred apparently has a big heart, because it\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s helped take care of an orphan \u2013 he once adopted a baby deer as well.\n6. Mabel the Chicken and the Puppies\nImage credits: Anita Maric\nAfter being saved from the pot due to a foot injury, Mable found a new wonder when she was moved into her owners\u2019 home \u2013 puppies! For some reason, the year-old hen has taken to roosting on the puppies and keeping them warm while their mother prefers the yard. Go figure!\n7. Milo the Dog and Bonedigger the Lion\nImage credits: Barcroft USA\nMilo the tiny dachshund took Bonedigger the lion cub under his wing when it was discovered that the lion was suffering from a metabolic bone disease that left him disabled. Five years later, the 500 pound lion is still the best of buddies with the 11-pound dachshund and his two compatriots, Bullet and Angel.\n8.

Not much is known beyond the fact that they\u2019re very cute and very playful.\n9. Shere Khan, Baloo and Leo\nImage credits: Barcroft Media\nThe tale of Shere Khan the tiger, Baloo the bear and Leo the lion is truly touching. The three of them were rescued together from a drug dealer who had abused them extensively. Baloo even needed surgery to remove a harness that had grown into his skin and caused deformities \u2013 the owner had never bothered to adjust it. Because of what they\u2019ve suffered together, the three friends are now inseparable. They are under the care of the Noah\u2019s Ark Animal Sanctuary in the U.S.\n10. Mani the Wild Boar Piglet and Candy the Dog\nImage credits: spiegel.de\nManni the wild boar piglet was found starving in a field in southwest Germany and brought home by the Dahlhaus family.

Since last we heard, Manni is recovering well and will either stay with his family or move to a wildlife park.\n11. Kasi the Cheetah and Mtani the Labrador\nImage credits: Busch Gardens Tampa\nKasi and Mtani were raised together at Bush Gardens in the U.S. During their youth, their unusual friendship was a treat to watch. As he grew into adolescence, however, Kasi began drifting away from Mtani and becoming more interested in the female cheetahs in the next pen. While Kasi now spends more time with other cheetahs, the two are still good friends and often visit schools and other places together.\n12.

Suryia the Orangutan and Roscoe the Blue Tick Hound\nSuryia and Roscoe live together at a rare and endangered species reserve in the U.S. While orangutans are endangered, dogs are certainly less so. However, Roscoe has lived with her ever since he followed Suryia and her handlers home. It didn\u2019t look like he had any other home to go to, so he stayed with Suryia, and they\u2019ve been great friends ever since.\n14.

They were great friends while growing up, but as Pippin matured, she moved out into the forest to raise a deer family of her own. She still visits Kate and her owner Isobel, however.\n15. Anjana the Chimpanzee and Tiger Cubs\nImage credits: Bary Bland\nThese two white tiger cubs were separated from their mother after her enclosure was flooded during a hurricane. Fortunately, they\u2019ve been adopted by a U.S. animal reserve by Anjana the chimpanzee and their caretaker, China York.

Everyone over a certain age knows how humans make babies, and for many animals, the process isn\u2019t that much different. For many others, however, the process is, well, a process.\nA handful of animals choose one partner for their entire lives. Many others are open to all takers. Some mate all year long, others are fertile only for a few hours. Some are highly selective and require one gender to perform elaborate rituals like dancing, strutting, and structure-building for the other gender to even give them a look. Others do it as frequently as possible with as many in their species as possible. More gruesomely, many animals murder after mating. Some others have to die in order to do it. Others do it literally until it kills them.\nMonogamy exists in nature, albeit rarely, as do homosexuality, infidelity, and ferocious jealousy. As with people, many young males in the animal kingdom strut, preen, and otherwise try to impress females, often in vain. Also familiarly, females often choose males based on attributes like strength or the ability to provide resources.\nThere are, however, plenty of differences. Some species are highly social and structured like ours\u2014but their societies are dominated completely by females. Other species have sexual traits of both genders. Others are born as one gender but can switch when needed.\nUsing sources like nature publications and research reports, Stacker compiled a list of 30 animal mating habits that defy the imagination.

The attractive marking is made up of irregular patches, in varying shades of brown, on a cream or buff background. Males are larger and darker than females, have thicker horns and have a lump on the forehead. The horn tips are bald in males and old females while hairy in younger females. Behaviour\nGiraffe are most active in the early morning and late afternoon but also feed at night in bright moonlight. However, unlike many of Africa's wild animals that \"disappear\" under shady trees during the heat of the day, giraffe continue browsing and because of their size, can be spotted throughout daylight hours. Giraffe will drink if water is available, but can survive without it. The forelegs are straddled and the knees bent in order to get the head down low enough. While drinking they are very vulnerable and will not drink if suspicious of danger. Females, calves and juveniles occur in herds of about 10 with only very loose social ties, and a flexible membership. Young males may form small bachelor groups. Mature bulls are nearly always alone, except when they join a female herd for mating. Young males spar by neck wrestling, twisting their necks together and trying to push the opponent off balance. Reproduction\nThe giraffe is the only ruminant with gestation longer than a year and a single calf weighing 100kg is born after a gestation of 457days. Giraffe reach sexual maturity in four to six years. Social bonds between mother and calf persist beyond weaning, until the birth of her next offspring. Calves suffer heavy predation; first year mortality can be over 40%. Diet\nAn exclusive browser, the giraffe eats leaves, fresh shoots, flowers, pods, and fruits from trees, of which acacias are the most important source of food. Leaves are removed from thorny branches by combing them between the teeth. Twigs and branches are pulled into the mouth with the long and dextrous tongue. Sounds\nGiraffe are usually silent. They bellow, grunt or snort when alarmed, as when confronted by lions, and can also moo in distress. Above information from The Ultimate Field Guide and other African mammal field guides.

Parrots appear to grasp concepts like \"same\" and \"different,\" \"bigger\" and \"smaller\", \"none\" and numbers. They understand zero Perhaps most interestingly, they can combine labels and phrases in novel ways. A January 2007 study in Language Sciences suggests using patterns of parrot speech learning to develop artificial speech skills in robots.\nElephants Do Forget, but They're Not Dumb\nEven newborn elephants are still some of the animal world's heftiest creatures. This baby Asian elephant, named Baylor, was born weighing 348 pounds (158 kilograms) in May 2010 at the Houston Zoo. Mom Shanti endured a pregnancy lasting almost 23 months. About two hours after birth the calf was able to stand on his own. (Image credit: Houston Zoo)\nElephants have the largest brain \u2014 nearly 11 pounds on average \u2014 of any mammal that ever walked the earth. Do they use that gray matter to the fullest? Intelligence is hard to quantify in humans or animals, but the encephalization quotient (EQ), a ratio of an animal's observed brain size to the expected brain size given the animal's mass, correlates well with an ability to navigate novel challenges and obstacles. The average elephant EQ is 1.88. (Humans range from 7.33 to 7.69, chimpanzees average 2.45, pigs 0.27.) Intelligence and memory are thought to go hand in hand, suggesting that elephant memories, while not infallible, are quite good.\nGiraffes Compensate for Height with Unique Blood Flow\nThe nubs that top the giraffe's head, which are just bone projects covered in skin and hair, are called ossicones. (Image credit: Wikimedia Commons user William Scot)\nThe stately giraffe, whose head sits some 16 feet up atop an unlikely pedestal, adapted his long neck to compete for foliage with other grazers. The long necks of giraffes date back to ancestors that lived 16 million years ago, according to a study reported October 7, 2015 in the journal Royal Society Open Science. While the advantage of reach is obvious, some difficulties arise at such a height. The heart must pump twice as hard as a cow's to get blood up to the brain, and a complex blood vessel system is needed to ensure that blood doesn't rush to the head when bent over. Six feet below the heart, the skin of the legs must then be extremely tight to prevent blood from pooling at the hooves.\nMany Fish Swap Sex Organs\nWeird fish: a basking shark in profile. (Image credit: Massachusetts Department of Fish & Game.)\nWith so many land creatures to wonder at, it's easy to forget that some of the weirdest activities take place deep in the ocean. The strange practice of hermaphroditism is more common among species of fish than within any other group of vertebrates. Some fish change sex in response to hormonal cycle or environmental changes. Others simultaneously possess both male and female sex organs. Scrawny male molly fish flaunt their bisexuality to improve their mating odds, according to research reported in the journal Biology Letters.\nBaby Chicks and Brotherhood\nThe jury is still out over whether the chicken or egg came first. But turns out dinosaurs were laying bird-like eggs long before chickens roamed Earth. (Image credit: dreamstime.)\nIt's a mistake to think of evolution as producing selfish animals concerned only with their own survival. Altruism abounds in cases where a helping hand will encourage the survival of genetic material similar to one's own. Baby chicks practice this \"kin selection\" by making a special chirp while feeding. This call announces the food find to nearby chicks, who are probably close relations and so share many of the chick's genes. The key to natural selection isn't survival of the fittest animal. It's survival of the fittest genetic material, and so brotherly behavior that favors close relations will thrive. Chimps are also known to be selfless on occasion.\nMole-Rats aren't Blind\nNaked mole-rats in the hands of biologist Thomas Park. Naked mole-rats are very gentle by nature, rarely acting aggressive towards humans. (Image credit: UIC Photo.)\nWith their puny eyes and underground lifestyle, African mole-rats have long been considered the Mr. Magoos of rodents, detecting little light and, it has been suggested, using their eyes more for sensing changes in air currents than for actual vision. But findings of the past few years have shown that African mole-rats have a keen, if limited, sense of sight. And they don't like what they see, according to a report in the November 2006 Animal Behaviour. Light may suggest that a predator has broken into a tunnel, which could explain why subterranean diggers developed sight in the first place. [Perspective: Why We Love Naked Mole Rats]\nFor Beavers, Days Get Longer in Winter\nNot the offending beaver. (Image credit: Tom Smylie, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)\nBeavers become near shut-ins during winter, living off of previously stored food or the deposits of fat in their distinctive tails. A beaver conserves energy by avoiding the cold outdoors, opting instead to remain in dark lodgings inside their pile of wood and mud. As a result these rodents, which normally emerge at sunset and turn in at sunrise, have no light cues to entrain their sleep cycle. The beaver's biological sense of time shifts, and she develops a \"free running circadian rhythm\" of 29-hour days. Such a shift in human circadian rhythm would mess with a human's ability to sleep and function.\nBirds Use Landmarks to Navigate Long Journeys\nTwo homing pigeons setting off together on the journey back to the loft. (Image credit: Robin Freeman)\nWe humans have detailed maps, GPS navigation systems and even Siri to guide us wherever we'd like to go. Birds, smart as they are, haven't learned to use any of this technology. Yet pigeons can fly thousands of miles to find the same roosting spot with no navigational difficulties. Some species of birds, like the Arctic tern, make a 25,000 mile round-trip journey every year. Many species use built-in ferromagnets to detect their orientation with respect to the Earth's magnetic field. A November 2006 study published in Animal Behaviour suggests that pigeons also use familiar landmarks on the ground below to help find their way home. Still, much about bird navigation remains a mystery, according to this 2014 this perspective piece by University of Oxford researcher Tim Guilford.\nWhale Milk Not On Low-Fat Diets\nTwo members of \u201cthe best studied social unit of sperm whales in the world,\u201d Mother \u201cFingers\u201d and her baby \u201cThumb,\u201d swim together off the coast of Dominica. (Image credit: Shane Gero)\nNursing a newborn is no small feat for the whale, whose calf emerges, after 10 to 12 months in the womb, about a third the mother's length (that's a 30-foot baby for the Blue whale). The mother squirts milk into the newborn's mouth using muscles around the mammary gland while the baby holds tight to a nipple (yes, whales have them). At nearly 50 percent fat, whale milk has around 10 times the fat content of human milk, which helps calves achieve some serious growth spurts \u2014 as much as 200 pounds per day. It should be no surprise that whale moms then quickly teach their young where to eat on their own.\nCrocodiles Swallow Stones for Swimming\nThe hybridization of Cuban crocodiles may threaten their population. (Image credit: Steve Zack | Wildlife Conservation Society)\nThe stomach of a crocodile is a rocky place to be, for more than one reason. To begin with, a croc's digestive system encounters everything from turtles, fish and birds to giraffes, buffalo, lions and even (when defending territory) other crocodiles. In addition to that bellyful-o'-ecosystem, rocks show up too. The reptiles swallow large stones that stay permanently in their bellies. It's been suggested these are used for ballast in diving.\nSince you made it all the way, here are some bonus crocodile facts: The largest croc ever found was 20.24 feet (6.17m) long. These reptiles are cold-blooded, so in winter they hibernate. A croc can lay up to 60 eggs at a time!"}

Although very common and widespread, it still faces enormous dangers from excessive hunting and poaching.\nIncredible Antelope Facts!\nThe antelope is an animal that has played an important role in human medicine and culture. In some African traditions, it is commonly associated with the wind.\nThe antelope\u2019s horns are composed of keratin. This is the same substance found in nails, hair, claws, and hooves. However, as opposed to deer, which the antelope is often compared to, antelopes keep the same horns for their entire lives instead of shedding them every year.\nThe structure and shape of antelope horns vary widely. Some horns form spirals, others are curved, and yet others have ridges. Experts can often distinguish antelope species based merely on the appearance of their horns.\nAntelope Scientific Name\nAntelope is more an informal classification than a scientific one. There is no single scientific name that includes all these animals. Instead, the name antelope describes any deer-like animals within the family Bovidae that has a similar appearance and physiology.\nIt is generally accepted that there are several distinct subfamilies that fall within the general term of antelope, but this is still a matter of scientific debate. Due to the lack of precise scientific criteria, there are many different edge cases. For instance, the pronghorn, or the American antelope, is not actually a true antelope at all. The giraffe is more closely related to the pronghorn than the antelopes.\nAntelopes are incredibly widespread animals. They make up approximately 91 of the 140 or so known species of the Bovidae family, which also includes sheep, goats, and domesticated cattle. More distantly, they belong to the order of Artiodactyla with giraffes and pigs. The most distinctive feature of this order is the even number of hooves. The name antelope came to us from the original Greek via the Medieval Latin, but the actual meaning of the word is currently unknown.\nAntelope Appearance and Behavior\nBecause of its massive diversity, it is difficult to talk about a single characteristic or appearance of the antelope. Most tend to have a deer-like appearance with spikes or corkscrew horns, but the largest members of the group almost resemble a cross between a deer and cattle.\nThere are generally two types of antelope, which vary by habitat. Small to medium animals such as the duikers and reedbucks are more adapted to concealed cover in forests and wetlands. Thanks to their short legs, round back, and large rear end, they are capable of fast, sporadic movements to elude predators. These animals have camouflaged colorings or markings to provide an extra layer of defense. They tend to forage on foliage by themselves but then pair together with mates monogamously during the breeding season.\nThe larger antelopes, on the other hand, are built for the deserts, open plains, and savannas. They graze on the grass and rely on pure speed to help them avoid predators. They tend to congregate into large herds in which a dominant male will mate with multiple females. The size of the herd can vary quite a bit. Some herds consist of no more than 10 or 20 individuals, while other antelopes have herds of thousands, which can make for quite the spectacle on the open plains. These herds may undertake large migrations during certain parts of the year in search of new food reservoirs and grazing land.\nAntelopes vary dramatically in size between the small royal antelope, which weighs a mere 4 pounds, and the truly gigantic eland, which weighs up to 1,800 pounds, or about as much as some cattle. The topi is perhaps the longest, reaching nearly 9 feet. Males tend to have larger bodies and horns than females, but in a few species, the females may lack horns altogether, or they will have smaller horns than the males.\nLike many other bovids, the entire body of the antelope is remarkably well adapted for the consumption and digestion of vegetation. It has a multi-chambered stomach filled with specialized bacteria to ferment and break down the tough cellulose of the plant matter. The antelope will also regurgitate the food as cud and chew it again with its well-developed molar teeth to aid in digestion.\nAnother important feature is the antelope\u2019s visual acuity. They have horizontal pupils located on the side of the head that enable them to see predators coming from the periphery of their vision. The acute sense of smell also aids in communication. Specialized fluids secreted from scent glands around the face, knees, and hooves allow them to mark territory and communicate with other members. Antelopes also have a suite of whistles, barks, bleats, grunts, and moos. These vocalizations serve as a means of alarm calls, warnings, or greetings.\nKarel Bartik/Shutterstock.com\nAntelope Habitat\nApproximately 71 species of antelopes inhabit the African continent. Most of the remaining antelopes are found in Asia, including the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Russian steppes. These animals were once prevalent across Europe and the Americas before going extinct there. No known antelopes have ever evolved in Australia.\nAs mentioned previously, antelopes tend to live exclusively in either forests or open plains, rarely mixing between the two. The habitation dictates the survival strategies of each species, from body size to diet to social organization.\nAntelope Diet\nThe antelopes feed almost exclusively on vegetation. The only exception is the duiker (a small- or medium-sized antelope located in forests), which supplements its herbivorous diets with small amounts of meat from mammals, insects, and birds.\nThere are generally two types of foraging strategies: browsers and grazers. Browsers tend to feed on leaves, seeds, fruits, flowers, and bark close to the ground. Grazers tend to consume grasses and similar vegetation. The gerenuk and dibatags have a unique strategy of standing on their hind legs to reach leaves in tall trees. It takes an enormous amount of time to break down the plant matter into a usable form, but this strategy is highly beneficial, since foliage and grazing land can support a large number of antelopes at a single time.\nThese animals spend a great deal of their time searching for and feeding on food. In order to find adequate sources, some antelopes have cleverly offloaded the work to other animals. They will actively follow bird flocks, monkey troops, or migrating zebras in search of prime foraging grounds.\nFor a complete analysis of antelope diets, make sure to read \u2018What Do Antelopes Eat?\u2019\nAntelope Predators and Threats\nAntelopes are some of the most common prey animals in Africa. They make a tempting meal for cheetahs, lions, hyenas, civets, pythons, and large birds. Because of the antelope\u2019s incredible speed, many predators prefer to sneak up on them and pick off individual stragglers. The cheetah, as one of the few animals fast enough to catch them, relies on its pure speed. These chases often make for spectacular footage on nature documentaries.\nThese animals have a number of strategies to deal with a dangerous predator, the most important of which is their speed and agility. If the animal cannot evade its pursuer outright, then it may try to hide in water or foliage. Some species will actually freeze in place to avoid being noticed. If everything else fails, then the antelope may stand its ground and defend itself with its sharp horns.\nAntelopes are hunted by humans for both their horns and their meat. Some cultures have local taboos against antelope hunting. However, the animal can still become accidentally ensnared in traps. Habitat loss is another significant threat to many types of antelopes.\nAntelope Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nAntelopes pursue so many different courtship and mating rituals that it is difficult to discuss all of them in detail. Breeding strategies can vary between full monogamy and a dominant breeding pair within a herd. In other species, males compete with each other every season for the right to breed with females.\nOnce the female is impregnated, gestation lasts anywhere between four and nine months. The mother produces only a single calf at a time, while twins are relatively rare. Because the calf is highly vulnerable at birth, they generally has two different strategies to protect the young. Most antelopes prefer to hide the calf in a concealed location, while the mother rejoins the herd or hunts on its own.\nIn the second strategy, the calf is expected to begin traveling immediately with the herd from almost the moment it is born. In exchange, the herd provides additional protection for the young calf.\nAge of maturity varies widely between species. Some of these animals species come of age in as little as six months. Some take as long as eight years to fully develop. The females usually mature faster than the males on average. Lifespan likewise can vary between three years and 28 years based on the species.\nAntelope Population\nAccording to the IUCN Red List, around a quarter of antelope species are currently threatened by extinction, and several have already gone extinct in the 19th and 20th centuries. But even among those groups in good health, many appear to be in decline and could face pressure in the future due to hunting and declining habitats. Exact population numbers are not known.\nAntelopes in the Zoo\nThe San Diego Zoo Safari Park has perhaps the largest collection of these animals in the United States, including springboks, lechwes, waterbucks, sables, roan antelope, gazelles, white-bearded gnu (a type of wildebeest), blesboks, and many more. One of the most important denizens is a breeding herd of saigas, a critically endangered antelope that inhabits the Eurasian steppe. The zoo has bred more than 100 saiga calves in captivity and also assists with conservation efforts across Russia.\nIf you don\u2019t live near San Diego, then there are still several ways to see live antelopes. The Little Rock Zoo in Arkansas contains three species of antelopes: the yellow-backed duiker, the greater kudu, and the dik-dik. The Buffalo Zoo contains the roan antelope and the addax. The Saint Louis Zoo has the addax, the lesser kudu, Speke\u2019s gazelle, and the gerenuk. Finally, the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo contains the dama gazelle and the scimitar-horned oryx.\nView all 122 animals that start with A"}

The Giraffe Centre is for you. Although this centre is part of a larger complex devoted to wildlife conservation, the Giraffe Centre is a primarily tourist destination that caters to the tourist who wants a selfie with a giraffe.\nYou buy entry tickets at the ticket counter (adults pay KSH1500 per person, children pay half that price). Beyond this, there\u2019s a small complex consisting of a restaurant, a couple of souvenir shops, a small garden, and\u2014the main attraction\u2014the giraffes, which are in a large field-and-trees area bounded by a low wall on the visitors\u2019 side. It\u2019s across this wall that Homo sapiens meets giraffe. You pick up a coconut shell bowl full of pellets (giraffe feed) and take them across the giraffes. Then you jostle with the rest of the crowd, await your turn, and when you can, you pick up a pellet between thumb and forefinger and place it on a giraffe\u2019s tongue, which it stretches out to you.\nThere\u2019s a small building next door, with a balcony on the outside and one giraffe poking its head up to be fed by the visitors on the balcony. One of the staff members on duty told us that this particular giraffe was especially gentle with children, so (since we had our six-year old with us) we headed upstairs. The crowd here was huge, so we eventually came downstairs anyway, but while we were up there, we had a look at the tiny giraffe information gallery there\u2014texts and pictures about giraffe facts, subspecies, distribution, and so on.\nWhen we came downstairs again, my husband had a go at feeding a giraffe. It left him with long trails of saliva on his hands, so even though it was fun, it was sticky! Fortunately, there are toilets right round the corner, so you can go wash your hands after feeding the giraffes.\nI thought this was too expensive an attraction. Yes, you do have an Instagrammable moment, but other than that, there\u2019s not much\u2014you don\u2019t learn much, for instance, about giraffes, unless you stumble upon the tiny gallery. (After we\u2019d left the Giraffe Centre and even Nairobi, we discovered that there\u2019s also a talk and presentation about giraffes in the space behind this gallery, but we missed it)."}

Both kinds are characterized by the long, twisting horns that grow on the heads of mature males. They also share similar habitats, body structure and coloration, although there is notable differences in size between the greater and lesser species. The kudu is an animal with passive grazing habits and natural camouflage to help them avoid being easily spotted by the many predators in their native habitat.\nAn Incredible Animal: 3 Kudu Facts!\nHigh speeds: The kudu is an animal that can reach speeds of over 60mph when attempting to escape from a predator.\nThe kudu is an animal that can reach speeds of over 60mph when attempting to escape from a predator. Ceremonial horns: The animal\u2019s spiraled horns are prized in local religious practices and are also made into musical instruments.\nThe animal\u2019s spiraled horns are prized in local religious practices and are also made into musical instruments. Polite competition: Even though males sometimes engage in rutting, they are generally not very violent when competing for mates.\nKudu Scientific Name\nKudu, alternatively spelled koodoo, is derived from the name given to the animal by the local, nomadic Khoikhoi, who are indigenous to southwestern Africa. The greater kudu is classified as Tragelaphus strepsiceros and the lesser kudu is Tragelaphus imberbis. The genus Tragelaphus shares its name with a word originally put forth by the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle in his oral depiction of an imagined animal that was half goat and half deer.\nKudu: The Animal\u2019s Appearance\nBoth species have similar body structure and proportions, although there are a few notable differences in their external characteristics. Both have grey to brown fur that is broken by a series of white stripes and other markings, often including a chevron visible on their nose. The lesser species typically has between 11 and 15 white stripes on their body, while the greater species usually has between 6 and 10.\nBody size is one of the key differences between the two species. The lesser species is generally 3 to 3.5 feet tall and weighs between 130 and 230 pounds. Greater kudu can reach much greater size, with a potential shoulder height of up to 5 feet and total weight of mature adults ranging between 260 and 600 pounds. The largest bull male on record weighed in at over 690 pounds.\nAll male kudu have the potential to grow spiraled horns that can be quite long relevant to their body size. Lesser kudu males can grow horns that are up to 3.5 feet long, while some greater kudu have been reported sporting horns as long as 6 feet. These horns tend to make 2 to 3 large twists as they slope backwards from the head toward the terminal point, which sets them apart from the tightly wound horns seen on other antelopes.\nAnan Kaewkhammul/Shutterstock.com\nKudu Behavior\nAs herbivores, most of the kudu biology and behavior is geared toward surviving in a potentially harsh native habitat and avoiding dangerous predators. They tend to stay very still as they graze, which allows their coloration to provide effective camouflage. They are most active during the night or morning hours and seek shelter in dense brush during the daytime. Kudu often travel in small packs or herds, but they are also frequently seen alone. Much like other kinds of antelope, these animals have a strong flight reflex and can move very quickly when confronted with an immediate threat.\nKudu: The Animal\u2019s Habitat\nBoth kudu species are native to southern and eastern portions of Africa. Greater kudu have a much greater geographic distribution that includes parts of Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya and as far south as South Africa. There are also some isolated populations of the cottoni subspecies found in central Africa. Lesser kudu have a much smaller distribution and are only found in eastern regions near the Horn of Africa, including Ethiopia and Kenya.\nThese animals have strong jumping and bulldozing potential, which helps them navigate rugged terrain around hills or mountains and forge boldly through dense brush and growth in wooded regions. They tend to inhabit woodland and forested areas, particularly along water sources. Lesser kudu are a bit less water dependent than their greater cousins. Both species can satisfy some of their water needs by seeking out certain types of plants as they graze.\nKudu Diet\nKudu are flexible foragers that consume a wide range of plant materials in woodland, thicket and open fields. Lesser kudu are known to have a diet that is mostly foliage from trees and shrubs, with most of the remaining being from vines and similar plants. However, kudu can also eat tender young shoots, plant roots and may even target some types of fruit when they can find them. Succulent plants that store water are also a prime target during the dry season. Kudu in captivity are typically fed grass or alfalfa hay alongside some natural forage and enriched pellets or biscuits.\nKudu Predators and Threats\nThe kudu share their native range with many solitary and pack predators that pose a significant threat to their survival. Perhaps the most dangerous predators are big cat species, including lions, cheetahs and leopards. Felines tend to use a combination of stealth, patience and speed to ambush the fast-acting kudu while they graze. Packs of spotted hyenas and African hunting dogs are also known to trap or track down kudu as prey.\nHumans are both a predator and serious environmental threat to the long-term viability of kudu populations. People hunt the animals for their meat, large hides and distinguished horns, which are traditionally used to make musical, ornamental and various household objects. Native habitats, especially of lesser kudu, are also threatened by the continued growth of human settlements and expansion of commercial farming enterprises throughout the region.\nLesser kudu are particularly vulnerable to habitat fragmentation and hunting due to their small geographic distribution, which has prompted their classification as near threatened. They can also suffer significant population losses from contagious diseases like rinderpest, which has decimated numbers in the past. Greater kudu have a much bigger native range and are considered a species of least concern by conservationists.\nKudu: The Animal\u2019s Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nSome herbivores can get pretty violent during mating season, but kudu are among the more peaceful species on the continent. Males often compete by showing off their size in profile until one withdraws. However, they may physically struggle by locking horns if one of the competitors doesn\u2019t back down. Victorious ales often wrestle with females initially then follow them for a while before actually mating.\nFemales remain pregnant for about 240 days before giving birth to a single calf, which typically weighs around 10 to 15 pounds. Mothers separate from their group before they deliver their baby. They leave the calf carefully hidden in the brush while they forage during the fist 4 or 5 weeks after birth. At this point, calves accompany the mother on foraging expeditions until it is about 6 months old.\nDespite the care and attention that mother kudu show their young, roughly half of calves die before the 6 month mark. Researchers estimate that only about 1 in 4 individuals make it to 3 years old. Kudu reach sexual maturity within a few years, but males are rarely successful at mating until they are about 4 or 5 years old. Aside from high death rates during youth, the animals often live to be 10 to 15 years old in the wild and up to 20 in captivity.\nVilliers Steyn/Shutterstock.com\nKudu Population\nResearchers estimate there are less than 100,000 lesser kudu remaining in Africa. Their limited native range combined with significant habitat disruption by humans is a serious cause for concern. About a third of them currently live in National Parks and other protected areas.\nExact population numbers for greater kudu are unknown, although the extremely limited range of the cottoni subspecies, found only in Chad and Sudan, means it could be a candidate for endangerment.\nAnimals in the Zoo: Where to find the Kudu\nThe Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo has a small population of kudu available for visitors to observe. They reported the birth of a male kudu calf in 2019. Over a dozen other city and state zoos across the country, including the Maryland Zoo, also have lesser kudu on display for interested viewers.\nView all 43 animals that start with K"}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Aardvark images!\nAardvark Classification and Evolution\nAardvarks are small pig-like mammals that are found inhabiting a wide range of different habitats throughout Africa, south of the Sahara. They are mostly solitary and spend their days sleeping in underground burrows to protect them from the heat of the African sun, emerging in the cooler evening to search for food. Their name originates from the Afrikaans language in South Africa and means Earth Pig, due to their long snout and pig-like body. Aardvarks are unique among animals as they are the only surviving species in their animal family. Until recently it was widely believed that they were most closely related to other insectivores such as armadillos and pangolins but this is not the case with their closest living relatives actually thought to be elephants.\nAardvark Anatomy and Appearance\nAardvarks have a unique appearance amongst mammals (and indeed all animals) as they display physical characteristics of a number of different animal species. They have medium-sized, almost hairless bodies and long snouts that make them look distinctly pig-like at first, with thick skin that both protects them from the hot sun and also from being harmed by insect bites. They are able to close their nostrils to stop dust and insects from entering their nose. They have tubular, rabbit-like ears that can stand on end but can also be folded flat to prevent dirt from entering them when they are underground. Aardvarks have strong, claws on each of their spade-like feet that along with the fact that their hind legs are longer than their front legs, makes them strong and capable diggers able to excavate vast amounts of earth at an alarming rate. Due to the fact that they spend most of their lives underground or out hunting in the dark at night, they have poor eyesight but are able to easily navigate their surrounding using their excellent sense of smell to both find prey and to sense potential danger.\nAardvark Distribution and Habitat\nAardvarks are found in a wide variety of different habitats throughout sub-Saharan Africa from dry deserts to the moist rainforest regions. The only stipulation (other than having good access to plenty of food and water) is to have good soil in which they can dig their extensive burrows. Despite being highly skilled at digging in sandy or clay soil types, rockier regions prove more of a challenge to create their underground homes so the aardvark will move to another area where soil conditions are better suited to digging. Their burrows can be up to 10 meters (33 ft) long in a home range that can be anywhere from 2 to 5 kilometres square. Their burrows often having multiple entrances and are always left head first so they are able to identify potential predators easily using their keen sense of smell.\nAardvark Behaviour and Lifestyle\nAardvarks are mainly solitary animals that come together only to mate and are never found in large groups. They live in underground burrows to protect them both from the hot daytime sun and from predators. Aardvarks are nocturnal mammals, only leaving the safety of the burrow under the cover of night when they go in search of food and water, often travelling several miles in order to find the biggest termite mounds guided by their excellent hearing and sense of smell. Despite often having a large burrow comprised of an extensive network of tunnels, aardvarks are also known to be able to quickly excavate small temporary burrows where they can protect themselves quickly rather than having to return to their original dwelling.\nAardvark Reproduction and Life Cycles\nAardvarks have specific mating seasons that occur every year. Depending on the region in which the aardvark lives young can be born either in October to November, or May to June in other areas. Known to have babies most years, female aardvarks give birth to a single offspring after a gestation period that usually lasts for around 7 months. Newborn aardvarks often weigh as little as 2kg and are born with hairless, pink skin in the safety of their mother\u2019s burrow. Baby aardvarks spend the first two weeks of their lives in the safety of the underground burrow before beginning to venture out with their mother under the cover of night. However, despite accompanying their mother in search of food they aren\u2019t weaned until they are around three months old. Young aardvarks live with their mother in her burrow until they are around six months old when they move out to dig a burrow of their own. Although their lifespan in the wild is not entirely clear, aardvarks tend to live for more than 20 years in captivity.\nAardvark Diet and Prey\nThe diet of aardvarks is mainly comprised of ants and termites, with termites being their preferred food source. Despite this though, they are known to also eat other insects such as beetles and insect larvae. Aardvarks are built to be insectivores, with strong limbs and claws that are capable of breaking into the harder outer shell of termite mounds very efficiently. Once they have broken into the mound they then use their long, sticky tongue to harvest the insects inside and eat them whole without chewing as they are then ground down in their muscular stomachs. One of the aardvarks most distinctive features is the fact that they have columnar cheek-teeth that serve no functional purpose at all. With some larger ant species that need to be chewed they use the incisors that are located towards the back of their mouths. Aardvarks are also able to use the same techniques to break into underground ant nests.\nAardvark Predators and Threats\nDespite the fact that aardvarks are nocturnal animals that live in the safety of underground burrows, they are threatened by a number of different predators throughout their natural environment. Lions, leopards, hyenas and large snakes (most notably pythons) are the main predators of aardvarks but this does vary depending on where the aardvark lives. Their main form of defence is to escape very quickly underground however, they are also known to be quite aggressive when threatened by these larger animals. Aardvarks use their strong, sharp claws to try and injure their attacker along with kicking the threatening animal with their powerful back legs. Aardvarks are also threatened by humans who hunt them and destroy their natural habitats.\nAardvark Interesting Facts and Features\nAardvarks use their long, sticky tongue to lap up to 50,000 insects a night from inside termite mounds or underground ant nests. Their worm-like tongues can actually grow up to 30 cm in length meaning they can reach more termites further into the mound. Their love of insects has actually led aardvarks also being known as Antbears! Interestingly enough, aardvarks are also thought to get almost all of the moisture they need from their prey meaning that they actually have to physically drink very little water. Aardvarks are thought to be one of the world\u2019s most prolific diggers with their strong limbs and claws and shovel-like feet helping them to be able to shift 2ft of soil in just 15 seconds!\nAardvark Relationship with Humans\nDue to the fact that they spend the daytime hours hidden in the safety of their underground burrows, only emerging under the cover of night to hunt for food, aardvarks are very seldom seen by many people. In some regions though, they are hunted by people for food and are becoming increasingly affected by expanding human populations as more of their natural habitats disappear to make way for growing settlements.\nAardvark Conservation Status and Life Today\nToday, aardvarks are listed by the IUCN as a species that is of Least Concern. Despite the fact that population numbers of aardvarks most certainly declined in some countries, in others, their numbers remain stable and they are often commonly found in both protected areas and regions with suitable habitats. They are however becoming increasingly affected by habitat loss in both the form of deforestation and expanding towns and villages. Due to their incredibly elusive nature, exact population sizes are not fully understood.\nView all 122 animals that start with A"}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Cape Buffalo Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Cape-buffalo-facts.html", "text": "cape buffalo Facts\nPortrait of a Cape Buffalo\nThe most awesome of all cape buffalo facts is that they are so dangerous they are referred to as \"the Black Death\"! Highly prized by big game hunters, these incredible creatures are members of \"Africa's Big Five\" - the five most difficult African animals to hunt on foot.\nThe African lion, the leopard, the African elephant and the rhinoceros (either white or black), are the other four members, but the cape buffalo actually kills more big game hunters than the other four animals combined.\nThere are 4 subspecies of African buffalo, which is Africa's only cow-like animal. The largest of these is the Cape buffalo, which is the only subspecies recognized as a \"Big Five\" member. In other words, just like all Pit Bulls are dogs but not all dogs are Pit Bulls, all Cape buffalo are African buffalo, but not all African buffalo are Cape buffalo.\nIt is also incorrectly referred to as the water buffalo, which is a significantly different animal found in Asia. Water buffalo are taller than cape buffalo, but are actually domesticated animals, with mild personalities compared to their hot tempered cousin.\nThe cape buffalo is a herbivorous bovine, effectively a plant-eating cow, but they are extremely aggressive and downright vengeful. Displaying perhaps a little more smarts than a typical bovine, there are numerous accounts of them using their legendary memories and extreme persistence to enact revenge upon hunters who shoot at or injure them. Cape buffalo have stalked hunting parties, hiding in wait, and ambushing their attackers.\nThey reportedly charge thousands of people a year, and gore over 200. They can attack and cause serious injury with the tips of their huge, curved horns, or by head butting with their \"boss\" which is the solid shield of horn that covers the skull where the horns emerge.\nBoth males and females have horns, but the males horns grow larger and can measure close to 4 feet across. Males also develop a thicker neck, a larger hump over the shoulders, and a fringe of long hairs around the throat that looks a bit like a beard, but is called a \"dewlap\". The largest males approach 2,000 pounds and 6 feet at the shoulder and take nearly 10 years of growing to reach full size.\nFull grown individuals are rarely targeted by large predators, but weakened adults and calves are hunted by lions. Even for a large pride of lions however, attacking any member of a Cape buffalo herd is extremely perilous. Herd members will come rushing to eachothers aid, and many a full grown lion has been gored to death by the Cape buffalo's incredible horns.\ncape buffalo lifestyle\nCape buffalo are extremely gregarious herd animals that will gather in groups of thousands when grazing is good. In the dry season they break up into smaller groups of 30 to 200 or so to find food. Within these herds are several smaller sub-herds that stick together and travel together.\nCows and their offspring, including young bulls up to 3 years old, will form family type units of 10 to 30, generally lead by a few matriarchal females. Groups of young bachelors stay together, and mature bulls may stay in small groups of 4 or 5 grizzled veterans sometimes called \"gangs\". Bulls passed their prime are called \ufeff\"dagga boys\", and will stay on the perimeter of the herd. The movements of these herds is driven generally in the same direction, following food sources and green pastures as they emerge.\nCape buffalo cannot go long without drinking, and are rarely more than 10 miles from a water source. They travel close to rivers and waterways, and will joyfully wallow in mud if available. They cover themselves and roll around in muddy pools to keep cool in hotter months. The mud can prevent insect bites and may smother some insects as well.\nCape buffalo, although notorious for their aggression, particularly towards hunters, are highly social. They engage in mutual grooming, will rest or lie down in close proximity, resting their chins on eachothers backs and shoulders, and engage in affectionate nuzzling and playful ear chewing.\nThey are extraordinarily protective of eachother, and weak, injured or older herd members have been observed enjoying the support of the herd. When in unfamiliar territory or under attack, herds will often surround calves or weak members all facing outward in a circle, ready to fight all comers.\nThere have been numerous accounts over the years of buffalo coming to aid one of their own against a lion attack, mobbing lion prides with a community effort. A tendency to charge en masse Sometimes the buffalo are the aggressors, particularly if a solitary lion, hyena or wild dog wanders into the path of the herd. Older bulls and sometimes fearless matriarchs will chase and sometimes kill lone predators, and some even make sport of it.\ngorgeous Cape buffalo\ncape buffalo reproduction\nAfrican buffalo adults protecting calf\nDuring mating season mature bulls will drive off younger males and old bulls, while attempting to keep cows close. Males may engage in sparring, pushing eachother with their bosses, but goring is rare, and joists tend to be tests of strength, with the less robust party leaving the scene before any damage is done. Strong, healthy bulls in the 8 to 14 year range are most successful at attracting a herd of cows, and just a few males will actually breed with most of the females. Gradually, however, they lose their ability to defend their herd. Eventually, very old males will stop attempting to rejoin the herd and will stay on the outskirts in small groups, or sometimes alone. As cape buffalo age the hair on their rumps tends to bald, and older males can be identified by their bare behinds. With patches of bare skin exposed, mud wallowing is a requirement to prevent sunburn, and these older bulls spend lots of time by the mud holes. They are called \"dagga boys\" by the Zulu people, dagga being the Zulu word for mud. Dagga boys tend to be cantankerous, frustrated, and exceptionally dangerous, probably accounting for the majority of attacks on people. Cows are pregnant for about 340 days, and breeding is timed so that calving takes place at the beginning of the rainy season. The calf is born quite precocious, fully furred, eyes open and able to stand within minutes. Calves have no horns when newborn, but there are two horny circles on the head called \"buttons\" from which the horns will soon start to grow. It takes about 10 years for horns to reach full size, and for the boss to fully harden. Young calves are raised by their mother, but all members of the herd look out for them and may come to their aid. The herd will also form a circle around calves when danger is near. If a pride of lions or other threat approaches herd members will stand in a circle around the calves facing out, ready to defend the little ones.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

There are 2 species of oxpeckers, both very similar in appearance, one red-billed and the other yellow-billed.\nThey are both quite happy to roost on not just Cape buffalo, but also elephants, antelope, and especially rhinos. They feed on the insect parasites that infest their large hosts. Ticks, lice, flies, and fleas colonize on Cape buffalo and are eaten by these birds.\nThe oxpecker will remove embedded ticks from all areas of the hosts body, entering ears and nostrils, and excavating around delicate nether regions. This has always been thought of as a symbiotic relationship, with both creatures benefiting relatively equally, but recent observations suggest that the buffalo doesn't benefit nearly as much as the oxpecker.\nOnce thought to keep buffaloes wounds clean by removing dead tissue, it is now thought that the oxpeckers actually interfere with and delay proper healing.\nIt is also questionable how beneficial their control of ticks may be, since they tend to prefer blood-engorged ticks that have already fed off the buffalo, allowing the ticks that have just arrived to attach and settle in for a meal.\nBy doing this the birds are, in a way, actually consuming buffalo blood with each engorged tick they eat. So the pendulum is swinging towards the idea that oxpeckers, once thought to be little helpers, are actually just as parasitic as the parasites they feed on.\na few more cape buffalo facts\nCape buffalo are so powerful they have been know to tip over cars\nThe \"boss\" is the solid shield of horn that covers the top of the buffalo's head\nThe Cape buffalo is also called the African buffalo\nThere are 4 subspecies of Cape or African buffalo\nBaby Cape buffalo can run with the herd just an hour after being born\nNew born Cape buffalo have spots on their heads called \"buttons\" where the horns will grow\nCape buffalo have a top speed of 35 miles an hour\nCape buffalo are so dangerous they are known as \"the Black Death\"\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Artiodactyla\nFamily Bovidae\nGenus Syncerus\nSpecies caffer\nCape Buffalo - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT bull cow calf herd GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD herd, gang Africa savanna grass TOPSPEED ENDANGERED AVG WEIGHT AVG HEIGHT 35 mph no 1300 pounds 50-70 inches ESTRUS GESTATION BIRTH WEIGHT BIRTHHEIGHT 1 x year 340 days 90-120 pounds 20-26 inches RAISED BY # OF YOUNG AT BIRTH STANDS mother 1 eyes open 1/2 hour WEANED INDEPENDENT MATURITY LIFESPAN 6 months 1 year 2 - 3 years 15-25 years"}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Walrus Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Walrus-facts.html", "text": "walrus Facts\nPortrait of a Walrus\nOne of the most interesting walrus facts, is that they are one of the world's most social animals, spending about a third of their lives sleeping right on top of each other. The walrus is an aquatic carnivore with a voluminous body that has been specially designed for life in a frozen environment.\nWalruses can be found in the icy oceans of the North Pole at the top of the world, in places like Canada, Alaska, Russia, Greenland and Scandinavia.\nThe walrus is a member of the seal or pinniped family. The word pinniped means \"flipper feet\" or \"feather feet\". Within the pinniped family are three types of semi-aquatic marine mammals, the \"true seals\", the \"eared seals\" and the walrus.\nThe walrus is alone in its own genus, and there are 2 main species. The Atlantic walrus can be about 8 feet long and 2,000 pounds, while the Pacific walrus is larger, averaging about 10 feet long, with individuals topping 14 feet long and around 4,000 pounds.\nIt is actually believed that the walrus descended from a 3 foot long, bear-like animal that lived on land some 10 million years ago, and somehow during its evolutionary journey, returned to the ocean where its limbs slowly became flippers. Walrus flippers are short and square with all the skeletal features of a terrestrial forelimb, including five fully formed digits, but the digits are completely webbed. Each digit has a small nail, and the underside of the flippers are thick and roughened for traction on ice and snow.\nLiving in some of the coldest regions of the world, the walrus is equipped with nearly 1 inch of thick, wrinkled skin, and a blubber layer right underneath that can be almost 6 inches thick. Some mature males develop large, mole-like nodules called \"bosses\" over the skin of their necks, giving them a warty texture.\nThe skin color of the walrus changes as the animal moves from land to sea, and those changes are particularly evident on mature and older walruses who have thinning hair. The walrus is able to dive to depths of over 300 feet because of special adaptions that conserve oxygen.\nOn a deep dive, the blood retreats from the animals extremities and surrounds the brain and vital organs. The skin grows paler the longer the walrus is underwater, and on long diving binges, the walrus may even look white. Once they return to land, the blood begins to flow freely again, and the skin looks brown. When the walrus sunbathes for extended periods of time, the blood moves closer to the skins surface to be warmed, and the walrus will take on a pink hue.\nThe entire body of the walrus is shaped for water travel, starting with a small, flat-topped head, widening out to hulking shoulders, and narrowing again, like a huge spindle, to the rear flippers. Most of the underwater propulsion comes from the rear flippers, with the front flippers kept close to the sides and used only occasionally for steering and extra boost.\nGetting around on land requires stepping with the front flippers and then writhing the big torso forward, and may be assisted by stabbing the ice with the tusks and pulling. This is why the Latin name for the walrus translates roughly to \"tooth walker\".\nThe tusks are enlarged canine teeth, and both males and females grow them, although the males can be quite a bit larger. Babies are born without tusks, but they begin to grow out of the gums at about 6 months old, and will start to appear from under the top lip at about 14 months.\nThey are thought to continue growing for the first 15 to 20 years of a potential 40 year lifespan, and massive tusks mean high social rank. In fact, an established walrus that breaks a tusk will quickly loose its status.\nwalrus lifestyle\nWalruses are carnivores that eat virtually no plant material. They occasionally hunt small seals, and sometimes individual males will become very successful with that strategy. There have even been numerous accounts of two or more walruses teaming up to hunt together.\nBut mostly, the gigantic walrus feeds on very small creatures located in the environment of the sea floor known as the benthic zone. Clams and mollusks are their preferred snack, but sea cucumbers, worms, shrimp and fish are consumed as well, and the walrus can eat several thousand individual organism in a single feeding.\nThe wonderful face full of whiskers that gives the walrus such character, is a hunting tool. The whiskers are tactile hairs known as vibrissae, which are used to troll the sandy sea bottom. If the walrus finds something that needs to be dislodged, it will spit a jet of water into the crevice and knock the morsel free. When eating clams, the walrus uses great suction power, sucking the meat out and spitting the shell out.\nWalruses will skim along the ocean floor with their tusks parallel to the bottom and their whiskers busy kneading through the substrate. They use their tusks as sled runners, and rest on them as they go.\nAlthough it would seem to make sense, recent research shows walruses do not use their tusks when foraging in the deep sea. In fact, the main use of the tusks is to help the walrus haul itself up out of the water and onto an iceberg.\nAs they approach the edge of an iceberg, which may be sticking out of the water a few inches or a few feet, the walrus throws its head back and stabs the surface with its tusks, using them to lever itself out of the water.\nIts a pretty slick move, and when you see a mass like that wrenching itself from the ocean in a single motion you realize the simple utility of the incredible tusks. Naturally they are used for other things, like defense, scratching and as a measure of maturity and social status, but they are used most often as a kind of glorified shoehorn.\nThe walrus is an extremely social animal which seems to desire and take comfort in the closeness of the herd. Their lives are dictated by their need for lots of food, and they generally have schedules of eating that are pretty extreme. They will swim out to their feeding areas, dive up to 330 ft down to the bottom, although 80 to 200 foot dives are most common, and feed for 5 to 12 minutes at a time, and then return to the surface to breathe and rest.\nThese dives are amazing feats of engineering, where the blood moves away from the extremities and is concentrated around the brain and vital organs, while the blubber layer insulates, and the heartbeat slows to conserve heat.\nWhen they come back up to breathe, they redirect air into large chambers in their throats called \u2018pharyngeal pouches\u2019 that inflate and act like life preservers. With these pouches inflated they can rest effortlessly on the surface, and will even sleep in the water with their heads tossed back, bobbing dreamily.\nThe pharyngeal pouches are used as a way to communicate as well. Air can be pushed back and forth between the two chambers making a bell-like sound called \"chiming\". Another body part noise maker are the walruses very large flat teeth. They will chatter their jaws together and make a sound called \"clacking\" that sounds like drums.\nWalruses may spend 60 to 80 hours at sea feeding continuously, and then return to shore to haul out and rest, one on top of the other, in piles of dozens or hundreds of individuals, for 3 or 4 days straight.\nplaying walruses\nwalrus facts on reproduction\nbaby walrus\nWalruses live in huge herds of sometimes several thousand individuals, but these herds are separated by sex, and only come together once a year to mate. Females in estrus will gather in groups on the beach, and males will stake out territories on the coastline and try to attract them. Bulls will display by throwing their heads back and freezing with their tusks in the air, and making chiming noises by pushing air back and forth in their pharyngeal pouches.\nThey may fight with other bulls, using their tusks, and wrestling with each other. Immature bulls, and older or weaker males will remain in their herd and not participate.\nA bull must be in peak condition with fully developed tusks in order to attract females, and they won't generally be interested until he is about 15 years old. Cows won't mate until they are about 8 years old, and these long development times give the walrus a very slow reproductive rate, so it is difficult to maintain stressed populations.\nMating may occur both on land and in the water and then the female returns to her herd.\nThe walrus has a process of delayed implantation, which means the embryo does not start to develop until it has been in the womb for about 4 months. This ensures the youngsters will be born at the most ideal time of year, when food is plentiful.\nThe entire pregnancy lasts about 15 months, but the baby actually grows for only 11 months. The mother will usually seek a private ice float when she's ready to give birth. A newborn walrus, known as a pup or a calf, may weigh 100 to 150 pounds. Baby walruses are well developed when born with fur and open eyes, and they can swim within about an hour.\nDaughters or other female relatives, may join the new mom and can be very protective and maternal. Female walruses have been known to adopt orphans, and the walrus mother is exceptionally loving and cuddly. She will exchange kisses, and hold the baby in her flippers while floating in the water.\nThe baby stays very close, both on land and at sea, and if their are aunts around, they will surround the baby and form a shield of protection, especially while swimming.\nWhen babies are small, they may ride on their mothers back, balancing with their little flippers. They are born without tusks, but they cut through the gums at 5 or 6 months.\nThe baby may start to forage on the ocean floor by 6 or 7 months old, but may continue to nurse for up to 2 years.\nWalrus mothers are fiercely protective and will actively fight polar bears to protect their young. The polar bear is the babies primary threat, but killer whales will prey upon them as well.\nwalrus mother and baby\nthe endangered walrus\nGlobal warming has all sorts of negative effects on the world and its creatures. Some scientists believe that the Arctic could be entirely without ice during the summer months within 20 to 25 years. Walruses are bottom feeders who forage for invertebrates in the relatively shallow waters off the coasts.\nWhen not feeding they spend much of their time on sea-ice. Mother walruses give birth on sea ice in the springtime. Mothers depend on the sea ice for safety from predators as they raise their calves. The problem the melting ice cap poses for walruses is that the distance between the sea ice where they live for much of the year, and the coastlines where they feed is increasing as the ice margins recede.\nFor some mothers with youngsters, it means the babies aren't strong enough to make the trip back and forth. And mothers are forced to come ashore with their babies, where they can fall prey to hunters and polar bears. This scenario is becoming more and more true for adult walruses as well. Some herds numbering between 20,000 and 35,000 came ashore in Alaska in 2014 and 2015.\nThese were the first haul-outs of this size seen, and it appears the problem is only getting worse.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Wombat Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Wombat-facts.html", "text": "wombat Facts\nPortrait of a Wombat\nThe wombat is a terrestrial marsupial found in Australia and Tasmania. At 40 inches long and often over 70 pounds, they are the second largest marsupial with only the larger kangaroo species attaining greater adult size.\nWombats also have the largest brains of all the marsupials, and are notorious for cleverly digging alternate exits to their burrows when traditional traps are placed at the entrance.\nWombats do not climb like their closest relative the koala. They are entirely terrestrial and well-built for a fossorial lifestyle underground.\nThey use their powerful, well-clawed paws, and muscular forearms to dig large burrows that may reach as much as 150 feet in length.\nThey have stout, rounded, nearly tailless bodies which give them an adorable roly-poly look, however they are not fat.\nWombats are heavily muscled and can honestly claim to be \"big-boned\", having unusually thick bone diameter and exceptionally robust skeletal mass.\nThe wombat is a solitary creature that is largely nocturnal, grazing on grasses and foraging for roots, flowers and tendrils under cover of night.\nThey have tiny eyes and poor vision which is compensated for with excellent senses of hearing and smell.\nWith its meaty form and underground lifestyle the wombat is highly reminiscent of the badger, but the two species are not closely related.\nIn addition, while the badger is a very successful animal across numerous continents and urban as well as rural environments, the wombat is unable to adapt as its habitat is industrialized.\nMost native Australians have never seen a wombat in the wild, as they disappear quickly with urban development.\nThere are three species of wombat, two of which are endangered, and all of whom are experiencing rapid loss of habitat.\nIf the trend continues, wombat rescues and sanctuaries may soon be the only place one may observe these unique and precious animals. - Wombat Facts\nbare-nosed wombat and hairy-nosed wombat\nbare-nosed wombat\nhairy-nosed wombat\nThere are three species of wombat sporadically distributed along the coasts of Australia and Tasmania, with some isolated populations more inland and to the North.\nThe first and most populous is the common wombat, perhaps more correctly referred to as the bare-nosed wombat.\nHappily nick-named \"the bulldozer of the bush\" it is also known as the Coarse haired wombat, the Naked nosed wombat, the Forest wombat, the Island wombat, and the Tasmanian wombat.\nBare-nosed wombats have, in fact, a bare nose with downward facing nostrils which is very similar in appearance to its close relative the koala. They have rounder heads, smaller ears, more dexterous front paws, and longer bodies than the hairy-nosed wombats.\nAlthough some populations are threatened, the species as a whole is not endangered.\nThey are the most widespread of the wombat species, and what most people think of when they think \"wombat.\"\nThe Southern hairy-nosed wombats have a longer, almost sledge-shaped head with much longer and more thin-skinned ears.\nThe most obvious distinguishing feature is the nose, which is not just finely furred and heavily whiskered, but is an entirely different shape from the bare-nosed wombats.\nThe hairy-nosed wombats snout is blunt and pig-like. It is a large, oval-shaped flat plane with two large, evenly spaced round nostrils and a deep crease running vertically down the center.\nThe Southern hairy-nosed ranges intermittently along the Southern coast of Australia and is listed as an endangered species.\nLooking very similar to the Southern hairy-nosed wombat, the third species of wombat known as the Northern hairy-nosed, is nearly extinct in the wild.\nIt lives in a range of only 750 acres of Forest in east-central Queensland, Australia.\nAt last count there were a little over 100 individuals remaining. The Northern hairy-nosed wombat is considered the most critically endangered of the marsupials, and one of the most critically endangered large mammals in the world.\nwombat lifestyle and reproduction\nbare-nosed wombat mother and baby\nWombats are marsupials, like kangaroos and koala bears, which means that their babies start to develop in the womb, but then move to a pouch on the mothers abdomen to continue growing.\nThe wombat is generally a solitary animal that maintains a small territory, marking it routinely with urine sprays and droppings and avoiding other wombats when possible.\nThey dig several different burrows at different ends of their range, and will alternate resting spots.\nOccasionally wombats may share a den, but interaction is minimal.\nFemales appear to come into season once a year, and local males may get into skirmishes to establish dominance. The pair will stay together for a few days, but the male plays no part in the rearing of young.\nFemales are pregnant for about 22 days and give birth to one infant. The newborn is bright red, hairless, and blind. It is only about the size of a jellybean, and is called a neonate at this unformed stage of development..\nThe teenie neonate makes its way, unaided by its mother, to the pouch, pulling itself through a forest of belly hair by its front limbs.\nThe wombats pouch faces rearward and the baby wombats trip is much shorter than that of a kangaroo - only about 3 inches, compared to the marathon trek of up to 15 inches inches that a neonate kangaroo must make.\nOnce in the pouch, the neonate will immediately latch itself to one of the mothers two teats.\nThe teat fills with milk at this point, and the baby is virtually locked to it for the first several weeks in the pouch.\nThe baby wombat continues to develop in the protection of the pouch for an additional 4 months or so, but by 5 months the baby is out and about, exploring its world and grazing by its mothers side.\nDangers in the babies first year or two include predation by dingos, snakes, and birds of prey.\nBaby wombats begin to dig their own practice dens at about 8 months old, but will still continue to sleep in their mothers den for many months.\nThey stay with their mothers for 1 1/2 to 2 years, before heading off on their own. - Wombat Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Unlike some other impressive earth movers like badgers and anteaters, the wombats front claws are not unusually long. They are, however, very thick, and virtually unbreakable.\nWombats move dirt with all four limbs and their snout, and will dig both forwards and backwards.\nWhen walking around in their underground lairs they waddle from side to side, bumping the tunnel walls as they go.\nThey are extremely tough-skinned and seem somewhat impervious to pain. They have been known to walk straight through fences making no attempt to go around, under, and certainly not over.\nThey plow through shrubs and brush, head low, their big shoulders and forehead taking whatever impacts may come, and they have been dubbed the \"bulldozers of the bush\" by native Australians who admire the awesome Aussie-like ruggedness of the otherwise cuddly looking animal.\nThe bare-nosed wombat has fairly dexterous front paws that it may use to grasp things. It has even been observed to use its front paws to pull vegetation from the ground and move it to its mouth.\nHairy-nosed wombats have chubbier feet and can't grasp with their forepaws in this fashion.\nWombats have few natural enemies, with humans pretty much standing alone on the list. Dingoes will take wombats occasionally, but only when numbers are in their favor. A fully grown wombat can often outweigh and definitely out power a dingo one on one.\ndingo\nThe wombats teeth are designed for ripping grass and breaking down vegetable matter, and its defensive instincts don't usually involve biting.\nThe wombat will, instead, attempt to bluff an attacker with hissing sounds and charging behavior, and it may turn its back on an attacker and kick out double-barreled like a donkey with its sharp-clawed hind legs.\nIf the wombat can retreat to its burrow, it will dive in head first, tuck its rear legs under and present just its big round rump to the pursuer.\nThe wombats fur is thick and the skin, particularly over the back end, is very tough. With just a button of a tail, there is little to latch on to, and a dingo may depart in frustration.\nDingoes in pursuit of wombats have been known to follow them into their den which is a very poor lapse in judgment.\nAlthough certainly not a common occurrence, wombats have been observed removing the limp bodies of dingoes from their dens after having crushed them against the walls of the confined space.\nIf the dingo attempts to get on top of the wombat inside a tunnel, the wombat will extend its legs and suffocate or crush the offender against the walls or ceiling.\nImagine a 60 pound dingo, the largest carnivore in Australia, being squeezed to death against the ceiling of a wombat den by a solid 80 pound block of hissing muscle.\nGotta watch who you pick on. - Wombat Facts\na few more wombat facts\nnap time\nWhen the busy day catches up with them, wombats will nap lying flat on their backs.\nWombats are most closely related to koalas but have much larger brains.\nWombats are quite accurately nick-named \"the bulldozers of the bush\"\nA newborn wombat is the size of a jellybean!\nThe mothers wombats pouch is called a \"marsupium\", and is where the word \"marsupial\" comes from.\nWombats are at home on the beach\nThe wombats teeth never stop growing\nThe wombats pouch faces backward - not forward like a kangaroo\nA wombats den can be 150 feet long and have 5 different exits and entrances\nMale wombats are Jacks female wombats are Jills and baby wombats are Joeys\nA wombats droppings are in the shape of a cube.\nWombats snore...

Just like people, mother chimpanzees often develop lifelong relationships with their offspring. By following wild chimps through the forests, scientists discovered that chimps use medicinal plants to treat themselves for illness and injury. Scientists have isolated an anti-tumor agent in one such plant. Chimpanzees are very social primates that use facial expressions, vocalizations, body language, grooming, and even kisses and pats to communicate with members of their group. The differences between monkeys and apes are easy to see once you know what to look for. Apes do not have a tail and are generally larger than most other primates. They have a more upright body posture as well. Apes rely more on vision than on smell and have a short broad nose rather than a snout, as Old World monkeys do. Apes have a larger brain relative to the body size than other primates do.\nEcology and Conservation\nWhile foraging through an area, a chimp feeds on a variety of fruits. A few days later, the seeds pass through the digestive tract and germinate far away from the parent plant. This method of seed dispersal insures healthy plant diversity within the habitat and creates shelter and food for other forest dwellers, including native peoples.\nBecause chimps closely resemble humans, studying their behavior and biology may provide great insight for solving the mysteries of our own ancestry and social development.\nThere are only four subspecies of chimpanzee left in the wild today. Habitat loss, poaching, and the bush meat trade are the main causes behind chimp deaths.\nBusch Gardens is proud of its long-standing relationship with the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Ga., the site of some of the most well-respected primate research programs in the world. Busch Gardens has partnered with the Yerkes Center on several primate conservation research programs including the Tana River Primate Research Center in Southeast Kenya and in-park behavioral research carried out by Frans de Waal, Ph.D. and his staff at the Yerkes Center.\nBibliography\nGhiglieri, Michael P.

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Kangaroo Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Kangaroo-facts.html", "text": "kangaroo Facts\nKangaroos are members of the zoological family macropodidae or \"macropods\". The word macropod is derived from Ancient Greek language meaning \"long foot\".\nThe family also includes the wallaby and the wallaroo, but the term \"kangaroo\" generally refers to three species of large Australian macropods within the genus macropus, the red kangaroo, and the Eastern and Western grey kangaroos.\nKangaroos live in groups of 5 to 40 individuals called \"mobs\". They can be found throughout much of Australia, particularly the arid interior grasslands commonly called the \"outback\".\nThe most stunning distinguishing feature of the kangaroo is the overall skeletal uniqueness of these animals.\nThey are bi-pedal animals but they can't walk. The hind legs are designed to move together, and the kangaroo gets from place to place by hopping or bouncing. It is unclear how this form of locomotion evolved, but it is highly successful and efficient, taking kangaroos on long journeys as they search for grass and water in a dry and difficult habitat.\nAlong with its spectacular form of motion, the female kangaroo has a very large forward facing pouch where its young eat, sleep and live for the first six to eight months of life.\nThe baby kangaroo, called a joey, can be remarkably large by the time it stops using the pouch, and can be seen diving in head first, feet, ears or tail dangling out while it nurses or naps.\nThe kangaroo is native only to Australia, and is used, along with the large flightless bird called the emu, on the Australian coat of arms.\nKangaroos are not endangered and have healthy populations throughout their range. The kangaroo is hunted in Australia in harvests similar to deer hunting season in other countries, but the practice is under heavy scrutiny and criticism by some groups.\nKangaroo meat and fur are a natural part of the culture of many Australians.\nKangaroos are herbivores that spend the cooler parts of the day foraging for grasses and numerous species of plants. The midday finds mobs of kangaroos seeking refuge from the sun, often digging out shallow napping holes in the clay to beat the heat.\nKangaroos are well adapted to life in arid conditions and have similar physical adaptions to animals like the camel. They can regulate their blood chemistry to adapt in times of drought, and will even become infertile for entire seasons if the body is depleted of water. Because of this adaption, kangaroo populations in the wild vary greatly depending upon the amount of rainfall in past years.\nKangaroos have good vision and excellent hearing, and when a member of the \"mob\" spots danger they will warn the others by thumping the ground with their huge feet. They have a superior sense of smell as well, detecting watering holes from miles away.\nIn the outback, where water is scarce, groups of up to 1,000 kangaroos may converge on a watering source at one time.\nThe kangaroo is a large animal with some adult males reaching over 6 feet tall and weighing 200 pounds, but dingos can still pose a threat, and kangaroos, amazingly, have been observed making a getaway by diving in a river or lake and swimming to safety.\nThe hind legs, which don't move independently on land, move separately when swimming!\nwhat is the difference between red kangaroos and grey kangaroos?\nThe most recognizable kangaroos are also the largest, most populous and least endangered.\nThe red kangaroo is the largest marsupial on Earth. Males can be enormous at over 6 feet tall and 200 pounds. These are muscular and robust animals that can move at speeds of over 35 miles an hour, gobbling up land with 25 foot leaps. Red kangaroos are not always red, however. Males tend to have rusty colored fur, even when immature, and females are usually blue- grey or brown in color, but there are grey males and red females as well.\nSo the red kangaroo can't be distinguished by fur color alone. Red kangaroos have narrow eyes and distinctive white or pale colored stripes down their cheeks, and black dashes at the corners of the mouth.\nThe Eastern and Western grey kangaroos look very similar and were once considered the same species. They are generally not as tall as the red kangaroo but still quite large, and Eastern grey males can actually weigh more than red males.\nThe Western grey has the distinction of being known as \"the \"stinker\". They have a strong odor caused by the types of plants they eat.\nwhat is the difference between a kangaroo, a wallaby and a wallaroo?\nWithin the family of macropods are dozens of smaller species of very \"kangaroo-like\" animals.\nThe wallaby is any number of about 30 species of macropds that are much smaller than the kangaroos, and may be as small as 10 pounds.\nWalaroos are three species of macropod that are slightly smaller, overall, than the smallest kangaroos, but larger than most of the wallabies.\nLifestyles and physiology of all of these species is fairly similar. All are land-dwelling grazers that live in social groups.\nThe tree kangaroo is in its own genus and is quite different from the true kangaroos. Tree kangaroos are small, tree-dwelling, nocturnal marsupials.\nTheir front limbs are closer in length and development to the hind legs. The hind legs have smaller, wider feet than kangaroos, with large curved claws to assist in climbing, but the tree kangaroo still hops when on the ground.\nTree kangaroos have several subspecies that live in the rain forests of New Guinea and North Eastern Australia. Many species of wallaby and all of the tree kangaroo species are critically endangered.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

In some regions these groups come in two forms. One type of group will be a dominant male with several females, and the other will be groups of bachelor males.\nIn some other kangaroo societies, the structure is less defined. Multiple individuals of both sexes will live together and males will court females as they come into season, fighting or \"boxing\" with other males for mating rights. Males may have multiple partners, but females are usually only receptive for a few days and will reject other suitors once they have mated.\nIf the mating is successful, the pregnancy will last approximately 35 days, with slight variations between the species for the majority of these time frames.\nThe newborn kangaroo is called a \"neonate\", because it is not fully formed, and can't survive outside of the womb. It must immediately make its way to the mothers pouch, which, in large red kangaroos, can be a perilous 15 inch trek trough a forest of the mothers belly fur.\nThe neonate is blind, earless and hairless. Only three functions of its body are operational, its sense of smell, its strong front legs and claws, and its instinct to find the pouch. The neonate thrusts forward with no assistance from its mother, dragging its tiny body - only about the size of a jellybean- to the pouch.\nOnce inside, it attaches to one of four teats. The teat swells when stimulated and the baby is practically locked in place by a mouth full of mothers milk.\nThe mothers reproductive system is triggered by the neonate attaching to the teat, and within just a few days of giving birth she will come into season again. If she is impregnated, the new embryo in the womb will grow for the first week and then become dormant, allowing the mothers body to continue to provide for the joey in the pouch.\nThis process is known as embryonic diapause. The development of the embryo is delayed until the older sibling leaves the pouch, usually at about 7 or 8 months old.\nAt this stage a joey is considered to be \"at foot\", no longer living in the pouch, but still nursing occasionally.\nThe mother will give birth to another neonate while she still has a baby at foot. In fact, if the female breeds successfully each time she comes into estrus, she will occasionally be caring for three offspring at once- a neonate and a joey in the pouch, and an older joey \"at foot\", ready to be weaned.\nHer body is actually able to produce a different kind of milk in each nipple, so the neonate, the joey in pouch and the joey at foot receive different types of milk from different nipples designed to maintain dormancy, foster growth or help with weaning. - Kangaroo Facts\nboxing kangaroos\nIn the outback, groups of bachelor male kangaroos spend hours a day competing in mock battles, waiting and training for the chance to overturn an alpha male.\nMale kangaroos have strong backs and shoulders, and although their forelimbs are much smaller than their hind limbs, they are powerful and equipped with sharp claws.\nKangaroos \"box\" by swatting each other in the face and chest, but also spend allot of time clinching. They will wrestle each other attempting to push each other backwards, which usually results in the fallen individual retreating.\nIn more serious fights, kangaroos will kick out with both legs at the same time, using their tails to support them as they extend their powerful clawed hind feet towards their rivals.\nAlthough these fights look dangerous, kangaroos rarely injure each other.\nMuch of the kangaroo boxing match seems to be more ritual than real attempts to do harm. The \"loser\" can retreat and is rarely pursued.\nNaturally, human beings found a way to exploit some of the tendencies of male kangaroos by creating side shows and circus acts with \"boxing\" kangaroos.\nUsually a volunteer from the audience was involved, and sometimes these competitions involved prize money. Animals in this position were probably under enormous stress, feeling threatened and forced to defend themselves constantly, but many of the hapless human \"volunteers\" got off even worse.\nThere are no real verifiable records of kangaroos killing human beings, but they are large and powerful animals that can and do cause serious injury when threatened. - Kangaroo Facts\nhow kangaroos hop\ngrey kangaroo mob in the outback\nKangaroo locomotion is all about hopping. The kangaroo is effectively a bi-pedal animal, standing on its two large hind feet the majority of the time. It has small forelimbs and relatively dexterous front paws with five digits. The thumb is not opposable. Kangaroos can grasp things with their front paws but they don't do this often, only occasionally grabbing branches or grasses.\nAlthough kangaroos stand upright they can't walk on their hind legs because the legs can't move independently. The tail is so large and powerful that it acts as a third (or fifth) limb and makes the kangaroo almost more tri-pedal than bi-pedal.\nThe tibia bone of the hind leg (shin bone) is twice as long as the femur (thigh bone) and creates a sort of \"z\" shape to the hind legs which act like two giant springs, capable of propelling the kangaroo up to 30 feet in a single bound. This unusual form of locomotion is called saltation.\nThe legs have no knee caps, and the tibia bone has pads of shock-absorbing fibrous cartilage unique to the kangaroo.\nThe muscular tail is as long as the entire body, and is used as a massive rudder when hopping. The tail is capable of easily supporting all of the kangaroos weight. Kangaroos can rock back on their tails and deliver powerful kicks with both legs at the same time.\nThe hind legs only move separately when the kangaroo is reclining, stretching or swimming. When it is in motion on land, the legs always move in tandem.\nWhen moving at full speed, the forelegs are held in front of the chest and the hind legs do all the work. When grazing and foraging the kangaroo moves by by supporting its weight in a tri-pod of the two front paws and the tail and then lifting the hind feet together and swinging them forward in a shuffling gate. This is sometimes referred to as walking on \"all fives\".\nFinally, because of the weight and position of the tail, kangaroos can't walk or hop backwards. This inability to take an effective step back is what landed them on the Australia coat of arms as a symbol of progress. - Kangaroo Facts\na few more kangaroo facts\nThe kangaroo is the largest marsupial\nKangaroos are only about the size of a jellybean at birth\nThe kangaroo is the only large mammal that moves by hopping\nKangaroos can hop up to 30 feet in one jump\nKangaroos can jump up to 10 feet high\nKangaroos hind legs always move together except when they are swimming\nThe mothers pouch is called a \"marsupium\", and is where the word \"marsupial\" comes from.\nBecause of their unusual body structure kangaroos never move backwards and because they are always moving forward Australia uses a kangaroo on its coat of arms as a symbol of the countries resolute nature and dedication to progress"}

Born in litters of only 2 or 3 cubs, the baby hyenas are so aggressive that they may force a weaker sibling to starve by pushing it away from the mother.\nThey need this toughness to survive in the pack, and thrive on the African savanna.\nThe spotted hyena is the most common hyena species, and also the largest.\nAdults are about 30 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 100 to 180 pounds.\nFemale hyenas are larger and more aggressive than males.\nHyena pregnancy lasts about 110 days, and newborns are well-developed.\nSpotted hyena babies are born with black, scruffy fur, tiny teeth already broken through their gums, and their eyes open.\nThey weigh only about one pound when newborn, and for the first few days of life, the mother hyena may keep them from the rest of the clan.\nAt about 3 weeks old the black coat starts to lighten, and spots appear. The babies become much more active and mingle with the clan.\nThe mother hyena will leave them with male \"baby sitters\" as she goes out to hunt with the female hyenas.\nThe society of the spotted hyena is matriarchal, meaning that females are larger, stronger and more aggressive than males.\nFemale spotted hyenas have unusually high testosterone levels that don't just change behavior but also transform the female sex organs.\nThe female hyena looks almost identical to the male, and even experts can't sex them without a physical examination.\nThis has caused many to believe that hyenas are clans of devilish hermaphrodites whose cackles mock the norm.\nBut actual intercourse is no laughing matter, it is a delicate and stressful process where a submissive male must somehow arch his way under the female to complete the act.\nThere are usually two cubs delivered, but fighting between the cubs often occurs, particularly if they are the same sex, and the weaker sibling will often perish in the first weeks.\nYoung males will leave the clan at about 2 years, females will remain for life.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Chimpanzee - The Animal Facts", "url": "https://www.theanimalfacts.com/mammals/chimpanzee/", "text": "Range\nAfrica is the native home of the chimpanzee. Here they can be found throughout Central and West Africa. They have the largest geographic range of any great ape and can be found across 21 countries.\nHabitat\nThey predominantly inhabit dense tropical rainforests but they are also found in woodlands, bamboo forests, swamps, secondary growth forests and even open savanna although usually only when they are moving from one area to another. Because they have an extremely varied diet they are able to live in a larger number of habitats.\nHabitat destruction is their greatest threat as well as hunting both for bushmeat and the pet trade.\nReproduction\nBreeding takes place year round in areas where there is an abundance of food. After a gestation period of 230 -240 days the female will give birth to a single baby, twins are very rare.\nAt birth the newborn will weigh approximately 1.9 kgs (4 pounds) and is extremely helpless. The newborn holds on tightly to the mothers breast for the first few months and then starts riding on the mothers back.\nJust like a human baby chimpanzee young develop very slowly. They will suckle from their mother until they are about three years old and by about the age of 4 they will mostly be walking on their own. They will then stay with their mother for another few years learning all the skills that they need to know to survive on their own.\nJust like human mothers chimpanzees often develop a close bond with their young that lasts all their life.\nSexual maturity is reached at 8 years old but they are typically 13-14 by the time they give birth for the first time.\nBehavior\nChimpanzees are humans closest living relatives and share about 98% of our genetic blueprint, they share some behaviours with humans.\nChimpanzees live in groups called communities and these communities are made up of several different family groups. The family groups are usually made up of 6 to 10 animals while the communities can have as many as 100 animals in them. There is a social heirachy within the communities with an alpha male usually the leader although in some communities the leadership is shared between several males.\nChimpanzees communicate in several ways such as vocalisations, body language, facial expressions, clapping, grooming and even kissing with other members of their family groups or communities.\nChimps are able to make tools for use in getting food and some also construct nests to sleep in at night in the trees. Chimpanzees have been known to show some behaviours which are very similiar to humans such as showing respect to each other, curiosity, mourning and romantic love. They also sometimes seem to \u201cpretend play\u201d with items."}
{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "Animal adaptation - Tartu", "url": "http://www.veeriku.tartu.ee/~ppensa/animal_adaptation.html", "text": "Giraffe\nGiraffes are well adapted to a life in a savannah. They drink water when it is aivailable but can go weeks without it, they rely on morning dew and the water content of their food. Their very long necks are an adaption to feeding at high levels in the treetops. Their physical adaption, a long neck, does not only help them to graze but also helps them keep track of predators and it enables visual communication with other giraffe over several miles.\nIn the giraffe did not have a long neck it would be an easier pray for predators and it would not get as much food.\nSimilar to giraffes are elephants. They use long trunks to reach high tree-tops.\nPille\nHyena\nIt is eating dead animals' corpses and it does not kill them. It lets to do the killing by lions. It is not very brave too. It can have eating problems because of that it does not kill the animal. It has many similar animals to him, for example lions, wild dogs, jackals and vultures.\nIvo\nWallaroo\nWallaroo inhabits the mountanous pastures of eastern Australia. It prefers to live in rocky outcrops or stoney ground. That is why it has furry pads on feet, for climbing rocks. It is adapted to dig watr from the ground, that is how it gets its water. If it would not dig for water it would surely die. Many animals in that environment dig for water because there is not much water there.\nVova\nAfrican Hedgehog\nThis animal has spiny armour, it is the main reason for their survival. The ability to curl up involves minor skeletal modifications and the unique circular skin muscle. This animal is omnivorous and nocturnial animal. Also they have very acute auditory sense and olfactory sense.\nWhen this animal would not have these adaptations, this animal could not protect himself from predators and will have difficult to find food.\nThere is one animal who has similar adaptations, it is porcupine.\nTairo\nSquirrel Monkey\nSquirrel Monkeys move through the trees by leaping. They have small back legs, that allows more jumping force. Thei live on trees. They do not come down from treesw because there is no food and hunters can kill them. They are bugger tha n squirrels.\nArdo\nBactrian Camel\nLong legs allow Bactrian Camel to travel great distances easily. Fat stored in two humps. The Bactrian Camels are classified as herbivores. They live primarly in Central Asian deserts north of the Himalayas. The Bactrian Camel has a remarkable capacity to endure extreme temperatures, both high and low. It lives in small groups of up to twenty individuals, led by an adult male. The camel can go without food and water for 3 to 4 days. There is Arabian Camel with similar adaptations.\nJ\u00fcri\nElephant\nIt has a trunk and tusks which keep him alive. It uses its tusks in order to protect himself. It uses its trunk in order to drink, gather food and bathe itself. These things are a physical part of the animal.If the animal did not have these things it would not be able to eat, drink, bath itself or protect itself.\nHenrik\nGiraffe\nSpecial adaptations of Giraffe are that she can be long time without water and with her long neck she could eat food at high levels in the treetops. These adaptations are physical.\nIf Giraffe did not have these adaptations, it might have some problems like it can not drink water and it is hard to get food. Also it can not live in savanna.\nYes other animals in savanna have some similar adaptions like they can be long time without water. For example elephant, zebra.\nKeteli\nZebra\nZebars live in savannas. They can run quickly to escape from predator (like lions, hyenas), because they have long legs. They eat grasses and drink water veru often, so they must stay near the water. They move as one big family. Those are the behavioural adaptations. if they have not got long legs, then they could not run quickly and so the predators could catch them easily. Zebras are closely related to horses and donkeys.\nKarel\nPolar Bear\nPolar bear has thick fur to protect itself from cold. It has fat under its skin. They have longer legs than other bears have and have very furry feet. These feet help to distribute their weight as they walk on a thin ice. All these are physical adaptions.\nPolar bear would feel very cold without thick skin, it would be hard to insulate them in the frigid waters without hollow hairs. Without their large feet they wouldn't stay on the thin ice. There live also phocas who have streamlined and slippery skin and they have thick skin. Polar bear eats them.\nPolar bears are very dangerous animals for people. They are white and it is quite good adaption to hide there in Arctic pole where everything is white and bright. It is good when it hunts phocas. When female polar bear gets little polar bears then she hs to hide them from male polar bear because he may eat them to get attention of female polar bear.\nTea\nWallaroo\nThey have furry pads on feet. They are good for rock climbing. They dig actually for water. These adaptions are behavioural part of the animal. This animal is adpted to heat and dryness. If this animal would not have these adaptions it would not get water and if it would not have furry pads it could not climb.\nThere are other animals too, who adapted with these things, like wallabies, pademelons, tree-kangaroos, forets allabies and potoroos.\nIvi\nWhite-Cheeked Gibbon\nThis little monkey lives in high canopy of tropical rainforests.\nUsually they eat small and pulpy fruit, buds, young leaves and sometimes invertebrates too. Family members feed together usually, but sometimes they forage alone. But when they are going to rest or sleep (at night) they get together again.\nTheir home territory is very large, about 8,5 acres. But it may vary very much. And they protect their area very carefully.\nSingle offsprings born every year two or three years after 7-8 month gestation. Their maturity occurs when they are about 6 years old. But males leave the family when they are about 8 years old. Usually they live about 25 or more years.\nTriin\nKoala\nKoalas are perfectly designed for their tree-dwelling life. Their hands have a large gap between the first and second fingers and their big toe is set ata a wide angle to the foot. This gives the koala vicelike grip on branches. They comfortabely sit in a tree alla day because of their thickly padded toes. That means the adaptation is more of a behaviour, if they would not eat eucalypt tree leaves they would drink a lot more water because they get the water from the leaves. If kola would not climb trees, it could have been eaten out of existence, because they are too slow to escape from predators as dingoes are.\nThere are not many animals who have similar adptions as koala, in fact there are none in koala's environment. But near their environment is an animal called three toed sloth, who also climbs trees and is slow.\nPeeter\nSquirrel\nSquirrel has got strong teeth, it brakes nuts with them. It also runs and hides itself to the treetops. Its enemies are bigger animals and people. It also has got claws. Adaptations are physical but also behavioural too. When squirrel did not got teeth it could not eat or when it did not run away it could be eaten. Squirrel is a very interesting animal. Similar to it is beaver.\nJohanna\nKoala\nKoalas have an opposable modified index finger that acts as a second thumb. Their big toe is set at a wide angle to the foot. The adaptations are more of a behaviour that the koala uses. It would not get any food. The sloth has similar adaptions.\nMarge\nArmadillo\nArmadillos are mammals. There are 20 species of Armadillos, grouped in 9 genera and distributed through America from Argentina to the South-Eastern corner of U.S.\nMany armadillos are nocturnal. They live in burrows when not active.\nArmadillos live on a variety of food. Insects and other invertebrates, plants and small vertebrates such as snakes and lizards. Naked-tailed armadillos feed mainly on ants and termites.\n1-4 young armadillos are born each year depending on the spechies. The young are born with a soft leathery skin which hardens after a few days.\nKillu\nZebra\nZebras are abel to run 40mph. Zebras use hooves and teeth in defence. They have stripes to recognize each other. They live in family group. Family group has a leader, sometimes 2 leaders. Also stripes confuse tsetse flies who can not see zebra for the stripes. Some of those adaptions are physical part of the animal. There are also some adaptions that they use. If zebras would not live in groups they would be weaker. If they could not run that fast predators would kill more zebras then they do now. If zebras would not have stripes they would not be able to recognize each other that well and tsetse flies would see them well.\nIn this environment deers and antilopes can also run fast. With that aptations they can escape from predators.\nMairi\nCalifornian King Snake\nCalifornian King Snake is partially or wholly immune to the venom of rattlesnakes and is able to eat and kill them. These adaptions are more of a behavioural ones and the Californian King Snake uses them. If the snake would not have those adaptions it would die. (It might have not something to eat). Other animals who live in this environment do not have similar adaptions.\nEvelin\nGiraffe\nGiraffe has long neck to reach to the high trees and eat eat the leaves. It has a muscular tongue to take the leaves. The tall neck enables to see enemies from far distance. It runs fast and can go without drinking for a long period.\nGiraffes can communicate with other giraffes over few miles. Giraffes can not make big sound, they only grunt, snort and bleat. They are used to sleep for 1-20 minutes, not longer. They sleep and they do not lie down. When they fight they use their neck and head banging.\nHelina\nRed Panda\nRed Panda feeds at night, so it does not have to compete with other animals that feed on the same things and has extra thumbs on its front paws to grab better. So its adaptions are both physical and behavioural. Thanks to these adaptions it does not have to worry about competition or fear about predators. Another of its adaptions is shared with squirrels-the big bushy tail to keep balance while climbing. Red pandas prefer temperate forests.\nPirgit\nPlatypus\nPlatypus is perfectly designed for underwater life, it has two layers of fur - the first is short and dense and never lets water through to the skin. The second is longer and is the layer of fur that gets wet. Platypus has the flat furry tail which stores fat for long cold winter in freezing waters.\nThe adaptions are physical part of the animal. If platypus did not have these adaptions if its fur gets wet, it would not keep platypus warm. Also if platypus did not have sensitive beak, it would not find food. And if it did not have tail that stores fat for winter, it would not survive a winter.\nThere are no other animal in this environment that have similar adaptions.\nTriinu\nPolar Bear\nPolar bears live year round near arctic waters hunting seal and other animals, rarely coming on land exept on islands and rocky points. In winter they hunt along the Arctic shelfs looking for tasty seals, fish and even humans. Polar bears are very dangerous, and grow to a huge size and weight, as much as small automobile. They have longer legs than other bears and large furry feet. These big feet help to distribute their weight as they walk on thin ice in the Arctic waters.\nMaris\nSiberian Tiger\nThey live in a climate where the winter can get snowy and the cold is bitter. To start with, the Siberian tiger has an extra layer of fat on its body to insulate it from the cold. It also has a very thick coat and more fur on the foot pads. These physical adaptations help the tiger survive the harsh Siberian winters. Also, all these tigers are great hunters, capable of bringing down animals larger than their own selves. The hind limbs are longer than its forelimbs, which is an adaptation for longer jumps. Northern forests offer the lowest human density of any tiger habitat, and the most complete ecosystem. The vast woodlands also allow tigers far more room to roam, as Russia's timber industry is currently less extensive than that of many other countries. For an animal that hunts alone it is easier to hide and to get its prey. However, in times when food is hard to find, they may come together and cooperate.\nCasandra\nPolar Bear\nTheir thick fur keeps them warm in frigid air and water. Their white fur actually transparent, for camouflage in ice and snow. their skin is black to absorb heat from the sun's rays to help keep them warm. the pads provide traction on ice. Claws are curved to dig through ice. Small ears and tails are short to minimize heat loss. Teeth are more jagged than most bears, suiting a carnivore. their nostrils close underwater. They ceep their fur clean because of camouflage.\nAdolf\nBengal Tiger\nBengal tigers are nocturnal: they hunt at night. Though powerful and quick over short distances, they stalk their prey because they cannot outrun faster prey. The tiger kills small prey with a bite on the back of the neck and large prey with a bite to the throat. Since Bengal tigers are solitary and do not like to share their hunting grounds, they need large home ranges in which to hunt. Males occupy about 20 square miles, while females typically require 17 square miles.\nEllen-Maria\nChimpanzee\nChimpanzees live and work in groups up to one hundred. It helps them a lot because they can keep each other safe. Their worst predator is the leopard. Leopards always go for the weak or young. If they stay together the leopard wouldn't attack because the strong will help the weak and young. Their communication sounds like a screaming squeak. They only live in the trees they eat from. And they also help each other groom.\nHelen\nGrizzly Bear\nGrizzlies and Black Bears use their claws as an adaptation to hunt, climb and dig. Grizzlys also have a very good smell to get to thier prey Grizzly bears can stand on their back legs. This allows them to dance, and see if danger is approaching. Grizzly bears have their cubs inside of their dens during hibernation. This allows them to train the babes to hunt, dance, and survive before leaving the den. Grizzly bears have long claws. This allows them to spear their food, like salmon, and dance. Grizzly bears have a very keen sense of smell. This allows them to make up for their poor eye sight. And dance.\nRauno\nLeopard\nThe spots, or rosettes are circular, which helps it to blend in with the background. The spotted coat provides almost perfect camouflage. The elegant, powerfully built leopard has a long body, relatively short legs and a broad head. Its tawny is covered with dark, irregular circles called rosettes.\nLisbeth\nSiberian Tiger\nFor an animal that hunts alone it is easier to hide and to get its prey. However, in times when food is hard to find, they may come together and cooperate. They live in a climate where the winter can get snowy and the cold is bitter. To start with, the Siberian tiger has an extra layer of fat on its body to insulate it from the cold. It also has a very thick coat and more fur on the foot pads. These physical adaptations help the tiger survive the harsh Siberian winters. Also, all these tigers are great hunters, capable of bringing down animals larger than their own selves. The hind limbs are longer than its forelimbs, which is an adaptation for longer jumps.\nLaura\nRound Island Day Gecko\nGeckos have special feet to help them climb up smooth surfaces. The flattened toes have elongated scales. A microscopic view would show thousands of tiny, hooked bristles that can hold on to any surface. This means they can easily climb up palm trees, as well as hide on the underside of leaves. They also have sharp teeth to penetrate the exo-skeleton of an insect. If attacked, Round Island Day Geckos have a unique way of defending themselves. The tail just drops off and lies moving around on the ground. Hopefully the enemy will pay attention to the tail while the gecko escapes. The stump quickly heals, and they will eventually grow a new tail.\nEgle\nGrey Wolfe\nIt is capable to run for 20 minutes, to stock it's prey at the speed of 56-64 km per hour. Strong and long jaws. Huge paws. It can reduce the flow of blood near their skin to conserve body heat. Large seized. The warmth of the footpads is regulated independently of the rest of the body, and is maintained at just above tissue-freezing point where the pads came in contact with ice and snow. They can easily follow fresh tracks.\nRagne\nCheetah\nAdaptations that enable the cheetah to run as fast as it does include large nostrils that allow for increased oxygen intake, and an enlarged heart and lungs that work together to circulate oxygen efficiently. During a typical chase, its respiratory rate increases from 60 to 150 breaths per minute While running, in addition to having good traction due to its semiretractable claws, the cheetah uses its tail as a rudder-like means of steering to allow it to make sharp turns, necessary to outflank prey animals that often make such turns to escape.\nMark\nParrotfish\nA number of parrotfish species, including the queen parrotfish, excrete a mucus cocoon, particularly at night. Prior to going to sleep, some species extrude mucus from their mouths, forming a protective cocoon that envelops and secures the fish at a particular location and, presumably hides its scent from predators.This mucus envelope may also act as an early warning system, allowing the parrotfish to flee when it detects predators such as moray eels disturbing the protective membrane.Also the colour helps to protect, when they arre located near to rockwalls. In most parrotfish species, juveniles have a different color pattern than adults. Juveniles of some tropical species can alter their color temporarily to mimic other species.\nMari-Ann\nThorny Devil\nIt inhabits arid scrub and desert over most of central Australia. In particular, it inhabits spinifex (triodia) sandplain and sandridge desert within the interior and mallee belt. Its distribution largely coincides more with the distribution of sandy and sandy loam soils than with a particular climate in western Australia. The food that the devil mainly eats is ants, often Iridomyrmex or Ochetellus. They collect moisture in the dry desert via night-time condensation of dew which forms on the skin and is channelled to the mouth in hygroscopic grooves between its spines. During rain events, capillary action allows the lizard to suck in water from all over its body.\nLiisbet\nPolar Bear\n. a white appearance, as camouflage from prey on the snow and ice\n. thick layers of fat and fur, for insulation against the cold\n. a small surface area to volume ratio, to minimise heat loss\n. a greasy coat, which sheds water after swimming\n. a very wide large paws- they help walk in the snow\n. nostrils which it can close- when it swims under the water\n. Babies remain with their mother until the third spring of their lives.\n. Males fight over the females so only the best reproduce\n. they will act in defense if another polar bear or organism comes too close to it's offspring OR its territory by snarling, chasing, standing on its hind legs and looking 'big', they will also 'wrestle' another polar bear by pushing them away\nKristel\nHummingbird\nMost hummingbirds have bills that are long and straight so that they can get nectar from flowers. Hummingbirds drink by using protrusible grooved or trough-like tongues. While in flight have the highest metabolism of all animals, a necessity in order to support the rapid beating of their wings. Long bills. When they don't fly anymore their body temperature drops and they fall into hypopraxia.\nKatariina"}

Its colors, appearance, vocalizations, and social behavior have sometimes drawn comparisons to the equally elaborate toucans of the Americas. But many facts about its anatomy and behavior still remain poorly understood, and we are running out of time to learn about these unique birds, because habitat loss and overhunting have driven many species to the brink of extinction.\n4 Incredible Hornbill Facts!\nThe hornbill is an arboreal bird that nests in the cavities of large trees . The only exceptions are two species of African ground hornbills: the Abyssinian ground hornbill and the Southern ground hornbill. These species spend most of their time roaming the savanna to consume mice, frogs, snakes, and other meat. When alarmed, they seek respite in ground holes or take to the air.\n.

Hornbill birds have a very unique kidney structure with two lobes . It is suggested that this might help the bird process water in a highly efficient manner. Scientists have observed that they obtain nearly all of their water from the heavily fruit-based diet.\n. It is suggested that this might help the bird process water in a highly efficient manner. Scientists have observed that they obtain nearly all of their water from the heavily fruit-based diet. Hornbill birds consume between 20% and 33% of their body weight in fruit and meat every single day.\nevery single day. The rhinoceros hornbill is the national bird of Malaysia.\nHornbill Scientific Name\nThe hornbill is a family of birds that goes by the scientific names of Bucerotidae. This is a combination of two Greek words: bous (meaning head of cattle) and keras (meaning horn). If you put the two words together, then you get buceros, which means horns like the cattle. This is a reference to the large horn that adorns the head of many species.\nThis bird\u2019s classification is still a matter of debate. Some taxonomists classify the ground hornbill in its own separate family of Bucorvidae or within the same family as the arboreal hornbills. Another point of dispute is the order to which it belongs. Some taxonomists put hornbills and the closely related hoopoes in the order of Coraciiformes with the kingfishers and bee-eaters. Other taxonomists place them in a separate order called Bucerotiformes. Either way, the facts remain that nearly 60 species are currently recognized. Some of the most well-known include the great, the rhinoceros, the Indian grey, and the African red-billed hornbills.\nHornbill Appearance\nThe hornbill bird has a very unusual appearance that sets it apart from anything else. This includes a large head in proportion to body size with broad wings, prominent eyelashes, and a long tail. The plumage is a brown, grey, or black color mixed in with white markings. This is often combined with a brightly colored arrangement of red, orange, blue, or yellow around the neck or head. Some species will actually enhance the colors of their bills by rubbing them against the preen gland beneath their tails. This has the effect of \u201cdying\u201d the bill a rather bright red or orange color.\nBy far the most prominent characteristic is the presence in some species of a large helmet or horn on top of the bill known as a casque. This structure is composed of keratin, the same substance as nails, hair, and horns. Part of the hornbill\u2019s unusual body shape is due to the fact that two of the neck vertebrae are fused together to support the enormous weight of the head, bill, and casque.\nThe hornbill ranges in size between 19 inches and 63 inches. The southern ground hornbill is the largest species in the family with some individuals reaching up to 13.6 pounds. The lightest is the redbilled dwarf hornbill. The female of this species weighs a mere 3 to 4 ounces. The helmeted hornbill of Borneo takes the crown for the heaviest casque in relation to body size. It makes up a full 10% of the bird\u2019s total weight. In most species, the female has a much smaller casque and body size compared to the male.\nSunti/Shutterstock.com\nHornbill Behavior\nThe hornbill is a very noisy bird that announces its presence with a diverse range of calls, including bellows, cackles, and brays. It is believed that the casque is a hollow chamber that serves the purpose of amplifying the sound of the voice. The deep, booming sound this creates is sometimes mistaken for the voice of a lion. Their wings also make a loud chuffing noise while in flight.\nBecause the male tends to have a larger casque, it is believed that the horn may serve a secondary role as an important sexual signal in the breeding season. The size and brightness of the casque is a mark of health and vitality to other hornbills. In some species, males fight by \u201cjousting\u201d with their bills in the air.\nThe hornbill is a social animal that gathers in large flocks for protection, mating, foraging, and hunting opportunities. These flocks sometimes consist of more than 100 individuals. Hornbills rise with the sun and begin the day by preening or calling to their neighbors. Then they leave the nest to forage for food in pairs or small groups. Self-care is an important aspect of its behavior. Several species have a specialized preening gland that produces an oily secretion to assist with cleaning. The hornbill will also run its bill against a branch or bark to clean it.\nSome hornbills have a reciprocal relationship with other species. The eastern yellow-billed hornbill will work with the dwarf mongoose to gather food. It will keep a lookout for potential predators while the mongoose stirs up insects for the bird to consume.\nHornbill Habitat\nThe hornbill is a tropical bird that resides in much of the sub-Saharan Africa, India, the Philippines, and the Solomon Islands. The preferred habitat of the arboreal hornbills includes rainforests and woodlands, while the ground-based hornbills largely reside in the open savannas.\nHornbill Population\nAccording to the IUCN Red List, population numbers appear to be in sharp decline across the entire family. This ranges between the critically endangered Rufous-headed hornbill, which has no more than 2,500 mature individuals remaining in the wild, and the vulnerable great hornbill, which has 13,000 to 27,000 mature individuals left. On the more positive side of the spectrum, the red-billed hornbill of Africa and the Indian grey hornbill are both species of least concern.\nIn order to rehabilitate numbers, governments and conservation organizations will need to work together to protect existing habitats and curtail illegal hunting. Some organizations are also rearing hornbills in captivity to bolster numbers.\nHornbill Diet\nThe hornbill is an omnivorous bird that feasts almost exclusively on fruit, insects, or other small animals. The bill has the ability to pluck fruit from the trees, and the end of the bill has sharp notches for tearing apart food. Their bodies are also very efficient at extracting limited proteins from fruit.\nHornbill Predators and Threats\nThe hornbill is constantly on the lookout from surprise attacks by birds of prey (in particular, the eagle and owl). It is usually well-protected in the middle layers of the canopy from climbing predators below and aerial predators above. However, habitat loss from logging and agriculture is a serious threat to the hornbill\u2019s survival, because most species depend on the trees for all of their needs. Humans have traditionally hunted the hornbill for meat and medicine, but more recently, the intensity of hunting has increased because the casques are incredibly valuable on the international market.\nHornbill Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nThis is a monogamous species of bird that pairs up with a single mate for most of their remaining lives. Because of the intense nature of their relationship, the pair\u2019s courtship is no simple or expendable fling. It involves a complicated set of ritualistic behaviors such as bill contact, vocalizations, and playful chasing. The male also brings food to his mate throughout the year as a demonstration of his commitment to the relationship. The number of offspring they produce together depends on the size of the bird. Smaller species can produce up to seven eggs at a time, while larger species produce only one or two.\nThe female lays the eggs several days apart, creating a staggered pattern to their hatching. She is quite vulnerable during this time because her molting renders her unable to fly. However, the male has the amazing ability to protect the mother and the chicks by covering the cavity in walls of mud. It will then pass food to the female through a small hole in the wall while she is incubating the eggs. The only type that does not engage in this behavior is the ground hornbills, which nest in unsealed holes, logs, or rock faces on the ground.\nThe mother will incubate the eggs for 23 to 96 days. When the eggs finally hatch, she will emerge from the mud-covered hole and leave her offspring behind. These tiny chicks (which weigh no more than a few ounces even in the largest species) will compete with each other for limited food resources. The oldest sibling has the best chance of surviving, while the other siblings are sometimes left to starve. While this may seem like a cruel strategy, it does ensure there are backup chicks in case the oldest one dies.\nIt can take up to six years before the hornbill reaches full sexual maturity (smaller species reach sexual maturity much faster). The life expectancy of the hornbill is up to 40 years in the wild, but it can survive even longer in captivity.\nHornbills in the Zoo\nThis species is one of the most popular tropical bird exhibits in the United States. The San Diego Zoo has a long history with the hornbill that stretches all the way back to 1951. Between the zoo and the safari park, it now claims to house almost 30 species and has hatched more than 520 chicks.\nIf you don\u2019t live in the San Diego area, then there are still plenty of opportunities to see this magnificent bird in person. The Saint Louis Zoo, San Francisco Zoo, and the Denver Zoo are home to the aptly named great hornbill of Southeast Asia. The Indianapolis Zoo contains both an eastern yellow-billed hornbill and a southern ground hornbill, while Zoo Atlanta also has a southern ground hornbill. The Nashville Zoo, Minnesota Zoo, and Zoo New England are all participants of the Rhinoceros Hornbill Species Survival Plan, which is committed to the survival and rehabilitation of the species. Finally, the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo has an Abyssinian ground hornbill, and Zoo Tampa has various hornbill species in its aviary.\nView all 71 animals that start with H"}

Grasslands are vast areas of semi-arid deep rooted grasses with little or no trees. They have rolling hills and wild flowers and the soil is very fertile with rich nutrients and minerals. Rainfall is moderate.\nHeaths and Pasture are, respectively, low shrublands and grasslands where forest growth is hindered by human activity, not climate. There are two types of grassland:\nTropical Grassland\nTemperate Grassland\nGrasslands around the world fall into three categories:\nPrairies\nPrairies \u2013 prairies are generally covered with tall grasses and have a humid climate. Soil is rich in nutrients and is ideal for plant growth. Prairies contain very few trees, the ones that can be found are situated on hill slopes and by streams. Grazing animals such as the Bison and Oxen can be found on grasslands.\nOther animals found on prairie grasslands are ground nesting birds, insects and a few species of reptile.\nSavannas\nSavannas \u2013 savanna biomes have a warmer, drier climate. Plant life is adapted to the hotter climate, some having trunks that store water for many days or special built-in mechanisms allowing the plant to lie dormant during periods of drought.\nAnother variation of this type of grassland is the tropical savanna found in Africa where mammals such as Gazelles, Wildebeests and African Wild Dogs make their home.\nSteppe\nSteppe \u2013 steppe grassland is usually found in areas of the world which are less prone to moisture. Steppe are characterized by a continental and dry climate. Peaks can be recorded in the summer of up to 40 \u00b0Centigrade and in winter -40 \u00b0Centigrade. Besides this huge difference between summer and winter, the differences between day and night are also very great.\nHumans have exploited many of the animals of the savanna biome, either for sport, fur, or illegal poaching. Rhinos and elephants are now endangered species due to the illegal trading of their horns and tusks. Frequent fires have also contributed to the diminishing savannah biome and though most occur because of the dry heat, they are more frequent in areas populated by humans.\nIn the highlands of Mongolia, 30 \u00b0Centigrade can be reached during the day and sub-zero temperatures at night. The grass is generally shorter than that found on prairie grasslands. Animal life on the steppe is comprised of grazing mammals such as the antelope and various types of burrowing mammals such as ground squirrels and ferrets.\nBelow are just some of the animals that inhabit different grasslands around the world.

Facts About Mounting Giraffes", "url": "https://giraffefacts.org/can-you-ride-a-giraffe.html", "text": "There is a good reason why you do not see many pictures of people riding giraffes. A giraffe is a huge animal with a very steeply sloping back that is simply not made for riding.\nIt is also not an animal that has traditionally been partnered with people, and feeding a giraffe is an extremely costly proposition. For this reason giraffe riding is not something that has been developed in the past, and it is not something you will commonly see.\nCircus Performers\nBe that as it may, if you have been wondering \u201cCan you ride a giraffe?\u201d you will be happy to learn that there is a young man in South Africa who has given it a try. He says he is following in the footsteps of his great uncle who was a giraffe-riding circus performer with Chipperfield\u2019s Circus during the 1950s.\nRaised by Hand\nShandor Larenty was 17 years old in 2012 when he began working with a baby giraffe named Mara on his family\u2019s South African farm. He says that Mara was abandoned by her mother, so he has had to raise her by hand.\nWhen Mara was three months old and over six feet high at the shoulder, Shandor began working with her to train her for riding. He believes that knowing how to be ridden will be good for the giraffe because it will be good exercise for her. He believes that he will enjoy giraffe riding, as well.\nGentle Care and Handling\nShandor has another pet giraffe named Purdy who is an adult and stands 18 feet high. He is also very bonded with Purdy. Shandor hand raised Purdy as well. He says that he realizes he will probably not be able to do as much with Mara when she grows to her full size; however, he thinks that continued handling will help them create a strong bond.\nRiding a Giraffe\nWhile this story proves it is true that you can ride a giraffe, it is not very common and few people will ever have the chance to experience it. It takes years of commitment and care in order to convince a giraffe to let you ride it."}

{"animal": "giraffe", "title": "How a Dwarf Giraffe Discovery Surprised Scientists - The New York Times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/science/dwarf-giraffes.html", "text": "More than half of wild giraffes die before reaching adulthood, so the fact that both Gimli and Nigel beat the odds suggests their dwarfism hasn\u2019t hindered their ability to survive. However, their height, or lack thereof, almost certainly makes many aspects of their lives difficult.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to imagine how this might make them more susceptible to predation since they lack the ability to effectively run and kick, which are two of the giraffe\u2019s most effective anti-predator tactics,\u201d Dr. Brown said. \u201cAdditionally, given the mechanics of giraffe mating, I\u2019d speculate that for both of these giraffes, mating would be physically challenging.\u201d\nEven though female giraffes tend to be shorter than males, it would be nearly impossible for an 8 or 9-foot male to mount even the shortest female \u201cunless they get a stepping stool,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Connor said.\nThe cause of this dwarfism remains a mystery. Although random mutations can give rise to the condition, dwarfism in captive animals has been associated with inbreeding and a lack of genetic diversity. Whether these factors influenced Gimli\u2019s and Nigel\u2019s dwarfism remains unclear.\nThe giraffe population that includes Gimli experienced a significant decline during the late 1980s that at one point diminished the total to just 78 animals. It now consists of more than 1,500 individuals. More research is needed to determine if a lack of genetic diversity caused Gimli\u2019s condition.\nAlthough scientists know very little about giraffes compared with other iconic animals, they do know that the towering mammals are in trouble. Habitat loss and poaching have reduced their numbers by an estimated 40 percent in the last 30 years, and some subspecies, including the Nubian giraffe, are now critically endangered. To combat this decline, Dr. Brown and other scientists have been surveying and monitoring as many wild giraffe populations as they can."}

They often stand on their rear legs and gaze alertly over the southern African plains where they live. Mothers can even nurse their young while standing.\nCooperative Behavior\nMeerkats (also called suricates) work together in numbers. A few will typically serve as lookouts, watching the skies for birds of prey, such as hawks and eagles, that can snatch them from the ground. A sharp, shrill call is the signal for all to take cover. While a few individuals guard the group, the rest busy themselves foraging for the foods that make up their varied diet. Meerkats will eat insects, lizards, birds, and fruit. When hunting small game, they work together and communicate with purring sounds. Meerkats are good hunters and are sometimes tamed for use as rodent-catchers.\nBurrow Life\nMeerkat groups utilize several different burrows and move from one to another. Each burrow is an extensive tunnel-and-room system that remains cool even under the broiling African sun. Females give birth to two to four young each year in one of the group's burrows. Fathers and siblings help to raise meerkat young, teaching them to play and forage and alerting them to the ever present danger from above. Young meerkats are so fearful of predatory birds that even airplanes will send them diving for cover.\n0:55"}

You can find them in savannas, grasslands, and open forests.\nSince giraffes are native to Africa, a very hot and dry place, they can definitely take the heat!\nWhat do they eat and drink?\nGiraffes like to roam and browse for their food, with Acacia leaves and shoots making up the bulk of their diet. They also enjoy leaves, herbs, and vines.\nDespite popular belief, most giraffes do not eat very much grass.\nGiraffes do, however, spend a lot of their time eating in general and can consume a whopping 100 lb of twigs and leaves a day.\nit has been estimated that during certain times of the year giraffes spend 75 percent of their time roaming for food and eating!\nGiraffes don\u2019t need much water despite being extremely large! Partly because they are able to use water from the plants they eat.\nThey only take the occasional drink (about once every few days), so they are often found far away from water sources.\nHow tall are giraffes?\nAs we mentioned, the giraffe is the tallest type of mammal in the entire world. Do you realize how many tall mammals there are?\nYet the giraffe outgrows them all! A male giraffe can grow up to 18 feet (5.5 meters), while a female giraffe can grow up to 14 feet (4.3 meters).\nThe legs of a giraffe average about six feet (1.8 meters) \u2013 that\u2019s actually taller than many humans!\nGiraffes also have the longest tail of any mammal. Their tails can be up to 8 feet (or 2.4 meters) long.\nEven though giraffes have very long necks their necks are too short to reach the ground because of their tall height.\nThis means when giraffes have to get a drink of water, they have to bend their front legs awkwardly to reach the ground. Imagine if you had to do that just to get a drink of water! Pretty crazy isn\u2019t it?\nGiraffes aren\u2019t only tall, they can weigh quite a lot, too! The average male giraffe weighs between 2,400 to 3,000 pounds, while the average female can weigh anywhere from 1,600 to 2,600 pounds!\nGiraffe is the 3rd heaviest animal in the world, after Elephants and Rhinos.\nThe spots on a giraffe are very distinctive, and look like human fingerprints. Interestingly enough, no two giraffes have the same set of spots.\nJust like two snowflakes or sets of fingerprints are not the same either! Now that\u2019s pretty cool, isn\u2019t it? Even the giraffes are telling us that being unique is awesome!\nGiraffe Neck\nThe Giraffe has a very long neck that can stretch over 7 feet long, which is nearly half it\u2019s overall height.\nThe long neck gives the Giraffe a slender appearance, even though the rest of its body is muscular and strong.\nGiraffes, like humans, have 7 vertebrae in the neck.\nGiraffe Tongue\nGiraffes have long tongues that can grow over 50 cm. They use these massive tongues to pull down leaves efficiently.\nTheir tongue is a peculiar bluish black and purple color. Many think that this dark pigmentation is to protect their tongue from the Sun while they munch leaves from the top of the trees.\nGiraffe Heart\nCompared to the human heart that weighs just 0.7 lb , the Giraffe\u2019s heart is truly massive and weighs as much as 25 lb.\nGiraffe\u2019s heart is the second heaviest of all land animals, just after the elephant.\nFor sheer size, it is the biggest, and no other land animal has such large heart size, not even the elephant.\nTheir heart pumps 60 liters of blood every single minute.\nGiraffe Hooves\nWith hooves (30 cm) the size of a dinner plate, they are able to maintain balance despite their great height.\nTheir massive legs, strong foot and big hooves make for a powerful kick. They can and have killed lions with a single kick, yes! just one kick!\nThose wide hooves also keeps them from sinking into loose sands.\nGiraffe Horns\nBoth male and female giraffes have two horns on their head.\nThese horns are called ossicones and many males giraffes have thicker, less hairy ossicones than female giraffes. This is due to the sparring they do with other male giraffes.\nGiraffe Calf\nFemale Giraffe\u2019s stand and give birth to baby giraffes. What this means is their babies get the 1.8 meter drop at birth \u2013 aahh!\nGiraffe calves are already big at birth. They weight 100 lb and are close to 2m tall right after birth.\nGiraffe calves live with their mother till they are 1.5-2 years old. They mature at 4 years and are considered fully grown at 6.\nGiraffe calves depend on their mother for protection, many don\u2019t live past 1 year, due to predation from lions.\nGiraffe Defenses\nAdult male Giraffes are large and imposing. A single lion or hyena is no match. It would take a full pride of lions to take one down, and even then many such attempts are unsuccessful.\nThe Giraffe uses its height and excellent eyesight to spot predators like lions and hyenas from far.\nGiraffe\u2019s mass and legs also work as defenses, they can stomp and kick predators to death. Adult giraffes are not easy lunch and most predators don\u2019t bother, unless there is a giraffe calf with the adult.\nAnimals like antelopes and zebras often graze near Giraffes to benefit from the giraffes ability to spot danger from a distance.\nHow long do Giraffes live\nIn the wild these gentle giants live for around 25 years, but in captivity few have lived over 40.\nAre Giraffes Friendly\nGiraffes are sensitive, gentle, social and friendly. They are not aggressive by nature, but do not usually like to be touched.\nThere are some zoos that allow people to feed adult giraffes.\nMore Fun Giraffe facts\nHere\u2019s a funny mental image \u2013 giraffes, despite being very tall and very heavy, can run pretty quickly for their size!\nThe average giraffe will surprise you by running as fast as 35 miles (56 kilometers) an hour over shorter distances, and 10 miles (16 kilometers) per hour over longer distances.\nYou can thank those long legs for that ability!\nMale giraffes can be called bulls, while female giraffes can be called cows.\nBelieve it or not, giraffes spend most of their lives standing up. Yes, you read that right! Giraffes can even sleep standing up. Don\u2019t try that one at home!\nActually, giraffes don\u2019t sleep that often anyway. Many giraffes only require 5 to 30 minutes of sleep in a 24 hour period, which of course is far less than the 7 or 8 hours we humans need.\nBelieve it or not, giraffes can stand up within an hour of being born! They\u2019re pretty far ahead of us humans aren\u2019t they?\nA giraffe\u2019s heart is typically 2 feet long and weighs around 25 pounds (11) kilogram, the biggest heart of any land animal.\nA giraffe\u2019s heart weighs the same as the average two year old!\nIt was initially thought that Giraffes don\u2019t make sounds, but now it is well accepted that they bellow and make flute like sounds, and that a lot of their sounds are beyond range of human hearing.\nEndangered Species\nCertain kinds of giraffes are now endangered \u2013 this means they are at danger of becoming extinct.\nThe West African giraffe and the Rothschild\u2019s giraffe are both endangered. As a whole, the population of giraffes has decreased over the years, making some animal conservationists very worried.\nIn 1999, there were an estimated greater than 140,000 giraffes in Africa, while today the estimate is less than 80,000 giraffes.\nAnimals"}

Some scientists estimate that one-third of all plant and animal species could be extinct by the year 2070.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff You are probably familiar with the threats to animals like polar bears and Bengal tigers, but the rate of extinction is rising so rapidly that there are many animals you might not realize are at risk.\n1 of 20 Zebras Brad / Flickr / CC BY-ND 2.0 An icon of the African plains and a necessity in any wildlife documentary, the zebra is actually in trouble. Specifically, it's the Grevy's zebra that is endangered. There are several species of zebras in Africa, including the plains zebra, the mountain zebra, and the grevy's zebra. Among them, the mountain zebra is considered vulnerable and the plains zebra is near threatened, but the grevy's zebra is in dire straits \u2014 fewer than 2,000 individuals are left in the wild.\n2 of 20 Peacocks George Edward Lodge / Wikimedia Commons / Public Domain We wouldn't think of peacocks as endangered, considering you can find them in any wildlife park, petting zoo, and even the occasional farm. But there are subspecies of this flamboyant bird that are in danger of disappearing, including the Bornean peacock-pheasant (pictured in the monograph above) and the Hainan peacock-pheasant from the island of Hainan, China. For both species, habitat loss is a major factor in their decline. Only about 600 to 1,700 Bornean peacock-pheasants and between 250 and 1,000 Hainan peacock-pheasants are left in the world.\n3 of 20 Giraffes Charlotte Bleijenberg / Getty Images Giraffes are practically part of the landscape of Africa, standing tree-like in the grasslands. Most giraffe species are not a huge concern to conservationists, yet the nominate subspecies of the Northern giraffe, the nubian giraffe, is critically endangered. It has experienced a 95% population decline over 30 years. The total population is estimated to be at 650, primarily in Ethiopia and South Sudan.\n4 of 20 Hummingbirds Jerry Oldenettel / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA 2.0 Though you may see a flock around that sugar-water feeder you set out, quite a few hummingbird species are actually listed as endangered by IUCN. Some of these species include the oaxaca hummingbird pictured above, with around 600 to 1,700 mature individuals remaining; the mangrove hummingbird, which was discovered in 2005 and lives along the Pacific coast of Costa Rica; and the chestnut-bellied hummingbird, a near-threatened species found in Colombia with an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 individuals left.\n5 of 20 Horses Aloxe / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA 3.0 It may come as a surprise that horses are endangered \u2014 specifically, the Przewalski's Horse. Closely related to but genetically unique from its domestic cousins, this wild horse is endangered. It was listed as extinct in the wild from the 1960s to 1996 when one surviving individual was found in the wild and other individuals were reintroduced. Currently, there are about 178 mature horses living in the wild with more individuals in captive breeding programs and zoos. A major threat to the species is a loss of genetic diversity and, as a result, disease.\n6 of 20 Howler Monkeys Ruestz / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA 3.0 Howler monkeys are so common to Central and South America that it's hard to think there is any risk for them. But with habitat loss and capture or predation by humans, there is indeed a problem for several species. The Yucatan black howler monkey is endangered and is expected to decline by up to 60% over the next 30 years. Meanwhile, the Maranhao red-handed howler monkey is also endangered, with approximately 250 to 2,500 mature individuals remaining in the wild.\n7 of 20 Fruit Bats 79Photography / Getty Images Some bat species are having trouble with white nose syndrome, including fruit bats. Turns out, a whole slew of species of fruit bat are endangered, including the golden-capped fruit bat (also known as the giant golden-crowned flying fox), with an estimated 10,000 individuals remaining; the Salim Ali's fruit bat, with possibly fewer than 400 left; and the Sao Tom\u00e9 collared fruit bat, which is rare and has an unknown population. Most of the decrease in fruit bat population is due to hunting, habitat loss, and disturbances to roost sites.\n8 of 20 Ground Squirrels Greg Schechter / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY 2.0 Rodents are usually a surprise for the Endangered Species List since they tend to be great at adapting and especially skilled at reproducing. But if they don't have a place to live, they're out of luck. Thanks to agricultural development, urbanization, and a whole lot of rodenticide, California's San Joaquin antelope ground squirrel (also known as the Nelson\u2019s antelope squirrel), with only 20% of its former range, has an unknown but decreasing population.\n9 of 20 Dolphins Alatom / Getty Images Even the most charismatic of animals isn't off the chopping block. The South Asian river dolphin has two subspecies based on the river systems in which they are found, the Ganges River dolphin and the Indus River dolphin. Though a strong effort has been made to research and conserve the species, there is still relatively little known about them. Of the Ganges River dolphins, there are about 3,500 left, while there are an estimated 1,200 to 1,800 Indus River Dolphins remaining.\n10 of 20 Galapagos Penguins Gareth Codd / Getty Images The Galapagos penguin is the smallest penguin in the world, and it is also the one that lives the farthest north. This aquatic bird is endangered, with a population of 1,200 and decreasing. The Galapagos penguin lives 20 years on average and mates for life. Contamination from oil spills, hunting, fishing, and non-native predators are all threats to it.\n11 of 20 Mice abrahambio / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA 4.0 Even mice are on the Endangered Species List. Quite a few have the dubious honor, including Nelson\u2019s spiny pocket mouse (pictured) and the salt-marsh harvest mouse. The Nelson\u2019s spiny pocket mouse is endangered due to loss of habitat in Mexico and Guatemala, where the mouse is also impacted by floods and landslides. Found in the salt marshes bordering San Francisco Bay, the salt-marsh harvest mouse is impacted by habitat loss as a result of residential and commercial development, dam and water management systems, and invasive plant species.\n12 of 20 Parakeets Mark Newman / Getty Images Several gorgeous species of this popular house pet are on the brink of extinction in no small part because of their popularity as house pets. Populations of the sun parakeet, estimated to be between 1,000 and 2,500 individuals, have declined due to trapping for the cage-bird trade as well the diminishing quality of their habitat. Though the total population is not known, the reasons for population decline are similar for the grey-cheeked parakeet of Ecuador and Peru.\n13 of 20 Crayfish Mike Powles / Getty Images Usually we think of crayfish as a common Southern food pulled from rivers. However, a surprising number of crayfish species are on the decline. Those on the Endangered Species list include the white-clawed crayfish (pictured above), the phantom cave crayfish, the slenderclaw crayfish, the giant freshwater crayfish, and the aptly named Sweet Home Alabama crayfish of Marshall county, Alabama. This native Alabama crayfish is threatened by pollution of the freshwater aquifer and its close proximity to roads and urban development.\n14 of 20 Deer outcast85 / Getty Images Many species of tiny musk deer are so diminutive they look like the prehistoric animals that were the first mammals to arrive on the planet. The species includes the Himalayan musk deer (pictured above), the black musk deer, the Kashmir musk deer, and the Chinese forest musk deer, among others. These deer are hunted primarily for their musk glands, which are used in traditional East Asian medicines and cosmetics.\n15 of 20 Water Buffalo Steve Garvie / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA 2.0 The water buffalo is a surprise for this list as we think of it as a domesticated animal, but like horses, it's the wild cousins of the domesticated beasts that are at risk. There are as few as 2,500 mature individuals left and researchers estimate the species has experienced a population decline of at least 50% over the last three generations. The major threats include interbreeding with feral and domestic buffalo as well as habitat loss, hunting, and disease from domestic livestock.\n16 of 20 Vultures J.M. Garg / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA 3.0 Vultures aren't usually considered the most attractive of birds, but the Egyptian vulture is a notable exception. The striking bird is found in Europe, Africa, and India, but rapid and severe declines in the Indian populations as well as a long-term decline in the European populations put the population at around 12,000 to 38,000 mature individuals. One of the threats to Egyptian vultures is the drug diclofenac, which is used as a painkiller for livestock. The vultures, who feed on animal carcasses, are killed from consuming animals that were treated with the drug. As a result, some countries have banned the use of diclofenac.\n17 of 20 Hippos Raimond Spekking / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA 4.0 Pygmy hippopotamus are the diminutive relatives of the Hippopotamus amphibius. The two do not share a habitat, however, as the pygmy hippo is only found in Liberia, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, and the Guinea regions of West Africa. While the pygmy hippopotamus population in the wild is unknown, the total number of mature individuals is estimated to be between 2,000 and 2,500. Deforestation is the greatest threat to the pygmy hippo, but this animal is also hunted for meat.\n18 of 20 Sea Lions Yummifruitbat / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA 2.5 Pinnipeds are geniuses in the marine world, but sadly their smarts can't keep them off the Endangered Species list. The Steller sea lion, the fourth largest pinniped behind walruses and two types of elephant seals, has a global population of around 81,300 animals. An improvement in population for the two subspecies considered together, the western Steller sea lion and the Loughlin\u2019s Steller sea lion, has improved the Steller sea lion's status from endangered to near threatened. The western Steller sea lion population has continued to decrease due to disease and killing by fishermen, while the Loughlin\u2019s Steller sea lion population is trending upward.\n19 of 20 Gazelle Sanjay Acharya / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA 3.0 As with zebras, no documentary about the African savanna is complete without a few gazelles being caught by lions or cheetahs. But feline predators are not the only threat to a number of gazelle species. The cuvier's gazelle of northwest Africa is considered vulnerable with an estimated population of 2,300 to 4,500 individuals, while the slender-horned gazelle of the Sahara has only around 300 to 600 mature individuals remaining. The speke's gazelle (pictured above) from the Horn of Africa is considered possibly extinct in Ethiopia, while remaining populations in Somalia, thought to be in the tens of thousands, face severe pressure from hunting and habitat loss."}
