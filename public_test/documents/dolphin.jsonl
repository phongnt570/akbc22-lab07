Least concern LC NT VU EN CR EW EX Least Concern Extinct Current Population Trend : Unknown\nDolphins are small-toothed cetaceans easily recognizable by their curved mouths, which give them a permanent \u201csmile.\u201d There are 36 dolphin species, found in every ocean. Most dolphins are marine and live in the ocean or brackish waters along coastlines. There are a few species, however, like the South Asian river dolphin and the Amazon river dolphin, or boto, that live in freshwater streams and rivers.\nThe largest dolphin, the orca, can grow to be over 30 feet long. The smallest, the Maui dolphin, is just five feet long.\nDolphins feed chiefly on fish and squid, which they track using echolocation, a built-in sonar that bounces sound waves off prey and reveals information like its location, size, and shape. An echolocating bottlenose dolphin can make up to a thousand clicking noises per second.\nBehavior and reproduction\nLiving in pods that can number a dozen or more, dolphins are intensely social mammals that communicate with squeaks, whistles, and clicks. Whether dolphins have language, as humans do, is a topic that scientists have debated for decades.\nAs mammals, they have warm blood and nurse their young. Dolphins have more than one mate, and generally produce a single offspring that will stay with the mother for up to six years, depending on the species.\nDolphins are graceful, sleek swimmers that can reach speeds of more than 18 miles an hour. They are also playful and often frolic in a boat\u2019s wake, leaping out of the water\u2014possibly for fun, to communicate, or even shed pesky parasites.\nThreats\nFor centuries, people have hunted dolphins for their meat and blubber. Today, their main threat comes from being caught accidentally in commercial fishing nets. Dolphins must rise regularly to the surface to breathe\u2014becoming entangled in nets prevents this, leading to drowning. For maine dolphins, warming ocean temperatures because of climate change have caused some of their primary food sources to move into deeper, cooler water. Furthermore, marine heatwaves, also caused by climate change, appear to have a negative affect on dolphins' reproductive rates and ability to survive.\nIn addition to hunting and entanglement in fishing gear, freshwater dolphins face the additional threat of dams fragmenting and degrading habitat."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Fascinating Dolphin Facts - Fact Animal F", "url": "https://factanimal.com/dolphins/", "text": "Dolphin Profile\nThe dolphin is a small to medium-sized marine mammal, which are found all over the world, generally in warmer waters. They usually inhabit shallow seas and continental shelves.\nThey are members of the order Cetacea, of which there are four families, the oceanic dolphins (Delphinidae), Indian river dolphins (Platanistidae), the new world river dolphins (Iniidae), and the brackish dolphins (Pontoporiidae). Between these four families, there are 40 distinct species.\nDolphin Facts Overview\nHabitat: All oceans, seas and many rivers. Location: Worldwide, although they avoid polar zones Lifespan: 30 \u2013 60 Years Size: 5 \u2013 31 ft (1.5 to 9.5 m) Weight: 110 \u2013 22,000 pounds (50 \u2013 9,980 kg) Color: Light Grey / White / Black Diet: Fish, squid. Some species like Killer Whales might eat seals & turtles & other marine mammals Predators: Sharks, Killer Whales (Orcas) Top Speed: 60 kph (37 mph) No. of Species:\n40 Conservation Status:\nSome endangered\nThe 40 different species can be found in a vast geographic region, which makes it very difficult to estimate the current population of dolphins. Around 35 of the species live in oceans, while five of the living dolphin species live in rivers.\nThe smallest, the Maui dolphin, grows to an average 5.6 feet (1.7 meters) in length, and weighs 90 \u2013 110 pounds (40 to 60 kg). The largest dolphin is the Killer Whale, which can grow up to 31.0 ft (9.5 m) in length, weighing 22,000 lb (9,980 kg).\nDolphins are meat eaters and have a steady diet of squid, fish and crustaceans. Although the coloration of the dolphin varies, they are most often grey, with their backs having a slightly darker shade than the rest of their bodies.\nAgile swimmers, dolphins are a favorite for wildlife watchers as their playful activities and aerobatics in the water are a delight to see. They are also highly intelligent and can learn to do different tasks just through observation.\nInteresting Dolphin Facts\n1. Dolphins are closely related to whales.\nThe dolphin is part of the group of mammals called Cetaceans. They are divided into two distinct groups \u2013 baleen whales and toothed whales. Baleen whales include the larger variety of filter feeding whales (the blue whale, humpback whale, and sei whale among others). Toothed whales include pilot whales, sperm, beluga and many others. Dolphins belong to the toothed whale group.\n2. Dolphins evolved from land mammals.\nThe Cetaceans adapted from land to water with streamlined body shape, blowholes, a layer of blubber to provide insulation and flippers.\n3. Dolphins communicate with clicks and whistles.\nThis helps them navigate, warn of potential predators and hunt for fish together.\n4. Dolphins give each other names.\nScientists have found evidence that dolphins call each other by \u2018name\u2019, with a unique whistle for each member of a pod.\n5. Dolphins and bats share the same superpower, \u2018echolocation\u2019.\nIn order to navigate and hunt, bats and dolphins use echolocation. What this means is that they send out high-pitched sounds and listen for them to echo as the sounds bounce off of objects. This allows bats and dolphins to move about freely knowing instantly where hazards exist and are capable to changing their path to avoid them.\n6. They can dive up to 1,000 feet.\nDolphins are excellent swimmers, and can dive as deep as 1,000 feet \u2013 usually in search of prey.\n7. Dolphins have been used by both US & Soviet militaries.\nDolphins (and sea lions) have been trained to help rescue lost naval swimmers, and to locate underwater mines.\n8. They are extremely social and playful mammals.\nPods can vary in size from as few as five all the way up to several hundred dolphins in a group. They will play and hunt together, as if they were part of a huge family.\n9. Dolphins look after each other.\nDolphins have been observed looking after the old, sick and injured in a pod.\n10. They are clever and somewhat devious at fishing for food.\nWhen dolphins hunt in groups, they will often trap a school of fish and will take turns slicing through the school to catch a meal. Dolphins will also follow other whales, sea birds and even fishing boats to feed on the marine life each scares up or discards.\n11. Dolphins can use just half of their brain when they want to.\nIn order to keep from drowning or safe from predators when sleeping, dolphins have the ability to shut off half of their brain, which goes to sleep. The other half stays active so that the mammal can continue to breathe and even swim.\n12. There is no clearly defined mating season.\nThe dolphin mating season runs throughout the year. However, there are peaks in spring and fall.\n13. The gestation period varies.\nDepending on the species, gestation can be as little as nine months and as long as 17 months.\n14. The female gives birth in an unusual manner.\nWhen it is time, the female dolphin will remove herself from the pod of dolphins and may go near the surface of the water to give birth. Typically, there is just one calf, and twins are rare.\n15. The mother and calf will spend years together.\nAs soon as a calf is born, it is taken to the surface of the water quickly in order to catch its first breath. Nursing will last between 11 months and two years and following that, the calf will remain with its mother for between another year or up to six more.\n16. The word dolphin actually identifies several marine mammals.\nThe word dolphin is actually an unspecific term. The toothed whale group that dolphins belong to include oceanic dolphins (Delphinidae), river dolphins (Iniidae) and Indian river dolphins (Platanitidae).\n17. There are many species in the group of true dolphins.\nOceanic dolphins are considered \u2018true\u2019 dolphins and that group alone contains about 32 different species of dolphins.\nIt is the largest subgroup of Cetaceans.\n18. They have excellent eyesight.\nDolphins have specially adapted lenses and corneas which allow them to see well both in and out of the water.\n19. They hear without ears.\nDolphins do not have actual ear holes or openings to hear with. Instead, they \u2018listen\u2019 with the small slits that are located behind their eyes. They hear frequencies 10 times the upper limit of adult human.\n20. Not every species of dolphin has a dorsal fin.\nThe fin located on the back of a dolphin is the dorsal fin. It provides directional control and stability when swimming. However, there are some species of dolphins that do not have this feature.\n21. Their pectoral flippers are not used for swimming.\nThe forelimbs on a dolphin are called pectoral flippers, and are not used for forward motion \u2013 they are short and rigid, providing the dolphin the ability to steer and control speed in the water.\n22. Dolphins probably can\u2019t smell much of anything.\nBased on their anatomy, dolphins are without olfactory lobes and nerves like all other toothed whales. As they do not have these anatomical features, scientists have concluded that dolphins very likely have little if any sense of smell.\n23. They have a mouth full of teeth, but never chew their food.\nThe elongated jaw bone of a dolphin contains as many as 130 conical teeth, but actually they swallow their food whole. Their teeth are used merely to catch their prey.\n21. Dolphins have two stomachs.\nIn a similar way to cows, the first one stores the food and the second is where digestion takes place\n23. Some Oceanic dolphins have a beak.\nThanks to an elongated jaw, some species of dolphins have a beak. It is actually called a rostrum and added to the aerodynamic body shape of those that have one.\n24. Dolphins are different to porpoises.\nThey may look similar, but dolphins are usually larger than porpoises, with longer beaks and curved dorsal fins.\n25. The oldest known dolphin lived to 61 years old.\nNellie, was the worlds oldest known dolphin, and was captive living at Florida\u2019s Marineland park.\n26. One species of dolphin is considered critically endangered.\nThe Baiji dolphin, which is a river dolphin found in the Yangtze River, has suffered a severe drop in population over the past few decades. The main cause happens to be pollution that has filled the river with contaminants. The river is heavily used by industry in the region. A scientific expedition in 2006 travelled the length of the Yangtze River to locate and identify the remaining Baiji dolphins. The expedition failed to locate even one and the species was declared \u201cfunctionally extinct\u201d as a result.\n27. Dolphins have been known to protect humans from shark attacks.\nThere are stories of dolphins assisting surfers that have been attacked by sharks. In one infamous encounter, they drove off the Great White Shark, and formed a ring of protection around the injured surfer until he managed to get back to shore and safety.\nDolphin Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphin facts and information - Whale & Dolphin Conservation USA", "url": "https://us.whales.org/whales-dolphins/facts-about-dolphins/", "text": "How many species of dolphins are there?\nCurrently there are 49 dolphin and porpoise species which are grouped into six families: the oceanic dolphin family is by far the largest with 38 members; the porpoise family has seven members; and there are four river dolphin families, each containing just one species. However, classification is not an exact science and as more information and discoveries come to light, deliberations will continue and some dolphin species are likely to be further split into more than one species and/or subspecies.\nNames and nick names can certainly be confusing; there are eight dolphin names that feature the word \u2018whale\u2019, including pilot whales, killer whales, false killer whales and melon-headed whales. Two species have whale and dolphin in their name; the northern right whale dolphin and the southern right whale dolphin \u2013 no wonder both the public and scientists get confused!\nWhere do dolphins live?\nDolphins live in the world\u2019s seas and oceans and in some rivers too. Some dolphin species prefer to live in coastal areas, others like shallow water but prefer to live away from the coast close to patches of shallower water which are located further out to sea.\nOrcas are the only dolphins which live in the Arctic and Antarctic. Their large size means that they have more protection against the harsh cold of the freezing seas. Most dolphins prefer tropical and temperate waters as they are warm-blooded mammals and so it is easier for them to regulate their body temperature in these environments.\nCan dolphins live in fresh water?\nRiver dolphins such as the Amazon River dolphin (boto) and South Asian river dolphins live their lives only in fresh water rivers and lakes, a long way from the ocean; they are sometimes known as the \u2018true river dolphins\u2019. There is another group of so-called river dolphins; these are fresh water populations of marine dolphin species some of whom permanently live in fresh water rivers, these include the tucuxi (or sotalia), the Guiana dolphin, Irrawaddy dolphin and the finless porpoise."}

There are dolphins in every ocean on Earth, and there are freshwater species of dolphins that inhabit rivers in South Asian and South American. The largest dolphin species (the orca) grows to more than 30 feet long while the smallest, Hector's dolphin, is just 4.5 feet in length. Dolphins are well known for their intellect, their gregarious nature, and their acrobatic abilities. But there are many lesser-known qualities that make a dolphin a dolphin.\nFast Facts: Dolphins Scientific Name : Odontoceti\n: Odontoceti Common Name : Dolphin (Note: This name refers to the group of 44 species classified as Odontoceti; each has its own scientific and common name.)\n: Dolphin (Note: This name refers to the group of 44 species classified as Odontoceti; each has its own scientific and common name.)

They have developed numerous adaptations that make them well suited for life in water including a streamlined body, flippers, blowholes and a layer of blubber for insulation. Dolphins have curved beaks which means they appear to have permanent smiles.\nDolphins evolved from land mammals whose legs were underneath their bodies. As a result, dolphins tails move up and down as they swim, whereas a fish\u2019s tail moves from side to side.\nDolphins, like all toothed whales, lack olfactory lobes and nerves. Because dolphins do not possess these anatomical features, they most likely have a poorly developed sense of smell.\nThe snout of some oceanic dolphins is long and slender due to their elongated, prominent jaw bones. Within the dolphins' elongated jaw bone sits numerous conical teeth (some species have as many as 130 teeth in each jaw). Species that have prominent beaks include, for example, Common Dolphin, Bottlenose Dolphin, Atlantic Humpbacked Dolphin, Tucuxi, Long-Snouted Spinner Dolphin, and numerous others.\nThe forelimbs of a dolphin are anatomically equivalent to the forelimbs of other mammals (for example, they are analogous to arms in humans). But the bones within the forelimbs of dolphins have been shortened and made more rigid by supporting connective tissue. Pectoral flippers enable dolphins to steer and modulate their speed.\nThe dorsal fin of a dolphin (located on the back of the dolphin) acts as a keel when the animal swims, giving the animal directional control and stability within the water. But not all dolphins have a dorsal fin. For example, the Northern Rightwhale Dolphins and the Southern Rightwhale Dolphins lack dorsal fins.\nDolphins do not have prominent external ear openings. Their ear openings are small slits (located behind their eyes) which do not connect to the middle ear. Instead, scientists suggest that sound is conducted to the inner and middle ear by fat-lobes located within the lower jaw and by various bones within the skull.\nTunatura/Getty Images\nHabitat and Distribution\nDolphins live in all of the world\u2019s seas and oceans; many inhabit coastal areas or areas with shallower water. While most dolphins prefer warmer tropical or temperate waters one species, the orca (sometimes called killer whale) lives in both the Arctic Ocean and the Antarctic Southern Ocean. Five dolphin species prefer fresh to salt water; these species inhabit rivers in South America and South Asia.\nDiet and Behavior\nDolphins are carnivorous predators. They use their strong teeth to hold their prey, but then either swallow their prey whole tear it into small pieces. They are relatively light eaters; the bottlenose dolphin, for example, eats about 5 percent of its weight each day.\nMany species of dolphins migrate to find food. They consume a wide range of animals including fish, squid, crustaceans, shrimp, and octopus. The very large Orca dolphin may also eat marine mammals such as seals or marine birds such as penguins.\nMany dolphin species work as a group to herd or coral fish. They may also follow fishing vessels to enjoy the \"waste\" thrown overboard. Some species will also use their flukes to beat and stun their prey.\nReproduction and Offspring\nMost dolphins become sexually mature at between 5 and 8 years old. Dolphins give birth to a single calf once every one to six years and then feed their babies milk through their nipples.\nDolphin pregnancies range in length from 11 to 17 months. Location can make an impact on the gestation period.\nWhen a pregnant female is ready to deliver, she separates herself from the rest of the pod to a location near the water's surface. Dolphin calves are usually born tail first; at birth, calves are about 35\u201340 inches long and weigh between 23 and 65 pounds. The mother immediately brings her infant to the surface so it can breathe.\nNewborn calves look a bit different from their parents; they typically have dark skin with lighter bands which fade over time. Their fins are quite soft but harden very quickly. They can swim almost immediately, but do require the protection of the pod; in fact, young dolphins are typically nursed for the first two to three years of life and may stay with their mothers for up to eight years.\nGeorgette Douwma/Getty Images\nSpecies\nDolphins are members of the order Cetacea, Suborder Odontoceti, Families Delphinidae, Iniidae, and Lipotidae. Within those families, there are 21 genera, 44 species, and several subspecies. The species of dolphins include:\nGenus: Delphinus\nDelphinus capensis (Long-beaked common dolphin)\nDelphinus delphis (Short-beaked common dolphin)\nDelphinus tropicalis.

In 2006, a scientific expedition set out to locate any remaining Baiji but failed to find a single individual in the Yangtze. The species was declared functionally extinct.\nDolphins and Humans\nHumans have long been fascinated with dolphins, but the relationship between humans and dolphins has been complex. Dolphins are the subject of stories, myths, and legends as well as great works of art. Because of their great intelligence, dolphins have been used for military exercises and therapeutic support. They are also often kept in captivity and trained to perform; in most cases, this practice is now considered to be cruel.\nSources"}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "11 Facts About Dolphins That Prove They Are Evil", "url": "https://unbelievable-facts.com/2015/08/dolphins-facts.html", "text": "If you were ever an over-imaginative, sensitive, sea-loving child, you probably had one of those awesome and adorable paintings of a child playing with a dolphin under a rainbow hung up in your room. And if you ever went to the seas, you probably even played with them. Oh! How adorable they are, with their cute whistles and love for playing! However, you only find them cute because you probably aren\u2019t aware of the low and dirty secrets a dolphin holds. Read on these eleven facts about dolphins to know more about them, and good luck liking dolphins after you read this article:\n1 Dolphins Rape The Females Of Their Species\nFlabbergasted, eh? Those cute little baby dolphins are probably the last thing you would imagine to grow up into giant, horny rapists. But the hard truth is, they do. Bottlenose dolphins are known to gang up on a female of their species, isolate her, then, violently mate with her for several weeks. Guess what? They have even got all the horrible rapist special effects. They make scary noises, movements, and inflict smacks upon her to keep her in line. They\u2019ll follow her if she tries to swim away! Poor little girl dolphin, doesn\u2019t she deserve a right to her body too?(source)\n2 Horny Dolphins Don\u2019t Mind Groping Humans\nIf that isn\u2019t enough to give you the nightmares, here is another besmirching fact about dolphins. When retired actress Demi Moore was visiting Las Vegas with her ex-husband, boyfriend, and children, she visited the Siegfried and Roy\u2019s Secret Garden and Dolphin Habitat. There, apparently, a male dolphin took a serious liking to her, and even made sexual advances!\n\u201cDolphins are very sexually aggressive and one went after Demi in a big way\u201d, said an onlooker. This isn\u2019t the only one. Take a look at this gross video of a scuba diver being sexually attacked by a dolphin:\n(source)\n3 Dolphins Have Really Prehensile Penises\nNot only are dolphins psychologically overtly sexual, even their biology is crafted in a way to assist them. Prehensility refers to the feature of a body part of being able to grab and hold. Some severely sexually aggressive creatures, therefore, have prehensile anuses that help grab on to the sexual organs of their partner and mate forcefully. Here is what Eric Lemonds says on Answers.com:\n\u201cA dolphin\u2019s penis, when erect, is shaped vaguely like a hook, so when males copulate with females, the chance of them being accidentally separated is eliminated. Think of the penis as a key, and the female\u2019s vagina is a lock. It\u2019s meant for securing, not necessarily grabbing.\u201d\nAlso, here is a really shocking video of a dolphin using a decapitated fish to masturbate. What is even gross is the idea that the reason humans find it so disgusting is because dolphins, not unlike humans, use sexuality for pleasure:\nhttps://youtu.be/TvLZxG6pB6U\n(source)\nAdvertisements\n4 Dolphins Kill Baby Porpoises Because They Resemble Their Own\nSo what? They like sexuality. But that\u2019s not all. Dolphins aren\u2019t just sexually aggressive creatures always looking to get laid, they are evil in a way you could have never expected. In Scotland\u2019s east coast and off the beaches of Virginia, baby porpoises wash up dead with horrifying internal injuries. Apparently, dolphins had been using echolocation and pulping techniques to internally damage and even kill baby porpoises as a sport!(source)\n5 Dolphins Murder their Own Children To Mate With Their Mother\nIt was later found that dolphins only kill baby porpoises because they have a tendency to look like baby dolphins. Meaning, the original intention of the dolphins weren\u2019t to play kill creatures of other species, it was to murder their own babies! The locations mentioned in the above point were also known for washed-up dead dolphin babies with similar internal injuries and dolphin tooth marks on their bodies. Want to know why male dolphins kill their babies? It\u2019s so that their female partners lose interest in the newborns and mate with their males instead!(source)\n6 Dolphins Can Go Without Sleep For Days\nIt\u2019s not like they \u201cnever\u201d sleep, but dolphins have an unusual ability to stay awake up to five days, and that\u2019s without the slightest loss of mental or physical strength. Wonder how they pull that off? The two halves of a dolphin\u2019s brain can sleep in \u201cshifts\u201d so that one part remains awake while the other is sleeping. This means a dolphin is always half-awake giving it the ability to last for days without the need for proper sleep.(source)"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphin Habitat and Distribution | Dolphins World", "url": "https://www.dolphins-world.com/dolphin-habitat-and-distribution/", "text": "Dolphins have a worldwide distribution, as they inhabit all the oceans and seas of the world except the Caspian Sea and the Aral Sea. Most species are concentrated in temperate and tropical areas although they dwell from the equator to the subpolar regions.\nObviously, the distribution and habitat are different for each dolphin species, but usually, they avoid extreme cold waters, so they are not found in the polar zones.\nDolphins are found living in bodies of water around the world. They inhabit all of the oceans and some important rivers. Most of them live in saltwater, but a few species thrive in freshwater.\nThe habitat of dolphins varies according to environmental factors and food accessibility. They are smart creatures with the intelligence to modify their habitat when needed for survival.\nPARTICULAR DISTRIBUTIONS\nFor example, the Bottlenose Dolphin dwells in all of the oceans, and they tend to live close to the coastline. Migration is a big part of life for some dolphins. They have to move where there is enough food; This is why some locations where there used to be dolphins either have very few or none anymore. Even changes in water temperatures can be reasons for them no longer to return to locations they once called home. Some successfully migrate hundreds of miles annually.\nOpen water species tolerate colder temperatures than coastal dolphins.\nThe Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans and their seas host a large number of dolphin species since they prefer tropical, subtropical and warm waters. However, talking about the particular distribution of dolphins means addressing the place where each species live as they differ from each other.\nAlso, some species are distributed over large areas while others may inhabit a small region. Other species are particularly endemic to a zone, and some may have different populations scattered over an extensive range. Each species is a different case.\nThe Pacific Ocean is habitat to several species, such as the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), perhaps the best-known dolphin, with a vast territory ranging from Japan to Australia and from the southern United States to Chile and Hawaii. In the Atlantic, the bottlenose dolphin dwells from North America to southern Argentina in the western part of this ocean and from Norway all the way down to the coasts of South Africa in the east. This species is also common in the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean.\nSome dolphins out there live in much smaller habitats. For example, the Yangtze River Dolphin only dwells in the river of the same name. Hector\u2019s Dolphins inhabit the coastal areas of New Zealand. They tend to be scattered there around the South Island.\nThe Short-beaked Common Dolphin (Delphinus Delphis) mainly inhabits the Mediterranean Sea and the northern part of the Atlantic Ocean. The Chinese white dolphin (Sousa chinensis) only dwells in the waters of the Indian and Pacific oceans.\nAdditionally, five river species exist that only inhabit the freshwaters of the Amazon, Ganges, Yangtze, Rio de la Plata and Indus rivers respectively.\nGENERAL AND SPECIFIC HABITATS\nThe habitats of dolphins are also very diverse. They can be found in ports, bays, gulfs and estuaries and frequently in the shallow waters of the continental shelves. Previously it was believed that dolphins could not dive more than 200 meters deep, but apparently, some species have the feasibility of diving about 300 meters deep, a conclusion reached by finding remains of benthic fish in the stomachs of some specimens.\nSome individuals prefer living in the open ocean while others fancy the conditions near the coasts. The Hector\u2019s dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori), for example, can live only in shallow waters near the coastline. In contrast, the Spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris) lives in the pelagic zone of high seas.\nOpen ocean dolphins seem to tolerate cold temperatures better than the coastal species. They rarely get close to the coasts. In contrast, coastal dolphins prefer warm and tropical waters, and their small body allows them to enter narrow and shallow places such as estuaries and river channels.\nOne thing is for sure: Dolphins visit areas with abundant prey within their habitats. Whether or not it is shallow water, most of these cetaceans prefer the pelagic area of \u200b\u200bthe sea where is easier finding and catching food. If the food supply decreases, dolphins tend to migrate to areas where there is no shortage, so their eating habits also change.\nSince most species do not tolerate frozen waters they can migrate in search of warmer places during the seasons when temperatures drop, and vice versa. Dolphins also consider the migration patterns of their usual prey and their breeding habits to move from one site to another and perform seasonal migrations.\nRiver Dolphins, for their part, inhabit the river basins of their distribution areas, along with the banks of the main channels and smaller channels. Some river dolphins venture to explore the forests when the rainy season floods them.\nIf you want to know the distribution and habitat of a particular species, do not hesitate to visit the Species section.\nReferences\nbioexpedition.com/dolphin-habitat-and-distribution/\nhttps://seaworld.org/en/animal-info/animal-infobooks/bottlenose-dolphins/habitat-and-distribution/\nhttp://www.scielo.cl/pdf/revbiolmar/v36n1/art11.pdf\nhttp://www.iucnredlist.org/search\nSam H.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "100 Greatest Animal Facts That Will Blow Your Mind - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/animal-facts/", "text": "Here\u2019s our big list of the 100 greatest animal facts. This includes some of the most asked, fun, surprising and crazy animal facts from across the animal kingdom. The loudest, deadliest, fastest, largest, most bizarre and random, are all here in our big animal fact list.\n1. The loudest animal in the world is a mere 2cm long, prawn. The Pistol Shrimp is capable of snapping its claw shut so rapidly, that it creates a bubble which collapses to produce a sonic blast, louder than a Concorde\u2019s sonic boom.\nThe shock wave can reach 230 decibels, also louder than the sound of a gunshot. The imploding bubble for split seconds also generates temperates of 4,400C, nearly as hot as the sun, killing its prey.\n2. Flamingos are not pink. They are born grey, their diet of brine shrimp and blue green algae contains a natural pink dye called canthaxanthin that makes their feathers pink.\nFlamingos in zoos often lost their colouring, until zoo keepers supplemented their diets.\n3. Otters \u201chold hands\u201d while sleeping, so they don\u2019t float away from each other.\nAnd it\u2019s super-cute. Look.\n4. Hummingbirds are the only known birds that can also fly backwards.\nThey often do this when retreating away from flowers.\n5. Dolphins use toxic pufferfish to \u2018get high\u2019.\nDolphins deliberately handle pufferfish causing them to release toxins as a defence mechanism. These toxins can be deadly in high doses, but also have a narcotic effect \u2013 and are a powerful hallucinogenic, which dolphins appear to enjoy.\n\ufeff\nA documentary witnessed them passing around pufferfish in a pod, before floating just underneath the water\u2019s surface, apparently \u2018mesmerised by their own reflections\u2019 afterwards.\n6. The Inland Taipan (also known as, the Western Taipan) is the most venomous snake in the world. A single bite contains enough venom to kill at least 100 fully grown men, and can kill within just 30 minutes, if left untreated.\nThey very rarely ever come in contact with humans, however. Every reliable identification of a snake bite victim from an Inland Taipan have been herpetologists, when handling or studying the snakes. They have all survived, due to successful treatment with antivenom.\n7. The worlds deadliest animal isn\u2019t a shark, bear or tiger, but something far smaller \u2013 the mosquito. According to the World Health Organization, 725,000 people are killed each year from mosquito-borne diseases, such as Malaria, dengue fever and yellow fever.\nThey outnumber every other animal in the world, apart from ants and termites. They can also be found in nearly every part of the world, which all add up in the risk they pose to humans.\n8. There are more than 1.4 billion insects for EACH HUMAN on the planet, according to recent estimates.\nAnts have colonised almost every landmass on Earth. Their population is estimated as 107\u2013108 billion alone, in comparison to approx. 7 billion humans on the planet.\n9. The shortest living animal in the world is the Mayfly. Its entire lifespan is just 24hrs.\nThe Mayfly reproduces and then dies, during that short 24hr period of life. Some species of Mayfly only live for 8-10 hours.\n10. The horned lizard is able to shoot blood from its own eyes, up to a distance of 3 feet away. The rather bizarre and disgusting act is a defensive mechanism to confuse predators.\nTheir blood contains a chemical that is noxious to predators, and this isn\u2019t its only trick \u2013 short-horned lizards are also capable of inflating their bodies up to twice their size to scare anything away.\n\ufeff\ufeff\n11. Roosters prevent themselves from going deaf due to their own loud crowing, by tilting their head backs when they crow, which covers their ear canal completely, serving as a built-in ear-plug.\nA study showed that their crowing averages over 100 decibels, which is roughly the same as running a chainsaw.\n12. Little is known about the elusive Giant squid, however the largest squid ever found measured over 50 feet and weighed nearly a tonne.\nTo put that in perspective, that\u2019s bigger than a bus.\n13. The pangolin is able to roll up into an armour-plated ball, so lions can\u2019t eat them.\nIf only this worked for poachers, who simply pick them up when they roll into a ball.\n\ufeff\n14. Koalas can sleep for up to 22 hours a day.\nKoala need more sleep than most animals, because their diet of eucalyptus leaves contain toxins, are very low in nutrition, and high in fibrous matter \u2013 so they take a large amount of energy to digest!\n15. Swifts spend most of their lives flying in the air, and can fly for almost an entire year, without ever landing.\nA study showed that over a 10-month period, a swift stopped for just 2 hours.\n16. Even after having its head cut off, a cockroach can still live for weeks .\nEven stranger, a cockroach\u2019s head can actually survive by itself for a few hours, too.\n17. A group of parrots is known as a pandemonium.\nAnd the collective noun for porcupines, is a prickle.\n18. Cows poo up to 15 times a day, which can be as much as 115 pounds of manure per day, or approximately 21 tons per year.\nThe large quantities are often put to good use, though \u2013 manure, to fertilizer, to fuel, or biogas to create electricity and heat for developing parts of the world.\n19. Panda\u2019s must eat 25 \u2013 90 pounds (12-38 kg) of bamboo every day to meet their energy needs.\nThis is because bamboo contains very little nutritional value, so they have to eat it in vast quantities to survive. Although the giant panda possess the digestive system of a carnivore, they have evolved to depend almost entirely on bamboo.\n20. A Blue Whales tongue can weigh as much as a car, or a small adult elephant.\nA Blue Whales tongue can weigh approx. 2.7 tonnes, or 6,000 \u2013 8,000 pounds (2,720 \u2013 3,630 kg).\n21. The longest living, verified animal is a Madagascar radiated tortoise, which died at an age of 188 years in May 1965.\nHowever, there might be even older. Adwaita, an Aldabra giant tortoise, died at an estimated age of 255 in March 2006 in Alipore Zoo, Kolkata, India. If verified, it will have been the oldest terrestrial animal in the world.\n22. The fastest land animal on the planet is a cheetah. It can reach speeds of up to 75 mph (120 kph).\nWhile the Peregrine Falcon is the fastest bird, with a diving speed of 242 mph (389 kph). The Black Marlin is the fastest sea animal, and can swim up to 80 mph (130 kph).\n23. Baby elephants suck their trunks for comfort.\nJust like babies and young children suck their thumbs, awwww.\nPhoto courtesy of Darkroomillusions.\n24. The Nile crocodiles jaws can apply 5,000 pounds of pressure per square inch \u2013 the strongest bite of any animal in the world.\nA human\u2019s jaw produces 100 pounds of pressure per square inch in comparison. A crocodiles bite is 10 times more powerful than that of a great white shark\n25. Axolotl are able to regenerate lost limbs and body organs.\nMexican walking fish can regrow the same limb up to 5 times, and even regenerate parts of its brain.\n26. The Giant Pacific Octopus has 3 hearts, 9 brains and blue blood.\nThey are also able to change their colour and texture to camouflage themselves in a blink of an eye.\n27. A flea can jump distances 200 times their body length.\nThey are able to jump 10 inches (25cm) vertically and up to 18 inches (45 cm) horizontally, making them one of the planets best jumpers relative to its size. It\u2019s equal to a human jumping as high as the Empire State Building in New York.\n28. The male seahorse goes through pregnancy and gives birth to babies. They are the only animal on earth where the male carries the baby rather than the female.\nThe male seahorse has a pouch on its stomach in which to carry babies\u2014as many as 2,000 at a time.\n29. Pufferfish can contain a tetrodoxin, a toxin that is up to 1,200 times more deadly than cyanide to humans. There is enough toxin in one pufferfish to kill 30 adult humans, and there is no known antidote.\nAmazingly despite this, some pufferfish meat is considered a delicacy in Japan. The meat called Fugu, is expensive and only prepared by licenced chefs with over 3 years of rigorous training who remove toxic parts of the meat for diners.\n30. The loudest animal relative to size is the Water Boatman, which measures at just 12mm long, but can produce 99 dB of sound by rubbing its genitalia across its abdomen.\nThis is the equivalent noise level of operating a circular saw, or a drill.\n31. The howler monkey is the loudest land animal. Its calls can be heard from 3 miles (5 km) away.\nAt its peak, the howler monkey can produce sounds that reach 140 decibels. That\u2019s as noisy as a jet engine, on take off!\n32. There is an average of 50,000 spiders per acre in green areas.\nThere\u2019s over 45,000 known spider species, with the venom of a few only known to be dangerous to humans.\n33. The aptly named colossal squids eyes are as large as a basketball.\nThis allows them to detect the faint light of a predator from over 400 feet (120 metres).\n34. White-tailed jackrabbits are the greatest land jumpers, having been recorded leaping an astonishing 21ft (6.4m) vertically.\nThat\u2019s higher than 3 average sized men all stood on top of each other. This large species of hare can also run up to 35mph (55kph) when escaping predators.\n35. Grey-headed Albatross can circle the globe in only 46 days.\nThe incredible round-the-world journey covers 14,000 miles over the 46 day period at a steady 13mph. They perform this feat by making various pit-stops along the way.\n36. Giraffes are the tallest land animal in the world, reaching heights of 19ft (5.8 m). The ostrich is the world\u2019s tallest bird. It can grow up to 9 feet (2.7m) tall.\nOver 2 metres (7ft) of a giraffes total size is its famously long neck, which helps it reach leaves in tall trees.\n37. An ostrich legs are so powerful that their kicks can kill a lion.\nOr a human! Each two-toed foot has a long, sharp claw \u2013 making them formidable weapons. Animals often end up running away from the large bird.\n38. The dementor wasp paralyses cockroaches with venom to its head, turning them into a zombie-like state. The toxins leave the cockroach unable to control its own movements, which incredibly makes it run into the wasps nest to meet its demise.\nThe venom is thought to cut brain activity that makes cockroaches sense fear and run away to safety. The dementor wasp will then lay eggs on the cockroach to act as an incubator for its young.\n39. More than half of all pigs in the world are kept by farmers in China.\nThere are over 440 million pigs in China. United States in comparison has a mere 73 million pigs.\n40. Polar bears have jet black skin under their white fur coats.\nIt helps them absorb heat to keep warm, while the white fur helps provides camouflage in the snowy and icy environment they live.\n41. Giant anteaters consume up to 35,000 ants and termites in a single day.\nThey use their long sticky tongues to slurp up hundreds of ants per minute. Interestingly, anteaters purposefully never destroy an ant nest, preferring to leave some ants alive to rebuild, so it can return and feed again in the future.\n42. The little known pangolin is the worlds most poached and trafficked animal.\nThis is due to the high demand of their scales and meat in Asian cultures. 70% of Chinese citizens believe pangolin products have medicinal value, when its been scientifically proven to be false.\n43. Great white sharks can detect a drop of blood in 25 gallons (100 litres) of water and can even sense tiny amounts of blood from 3 miles (5 km) away.\nThey use their acute sense of smell to detect blood using an organ called the \u2018olfactory bulb\u2019.\n44. The Naked Mole-Rat can live in an almost zero oxygen atmosphere.\nIncredibly, in a zero oxygen environment, the Naked Mole-Rat can still survive for up to 20-minutes without suffering any harm at all.\n45. The smell of a skunk is powerful enough for a human to smell it up to 3.5 miles (5.6 km) away.\nThe foul smelling spray from a skunk can also cause skin irritation and even temporary blindness.\n46. The most venonmous fish in the world is the 30cm Stonefish.\nStonefish have 13 sharp fin spines on their back, each with two venom glands. Their stings are extremely painful, can be lethal to humans, and mostly occur as a result of stepping on the creature.\n47. Only 5% of cheetah cubs survive to adulthood.\nA study in the 90\u2019s in the Serengeti found that 95% of cheetah cubs died before reaching adulthood. Many deaths were due to Lions, but also other predators and disease.\n48. A tigers rear legs are so powerful, that they have been found remaining to stand even after death.\nTigers have been witnessed to have been shot, bled out, and died \u2013 and remained standing throughout.\n49. A Rhinoceros\u2018s horns are made of \u2018keratin\u2019, the same type of protein that makes up hair and fingernails.\nSome species of Rhinos have two horns, while others just have a single horn.\n50. The Alpine Swift is able to stay airborne for over 6 months without touching down.\nIt holds the world record for the longest recorded uninterrupted flight by a bird, at over 200 days in the air as it hunted flying insects on its wintering range in the skies over West Africa.\n51. The Edible Dormouse (Glis glis) is able to hibernate the longest \u2013 up to 11-months of the year when food availability is low.\nTo be able to pull of this feat, they double or even triple their body weight before hibernation. During hibernation they are able to reduce their metabolic rate and the animal may stop breathing for periods of up to an hour at a time.\n52. Japanese Macaques play with snowballs for fun.\nThese snow monkeys have been observed rolling up snowballs, then pushing them down hills just for the heck of it. Others gather lumps of snow in a ball and carry them around, proudly sometimes to the envy of other monkeys who try to steal it.\n53. Sperm whales are the world\u2019s largest predator.\nThey can be up to 18m long and weigh up to 53 tonnes. These giant whales dive down to almost 3000m below the surface where they hunt giant squid. Giant squid can be the same size or bigger than sperm whales and will fight viciously with them. Adult whales can be seen with scars on their heads from the beaks of giant squid.\n54. The largest insect to ever live was a \u201cdragonfly\u201d with a wingspan of over 75cm (2 and a half feet) across.\nThey are called Meganeuropsis and were around 247 million years ago. They were proficient predators, with large mandibles that they used to capture fish, amphibians and insects.\n55. Koala\u2019s have fingerprints almost identical to human.\nIt is so hard to distinguish between the fingerprints of koalas and humans that even under a microscope it is hard to tell. There are even reported cases of a koala\u2019s fingerprints confusing forensics at crime scenes.\n56. Greenland sharks are the longest living vertebrates on earth, with one individual thought to be over 400 years old\nGreenland sharks are giant, reaching up to 5m in length, and live in the cold deep waters of the North Atlantic. They are rarely seen, and little is known about them.\n57. The blood \u2018Dracula ant\u2019 has the fastest recorded animal movement when it snaps its mandible.\nThis cannibalistic ant can go from zero to 200mph in 0.000015 seconds when it snaps its mandibles, that\u2019s roughly 5,000 times faster than humans blink. 5 This is the fastest recorded movement in the animal kingdom.\n58. The box jellyfish is considered the most venomous marine species in the world.\nThese cube shaped jellyfish have long tentacles and can be over 3m in length. Their toxin, delivered via stinging cells in their tentacles, is so potent that many die before they can even reach the shore.\n59. The Japanese Spider Crab has the longest leg span of any arthropod.\nFrom the tip of one claw to the other can be as long as almost 4m! Japanese spider crabs have 10 legs stretching out from a central body, giving it its spider like appearance. They live deep in the oceans south of Japan.\n60. Some albatrosses are lesbians.\nAlbatrosses form bonds for life, returning to the same place every year to raise their young. Some of these bonds are between two female albatrosses, with a study finding that in one breeding area 31% of pairs were two females.\n61. Some corvids (crows, rooks, ravens etc,) can understand physics.\nCorvids are highly intelligent. They can use tools, solve puzzles, recognise faces, and even understand physics. Tests show that rooks have the same level of understanding of physics as a 6-month-old baby, which is higher than some apes.\n62. Sheep can recognise faces.\nAs social animals, sheep are capable of recognising familiar and unfamiliar faces. Studies even suggest that they miss other sheep when they are taken away for a long time afterwards.\n63. Tardigrades can survive in space and go without eating for more than 10 years.\nTardigrades are microscopic animals with crazy endurance abilities. They can survive in temperatures as high as 149oC or as low as -272oC and pressures 6 times more intense than the bottom of the ocean. They also look like tiny bears!\n64. Hoatzin\u2019s are the only bird species with a ruminant digestive system, and they smell like cow-dung.\nA ruminant digestive system is one that uses fermentation to digest food, cows being a well- known example of this. It\u2019s this digestive system that gives it it\u2019s lovely cow-dung smell. These birds are found in the amazon and have a dinosaur like appearance to them.\n65. Echidna\u2019s are relatives of duck-billed platypuses and have a beak, spikes, a kangaroo-like pouch, and lays eggs.\nThey are small at just 30\u201345cm and are known as spiny anteaters. One of the few egg-laying mammals, echidna lay a tiny egg which is then transferred into a kangaroo-like pouch where it then hatches.\n66. The desperate leaf chameleon is less than 3cm long.\nOne of the tiniest reptiles in the world, this tiny chameleon is native only to Madagascar. It can change colour to match its environment and lays huge eggs compared to its body size. They are named \u201cdesperate\u201d due to their status as critically endangered.\n67. The Yangtze giant softshell turtle is the biggest freshwater turtle in the world.\nIt weighs between 150 to 220 kilograms (330 to 485 pounds) and is over 100cm (39in) in length. They are found primarily in the area of the Yangtze River in China.\n68. The Mariana snailfish is the deepest fish in the ocean, living up to around 8,000m below the surface.\nThey live down in the deepest trenches of the ocean where they hunt invertebrates, such as crustaceans and shrimp.\n69. Pea Crabs are miniature crabs that spend their whole lives inside oysters, clams, and mussels.\nNames so because it is the size of a pea, this tiny crab relies entirely on its host for food.\n70. The shoebill stork can swallow baby crocodiles whole.\nThese huge birds are over a meter tall (up to 5 feet) and have a wingspan of more than 2 m (almost 8 feet!). Its name comes from its huge beak which is over 20cm long and almost that wide. Along with lungfish, it also eats baby turtles and baby crocodiles whole.\n71. Lungfish are the only fish that have both lungs and gills.\nThis allows them to survive when the water in their ponds/lakes dries up.\n72. Electric eels are in fact not eels, and give a shock strong enough to knock out a horse.\nIn the Tennessee Aquarium an electric eel\u2019s tank has been hooked up to a computer programmed to send out a tweet whenever the eel produces enough electricity.\n73. The yellowhead jawfish incubates its eggs in its mouth.\nThe male gathers up all of the eggs once they\u2019ve been fertilised and stores them in his mouth until they hatch.\n74. The patu digua is thought to be this smallest spider in the world at just 0.37 mm.\nThis Colombian spider is about one fifth the size of the head of a pin.\n75. Vampire bats share blood with their friends.\nVampire bats need to eat blood at least every 48 hours to survive. Bats will share blood after a good meal with another bat that\u2019s fed them in the past.\n76. The U.S. military trained bottlenose dolphins.\nBottlenose dolphins were used in both the Vietnam and the Gulf to detect enemy swimmers trying to plant explosives on ships.\n77. Wojtek the bear was a corporal in the polish military during WWII.\nWojtek was brought by polish shoulders while in Iran. He was made an officer so that he was allowed rations and eventually was promoted to corporal. He helped out by carrying boxes of ammunition.\n78. Horned lizards shoot blood out of their eyes.\nTo scare of predators, this lizard shoots blood out of its eyes.\n79. Cuckoo birds hide their eggs in the nests of other species.\nThe other bird species then raises the cuckoo chick as if it were its own, and the cuckoo mother doesn\u2019t have to do any of the work.\n80. Elephants mourn their dead.\nElephants will return to the place where family members died and stand in silence over the bones, sometimes bowing their heads.\n81. Meerkat parents train their offspring to hunt scorpions.\nThey will bring back dead or almost dead scorpions back to the younger ones so that they can practice killing them without getting stung.\n82. Only 3-5% of mammals are monogamous.\nThe majority of mammals are not monogamous, making humans unusual.\n83. Gorilla\u2019s have been seen dismantling traps set by poachers.\nPoaching is a big problem for gorillas, but young gorillas have learnt how to trap and dismantle snares.\n84. The earliest found depictions of dogs come from 8,000 years ago.\nDogs have been human-kinds best friend for a long time, with a carving in a rock face in Saudi Arabia showing a man hunting with 13 dogs. Two of them even have leads!\n85. Cat\u2019s were domesticated 9,500 years ago in Ancient Egypt.\nThey were worshiped in Ancient Egypt and some historians report that it was illegal to kill a cat.\n86. Emperor penguins are the world\u2019s biggest penguins, and they trek 50\u2013120 km (31\u201375 m) across the Antarctic to reach breeding colonies.\nThese impressive penguins reach 100 cm (39 in) in length and weigh 22 to 45 kg (49 to 99 lb). They breed during winter, when they emerge from their more natural habitat in the ocean to trek long distances over treacherous ice.\n87. Yaks are specially adapted to high altitudes, with a huge lung capacity and small red blood cells.\nNative originally to Tibet, these giant oxen-like animals live at high altitudes in the Himalayas (4,000\u20136,000 metres). They are specifically adapted to the low oxygen levels with a lung capacity that is ~3 times that of normal cattle, and have smaller red blood cells to improve oxygen transport.\n88. Cuvier\u2019s Beaked whales are one of the deepest diving mammals and can collapse their lungs to survive the high pressure.\nOne of the deepest diving mammals, one individual was recorded diving down to 2,992 m (9,816ft) below the surface. The pressure at these depths is so high that in order to survive it they have to collapse their lungs.\n89. Orangutans are the heaviest tree-dwelling animals.\nThere are three species of orangutan and adult males of all three typically weigh around 75kg (165lb) while females are ~37 kg (82 lb). They are ~1.5m(5ft) tall and have a huge arm span of ~2m (6ft). They spend most of their time up in the canopy, making them the heaviest tree-dwelling animal.\n90. Chimpanzees are very intelligent and make all kinds of tools.\nFor example, some use long sticks to fish out termites from their mounds. Others have been recorded creating \u201cspears\u201d to hunt bushbabies!\n91. Shrike\u2019s impale their prey on sticks to save them for later.\nAlso known as \u201cbutcherbirds\u201d they are famous for being fairly brutal songbirds. They catch all kinds of animals, including crickets, lizards, and small birds, and impale them on sticks to save them for later.\n92. Atlantic wolffish are terrifying predators reaching up to 5 feet in length.\nThey have very sharp teeth and a powerful bite, making them powerful predators. Atlantic wolffish use this bite force to crush the hard shells of molluscs and crustaceans.\n93. The wood frog spends 7 months of the year frozen.\nThese Alaskan frogs freeze almost completely at the start of winter, with two-thirds of their body water turning into ice. To all intents and purposes, they seem dead; their heart stops beating, and their blood flow stops. However, once winter starts to thaw so do they and they hop back to life.\n94. Certain animals have anti-freeze proteins that allow them to survive extreme temperatures.\nThese anti-freeze proteins prevent water in the cells of the animals from crystalising and forming ice. Examples of animals with this superpower include the winter flounder and the eelpout.\n95. Honeypot ants swell up to a huge size with food.\nHoneypot ants have to be seen to be believed. During wet season, certain ants consume huge amounts of nectar, making their abdomens swell up to the size of a grape. Then, during dry season, they provide the other ants with food by throwing the nectar back up again. Yum!\n96. The lesula, discovered in 2007, has giant human like eyes and a blue bottom.\nThis relatively newly discovered monkey lives in the Congo. Their eyes are very distinctive because of their human-like appearance, as are their bright blue bums.\n97. The Donald Trump caterpillar looks identical to the ex-president\u2019s hair.\nThis species of caterpillar, prior to 2016, was known as the Flannel Moth Caterpillar (Megalopyge opercularis). It gained popularity as it is very furry and bright orange, giving it an uncanny resemblance to Trump\u2019s hair (wig?).

Frilled sharks are 2-meter-long living fossils that eat their prey whole.\nFrilled sharks are considered living fossils, meaning they\u2019ve gone unchanged for a long period of time and most of their closest relatives can only be found in the form of fossils. They get their names from their \u201cfrilly\u201d gills and they are predators, which swallow their prey whole.\n99. Giant vampire bats lived 100,000 years ago and had a wingspan of 50cm (20 inches).\nThese giant bats were roughly 30% larger than the modern vampire bats. The remains of one were recently found in a cave in Argentina.\n100. There are an estimated 8.7 million species on earth and more than 80% of them are undiscovered.\nBased on current data, complex statistics, and models we can predict how many species there are on Earth, telling us how many are still left to be found. It will likely take another 500 years to find them all."}

They only need to breath air from the surface once every 5 to 10 minutes using the blow hole at the top of their heads which is like a large nostril.\nThere are almost forty different species of dolphins with the killer whale being the largest.\nThe bottlenose dolphin is the species of \"Flipper\" fame that we are most familiar with, and the species that is regularly referred to as simply \"dolphin\".\nThe term \"dolphin\" is not synonymous with \"porpoise\". Porpoises are six species within the dolphin family differentiated by their flat teeth. So, simply put, all porpoises are dolphins, but not all dolphins are porpoises. The bottlenose is not a porpoise.\nDolphins live in groups of 5 to 15 individuals called pods. They have a very loosely structured lifestyle and freely socialize among many different pods.\nContact and interaction are critical to all whale species, and the bottlenose dolphin craves stimulation from its family, peers, and close friends, but dolphins will also reach out and connect with people on a regular basis, and will even joyfully interact with dogs and children on boating trips.\nIn the sea, their only enemy is the shark, but when in groups, dolphins are not afraid of sharks, and will torment and often kill a solitary shark.\nDolphins are amazingly agile and have athletic, muscular bodies that allow them to circle around a shark, dizzying and confusing it. Once the hapless shark is sufficiently stymied, the dolphins will ram the shark repeatedly with their strong snouts, delivering one heavy-weight blow after another.\nIncidents of dolphins hunting down and killing sharks in this manner have been documented for centuries.\nAlthough there are no incidence of fatal attacks by bottlenose dolphins on humans, the killer whale or orca, which is the largest dolphin species, has been known to attack humans while being held in captivity.\nThese attacks - several of which have been fatal- are no doubt out of desperation, and possibly psychosis, after an animal with immense intellect and emotional depth is kept in crushingly inhumane conditions. - Dolphin Facts\ndolphin echolocation\ndolphin pod\nAll of the toothed whale species including dolphins, orcas, and porpoises use echolocation - a kind of \"sonar\" -to detect objects.\nBy bouncing sounds off surfaces which might be boats, fish, rock out-croppings or even people, dolphins can figure out an objects size, shape, and location.\nDolphins make clicking sounds of different frequencies through their blowhole and listen for the sounds to echo back to them. They can then form a mental image of what is around them.\nThis sixth sense is the dolphins most primary sense, used as they dive deep into dark waters. People who have been \"echolocated\" by dolphins report having felt a strange vibration!\nDolphins have been caught and killed in fishing nets for hundreds of years because the echolocation they use can't identify a net. Happily, new nets with plastic beacons attached to them reflect and amplify the dolphins sonar and are saving many lives. An amazingly simple solution! - Dolphin Facts\ndolphins!\ndolphin lifestyle and reproduction\nThe social life of a bottlenose dolphin is an active one with different pods merging and intermingling and individuals often moving happily about among several social groups.\nDolphins are rather sexual creatures and engage in lots of activities that may appear to be purely for pleasure and without reproduction in mind.\nGroup activity and activity between members of the same sex is very common and appears to strengthen bonds. Mating may occur at any time throughout the year, with any number of partners, but females appear to only have one calf every 3 to 5 years.\nThe females in the pod will protect the mother and assist in the birth. The calf is delivered tail first and a mid-wife or aunt will nudge the calf to the surface for its first breaths of air while mom recovers from the labor.\nThe calf swims actively at it's mother's side and nurses from her within moments of birth. Mother dolphins speak to their little ones constantly, and soon the baby is communicating with its own squeaks and clicks.\nDolphin pods have their own culture, and each individual pod may speak with a slightly different recognizable \"accent\" that differs from pod to pod, and also regionally.\nBaby dolphins will nurse for up to 18 months and will live with their mothers for 5 or 6 years before jumping into the deep end of the busy dolphin social scene. - Botlenose Dolphin Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

The question is why?\nScientists have debated for years on this subject suggesting that leaping dolphins or whales are clearing parasites off of their bodies, looking around for flocks of seagulls that might indicate a school of fish in the distance, or announcing their presence to those nearby.\nGiven these animals astounding intellect, maybe they are just enjoying the thrill of exertion, engaging in sport as you or I might if our bodies allowed.\nMaybe its just fun! -Dolphin Facts\ndo dolphins smile?\nMany people describe the bottlenose dolphin as smiling.\nThe sweet expression of the bottlenose dolphin is one that melts many human hearts, but if you take a closer look you will see that the smile never changes.\nEven if a dolphin is ill, stressed or frightened, the lips remain curved in what we perceive to be a cheery grin.\nDolphins communicate mood to each other with a huge vocabulary of clicks, tones and chatters, as well as body and tail movements, but their faces, like the rest of their bodies, are lined with inches of blubber that hinder any change of expression. -Dolphin Facts\nthe dolphins\nspotted dolphins\ncommon dolphins\nDolphins are members of the delphinedae family which is over 30 species of small toothed whales. Some of the largest dolphin species are referred to simply as whales including pilot whales and of course killer whales, also known as orcas,\nThe most common dolphin species are the common dolphin, the bottlenose dolphin and the spotted dolphin. Bottlenose dolphins live in all open oceans of the world except the Arctic and Antarctic oceans.\nThere is also a completely separate family of four dolphin species that live mostly in freshwater rivers.\nAll whales have a blow hole through which they breathe air from the surface. The blow hole is effectively a single nostril.\nWithin the blow hole are delicate folds of skin known as \"phonic lips\" that create all the different clicks that dolphins use to communicate. The whistle sounds are produced by the larynx - so dolphins can create more than one sound at a time.\nDolphins don't have gills and can't breathe underwater. They do not breathe at all when submerged, and when they surface they must make a make a conscious effort to take a breath.\nBecause their breathing is no longer automatic, as it surely was when dolphins were land mammals, only one hemisphere of the dolphins brain goes to sleep at a time, the other half stays awake, with one eye open, to take in a breath every 5 minutes or so. - Dolphin Facts\na few more dolphin facts\ndolphin airborne\nAlthough the bottlenose is most familiar, there are 41 different species of dolphin!\nThe killer whale is a actually a species of dolphin.\nThe bottle nose dolphins top speed is almost 30mph\nDolphins sleep with 1/2 their brain at a time!\nBottlenose dolphins each have their own \"whistle\" that they use to identify themselves - exactly like a human name\nThe dolphin is one of the few animals to be born tail first - Dolphin Facts\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnamalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Cetacea\nSub-Order Odontoceti\nFamily Delphinidae\nGenus Tursiops\nSpecies truncatus (bottlenose dolphin)\nDolphin Facts - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT bull cow calf group GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD pod temperate and tropical oceans ocean fish, squid TOP SPEED LIFESPAN AVG.

There are around 44 species of dolphins left in the world and the population of the common bottlenose dolphins is estimated to be around 600,000.\nWhere does a dolphin live?\nDolphins live in the ocean and some live in rivers. They are mostly found in temperate and tropical waters around the world.\nWhat is a dolphin's habitat?\nDolphins are marine animals that live in oceans and brackish waters along coastlines. Some of the species are known to live in freshwater bodies like rivers, too. Dolphins depend on other aquatic life like fish, and squid in order to survive.\nWho do dolphins live with?\nDolphins generally live in groups of dozens or hundreds of their kind known as pods. They hunt in pods, and this also helps them to keep their predators away. Some species are known to live in superpod with more than 1000 dolphins.\nHow long do dolphins live?\nDepending on the species, the lifespan of dolphins can vary. Most dolphins are expected to live for about 30-50 years, whereas some dolphin species like striped dolphins can live for up to 60 years!\nHow do they reproduce?\nCommon bottlenose dolphins reproduce by the process of internal fertilization, and the females give birth to their young. Newborn dolphins can swim from the moment they are born but are dependent for almost two years on their mothers for milk and food. Dolphins may mate at any time of the year and tend to give birth to a baby every two to three years.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nThe current conservation status of Dolphins is Endangered, with only 44 species left across the world.\nDolphin Fun Facts\nWhat do dolphins look like?\nThese animals have a long, streamlined body which helps them to travel fast and effectively in the water. They have gray, brown, or blue skin, sometimes with black spots and stripes on their body. The bottlenose dolphin species are known to have a short and thick snout. They have between 74-104 teeth which help them hunt for fish and other marine mammals.\nHow cute are they?\nThese marine mammals are very cute, and they get along with humans very well. They are known to be very social and are super cute!\nHow do they communicate?\nThese intelligent mammals communicate by whistles and each dolphin has a different vocal pitch. These are used for communicating within their pods.\nHow big are dolphins?\nDolphins can be between 5.7 - 31.2 ft (1.7 - 9.5 m) long and can be 2.1 -2.11 ft (64 - 89 cm).

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphin - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin", "text": "Marine mammals, closely related to whales and porpoises\nA dolphin is an aquatic mammal within the infraorder Cetacea. Dolphin species belong to the families Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins), Iniidae (the New World river dolphins), Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese river dolphin). There are 40 extant species named as dolphins.\nDolphins range in size from the 1.7-metre-long (5 ft 7 in) and 50-kilogram (110-pound) Maui's dolphin to the 9.5 m (31 ft 2 in) and 10-tonne (11-short-ton) orca. Several species of dolphins exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the males are larger than females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not quite as flexible as seals, some dolphins can briefly travel at speeds of 29 kilometres (18 mi) per hour or leap about 30 feet (9.1 m). Dolphins use their conical teeth to capture fast-moving prey. They have well-developed hearing which is adapted for both air and water. It is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.\nDolphins are widespread. Most species prefer the warm waters of the tropic zones, but some, like the right whale dolphin, prefer colder climates. Dolphins feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the orca, feed on large mammals such as seals. Male dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively long period of time. Dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.\nDolphins are sometimes hunted in places such as Japan, in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. Besides drive hunting, they also face threats from bycatch, habitat loss, and marine pollution. Dolphins have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. Dolphins occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the film series Free Willy. Dolphins are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks. The most common dolphin species in captivity is the bottlenose dolphin, while there are around 60 orcas in captivity.\nEtymology\nThe name is originally from Greek \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03af\u03c2 (delph\u00eds), \"dolphin\", which was related to the Greek \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03cd\u03c2 (delphus), \"womb\". The animal's name can therefore be interpreted as meaning \"a 'fish' with a womb\". The name was transmitted via the Latin delphinus (the romanization of the later Greek \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u2013 delphinos), which in Medieval Latin became dolfinus and in Old French daulphin, which reintroduced the ph into the word \"Dolphin\". The term mereswine (that is, \"sea pig\") has also historically been used.\nThe term 'dolphin' can be used to refer to most species in the family Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins) and the river dolphin families Iniidae (South American river dolphins), Pontoporiidae (La Plata dolphin), Lipotidae (Yangtze river dolphin) and Platanistidae (Ganges river dolphin and Indus river dolphin). This term has often been applied in the US, mainly in the fishing industry, to all small cetaceans (dolphins and porpoises) are considered porpoises, while the fish dorado is called dolphin fish. In common usage the term 'whale' is used only for the larger cetacean species, while the smaller ones with a beaked or longer nose are considered 'dolphins'. The name 'dolphin' is used casually as a synonym for bottlenose dolphin, the most common and familiar species of dolphin. There are six species of dolphins commonly thought of as whales, collectively known as blackfish: the orca, the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale, and the two species of pilot whales, all of which are classified under the family Delphinidae and qualify as dolphins. Although the terms 'dolphin' and 'porpoise' are sometimes used interchangeably, porpoises usually refers to the Phocoenidae family, which have a shorter beak and spade-shaped teeth and differ in their behavior.\nA group of dolphins is called a \"school\" or a \"pod\". Male dolphins are called \"bulls\", females called \"cows\" and young dolphins are called \"calves\".\nHybridization\nIn 1933, three hybrid dolphins beached off the Irish coast; they were hybrids between Risso's and bottlenose dolphins. This mating was later repeated in captivity, producing a hybrid calf. In captivity, a bottlenose and a rough-toothed dolphin produced hybrid offspring. A common-bottlenose hybrid lives at SeaWorld California. Other dolphin hybrids live in captivity around the world or have been reported in the wild, such as a bottlenose-Atlantic spotted hybrid. The best known hybrid is the wolphin, a false killer whale-bottlenose dolphin hybrid. The wolphin is a fertile hybrid. Two wolphins currently live at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii; the first was born in 1985 from a male false killer whale and a female bottlenose. Wolphins have also been observed in the wild.\nEvolution\nDolphins are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates). They are related to the Indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago.\nThe primitive cetaceans, or archaeocetes, first took to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic by 5\u201310 million years later.\nArchaeoceti is a parvorder comprising ancient whales. These ancient whales are the predecessors of modern whales, stretching back to their first ancestor that spent their lives near (rarely in) the water. Likewise, the archaeocetes can be anywhere from near fully terrestrial, to semi-aquatic to fully aquatic, but what defines an archaeocete is the presence of visible legs or asymmetrical teeth. Their features became adapted for living in the marine environment. Major anatomical changes include the hearing set-up that channeled vibrations from the jaw to the earbone which occurred with Ambulocetus 49 million years ago, a streamlining of the body and the growth of flukes on the tail which occurred around 43 million years ago with Protocetus, the migration of the nasal openings toward the top of the cranium and the modification of the forelimbs into flippers which occurred with Basilosaurus 35 million years ago, and the shrinking and eventual disappearance of the hind limbs which took place with the first odontocetes and mysticetes 34 million years ago. The modern dolphin skeleton has two small, rod-shaped pelvic bones thought to be vestigial hind limbs. In October 2006, an unusual bottlenose dolphin was captured in Japan; it had small fins on each side of its genital slit, which scientists believe to be an unusually pronounced development of these vestigial hind limbs.\nToday, the closest living relatives of cetaceans are the hippopotamuses; these share a semi-aquatic ancestor that branched off from other artiodactyls some 60 million years ago. Around 40 million years ago, a common ancestor between the two branched off into cetacea and anthracotheres; anthracotheres became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene two-and-a-half million years ago, eventually leaving only one surviving lineage: the two species of hippo.\nAnatomy\nThe anatomy of a dolphin showing its skeleton, major organs, tail and body shape.\nDolphins have torpedo-shaped bodies with generally non-flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, a tail fin, and bulbous heads. Dolphin skulls have small eye orbits, long snouts, and eyes placed on the sides of its head; they lack external ear flaps. Dolphins range in size from the 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in) long and 50 kg (110 lb) Maui's dolphin to the 9.5 m (31 ft 2 in) and 10 t (11 short tons) orca. Overall, they tend to be dwarfed by other Cetartiodactyls. Several species have female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males.\nDolphins have conical teeth, as opposed to porpoises' spade-shaped teeth. These conical teeth are used to catch swift prey such as fish, squid or large mammals, such as seal.\nBreathing involves expelling stale air from their blowhole, in an upward blast, which may be visible in cold air, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. Dolphins have rather small, unidentifiable spouts.\nAll dolphins have a thick layer of blubber, thickness varying on climate. This blubber can help with buoyancy, protection to some extent as predators would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. Calves, generally, are born with a thin layer of blubber, which develops at different paces depending on the habitat.\nDolphins have a two-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and pyloric chambers.\nDolphins' reproductive organs are located inside the body, with genital slits on the ventral (belly) side. Males have two slits, one concealing the penis and one further behind for the anus. Females have one genital slit, housing the vagina and the anus, with a mammary slit on either side.\nIntegumentary system\nThe integumentary system is an organ system mostly consisted of skin, hair, nails and endocrine glands. The skin of dolphins is very important as it is specialized to satisfy specific requirements. Some of these requirements include protection, fat storage, heat regulation, and sensory perception. The skin of a dolphin is made up of two parts: the epidermis and the blubber, which consists of two layers including the dermis and subcutis. The dolphin's skin is known to have a smooth rubber texture and is without hair and glands, except mammary glands. At birth, a newborn dolphin has hairs lined up in a single band on both sides of the rostrum, which is their jaw, and usually have a total length of 16\u201317 cm . Dolphins are a part of the species Cetacea. The epidermis of this species is characterized by the lack of keratin and by a prominent intertwine of epidermal rete pegs and long dermal papillae. The epidermal rete pegs are the epithelial extensions that project into the underlying connective tissue in both skin and mucous membranes. The dermal papillae are finger-like projections that help adhesion between the epidermal and dermal layers, as well as providing a larger surface area to nourish the epidermal layer. The thickness of a dolphin's epidermis differs, depending on species and age.\nBlubber\nBlubber is found within the dermis and subcutis layer. The dermis blends gradually with the adipose layer, which is known as fat, because the fat may extend up to the epidermis border and collagen fiber bundles extend throughout the whole subcutaneous blubber which is fat found under the skin. The thickness of the subcutaneous blubber or fat depends on the dolphin's health, development, location, reproductive state and how well it feeds. This fat is thickest on the dolphin's back and belly. Most of the dolphin's body fat is accumulated in a thick layer of blubber. Blubber differs from fat in that, in addition to fat cells, it contains a fibrous network of connective tissue.\nThe blubber functions to streamline the body and to form specialized locomotor structures such as the dorsal fin, propulsive fluke blades and caudal keels. There are many nerve endings that resemble small, onion-like configurations that are present in the superficial portion of the dermis. Mechanoreceptors are found within the interlocks of the epidermis with dermal ridges. There are nerve fibers in the dermis that extend to the epidermis. These nerve endings are known to be highly proprioceptive, which explains sensory perception. Proprioception, which is also known as kinesthesia, is the body's ability to sense its location, movements and actions. Dolphins are sensitive to vibrations and small pressure changes.\nBlood vessels and nerve endings can be found within the dermis. There is a plexus of parallel running arteries and veins in the dorsal fin, fluke and flippers. The blubber manipulates the blood vessels to help the dolphin stay warm. When the temperature drops, the blubber constricts the blood vessels to reduce blood flow in the dolphin. This allows the dolphin to spend less energy heating its own body, ultimately keeping the animal warmer without burning energy as quick. In order to release heat, the heat must pass the blubber layer. There are thermal windows that lack blubber, are not fully insulated and are somewhat thin and highly vascularized, including the dorsal fin, flukes, and flippers. These thermal windows are a good way for dolphins to get rid of excess heat if overheating. Additionally in order to conserve heat, dolphins use countercurrent heat exchange. Blood flows in different directions in order for heat to transfer across membranes. Heat from warm blood leaving the heart will heat up the cold blood that is headed back to the heart from the extremities, meaning that the heart always has warm blood and it decreases the heat lost to the water in those thermal windows.\nLocomotive\nDolphins have two pectoral flippers, containing four digits, a boneless dorsal fin for stability, and a tail fin for propulsion. Although dolphins do not possess external hind limbs, some possess discrete rudimentary appendages, which may contain feet and digits. Dolphins are fast swimmers in comparison to seals which typically cruise at 9\u201328 km/h (5.6\u201317.4 mph); the orca, in comparison, can travel at speeds up to 55.5 km/h (34.5 mph). The fusing of the neck vertebrae, while increasing stability when swimming at high speeds, decreases flexibility, which means they are unable to turn their heads. River dolphins have non-fused neck vertebrae and can turn their heads up to 90\u00b0. Dolphins swim by moving their tail fin and rear body vertically, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Some species log out of the water, which may allow them to travel faster. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. All species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves from involuntarily spinning in the water.\nSome dolphins are adapted for diving to great depths. In addition to their streamlined bodies, some can selectively slow their heart rate to conserve oxygen. Some can also re-route blood from tissue tolerant of water pressure to the heart, brain and other organs. Their hemoglobin and myoglobin store oxygen in body tissues and they have twice the concentration of myoglobin than hemoglobin.\nSensory\nThe dolphin ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In dolphins, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The dolphin ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. This allows dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation. Though most dolphins do not have hair, they do have hair follicles that may perform some sensory function. Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on an object's shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood. The small hairs on the rostrum of the boto are believed to function as a tactile sense, possibly to compensate for the boto's poor eyesight.\nThe dolphin eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes of a dolphin are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When dolphins surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells. They lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells, indicating a more limited capacity for color vision than most mammals. Most dolphins have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area. They also have glands on the eyelids and outer corneal layer that act as protection for the cornea.\nThe olfactory lobes and nerve are absent in dolphins, suggesting that they have no sense of smell.\nDolphins are not thought to have a good sense of taste, as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether. Some have preferences for different kinds of fish, indicating some taste.\nIntelligence\nDolphins are known to teach, learn, cooperate, scheme, and grieve. The neocortex of many species is home to elongated spindle neurons that, prior to 2007, were known only in hominids. In humans, these cells are involved in social conduct, emotions, judgment, and theory of mind. Cetacean spindle neurons are found in areas of the brain that are homologous to where they are found in humans, suggesting that they perform a similar function.\nBrain size was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. Since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. Allometric analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately the \u2154 or \u00be exponent of the body mass. Comparison of a particular animal's brain size with the expected brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an encephalization quotient that can be used as another indication of animal intelligence. Orcas have the second largest brain mass of any animal on earth, next to the sperm whale. The brain to body mass ratio in some is second only to humans.\nSelf-awareness is seen, by some, to be a sign of highly developed, abstract thinking. Self-awareness, though not well-defined scientifically, is believed to be the precursor to more advanced processes like meta-cognitive reasoning (thinking about thinking) that are typical of humans. Research in this field has suggested that cetaceans, among others, possess self-awareness. The most widely used test for self-awareness in animals is the mirror test in which a mirror is introduced to an animal, and the animal is then marked with a temporary dye. If the animal then goes to the mirror in order to view the mark, it has exhibited strong evidence of self-awareness.\nSome disagree with these findings, arguing that the results of these tests are open to human interpretation and susceptible to the Clever Hans effect. This test is much less definitive than when used for primates, because primates can touch the mark or the mirror, while cetaceans cannot, making their alleged self-recognition behavior less certain. Skeptics argue that behaviors that are said to identify self-awareness resemble existing social behaviors, and so researchers could be misinterpreting self-awareness for social responses to another individual. The researchers counter-argue that the behaviors shown are evidence of self-awareness, as they are very different from normal responses to another individual. Whereas apes can merely touch the mark on themselves with their fingers, cetaceans show less definitive behavior of self-awareness; they can only twist and turn themselves to observe the mark.\nIn 1995, Marten and Psarakos used television to test dolphin self-awareness. They showed dolphins real-time footage of themselves, recorded footage, and another dolphin. They concluded that their evidence suggested self-awareness rather than social behavior. While this particular study has not been repeated since then, dolphins have since passed the mirror test. Some researchers have argued that evidence for self-awareness has not been convincingly demonstrated.\nBehavior\nSocialization\nDolphins are highly social animals, often living in pods of up to a dozen individuals, though pod sizes and structures vary greatly between species and locations. In places with a high abundance of food, pods can merge temporarily, forming a superpod; such groupings may exceed 1,000 dolphins. Membership in pods is not rigid; interchange is common. They establish strong social bonds, and will stay with injured or ill members, helping them to breathe by bringing them to the surface if needed. This altruism does not appear to be limited to their own species. The dolphin Moko in New Zealand has been observed guiding a female pygmy sperm whale together with her calf out of shallow water where they had stranded several times. They have also been seen protecting swimmers from sharks by swimming circles around the swimmers or charging the sharks to make them go away.\nDolphins communicate using a variety of clicks, whistle-like sounds and other vocalizations. Dolphins also use nonverbal communication by means of touch and posturing.\nDolphins also display culture, something long believed to be unique to humans (and possibly other primate species). In May 2005, a discovery in Australia found Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) teaching their young to use tools. They cover their snouts with sponges to protect them while foraging. This knowledge is mostly transferred by mothers to daughters, unlike simian primates, where knowledge is generally passed on to both sexes. Using sponges as mouth protection is a learned behavior. Another learned behavior was discovered among river dolphins in Brazil, where some male dolphins use weeds and sticks as part of a sexual display.\nForms of care-giving between fellows and even for members of different species(see Moko (dolphin)) are recorded in various species \u2013 such as trying to save weakened fellows or female pilot whales holding up dead calves for long periods.\nDolphins engage in acts of aggression towards each other. The older a male dolphin is, the more likely his body is to be covered with bite scars. Male dolphins can get into disputes over companions and females. Acts of aggression can become so intense that targeted dolphins sometimes go into exile after losing a fight.\nMale bottlenose dolphins have been known to engage in infanticide. Dolphins have also been known to kill porpoises for reasons which are not fully understood, as porpoises generally do not share the same diet as dolphins and are therefore not competitors for food supplies. The Cornwall Wildlife Trust records about one such death a year. Possible explanations include misdirected infanticide, misdirected sexual aggression or play behaviour.\nReproduction and sexuality\nA skin-skeletal preparation.\nDolphin copulation happens belly to belly; though many species engage in lengthy foreplay, the actual act is usually brief, but may be repeated several times within a short timespan. The gestation period varies with species; for the small Tucuxi dolphin, this period is around 11 to 12 months, while for the orca, the gestation period is around 17 months. Typically dolphins give birth to a single calf, which is, unlike most other mammals, born tail first in most cases. They usually become sexually active at a young age, even before reaching sexual maturity. The age of sexual maturity varies by species and gender.\nDolphins are known to display non-reproductive sexual behavior, engaging in masturbation, stimulation of the genital area of other individuals using the rostrum or flippers, and homosexual contact.\nVarious species of dolphin have been known to engage in sexual behavior up to and including copulation with dolphins of other species. Sexual encounters may be violent, with male dolphins sometimes showing aggressive behavior towards both females and other males. Male dolphins may also work together and attempt to herd females in estrus, keeping the females by their side by means of both physical aggression and intimidation, to increase their chances of reproductive success. Occasionally, dolphins behave sexually towards other animals, including humans.\nSleeping\nSleeping dolphin in captivity: a tail kick reflex keeps the dolphin's blowhole above the water.\nGenerally, dolphins sleep with only one brain hemisphere in slow-wave sleep at a time, thus maintaining enough consciousness to breathe and to watch for possible predators and other threats. Sleep stages earlier in sleep can occur simultaneously in both hemispheres. In captivity, dolphins seemingly enter a fully asleep state where both eyes are closed and there is no response to mild external stimuli. In this case, respiration is automatic; a tail kick reflex keeps the blowhole above the water if necessary. Anesthetized dolphins initially show a tail kick reflex. Though a similar state has been observed with wild sperm whales, it is not known if dolphins in the wild reach this state. The Indus river dolphin has a sleep method that is different from that of other dolphin species. Living in water with strong currents and potentially dangerous floating debris, it must swim continuously to avoid injury. As a result, this species sleeps in very short bursts which last between 4 and 60 seconds.\nFeeding\nThere are various feeding methods among and within species, some apparently exclusive to a single population. Fish and squid are the main food, but the false killer whale and the orca also feed on other marine mammals. Orcas on occasion also hunt whale species larger than themselves. Different breeds of dolphins vary widely in the number of teeth they possess. The orca usually carries 40-56 teeth while the popular bottlenose dolphin has anywhere from 72 to 116 conical teeth and its smaller cousin the common dolphin has 188-268 teeth so that the number of teeth each breed carries varies widely between individuals. Hybrids between common and bottlenose bred in captivity had an intermediate amount of teeth.\nOne common feeding method is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a small volume, known as a bait ball. Individual members then take turns plowing through the ball, feeding on the stunned fish. Corralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more easily. Orcas and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it, a behaviour known as beach or strand feeding. Some species also whack fish with their flukes, stunning them and sometimes knocking them out of the water.\nReports of cooperative human-dolphin fishing date back to the ancient Roman author and natural philosopher Pliny the Elder. A modern human-dolphin partnership currently operates in Laguna, Santa Catarina, Brazil. Here, dolphins drive fish towards fishermen waiting along the shore and signal the men to cast their nets. The dolphins' reward is the fish that escape the nets.\nIn Shark Bay, Australia, dolphins catch fish by trapping them in huge conch shells. In \"shelling\", a dolphin brings the shell to the surface and shakes it, so that fish sheltering within fall into the dolphin's mouth. From 2007 to 2018, in 5,278 encounters with dolphins, researchers observed 19 dolphins shelling 42 times. The behavior spreads mainly within generations, rather than being passed from mother to offspring.\nVocalization\nSpectrogram of dolphin vocalizations. Whistles, whines, and clicks are visible as upside down V's, horizontal striations, and vertical lines, respectively.\nDolphins are capable of making a broad range of sounds using nasal airsacs located just below the blowhole. Roughly three categories of sounds can be identified: frequency modulated whistles, burst-pulsed sounds and clicks. Dolphins communicate with whistle-like sounds produced by vibrating connective tissue, similar to the way human vocal cords function, and through burst-pulsed sounds, though the nature and extent of that ability is not known. The clicks are directional and are for echolocation, often occurring in a short series called a click train. The click rate increases when approaching an object of interest. Dolphin echolocation clicks are amongst the loudest sounds made by marine animals.\nBottlenose dolphins have been found to have signature whistles, a whistle that is unique to a specific individual. These whistles are used in order for dolphins to communicate with one another by identifying an individual. It can be seen as the dolphin equivalent of a name for humans. These signature whistles are developed during a dolphin's first year; it continues to maintain the same sound throughout its lifetime. In order to obtain each individual whistle sound, dolphins undergo vocal production learning. This consists of an experience with other dolphins that modifies the signal structure of an existing whistle sound. An auditory experience influences the whistle development of each dolphin. Dolphins are able to communicate to one another by addressing another dolphin through mimicking their whistle. The signature whistle of a male bottlenose dolphin tends to be similar to that of his mother, while the signature whistle of a female bottlenose dolphin tends to be more distinguishing. Bottlenose dolphins have a strong memory when it comes to these signature whistles, as they are able to relate to a signature whistle of an individual they have not encountered for over twenty years. Research done on signature whistle usage by other dolphin species is relatively limited. The research on other species done so far has yielded varied outcomes and inconclusive results.\nBecause dolphins are generally associated in groups, communication is necessary. Signal masking is when other similar sounds (conspecific sounds) interfere with the original acoustic sound. In larger groups, individual whistle sounds are less prominent. Dolphins tend to travel in pods, upon which there are groups of dolphins that range from a few to many. Although they are traveling in these pods, the dolphins do not necessarily swim right next to each other. Rather, they swim within the same general vicinity. In order to prevent losing one of their pod members, there are higher whistle rates. Because their group members were spread out, this was done in order to continue traveling together.\nJumping and playing\nPacific white-sided dolphins porpoising.\nDolphins frequently leap above the water surface, this being done for various reasons. When travelling, jumping can save the dolphin energy as there is less friction while in the air. This type of travel is known as porpoising. Other reasons include orientation, social displays, fighting, non-verbal communication, entertainment and attempting to dislodge parasites.\nDolphins show various types of playful behavior, often including objects, self-made bubble rings, other dolphins or other animals. When playing with objects or small animals, common behavior includes carrying the object or animal along using various parts of the body, passing it along to other members of the group or taking it from another member, or throwing it out of the water. Dolphins have also been observed harassing animals in other ways, for example by dragging birds underwater without showing any intent to eat them. Playful behaviour that involves another animal species with active participation of the other animal has also been observed. Playful dolphin interactions with humans are the most obvious examples, followed by those with humpback whales and dogs.\nJuvenile dolphins off the coast of Western Australia have been observed chasing, capturing, and chewing on blowfish. While some reports state that the dolphins are becoming intoxicated on the tetrodotoxin in the fishes' skin, other reports have characterized this behavior as the normal curiosity and exploration of their environment in which dolphins engage.\nTail-walking\nAlthough this behaviour is highly unusual in wild dolphines, several Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) of the Port River, north of Adelaide, South Australia, have been seen to have exhibit \"tail-walking\". This activity mimicks a standing posture, using the tail to run backwards along the water. To perform this movement, the dolphin \"forces the majority of its body vertically out of the water and maintains the position by vigorously pumping its tail\".\nThis started in 1988 when a female named Billie was rescued after becoming trapped in a polluted marina, and spent two weeks recuperating with captive dolphins. Billie had previously been observed swimming and frolicking with racehorses exercising in the Port River in the 1980s. After becoming trapped in a reedy estuary further down the coast, she was rescued and placed with several captive dolphins at a marine park to recuperate. There she observed the captive dolphins performing tail-walking. After being returned to the Port River, she continued to perform this trick, and another dolphin, Wave, copied her. Wave, a very active tail-walker, passed on the skill to her daughters, Ripple and Tallula.\nAfter Billie's premature death, Wave started tail-walking much more frequently, and other dolphins in the group were observed also performing the behaviour. In 2011, up to 12 dolphins were observed tail-walking, but only females appeared to learn the skill. In October 2021, a dolphin was observed tail-walking over a number of hours.\nScientists have found the spread of this behaviour, through up to two generations, surprising, as it brings no apparent advantage, and is very energy-consuming. A 2018 study by Mike Rossley et al. suggested:\nSocial learning is the most likely mechanism for the introduction and spread of this unusual behaviour, which has no known adaptive function. These observations demonstrate the potential strength of the capacity for spontaneous imitation in bottlenose dolphins, and help explain the origin and spread of foraging specializations observed in multiple populations of this genus.\nThreats\nLesions in the dorsal fin of a bottlenose dolphin caused by lobomycosis , a fungal infection of the skin.\nDolphins have few marine enemies. Some species or specific populations have none, making them apex predators. For most of the smaller species of dolphins, only a few of the larger sharks, such as the bull shark, dusky shark, tiger shark and great white shark, are a potential risk, especially for calves. Some of the larger dolphin species, especially orcas, may also prey on smaller dolphins, but this seems rare. Dolphins also suffer from a wide variety of diseases and parasites. The Cetacean morbillivirus in particular has been known to cause regional epizootics often leaving hundreds of animals of various species dead. Symptoms of infection are often a severe combination of pneumonia, encephalitis and damage to the immune system, which greatly impair the cetacean's ability to swim and stay afloat unassisted. A study at the U.S. National Marine Mammal Foundation revealed that dolphins, like humans, develop a natural form of type 2 diabetes which may lead to a better understanding of the disease and new treatments for both humans and dolphins.\nDolphins can tolerate and recover from extreme injuries such as shark bites although the exact methods used to achieve this are not known. The healing process is rapid and even very deep wounds do not cause dolphins to hemorrhage to death. Furthermore, even gaping wounds restore in such a way that the animal's body shape is restored, and infection of such large wounds seems rare.\nA study published in the journal Marine Mammal Science suggests that at least some dolphins survive shark attacks using everything from sophisticated combat moves to teaming up against the shark.\nHumans\nSome dolphin species are at risk of extinction, especially some river dolphin species such as the Amazon river dolphin, and the Ganges and Yangtze river dolphin, which are critically or seriously endangered. A 2006 survey found no individuals of the Yangtze river dolphin. The species now appears to be functionally extinct.\nPesticides, heavy metals, plastics, and other industrial and agricultural pollutants that do not disintegrate rapidly in the environment concentrate in predators such as dolphins. Injuries or deaths due to collisions with boats, especially their propellers, are also common.\nVarious fishing methods, most notably purse seine fishing for tuna and the use of drift and gill nets, unintentionally kill many dolphins. Accidental by-catch in gill nets and incidental captures in antipredator nets that protect marine fish farms are common and pose a risk for mainly local dolphin populations. In some parts of the world, such as Taiji in Japan and the Faroe Islands, dolphins are traditionally considered food and are killed in harpoon or drive hunts. Dolphin meat is high in mercury and may thus pose a health danger to humans when consumed.\nQueensland's shark culling program, which has killed roughly 50,000 sharks since 1962, has also killed thousands of dolphins as bycatch. \"Shark control\" programs in both Queensland and New South Wales use shark nets and drum lines, which entangle and kill dolphins. Queensland's \"shark control\" program has killed more than 1,000 dolphins in recent years, and at least 32 dolphins have been killed in Queensland since 2014. A shark culling program in KwaZulu-Natal has killed at least 2,310 dolphins.\nDolphin safe labels attempt to reassure consumers that fish and other marine products have been caught in a dolphin-friendly way. The earliest campaigns with \"dolphin safe\" labels were initiated in the 1980s as a result of cooperation between marine activists and the major tuna companies, and involved decreasing incidental dolphin kills by up to 50% by changing the type of nets used to catch tuna. The dolphins are netted only while fishermen are in pursuit of smaller tuna. Albacore are not netted this way, making albacore the only truly dolphin-safe tuna. Loud underwater noises, such as those resulting from naval sonar use, live firing exercises, and certain offshore construction projects such as wind farms, may be harmful to dolphins, increasing stress, damaging hearing, and causing decompression sickness by forcing them to surface too quickly to escape the noise.\nDolphins and other smaller cetaceans are also hunted in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. This is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, dolphins are mostly hunted for their meat, though some end up in dolphinariums. Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the often polluted meat causes, thousands of dolphins are caught in drive hunts each year.\nRelationships with humans\nIn history and religion\nCrete. Fresco of dolphins, c. 1600 BC, from Knossos\nSilver stater from Tarentum c. 290 BC showing Phalanthos riding a dolphin on one side and a rider with a shield decorated with a dolphin on the other side.\nDolphins have long played a role in human culture. Dolphins are sometimes used as symbols, for instance in heraldry.\nIn Greek myths, dolphins were seen invariably as helpers of humankind. Dolphins also seem to have been important to the Minoans, judging by artistic evidence from the ruined palace at Knossos. During the 2009 excavations of a major Mycenaean city at Iklaina, a striking fragment of a wall-paintings came to light, depicting a ship with three human figures and dolphins. Dolphins are common in Greek mythology, and many coins from ancient Greece have been found which feature a man, a boy or a deity riding on the back of a dolphin. The Ancient Greeks welcomed dolphins; spotting dolphins riding in a ship's wake was considered a good omen. In both ancient and later art, Cupid is often shown riding a dolphin. A dolphin rescued the poet Arion from drowning and carried him safe to land, at Cape Matapan, a promontory forming the southernmost point of the Peloponnesus. There was a temple to Poseidon and a statue of Arion riding the dolphin.\nThe Greeks reimagined the Phoenician god Melqart as Melikert\u00eas (Melicertes) and made him the son of Athamas and Ino. He drowned but was transfigured as the marine deity Palaemon, while his mother became Leucothea. (cf Ino.) At Corinth, he was so closely connected with the cult of Poseidon that the Isthmian Games, originally instituted in Poseidon's honor, came to be looked upon as the funeral games of Melicertes. Phalanthus was another legendary character brought safely to shore (in Italy) on the back of a dolphin, according to Pausanias.\nDionysus was once captured by Etruscan pirates who mistook him for a wealthy prince they could ransom. After the ship set sail Dionysus invoked his divine powers, causing vines to overgrow the ship where the mast and sails had been. He turned the oars into serpents, so terrifying the sailors that they jumped overboard, but Dionysus took pity on them and transformed them into dolphins so that they would spend their lives providing help for those in need. Dolphins were also the messengers of Poseidon and sometimes did errands for him as well. Dolphins were sacred to both Aphrodite and Apollo.\nWhen heraldry developed in the Middle Ages, not much was known about the biology of the dolphin and it was often depicted as a sort of fish. Traditionally, the stylised dolphins in heraldry still may take after this notion, sometimes showing the dolphin skin covered with fish scales.\nDolphins are present in the coat of arms of Anguilla and the coat of arms of Romania, and the coat of arms of Barbados has a dolphin supporter.\nA well-known historical example of a dolphin in heraldry, was the arms for the former province of the Dauphin\u00e9 in southern France, from which were derived the arms and the title of the Dauphin of France, the heir to the former throne of France (the title literally means \"The Dolphin of France\").\n\"Dolfin\" was the name of an aristocratic family in the maritime Republic of Venice, whose most prominent member was the 13th Century Doge Giovanni Dolfin.\nIn Hindu mythology the Ganges river dolphin is associated with Ganga, the deity of the Ganges river. The dolphin is said to be among the creatures which heralded the goddess' descent from the heavens and her mount, the Makara, is sometimes depicted as a dolphin.\nThe Boto, a species of river dolphin that resides in the Amazon River, are believed to be shapeshifters, or encantados, who are capable of having children with human women.\nThere are comparatively few surviving myths of dolphins in Polynesian cultures, in spite of their maritime traditions and relevance of other marine animals such as sharks and seabirds; unlike these, they are more often perceived as food than as totemic symbols. Dolphins are most clearly represented in Rapa Nui Rongorongo, and in the traditions of the Caroline Islands they are depicted similarly to the Boto, being sexually active shapeshifters.\nIn captivity\nSpecies\nSeaWorld show featuring bottlenose dolphins and pilot whales.\nThe renewed popularity of dolphins in the 1960s resulted in the appearance of many dolphinaria around the world, making dolphins accessible to the public. Criticism and animal welfare laws forced many to close, although hundreds still exist around the world. In the United States, the best known are the SeaWorld marine mammal parks. In the Middle East the best known are Dolphin Bay at Atlantis, The Palm and the Dubai Dolphinarium.\nSeaWorld San Diego pilot whale with trainers.\nVarious species of dolphins are kept in captivity. These small cetaceans are more often than not kept in theme parks, such as SeaWorld, commonly known as a dolphinarium. Bottlenose dolphins are the most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan in captivity and have a friendly appearance. Hundreds if not thousands of bottlenose dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. Other species kept in captivity are spotted dolphins, false killer whales and common dolphins, Commerson's dolphins, as well as rough-toothed dolphins, but all in much lower numbers than the bottlenose dolphin. There are also fewer than ten pilot whales, Amazon river dolphins, Risso's dolphins, spinner dolphins, or tucuxi in captivity. An unusual and very rare hybrid dolphin, known as a wolphin, is kept at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii, which is a cross between a bottlenose dolphin and a false killer whale.\nThe number of orcas kept in captivity is very small, especially when compared to the number of bottlenose dolphins, with 60 captive orcas being held in aquaria as of 2017 . The orca's intelligence, trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity and sheer size have made it a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales were taken from the wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.\nOrganizations such as the Mote Marine Laboratory rescue and rehabilitate sick, wounded, stranded or orphaned dolphins while others, such as the Whale and Dolphin Conservation and Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society, work on dolphin conservation and welfare. India has declared the dolphin as its national aquatic animal in an attempt to protect the endangered Ganges river dolphin. The Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary has been created in the Ganges river for the protection of the animals.\nControversy\nShamu in 2009, with a collapsed dorsal fin.\nThere is debate over the welfare of cetaceans in captivity, and often welfare can vary greatly dependent on the levels of care being provided at a particular facility. In the United States, facilities are regularly inspected by federal agencies to ensure that a high standard of welfare is maintained.[citation needed] Additionally, facilities can apply to become accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), which (for accreditation) requires \"the highest standards of animal care and welfare in the world\" to be achieved. Facilities such as SeaWorld and the Georgia Aquarium are accredited by the AZA. Organizations such as World Animal Protection and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation campaign against the practice of keeping them in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the dorsal fin collapse seen in 60\u201390% of male orca. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s, although there are examples of orcas living longer, including several over 30 years old, and two captive orcas, Corky II and Lolita, are in their mid-40s. In the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average, and up to 70\u201380 years in rare cases. Wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average, and up to 50\u201360 years. Captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat, and captive whales' social groups are foreign to those found in the wild. Critics claim captive life is stressful due to these factors and the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild orca behavior. Wild orcas may travel up to 160 kilometres (100 mi) in a day, and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity. Captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves, their tankmates, or humans, which critics say is a result of stress.\nAlthough dolphins generally interact well with humans, some attacks have occurred, most of them resulting in small injuries. Orcas, the largest species of dolphin, have been involved in fatal attacks on humans in captivity. The record-holder of documented orca fatal attacks is a male named Tilikum, who lived at SeaWorld from 1992 until his death in 2017. Tilikum has played a role in the death of three people in three different incidents (1991, 1999 and 2010). Tilikum's behaviour sparked the production of the documentary Blackfish, which focuses on the consequences of keeping orcas in captivity. There are documented incidents in the wild, too, but none of them fatal.\nFatal attacks from other species are less common, but there is a registered occurrence off the coast of Brazil in 1994, when a man died after being attacked by a bottlenose dolphin named Ti\u00e3o. Ti\u00e3o had suffered harassment by human visitors, including attempts to stick ice cream sticks down her blowhole. Non-fatal incidents occur more frequently, both in the wild and in captivity.\nWhile dolphin attacks occur far less frequently than attacks by other sea animals, such as sharks, some scientists are worried about the careless programs of human-dolphin interaction. Dr. Andrew J. Read, a biologist at the Duke University Marine Laboratory who studies dolphin attacks, points out that dolphins are large and wild predators, so people should be more careful when they interact with them.\nSeveral scientists who have researched dolphin behaviour have proposed that dolphins' unusually high intelligence in comparison to other animals means that dolphins should be seen as non-human persons who should have their own specific rights and that it is morally unacceptable to keep them captive for entertainment purposes or to kill them either intentionally for consumption or unintentionally as by-catch. Four countries \u2013 Chile, Costa Rica, Hungary, and India \u2013 have declared dolphins to be \"non-human persons\" and have banned the capture and import of live dolphins for entertainment.\nMilitary\nA military dolphin.\nA number of militaries have employed dolphins for various purposes from finding mines to rescuing lost or trapped humans. The military use of dolphins drew scrutiny during the Vietnam War, when rumors circulated that the United States Navy was training dolphins to kill Vietnamese divers. The United States Navy denies that at any point dolphins were trained for combat. Dolphins are still being trained by the United States Navy for other tasks as part of the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program. The Russian military is believed to have closed its marine mammal program in the early 1990s. In 2000 the press reported that dolphins trained to kill by the Soviet Navy had been sold to Iran.\nThe military is also interested in disguising underwater communications as artificial dolphin clicks.\nTherapy\nDolphins are an increasingly popular choice of animal-assisted therapy for psychological problems and developmental disabilities. For example, a 2005 study found dolphins an effective treatment for mild to moderate depression. This study was criticized on several grounds, including a lack of knowledge on whether dolphins are more effective than common pets. Reviews of this and other published dolphin-assisted therapy (DAT) studies have found important methodological flaws and have concluded that there is no compelling scientific evidence that DAT is a legitimate therapy or that it affords more than fleeting mood improvement.\nConsumption\nCuisine\nIn some parts of the world, such as Taiji, Japan and the Faroe Islands, dolphins are traditionally considered as food, and are killed in harpoon or drive hunts. Dolphin meat is consumed in a small number of countries worldwide, which include Japan and Peru (where it is referred to as chancho marino, or \"sea pork\"). While Japan may be the best-known and most controversial example, only a very small minority of the population has ever sampled it.\nDolphin meat is dense and such a dark shade of red as to appear black. Fat is located in a layer of blubber between the meat and the skin. When dolphin meat is eaten in Japan, it is often cut into thin strips and eaten raw as sashimi, garnished with onion and either horseradish or grated garlic, much as with sashimi of whale or horse meat (basashi). When cooked, dolphin meat is cut into bite-size cubes and then batter-fried or simmered in a miso sauce with vegetables. Cooked dolphin meat has a flavor very similar to beef liver.\nHealth concerns\nThere have been human health concerns associated with the consumption of dolphin meat in Japan after tests showed that dolphin meat contained high levels of mercury. There are no known cases of mercury poisoning as a result of consuming dolphin meat, though the government continues to monitor people in areas where dolphin meat consumption is high. The Japanese government recommends that children and pregnant women avoid eating dolphin meat on a regular basis.\nSimilar concerns exist with the consumption of dolphin meat in the Faroe Islands, where prenatal exposure to methylmercury and PCBs primarily from the consumption of pilot whale meat has resulted in neuropsychological deficits amongst children.\nThe Faroe Islands population was exposed to methylmercury largely from contaminated pilot whale meat, which contained very high levels of about 2 mg methylmercury/kg. However, the Faroe Islands populations also eat significant numbers of fish. The study of about 900 Faroese children showed that prenatal exposure to methylmercury resulted in neuropsychological deficits at 7 years of age World Health Organization\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading\nCarwardine, M., Whales, Dolphins and Porpoises , Dorling Kindersley, 2000.

It has been credibly claimed, after surveys in the Yangtze River during the 1980s, that baiji could be the first dolphin species in history that humans have driven to extinction. The main threats to the species included a period of hunting by humans during the Great Leap Forward, entanglement in fishing gear, the illegal practice of electric fishing, collisions with boats and ships, habitat loss, and pollution. Further studies have noted that a lack of information on the baiji's historical distribution or ecology, the environmental impact of the construction of the Three Gorges Dam on the living space of the baiji, and the failure to act for the protection of the baiji are also threats to the species. In August 2007, a Chinese man reportedly videotaped a large white animal swimming in the Yangtze. Although the animal was tentatively identified as a baiji, the presence of only one or a few animals, particularly of advanced age, is not enough to save a functionally extinct species from true extinction. The World Wildlife Fund is calling for the preservation of any possible baiji habitat, in case the species is located and can be revived.\nPopulation number\nThe IUCN Red List and other sources don\u2019t provide the total number of the baiji population size.

They are part of the family of toothed whales that also includes killer and pilot whales. They are mammals and breathe through a blowhole on the top of their head. Most dolphins have acute eyesight, both in and out of the water, and their sense of hearing is superior to that of humans. Though they have a small ear opening on each side of their head, it is believed that hearing underwater is also, if not exclusively, done with the lower jaw which conducts the sound vibrations to the middle ear via a fat filled cavity in the lower jaw bone. Hearing is also used for echolocation, which is an ability all dolphins have. The dolphin's sense of touch is also well developed.\nThe tucuxi is the smallest of the dolphin species. It is about five feet in length and weighs about 100 pounds. The largest dolphin species is the orca. Male orcas are about 18 feet in length and weigh about 19,000 pounds. Most species have a long lifespan. Some individuals may have lived for more than 100 years.\nAll but five of the 34 dolphin species live in tropical and temperate oceans. Five species live in rivers: baiji (Chinese River dolphin), boto (Amazon River dolphin), franciscana (La Plata River dolphin), Ganges River dolphin and Indus River dolphin. The baiji has been declared functionally extinct.\nUsing echolocation to find prey, dolphins eat a variety of food including fish, squid and crustaceans. Dolphins often hunt together, surrounding a school of fish, trapping the fish, and taking turns swimming through the school and catching fish. Dolphins will also follow seabirds, other whales and fishing boats to feed opportunistically on the fish they scare up or discard.\nDolphins are well known for their agility and playful behavior, making them a favorite of wildlife watchers. Many species will leap out of the water, spy-hop (rise vertically out of the water to view their surroundings) and follow ships, often synchronizing their movements with one another. Scientists believe that by swimming alongside ships, a practice known as bow-riding, dolphins conserve energy. Dolphins live in social groups of five to several hundred.\nDolphins are widely believed to be among the most intelligent of all animals. Dolphins often leap above the water surface, sometimes performing acrobatic figures. Scientists aren't quite certain about the purpose of this behavior, but it may be to locate schools of fish by looking at above water signs, like feeding birds. They could also be communicating to other dolphins to join a hunt, attempting to dislodge parasites, or simply doing it for fun. Play is a very important part of dolphins' lives and they can often be observed playing with seaweed or playfighting with other dolphins. They have even been seen harassing other creatures, like seabirds and turtles. Dolphins also seem to enjoy riding waves and are frequently seen 'surfing' coastal swells and the bow waves of boats. They are also famous for their willingness to occasionally approach humans and playfully interact with them in the water. There are many stories of dolphins protecting shipwrecked sailors against sharks by swimming circles around the swimmers. A school of dolphins is also said to have pushed a fishing boat that was returning back out to sea after sensing the underwater disturbances generated by the 2004 Asian Tsunami.\nDolphins are social animals, living in pods (also called \"schools\") of up to a dozen animals. In places with a high abundance of food, schools can join temporarily, forming an aggregation called a superpod; such groupings may exceed 1,000 dolphins. The individuals communicate using a variety of clicks, whistles and other vocalizations. They also use ultrasonic sounds for echolocation. Membership in schools is not rigid; interchange is common. However, the animals can establish strong bonds between each other. This leads to them staying with injured or ill fellows for support.\nSome dolphins teach their offspring to use tools. The animals break off sponges and put them onto their mouths, protecting the delicate body part during their hunt for fish on the seabed. This knowledge of how to use a tool is mostly transferred from mothers to daughters in dolphins, unlike simian primates, where the knowledge is generally passed onto all the offspring, irrespective of sex. The technology to use sponges as mouth protection is not genetically inherited, but a taught cultural behavior.\nTHREATS TO DOLPHINS\nThreats to dolphins include marine pollution, habitat degradation, harvesting, low frequency sonar and entrapment in fishing gear. Some dolphin species face an uncertain future, especially the Amazon river dolphin and the Ganges river dolphin, which are critically or seriously endangered. Pesticides, heavy metals, plastics, and other industrial and agricultural pollutants that do not disintegrate rapidly in the environment concentrate in predators such as dolphins. Injuries or deaths due to collisions with boats, especially their propellers, are also common. Various fishing methods, most notably purse seine fishing for tuna and the use of drift and gill nets, kill many dolphins. In some parts of the world dolphins are killed in harpoon or drive hunts.\nHundreds of orcas, dolphins and other members of the dolphin family are held in captivity in the United States. While the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), passed in 1972, makes it more difficult to capture marine mammals from the wild, aquariums can still apply for permits or import animals caught in other countries. Whether wild caught or captive born, orcas and dolphins in captivity are sentenced to a life of confinement deprived of normal social and environmental interaction. Captured orcas and dolphins are confined to tanks as small as 24 feet by 24 feet wide and 6 feet deep. In tanks, the reverberations from their own sonar bouncing off walls drives some orcas and dolphins insane. Tanks are kept clean with chlorine, copper sulfate, and other harsh chemicals that irritate animals' eyes, causing many to swim with their eyes closed. Captured dolphins and orcas are often forced to learn tricks through food deprivation. Marine parks may withhold up to 60 percent of food before shows so that the animals will be \"sharp\" for performances. The stress of captivity is so great that some commit suicide."}

Dolphins are extremely intelligent and sociable animals, and have their own way to communicate with each other using special sounds.\nDolphins have a playful and friendly nature, which makes them very popular with humans. Read on for more facts about dolphins for kids (and adults) \u2026\nHave you seen a dolphin in real life? They sometimes live in captivity, in zoos, aquariums or water parks. Perhaps you are lucky enough to have seen them in the wild. There are few better sights in nature than a group of dolphins swimming in the sea!\nInformation about dolphins\nAlthough they are often mistaken for fish, dolphins are actually mammals. They are members of the Cetacea (pronounced set-ay-shia) family, which also contains whales and porpoises.\nOne way of telling the difference between a cetacean and a fish is by looking at their tails. You can tell a cetacean because their tail fins (called flukes) are horizontal, and move up and down. Fish have vertical tails which move from side to side.\nWatch the video below to see how a dolphin swims.\nThe most common type of dolphin is the bottlenose dolphin, which has the scientific name Tursiops. The bottlenose dolphin gets its name from its short and stubby beak. They measure around 6-12 feet (2-4 metres) long and can weigh anywhere between 300 and 1400 pounds (135 \u2013 650 kg). Male dolphins are larger than females.\nA dolphin\u2019s body is designed to help them move quickly and easily through water. The dolphin\u2019s fluke propels it through the water. On its back is a curved dorsal fin and on each side of the dolphin is a pectoral fin. The bump on a dolphins head is known as the melon.\nDolphin behaviour\nDolphins are very sociable and like to spend time together. They usually live in groups of around 10 \u2013 12 members. These groups are called pods. The female members of the family are called cows, the males are called bulls and young dolphins are known as calves. Pods help dolphins to form bonds and protect each other.\nDolphins are also very playful creatures. They have been spotted chasing each other and tossing around objects such as seaweed. They often leap out of the water, ride waves and pop their heads above the surface to look around (this is known as spy-hopping).\nEcholocation\nDolphins use a type of sonar to detect where objects are around them. This is called echolocation. Echolocation works when a dolphin bounces a high pitched sound off an object and then listens for the echo to come back. It is a very useful way for dolphins to find food and navigate.\nHow intelligent are dolphins?\nDolphins are often thought of as one of the world\u2019s most intelligent animals. They have bigger brains than humans.\nHow do dolphins communicate with each other?\nDolphins communicate with each other through clicks, squeaks and whistles. They use these special sounds to greet each other and to indicate if they are in distress.\nHow do dolphins breathe?\nDolphins live in the sea, but they can\u2019t breathe under water! They breathe through a blowhole and have to come up for air every 15 minutes.\nWhere do dolphins live?\nMost dolphins are marine mammals \u2013 this means that they live in the sea. They can be found in oceans all over the world. Dolphins usually stick to shallow areas of water found along coastlines and continental shelves. They like to live in warm, tropical water such as the Indian Ocean but dolphins can even be found in the seas around Scotland!\nRiver Dolphins\nThere are also some species of dolphins that live in rivers. River dolphins can be found in locations such as the Ganges River and the Amazon River.\nWhat do dolphins eat?\nDolphins are carnivores. They live off fish, squid and crustaceans that they find in the sea. Using their echolocation skills, dolphins usually work together in their pods to find fish. They trap large groups of fish and take turns to hunt and eat as many as they can. Although they have teeth, dolphins usually swallow their food whole.\nIn a normal day, a dolphin will eat up to 30 pounds of food!\nTypes of dolphin\nThere are over 40 different species of dolphins in the world. This includes marine dolphins that live in the sea as well as river dolphins.\nDolphins in captivity\nIf you have seen a dolphin in real life, it was probably in captivity. Many zoos, aquariums and waterparks keep dolphins and train them to perform in shows.\nDolphins kept in captivity for this purpose are usually treated very well, and seem to enjoy entertaining people. Many people who would otherwise never have seen a dolphin are able to get close to them and learn more about them. This may in turn help raise awareness of dolphin conservation efforts.\nHowever, many people think that dolphins should not be kept in captivity, and argue that an intelligent animal would prefer life in the wild and should not be contained in a small area.\nIt is impossible for us to know what a dolphin is really thinking. Although they may seem to be enjoying performing, we don\u2019t know what the effect of being in captivity really has on a dolphin.\nWhat do you think? Is it right to keep dolphins in captivity? Both sides have valid arguments and there is no real right or wrong answer.\nAre dolphins endangered?\nSome species of dolphins are becoming endangered because of human behaviour.\nThe biggest threat to the dolphin population is fishing. Nets from fishing boats are very dangerous to dolphins because they can get accidentally caught up in them and drown. In some countries, dolphins are even illegally hunted as a source of food.\nHuman pollution is another big threat to dolphins. Waste and chemicals poured into the ocean can make dolphins sick and reduce their ability to fight infections and diseases.\nHow can we help dolphins?\nLearning about dolphins is a great a start. If more people know about dolphins, there will be more awareness of their threats. There are many groups around the world that are dedicated to protecting wild dolphins by reducing hunting and pollution.\n10 facts about dolphins for kids\nDolphins can dive as deep as 3000 feet (915 metres). They can reach swimming speeds of up to 22 miles (35 kilometres) an hour. Wild dolphins live for at least 40 years. The largest member of the dolphin family is the orca, also known as the killer whale. Dolphins are warm blooded, just like humans. Whilst sleeping, only half of a dolphin\u2019s brain switches off. The other half stays awake to help them breathe and prevent them from drowning. A dolphin calf stays with its mother until it is between 3 and 8 years old. Dolphins have no sense of smell! Dolphins don\u2019t need to drink to stay alive. The fish that they eat contain enough water to keep them hydrated. Dolphins have a thick layer of fat called blubber beneath their skin to keep warm.\nDolphin activities\nWe hope that you have enjoyed these facts about dolphins for kids.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "20+ Weird Facts About The Dolphins That Might Surprise You", "url": "https://eartheclipse.com/animals/dolphins-weird-facts.html", "text": "20+ Weird Facts About The Dolphins That Might Surprise You\nDolphins, these cute, friendly cetaceans are known for being smart, curious, extremely playful, and helpful creatures that can learn to perform impressive tricks. These warm-blooded mammals are mostly saltwater creatures, breathe air through a blowhole, and give birth to calves. Let\u2019s know more about them through the following 20+ weird facts about the Dolphins.\n20+ Weird Facts About the Dolphins\nFact 1: Dolphins can live up to 50 years!\nLiving in the wild and depending on species, dolphins can live 40-70 years because of their excellent hunting and survival skills. But captivity shortens a dolphin\u2019s lifespan.\nFact 2: Heightened senses and skills\nDolphins can move their eyes separately from each other. It is beneficial in observing their surroundings, especially when they face danger. Their hearing power is ten times better than any humans.\nSome dolphins can hold breath up to 30 minutes, and they have been recorded to dive to 1000 feet (usually they spend almost their entire lives in shallow waters).\nThey can even swim at speeds of 25 miles per hour (typically average about 7 or 8 miles per hour) if they want. However, dolphins have a poor sense of smell.\nFact 3: Power Nap\nDolphins are champion in taking power naps. Instead of sleeping at a time for several hours, they rest one hemisphere of their brain for 15 to 20 mins at a stretch, while the other part of their brain remains alert and awake.\nThey take these kinds of \u201cnaps\u201d several times each day. Therefore, dolphins can continue swimming, breathing without drowning (it only takes a spoon full of water in their lungs to drown them), and remain safe from predators 24/7 while napping.\nFact 4: Dolphin species are as many as 44\nThere are around 44 different species of dolphins. Dolphins\u2019 physical attributes and behavior can vary considerably as per their species. The most common is the Bottlenose dolphin.\nThe smallest of their kind is very rare Maui\u2019s dolphin or popoto, which is 3-4 feet long, while the largest killer whale (also called Orca) is 30 feet, ten times longer than the smallest dolphins! World\u2019s largest dolphin is known by the name Boto.\nFact 5: Dolphins never chew with teeth\nDolphins have 100 teeth! But they never chew food using their teeth. Instead, dolphins use teeth only to catch their prey, such as fish, crustaceans, and squid, and grab the prey until they swallow it whole.\nFact 6: Multiple stomach chambers\nThese carnivores are predators and eat an average of 33 pounds of fish per day, so their stomachs are designed for rapid digestion. They have multiple stomach chambers.\nSince they forgo chewing, digestion occurs in one of the chambers of their stomach or part of their abdomen. The other chambers store food before its digestion.\nFact 7: Dolphins\u2019 useful tool- echolocation\nDolphins identify things from hundreds of yards away because of their natural sonar ability, called echolocation. It is a natural version of radar. They use echolocation (like bats) to find food, navigate in water and evade predators.\nThey make a series of high-pitched clicks that bounce off the distant objects and create an echo. Dolphins listen to the echoes and judge their location and determine the size and shape of nearby objects; they can even distinguish between a golf ball and a ping pong ball hitting the water.\nAn organ called \u201cmelon\u201d in a dolphin\u2019s head is responsible for echolocation. It\u2019s dolphin\u2019s teeth that pick up the echoes, and not ears.\nFact 8: Remarkable altruism\nDolphins are altruistic animals. They care for their injured, old, and sick members and help the wounded to reach the surface to breathe. They are compassionate to other species; also, they extend help crossing the species-barrier. There are many instances where dolphins helped humans and even whales.\nFact 9: Dolphins give birth to just one calf\nFemale dolphins called cows give birth to just one calf and carry their babies for nine to 17 months, depending on their species before giving birth to a calf.\nSurprisingly, dolphins are the only mammals on earth to give birth tail first, instead of the head and that they don\u2019t drown during the birthing process. Baby is nursed for one to two years, and stays with its mother up to the next seven to eight years, before mating and having its own calves.\nFact 10: Dolphins have names!\nNo, they aren\u2019t swimming around with name tags, but with its unique whistle. As per the scientists, dolphins use these signature whistles to recognize each other and call out to one another for life, and female dolphins may even teach their calves their whistles before they\u2019re born. Dolphins may be able to remember other dolphins\u2019 whistles for decades.\nFact 11: Unique identification\nThe dorsal fin of each dolphin is unique, just like snowflakes or fingerprints in humans. It can be very useful in identification.\nFact 12: Smart communication\nDolphins possess several highly developed forms of communication and make a variety of vocalizations to communicate with one another underwater.\nThey make clicking sounds to find prey and navigate the ocean and use whistling to call out other dolphins. Dolphins produce loud burst-pulse sounds when they need to scare off a nearby shark or reprimand their offspring for bad behavior.\nFact 13: Their language remains a mystery\nDolphin vocalizations have been studied and recorded by marine scientists for decades, but many aspects of their language are still unknown. Scientists have not yet found the meaning of the individual units of dolphin sounds, or the link between the animals\u2019 vocalizations and their behavior.\nWith the new technologies, including algorithms and high-frequency underwater recorders, hope they will be able to unlock the mystery of the dolphin language.\nFact 14: Dolphins make friends\nDolphins are highly social animals, and scientists are still discovering fascinating details about how these aquatic mammals socialize with one another.\nScientists found that dolphins have friends, and they segregate themselves into friend groups. Dolphins prefer the company of certain peers more than others, just like humans. They are friendly to even humans.\nFact 15: They are playful, teasers, and hot!\nDolphins love to play with their pod members. They are often found playing and teasing other animals living underwater. Besides humans, dolphins are also one of the most prolific sexual pleasure seekers in the world that mate for fun, not to breed. They spend 80% of their time in the pursuit of it.\nFact 16: Dolphin\u2019s skin gets regenerated every two hours\nA dolphin\u2019s skin looks and feels super smooth and sleek. Dolphin\u2019s epidermis or outer layer of skin gets replaced with new skin cells every two hours. As their skin regenerates so often, it stays smooth and, as most scientists believe, reduces drag as they swim.\nHowever, their skin is very delicate and gets injured at the slightest touch of hard surfaces. Don\u2019t worry; their skin also heals very fast that even the deepest of wounds can be cured within a short period.\nFact 17: The oldest dolphin in captivity\nDolphin\u2019s lifespan mainly varies by species. Most dolphins live for a few decades in the wild, while their lifespan drastically gets reduced only a few years in captivity.\nSurprisingly, Nellie, a bottlenose dolphin, lived for more than sixty years in captivity. It was the oldest dolphin who used to live in a marine entertainment park in Florida. Nellie was born in 1953. She appeared on many TV shows and commercials and performed tricks for the park\u2019s attendees before passing away in 2014.\nFact 18: Superpod with more than 1000 dolphins\nDolphins live in groups, known as pods that contain dozens or hundreds of member dolphins. While swimming in a pod, dolphins work together and cooperate to hunt prey, evade predators, raising calves, and care for sick or injured members.\nSometimes different pods merge, forming a superpod consisting of more than 1000 dolphins. But superpods are temporary group formation that only occurs in parts of the ocean with plentiful food.\nDolphins show their babies how to use tools like rubbing the body on certain soft corals to coat their skin like sunscreen or covering their snouts with sponges to protect them while foraging.\nFact 20: Trained Dolphins\nDolphins have the most developed brain in the animal kingdom. They can process information, communicate, learn, and remember like humans and apes.\nAlso, they have amazing survival skills. Because of their intelligence, speed, and echolocation skills, dozens of bottlenose dolphins are trained by Navy to help the U.S. Navy to find enemy swimmers, locate underwater mines, and guard nuclear arsenals.\nFact 21: Dolphins are not the same as porpoises\nMany people mistake dolphins with porpoises as they look nearly identical. But the two species belong to entirely different families and differ in their physical attributes.\nDolphins are usually bigger than porpoises, with longer beaks and curved dorsal fins. On the other hand, porpoises have more triangular dorsal fins as well as spade-shaped (rather than conical) teeth.\nReferences:\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2015/05/dolphin-intelligence-human-communication/\nhttps://www.onekindplanet.org/be_inspired/animal_sentience/tool_use/tool_use_in_dolphins/\nhttp://ocean.si.edu/ocean-photos/bottlenose-dolphin-pod\nhttps://defenders.org/dolphin/basic-facts"}

They are highly intelligent, sociable and playful animals found throughout the world\u2019s oceans.\nOcean dolphins range in size from the smallest, M\u0101ui dolphin, to the largest known dolphin, the Orca or killer whale.\nDolphins are extremely powerful animals. Some species can swim up to speeds of 50kph and regularly dive to depths of up to 55 metres to forage for their favourite foods of fish and squid.\nTravelling and hunting in pods, dolphins have big territories, on average around 100km\u00b2.\nDolphins help keep our environment in balance by eating other animals. Scientists also see dolphins as indicators of the health of our oceans.\nDolphins communicate in many different ways \u2013 including squeaking, clicking and whistling. Each dolphin has a unique whistle \u2013 it helps them recognise each other \u2013 meaning whistles work very much like human names. They also use high-pitched clicking sounds for echolocation \u2013 to help them navigate and find food. The clicks hit objects in the water and then bounce back as echoes. This helps dolphins work out what and where objects are.\nDespite what some people think, dolphins don\u2019t communicate by smiling when they are happy. The \u2018smile\u2019 on their face is simply their jaw shape."}

The other three species in this genus are Commerson's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus commersonii), Chilean dolphin (Cephalorhynchus eutropia), and Heaviside's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus heavisidii). They are playful blunt-nosed dolphins.\nWhat class of animal does a Hector's dolphin belong to?\nHector's dolphins are aquatic mammals (cetaceans) belonging to the family Delphinidae, found exclusively in New Zealand. Other cetaceans are whales, dolphins, and porpoises. They live in waters, breathe air, and give birth to young ones. There are many subspecies of these marine mammals.\nHow many Hector's dolphins are there in the world?\nThe Hector's dolphin population is rapidly decreasing. According to the estimates of IUCN, the current number of adult individuals is 7,381. Diseases, fishing nets, and humans are the biggest threats to this endangered individuals species.\nWhere does Hector's dolphin live?\nThe Hector's dolphin is found in the New Zealand inshore and coastal waters. The only cetaceans endemic to New Zealand are Hector's dolphin (New Zealand). Dolphin (Hector's in particular) populations are heavily fragmented. The largest population is found in Akaroa Harbour. Haast and Farewell Spit in the west, the Banks Peninsula marine mammal sanctuary in the east, Te Waewae Bay, and Porpoise Bay in the south are some regions where populations are concentrated. There is the North Island Hector's dolphin, South Island Hector's dolphin, and those on the west coast.\nWhat is a Hector's dolphin's habitat?\nNew Zealand's Hector's dolphins subspecies are mainly found to inhabit shallow inshore waters range. The maximum range of depth a Hector's dolphin is found at is 330 ft (100 m). They seasonally migrate from inshore (spring and summer) to offshore (autumn and winter). They are very consistent with their feeding sites. The Hector's dolphin habitat is preferably murky, turbid water.\nWho do Hector's dolphins live with?\nSouth Island Hector's dolphins are very social animals and travel in groups of up to five dolphins. They tend to form groups based on age and sex. Though they forage and travel in groups, they do not get attached to each other. Three types of groups formed by Hector's dolphins are nursery groups, subadult groups, and mature male or female groups. Nursery groups of these marine mammals consist of up to seven mothers and their offspring.\nHow long does Hector's dolphin live?\nThe average Hector's dolphin lifespan in the wild is 20 years old. There are accounts of them living up to 25 years old. The Hector's dolphin life history shows that they have slow population growth.\nHow do they reproduce?\nHector's dolphins' subspecies segregate in groups based on age and sex. They exhibit non-aggressive sexual behavior. There is also no male to male aggression. Hector's dolphins reach sexual maturity at an average of eight years of age. Hector's dolphins are polygynandrous. They follow a promiscuous mating pattern (more than one male mate with more than one female).\nSexual behavior in this subspecies is observed in larger mixed groups than in small single-sex groups. Their sexual behavior involves gestures like presenting their abdomen or gonad and physical contact which leads to mating. Adult Hector's dolphin males have large testes which make up 2.9% of their total weight. The mating occurs in late spring. Their gestation period is 11 months. The female Hector's dolphin gives birth to one calf every one to three years. Throughout their lifespan, they give birth to up to seven calves.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nAccording to the IUCN red list of threatened species, the conservation status of Hector's dolphins falls under the category of Endangered. The major threats faced by Hector's dolphins are the New Zealand fishing industry, seabed mining, pollution, and human impact. Diseases, fishing nets, and humans are the biggest threats to this Endangered sub-species' population. Hector's dolphins are endangered and highly protected. The Ministry of Fisheries, New Zealand, and the Department of Conservation (DOC) are responsible for a threat management plan for Hector's and Maui dolphins.\nHector's Dolphin Fun Facts\nWhat do Hector's dolphins look like?\nThe Hector's dolphin is the smallest marine dolphin found in New Zealand. It has a blunt snout and a round black dorsal fin. It does not have a beak, like other dolphins. Hector's dolphins have a stocky streamlined body. They have a pale gray body with a black dorsal fin, flippers, and flukes. The throat and belly are off-white. A unique white stripe stretches from their belly onto each side below the dorsal fin. A black mark surrounds their eye and extends to the base of their flippers.\nHow cute are they?\nDolphins are very adorable and playful species. Their round black dorsal fin is often compared to Mickey Mouse's ears. They are very intelligent and curious creatures.\nHow do they communicate?\nHector's dolphins communicate by echolocation. They produce high-frequency clicks but at a lower level than other dolphins. This is mainly due to their crowded habitat. The disadvantage is that they can spot their prey only as they get closer. This species, Hector's dolphin, has only a few types of clicks and audible sounds.\nHow big is Hector's dolphin?\nThe Hector's dolphin is very small in size compared to other dolphins. The adult dolphin grows up to a length of 3 ft 11 in\u20135 ft 3 in (1.2\u20131.6 m). The male dolphins are smaller than the female dolphins. Baby Hector's dolphins or calves are an average of 22 in (55 cm) at the time of birth.\nHow fast can Hector's dolphin swim?\nThe Hector's dolphin's fastest speed that it can maintain for a while is about 6.8-7.8 mph (11-12.5 kph). Its maximum speed is up to 10.2 mph (16.5 kph). Newborn Hector's dolphins swim very slowly, reducing the average speed of the nursery group.\nHow much does Hector's dolphin weigh?\nAn adult Hector's dolphin weighs around 88\u2013132 lb (40\u201360 kg). The male weighs lighter than the female dolphins. A newborn calf weighs 17-22 lb (8-10 kg).\nWhat are the male and female names of the species?\nA male and female dolphin is called a bull and a cow respectively. This name is not species-specific.\nWhat would you call a baby Hector's dolphin?\nA Hector's dolphin baby can be called a calf or an offspring.\nWhat do they eat?\nHector's dolphins live in inshore waters and feed on the prey available in the neritic zone. They feed on small-sized prey and avoids spiny ones. The common prey in the diet Hector's dolphins is red cod, squid, sardines, anchovy, and other schooling fish, flatfish, New Zealand sprat, arrow squid, and stargazer juveniles. Their inshore offshore movements are based on the movement of prey species. They play an important role in controlling the local fish population.\nThe main predators of Hector's dolphins are the seven gill shark, great white shark, blue shark, killer whales or orcas, mako sharks, and bronze whaler sharks.\nAre they friendly?\nDolphins are very friendly aquatic mammals and are harmless to humans. They are highly intelligent animals and often compared to dogs for their behavior towards humans. Hector's dolphins are very curious and are often found swimming very close to boats. They spend the majority of their tie feeding and playing. They are found very close to the shores.\nWould they make a good pet?\nWild animals should not be kept as pets. Aquatic mammals are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. It is illegal to keep any dolphins as pets, especially Critically Endangered ones like Hector's dolphins.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nDid you know...\nHector's dolphins were named after Sir James Hector, former curator of the Colonial Museum, Wellington. The first species was examined by him.\nThough they use echolocation for finding prey, they do not often use it for traveling, this leads to them getting stuck on gill nets and becoming bycatch. The Banks Peninsula marine mammal sanctuary in Canterbury, New Zealand was established in 1988 to reduce bycatch deaths of Hector\u2019s dolphins in the region.\nMaori tribes predict the weather by watching dolphins. M\u0101ori names for the Hector's dolphin are tutumairekurai and tupoupou.\nHector's dolphins are conscious sleepers. They never fall completely asleep and this helps control the required amount of oxygen intake. Otherwise, they could drown.\nBrucellosis is an infectious bacterial disease that affects Hector's and M\u0101ui dolphins. It causes late pregnancy abortion in these aquatic mammals. Brucellosis causes reproductive disease and affects the reproductive success of Hector's and Maui dolphins.\nHow do male and female Hector's dolphins differ in size?\nHector's dolphins exhibit sexual dimorphism. The female Hector's dolphins are slightly bigger and heavier than the male dolphins.\nWhat sounds do Hector's dolphins make?\nHector's dolphins make high-frequency clicks. Their mode of communication is by echolocation. They also use echolocation to search for food, terrain, and mates. The clicks hit the body or object and reflect, enabling the dolphin to identify the prey's location and surroundings. These clicks are also at times the Hector's dolphin expressing emotions.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly animal facts for everyone to discover!

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "7 Things Dolphins Like to Eat (Diet & Facts)", "url": "https://www.atshq.org/what-do-dolphins-eat/", "text": "You can recognize 43 different dolphin species, from the smallest, 5.6 feet (1.7 m) long Maui\u2019s dolphin that weighs only 110 pounds (50 kg), to the giant, 20,000 pounds (10 tons) heavy killer whale that can reach a length of 31 feet (9.5 m).\nTherefore, the answer to the question of what do dolphins eat is not easy to answer. As you can guess, their diet will depend on numerous things. Let\u2019s see.\nWhat Do Dolphins Eat in the Wild\nIf you know that there are 43 different dolphin species in nature, including two families (river and oceanic), you can suppose that their feeding habits significantly vary. Besides particular species, the chosen diet will depend on:\nA region where they live\nThe dolphins\u2019 noses (rostrum) shape\nTheir teeth size or type\nFood species in their habitat\nThe calorie levels each dolphin species needs\nIn any case, these opportunistic feeders will grab any aquatic food they find. Most of them will prefer eating fish, but deep water species also consume jellyfish and squid. River dolphins prefer freshwater fish and crustaceans, while Spinner dolphins consume fish, krill, and jellyfish.\nTheir feeding habits are quite flexible, and they quickly adapt to the current habitat. As you can expect, these mammals spend hours searching for food. However, the quantity of food they consume and the number of meals depend on the particular species.\nInterestingly, they often swallow seaweed, small shellfish, rock pieces, and other invertebrates while playing. Unfortunately, they can accidentally ingest plastic debris that usually causes their death.\nDolphin diets in captivity will depend on food availability, including frozen sea fish and fresh fish local fishermen catch. You can also find commercial dolphin dietary food like fish, crustaceans, shrimp, and squid.\nDolphins\u2019 favorite food\nAll existing dolphin species are carnivores that need a considerable amount of protein and fat to survive. Different dolphins species need various amounts of food, depending on their size.\nOn average, most dolphins need to intake food up to 2 to 10% of their body weight daily. So, a medium dolphin weighing 440 to 550 pounds (200 \u2013 250 kg) will need at least 22 to 55 pounds (10 \u2013 25 kg) fish a day. Their favorite food is:\nMarine mammals \u2013 Large dolphin species often hunt smaller marine mammals, including small dolphins, sea lions, penguins, walruses, seals, whales, sharks, and even seabirds.\n\u2013 Large dolphin species often hunt smaller marine mammals, including small dolphins, sea lions, penguins, walruses, seals, whales, sharks, and even seabirds.

For instance, small dolphins and those that never chew food will pick out smaller fish.\n\u2013 Most dolphins prefer consuming fish, regardless of the available species. The only difference is in fish size. For instance, small dolphins and those that never chew food will pick out smaller fish. Sea turtles \u2013 Large dolphins grab and consume sea turtles whenever they can since they are an excellent source of fat. They often choose smaller species or hatchlings since they have softer shells. On the other hand, adult turtles\u2019 shells are too hard, so they are safe from these voracious mammals.\n\u2013 Large dolphins grab and consume sea turtles whenever they can since they are an excellent source of fat.

Therefore, dolphins need to consume more of these aquatic creatures compared to other food types. Plankton \u2013 This seafood is a yummy bite for small dolphins. Since plankton lives in large groups, they are an easy meal for these mammals.\n7 Facts About Dolphins\nBiology\nDolphins are warm-blooded mammals with recognizable beaks and sharp conical-shaped teeth. Some species can swim long distances at a speed of impressive 25 mph (40 km/h), while others are capable of diving 1,000 feet (305 m) under the water surface or jump 20 feet (6 m) out of the water.\nThey are voluntary breathers, so they can hold their breath for a while and decide when to breathe. However, some of them need to take a breath every 20 seconds, and others can hold their breath for half an hour.\nDolphins types Scientific classification Dolphins Kingdom Animalia Phylum Chordata Class Mammalia Order Artiodactyla Infraorder Cetacea Parvorder Odontoceti Family Delphinidae, Inioidea, Platanistoidea, Lipotoidea\nSocial behavior\nDolphins are incredibly social animals that live in pods (groups) and form strong bonds for a lifetime. They even support sick and dying pod members when necessary. On the other hand, some dominant animals can be aggressive and can abuse the weaker group members.\nPregnancy and breastfeeding\nDolphins typically live at least 40 years. Females reach sexual maturity when they turn 8 to 11 years old, while most males become mature at 10 years of age.\nAll dolphin species give birth to live calves. After becoming mature, females can get pregnant every 2 to 4 years, but some species prolong that period to 5 to 7 years between two pregnancies.\nThey give birth to calves after a gestation of 9 to 12 months, primarily in a period from late spring to autumn. The only exception is dolphins that live in the central Pacific. All calves there are born from late winter to early spring.\nCalves (baby dolphins)\nAn average calve is about 3 to 4 feet (0.9 \u2013 1.2 m) long at birth and weighs approximately 30 pounds (13.5 kg). They eat their mothers\u2019 milk for at least 18 months, but sometimes for years.\nHowever, a few months old dolphins include small fish in their diet. Most of them will finally wean when increasing meat consumption. However, it is not rare that calves stay with their moms for a lifetime.\nDolphin habitats\nYou can find these beautiful creatures worldwide since different species can stand all temperature levels. However, most of them prefer living in regions with average temperatures from 50 to 90 F (10 \u2013 32 C). However, even these warm-blooded mammals avoid oceans close to the Arctic and Antarctic.\nBasically, they will live in any environment with enough food. Therefore, many species pick out oceans, seas, and even rivers for their homes:\nThe Pacific Ocean\nYou can recognize two dolphin types living in this ocean. Shore-loving species don\u2019t tolerate cold water, unlike dolphins that live in the deep ocean. Some of the most popular habitants are:\nCommon dolphins\nPacific white-sided dolphins\nSpinner dolphins\nHector\u2019s dolphin\nBottlenose dolphins\nChinese white dolphin\nThe Atlantic Ocean\nYou can find many dolphin species between Nova Scotia to Patagonia, including:\nAtlantic spotted dolphins\nHumpback dolphins\nAtlantic white-sided dolphin\nBottlenose dolphins\nCommon dolphin\nThe Indian Ocean\nNumerous dolphin species choose this ocean as their home, like:\nCommon dolphins\nBottlenose dolphins\nSpinner dolphins\nHumpback dolphins (highly endangered)\nIndo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins\nSeas\nEven though the population of dolphins in the Mediterranean sea decreases, you can still see four dolphin species living there:\nBottlenose dolphins\nStriped dolphins\nRisso\u2019s dolphins\nShort-beaked common dolphins\nRivers\nFew people know that there are also freshwater dolphin species. Some of them are endangered.\nSmall bright pink Amazon river dolphins that weigh only 350 pounds (159 kg)\nYangtze river dolphins\nIndus river dolphins (endangered)\nGanges river dolphins (endangered)\nHunting methods\nDolphins can go hunting individually or in a pod by using various techniques, like:\nHerding \u2013 A dolphin pod often uses the highly efficient technique of surrounding and compressing a school of fish as much as possible. Then, mammals take turns eating all the fish they catch.\n\u2013 A dolphin pod often uses the highly efficient technique of surrounding and compressing a school of fish as much as possible.

A dolphin forces a fish to shallow water, disables it from escaping, and effortlessly catches it. Stunning \u2013 This a bit cruel method implies that a dolphin hits the prey animal, typically smaller dolphins or whales, with the tail.

That way, it stuns or confuses the victim, making its catching effortless. Eco-localization \u2013 It is a process of emitting sound waves. By emitting them, dolphins quickly determine the exact prey location and rush in that direction to overcome it.\nSince dolphins are highly intelligent creatures, they never stay in the same place for a long. Despite the food abundance, all habitats run out of food after a while.\nIt always takes time for the environment to recover. Therefore, dolphins almost always return to old food sources but wait enough time to allow them to replenish.\nThreats\nUnfortunately, many dolphin species are endangered nowadays, no matter where they live. The most severe threats that contribute to dolphins\u2019 habitat degradation are:\nPollution\nOcean noise that interferes with dolphins\u2019 communication, navigation, finding food, and choosing mates\nClimate change and variation in ocean temperatures\nCommercial fishing and whaling\nToxic contaminants\nEntanglement in fishing gear like trap pots, longlines, gillnets, trawls, and seines\nBoat collisions\nDifficulties in finding prey\nSevere incidental injuries during salmon and squid fisheries\nSummary\nDolphins are intelligent and friendly aquatic mammals classified under the toothed whale category. They live in oceans, seas, and rivers worldwide and enjoy different living conditions and food types. However, all these animals are carnivorous and primarily consume fish, squids, crabs, turtles, crustaceans, and clams."}

Like you, we know there\u2019s something very special about dolphins. Because you share our fascination with dolphins, we asked our marine biologists to round up some remarkable dolphin facts so you can fully appreciate why dolphins are such an amazing species. Once you read these, you'll have everything you need to know about dolphins, and just a bit more. Here are some of the little known dolphin facts you\u2019ll learn: Which species of dolphin swims sideways.\nHow dolphins communicate and locate prey.\nWhich species can weigh 11 tons and which ones only weigh 350 pounds.\nWhich species have hair and which ones are bright pink.\nLet's dive in!\nAre Dolphins Fish?\nDolphins may swim through the water as gracefully as any fish, but they are not fish. Dolphins are mammals. This puts them in the ranks of other famous marine mammals such as whales, seals, and manatees. So why are dolphins mammals? They: are warm-blooded\nbreathe through lungs, not gills\ngive birth to live young\nproduce milk for their young\nhave body hair (doesn\u2019t look like it, but they do!) Warm Blooded Warm-blooded means that their body is able to regulate its own temperature, so they stay warm even when the water temperatures around them are cold. Some of their native environments, such as the waters of the northern Pacific Ocean, can get very chilly. In these places, being warm-blooded is a big advantage for survival. Being warm-blooded also makes dolphins and other cetaceans less prone to infections and other health conditions that affect cold-blooded species. Lungs, Not Gills Another central feature of marine mammals is that they have lungs, not gills. Dolphins, like whales, need to periodically come to the surface to replenish their air supply. They have blowholes that they close while diving, and then open at the surface for air. Marine mammals have also adapted in some special ways to thrive in an aquatic environment. For instance, dolphins exchange 80% of the air in their lungs with each breath, while humans are only capable of exchanging 17%. Marine mammals also have a greater capacity for oxygen storage in their lungs, blood, and muscles. All of this creates a more efficient use of the oxygen in their bodies and is what allows many species to dive for extended periods of time. Live Birth Dolphins give birth to live young and do not lay eggs. They can get pregnant on average every two to four years once they're mature, although some species can have 5-7 years between births. Dolphin calves tend to stay close to their mothers for a few years before venturing off on their own. However, some calves will stay with their mothers for a lifetime. Nursing Along with gestating their young, dolphins produce milk to nourish them. It may seem tricky for calves to nurse underwater, but dolphins have adapted some special physiological traits to work around this issue. Body Hair Did you know that dolphins start life with body hair? Newborn calves have hairs on their rostrum (their beak) that fall out soon after birth This is believed to be an evolutionary remnant from when they lived on land.\nAre Dolphins Intelligent?\nDolphins are considered one of the world's most intelligent animals, and they have several cognitive abilities that set them apart. Many researchers consider intelligence to be a combination of perception, communication, and problem-solving. You can see dolphin intelligence in action in the way they communicate and use tools. Communication is a big part of how dolphins socialize and hunt. They have the ability to echolocate with a series of clicks, allowing them to find other dolphins or similar species and prey even in the low-light conditions of the ocean. They can do more, too. Did you know that dolphin echolocation allows them to detect surgically implanted metal in swimming humans? The human body is comprised of about 75% water, and once in the water, we provide a prime structure for echolocation. This is how dolphins are able to discern that the metal is denser than human flesh, which is mostly water. Dolphins also have a complicated method of communicating with each other. From an outside perspective, dolphins may seem to communicate much like humans. However, researchers are still investigating both how dolphins communicate and what information they are able to pass to each other. Despite lacking hands, dolphins are adept at using tools. For instance, one of their more specialized tricks is to carry a sponge at the end of their beak, also know as a rostrum. This acts like padding, protecting them from sharp rocks as they dig through the seafloor for food. Zoological facilities, aquariums, and other places, such as Dolphins Plus, give people a way to learn more about these remarkable animals. The educated professionals who work there can share general information, threats and conservation efforts, and the latest research findings on how these animals cognitively function, communicate, and adapt. These places are both fun for the viewing public and offer a great learning experience.\nHow do Dolphins Communicate?\nOne of the fascinating things about these marine mammals is their complex methods of communication. So how do dolphins communicate? There are three main ways: whistles, echolocation, and social communication. Dolphins communicate through more than just clicks and whistles. They can also slap the water's surface with their tail or bodies, which is officially termed breaching. Dolphins can make squeaks, buzzes, whistles, clicks, and a wide array of other crazy noises.. These whistles can be heard by others of the species from miles away. Their whistle repertoire can change as they get older, and dolphins who bond with one another can learn each others signature whistles and often copy each other\u2019s whistles. Click on the links below to listen to the whistles of Atlantic bottlenose dolphins at Dolphins Plus. Listen to Julie Listen to Leo Listen to Nica Listen to Samanta Listen to Zoe Echolocation serves for both communication and for navigation. Echolocation is seeing with sound, much like sonar on a submarine. The dolphin emits a sound and then listens for the echo as that sound bounces off of objects, these sound waves travel back to the dolphin. Dolphins are able to get much more information out of the sound than humans. This includes the size and shape of objects or obstructions near them and even what material they are made of.\nHow Many Dolphin Species Are There?\nThere are dozens of species of dolphins and each has their own unique habitats, appearance, and behaviors. Many dolphins are grey in color, some species have various patterns of black and white, and a few are even pink. In terms of behavior, all species of dolphins are quite gregarious. In fact, many dolphin species can form groups of over 1,000 individuals, known as super pods! Dolphins come in all shapes and sizes, and each species has their own unique features. Here's how to recognize a few of the most striking and unusual dolphin species, although we\u2019re warning you right now that we\u2019re saving the most popular species for last! The Amazon River Dolphin You may not expect to find a dolphin in freshwater areas, but this species thrives in the Amazon River. It's also called the boto or bufeo dolphin and its skin turns pink as it matures. The Ganges River Dolphin Here's another entry to the list of freshwater dolphins. As you'd guess from the name, this species can be found in the Ganges River in India. It has a unique habit of swimming sideways, allowing it to sidle up to food. Commerson's Dolphin This striking, highly social dolphin species is found off the coast of Argentina and in parts of the Indian Ocean. It's best known for a panda-like black and white color pattern. Risso's Dolphin Risso's dolphins love deeper waters, where they seek out a diet of squid and other deepwater fish species. However, their favorite prey fights back and older members of this species may have a mottled pattern of battle scars from squid attacks. Killer Whales Did you know that killer whales are members of the dolphin family? These animals, also commonly called orcas, are the world's largest dolphins. How big are they? Larger individuals can grow over 30 feet long and weigh 11 tons. They typically have a bold black and white pattern similar to Commerson's dolphin. They use some of the most sophisticated and unusual communications of all dolphin species. Spinner Dolphins These playful dolphins have earned their name, in part, for the high jumping spins they take out of the water. These aerial acrobatic tricks make them a favorite among dolphin-watchers. They are found throughout the world, preferring warm and shallow waters. The Short-Finned Pilot Whale Once you've seen one of these members of the dolphin family, you'll never forget them. The short-finned pilot whale has an unusual, squared-off head and lacks the long beak of most dolphin species. Pilot whales are very social and travel in pods of up to 50 members. The Hourglass Dolphin This shy, elusive dolphin species share a similar black and white color pattern to killer whales, but they are a fraction of the size. They are rarely seen by humans as hourglass dolphins are one of the few dolphin species who favors the Antarctic area. The Striped Dolphin Although the bottlenose is the most famous dolphin species, there is a good chance you've seen a striped dolphin in action at an aquatic center. These attractively striped animals can live in very large groups, and they perform elaborate acrobatics when they leap into the air.\nThe Bottlenose Dolphin\nWe saved the bottlenose dolphin for last for two reasons. It\u2019s one of the most popular species. Flipper, the world's most famous dolphin, was a bottlenose dolphin. The other reason is they hold a special place in our hearts, since most the dolphins at Dolphins Plus are Atlantic bottlenose dolphins. These majestic animals are dark grey and, as you'd expect from the name, have a short and blunt rostrum. Bottlenose dolphins live throughout the world in warmer waters. They have a number of interesting features ranging from how they look to how they interact with each other. Anatomy and Appearance Bottlenose dolphins are varying shades of grey with a lighter belly (counter-shading), which helps conceal them from predators. They have a streamlined body that allows them to swim up to 20 mph. The typical length for an adult bottlenose dolphin can range between 6 to over 12 feet and they can weigh over a 1,000 pounds. Behavior and Diet The bottlenose dolphin's diet varies depending on the region where they live. These skillful predators primarily eat fish, but can also hunt other marine life such as squid. Dolphins have some sophisticated ways to catch a meal. Some of their tactics include herding prey into muddy areas and even catching leaping fish out of the air. They tend to hunt in a group, which makes the foraging process very effective. Habitat Dolphins thrive in both tropical and cooler, more temperate waters. Humans have encountered dolphin pods both near shore and in deep offshore waters like the Indian Ocean. Some dolphin groups stay in one area for a lifetime while others migrate. Dolphin Calves JIM SCHULTZ/CHICAGO ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY\nWhen their calves are born they typically weigh around 30-40 pounds, compared to full-grown dolphins that can weigh over a 1,000 pounds. That's quite a difference! Bottlenose dolphins start out quite dark in color, lightening as they mature. Threats and Challenges Dolphins are under threat worldwide, mainly human generated threats. Two of the biggest issues are entanglement in fishing gear and nets, and pollution. Dolphins often pursue the same fish species that commercial fishing ships are hunting and may get accidentally caught in their nets. They can also get tangled in discarded ropes and gear, causing a significant amount of marine mammal deaths each year. Finally, the human-created pollution that is affecting the world's oceans is causing a wide variety of problems for dolphins, ranging from diseases to difficulty finding food. Mating Habits Dolphins do not mate for life. Dolphin reproduction often involves putting on displays including posturing and vocalizations to attract a mate. Dolphins gestate for 12 months and calves are typically born tail first, and they are primarily cared for by the mothers and other related and unrelated females.\nWhere Do Dolphins Live?\nDolphin habitats can be are found around the world, from tropical to temperate regions. Although they are warm-blooded, they tend to avoid oceans near the Arctic and Antarctic. The bottlenose dolphin, one of the most well-known species, prefers water between 50 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. However, each species has its own preferences. Dolphin habitats can be found everywhere from open oceans to coastlines to river basins. Some species are migratory and adapt well to changes in their environment. They can move to areas in their temperature range that offer sufficient numbers of fish. Other species are closely tied to one place and come under threat when humans begin developing the area. The Pacific Ocean This is home to several species including bottlenose, spinner, and Pacific white-sided dolphins. Dolphins who live in the deep ocean are better adapted to tolerating cold water than their shore-loving counterparts. The Atlantic Ocean Here you'll find the preferred home of bottlenose, humpback, and spotted dolphins. These species have been found from Nova Scotia to Patagonia and everywhere in between. The Indian Ocean The Indian Ocean is the native environment for large numbers of bottlenose, spinner, and common dolphins. Off the coast of East Africa, you'll also find the highly endangered humpback dolphin. World Wildlife Organization Rivers and Seas Dolphins are best known for living in the ocean, but there are also endangered freshwater varieties. Did you know that there are dolphins in the Amazon River? The Amazon River dolphin is comparatively small, weighing up to 350 pounds, and adults are bright pink. Threats Despite living throughout the world, dolphins are currently facing a lot of threats. Climate change, pollution including trash and debris, and aggressive fishing operations are impacting all species of dolphins. This is why marine mammal facilities are important for protecting and researching these animals. They are able to educate the public about these remarkable mammals, promote environmental stewardship, and give scientists an opportunity to understand the species more in depth.\nAre Dolphins Endangered?\nAre dolphins endangered? Yes, there are dozens of species of dolphin that are endangered and now extinct. Some of the most threatened species are the ones that come into contact with humans most frequently. This includes the Yangtze River dolphin, the Maui dolphin, the Ganges River dolphin, and the short-beaked common dolphin. Each of these species face significant challenges for their future. The Yangtze River dolphin is not officially considered extinct, but there have been no confirmed sightings for nearly 20 years. What may have happened? This species could have been a victim of human development including: bycatch fishing (when the dolphin is accidentally caught in a fishing net)\ninjuries from fishhooks and lines\nboat collisions\nthe rising pollution levels in the river itself The Maui dolphin, found off the coast of New Zealand, is a highly endangered species with (an estimated) less than 100 members left. The species decline is due to many issues, one of which is that they are very slow breeders. Most dolphins reproduce an average of every couple of years, but for this species, it's 6-7 years. They also face threats to their habitats and food sources. The Ganges River dolphin is seen in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. Because it lives in some of the most populated areas of the world, this species is hit hard by human impact. Some major threats include river pollution, lowered levels of river water, and dam building. The short-beaked common dolphin is found in the Mediterranean in declining numbers. These colorful animals are endangered by fishing accidents and the increasing pollution and trash building up in the Mediterranean Sea. How can you help? Even small changes you make can have a big impact on the future of dolphins in the world. These include: reducing the pollution and household waste you produce\npractice recycling\nreduce carbon emissions\nfollow marine-friendly regulations when out on your boat\nsupport private and governmental conservation programs\nstay educated on dolphins and environmental issues\nShould You Swim with Dolphins in the Wild?\nMost of the time, dolphins are not dangerous. Some are friendly and curious while others are skittish and avoid human contact. However, don't forget that dolphins are wild animals and can be unpredictable. Are you interested in swimming with dolphins? Don't do this in the wild; appreciate them from a distance. However, if you want this experience, you can go to a marine facility and have a safe encounter there. Some do's and don'ts of watching dolphins in the wild include: Do not feed wild dolphins. It teaches them to be dependent on humans, can lure them into dangerous areas along the shore, and encourages bad habits. If you see someone feeding dolphins in the wild, report them to the authorities. They may think they're helping, but they're causing more harm in the long run.\nDo not touch or pet dolphins, even if they come close. Stay at a safe distance.\nIf you want to view dolphins from an aircraft, check with the company ahead of time to make sure they stay at least 1,000 feet above the water to avoid disorienting the animals.\nNever use a drone to take picture of a dolphin from above.\nStay quiet and avoid loud noises. A startled dolphin may end up separated from their pod.\nDon't throw unused bait into the water.\nDiscard unwanted or waste fishing lines safely. You can also fish with specially designed dissolving hooks instead of the stainless steel varieties. SARASOTA DOLPHIN RESEARCH PROGRAM This last point is very important. Fishing lines, fish hooks, and discarded netting are one of the bigger threats to dolphins. Even if the animal manages to free itself, the resulting wounds attract predators and leave them vulnerable to infection.\nCan Dolphins and Humans Coexist?"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "35 Dolphin Facts for Kids - Little Passports", "url": "https://www.littlepassports.com/blog/animals/dolphin-facts-for-kids/", "text": "Dolphin facts can help kids tap into a long human tradition. Ancient artists and storytellers in Egypt, Greece, Rome, New Zealand (called Aotearoa by the Maori who first settled there), and China all featured dolphins in their work. Dolphins have been revered as supernatural messengers, treated as guardians of goddesses or reincarnated princesses, cast as the stars of movies and television shows, and studied by scientists. What are some dolphin facts for kids? Read on to find out.\nWhat Do Dolphins Eat?\nDolphins eat the meat of animals they find in the water. Often that means fish, but dolphins also eat jellyfish, squid, shrimp, and more. Like humans, dolphins are adaptable eaters\u2014they may have a favorite food, but they\u2019ll change up their diet depending on what\u2019s around them.\nDolphins find food to eat by hunting, often working together in pods to trap or confuse their prey and make it easier to catch. Bottlenose dolphins have a dazzling array of feeding techniques, from flipping fish into the air with their tails to using sponges (the sea creature, not the kitchen tool) to shield their noses while digging in the sand. Dolphins are social animals, and some of their feeding techniques are passed from generation to generation. The sponge trick, for instance, is only used by one group of dolphins in Australia!\nDolphin Teeth\nDolphin teeth help distinguish dolphins from other creatures of the sea. All dolphins have teeth, although how many they have varies a lot between species.\nSome dolphins have over 100 teeth, but they don\u2019t typically use them to chew! Instead, they grab their food with them. Dolphins often eat prey whole, but they sometimes rub large fish or octopuses against the bottom of the sea to break them into smaller pieces.\nLike humans, dolphins are born with their teeth still in their gums, and their teeth start to poke through as they get older.\nHow Do Dolphins Sleep?\nDolphins have different kinds of sleep, just like humans. Sometimes they sleep lightly, and sometimes they go into deeper sleep. During lighter sleep, dolphins often keep right on swimming. But when they really need to rest, dolphins sleep like a log, floating a little below the surface and occasionally drifting up to take a breath through their blowhole.\nDolphins also sometimes sleep with one eye open\u2014literally! Some dolphins put only half their brains to sleep at a time, using the other half to stay alert for danger.\nAre Dolphins Mammals?\nDolphins are classified as mammals by scientists. They regulate the temperature inside their bodies, they have lungs and breathe air, and their babies are born live. They even have very fine hair on their bodies when they\u2019re born! (The baby hair falls out and doesn\u2019t grow back.) Most importantly, dolphin babies drink milk, which all mammals do as infants.\nAre Orcas Dolphins?\nYes! Orcas have been known for centuries as \u201ckiller whales\u201d because of their ferocious hunting, but they\u2019re actually dolphins. Although they (and other dolphins) are related to whales, orcas\u2019 streamlined bodies, round heads, and beaks have more in common with dolphins. Most importantly, orcas have a \u201cmelon,\u201d a big, fatty bump on their forehead that lets them track prey via echolocation. Only dolphins have melons!\nTogether Time\nClick here to check out other fun animal facts for kids, including plenty of information about ocean creatures.

There are about 40 different dolphin species. which all vary in size, weight, behaviour and in appearance and color, too. They can be white, pearl-colored, rose, brown, grey, blue or black. When talking about dolphins, most people have a common bottlenose dolphin on their minds. Did you know that the orca is a dolphin, too? We have a separate profile for the orca.\nAnatomy and Appearance\nThe Biggest and the Smallest Dolphin Species\nThe smallest and lightest dolphin is Heaviside\u2019s dolphin. It normally reaches a length of just 4 feet (1.2 meters) and a weight of 88 lb (40 kg). The biggest and heaviest dolphin is the orca, which is also named killer whale. It reaches a length of 20-26 feet (6-8 meters) and can weigh up to 6 tons.\nDo Dolphins Have Ears?\nYes, but they do not have auricles like us. Dolphins have extremely small earholes, but they are said to have the best auditory sense of all animals. They also pick up sound waves with their jaws and their head and transmit them to their inner ears.\nBehavior\nHow Much Fish Does a Dolphin Eat Per Day?\nCommon bottlenose dolphins eat 18-33 lb (8-15 kg) fish per day. Orcas need about 485 lb (220 kg). They do not only hunt fish, but also seals, penguins and squids.\nHow Deep and How Long Do Dolphins Dive?\nExperiments showed that a trained dolphin could dive 1,640 feet (500 meters) deep. On average it is about 984 feet (300 meters) for a maximum of 20 minutes.\nDolphins on the Hunt\nDolphins always hunt together. Some dolphin species round up fish by means of clicking sounds before attacking them.\nDolphins Are Social Animals\nIf a dolphin is ill, injured or just giving birth to a dolphin baby, the others protect it and transport it to the water surface so that it can breathe.\nAnatomy and Appearance\nHow Do Dolphins Sleep?\nThey have to permanently stay close to the water surface to be able to breathe, as they are no fish but mammals with lungs. Therefore, dolphins have to swim while they are sleeping, because they have to come up to the surface to breathe. But how does this work?\nThe answer is: Just like a computer they activate an energy saving mode by reducing the activities of one of their cerebral hemispheres. This is a rather complicated process und allows dolphins to shut one eye and execute simple swimming movements simultaneously. Yet it sometimes happens that a dolphin \u201cforgets\u201d to resurface and breathe. Fortunately the dolphins keep an eye on each other and poke each other to wake up in those cases.\nCan Dolphins Speak?\nThere is only one correct answer to this question: possibly. We know that dolphins are able to utter about 100 different sounds. They chirp, click, whistle, scream, shout, groan, grunt, squeak and even make noises like creaking doors.\nYet, until today nobody has been able to lift the secret behind their songs. Scientists think that dolphins express their contentment with slow clicking noises and high whistling sounds while sharp and deep screeching is a signal of anger. It is also presumed that dolphins communicate via body language.\nEnemies and Threats\nWhen a Dolphin Feels Threatened\nThe marine mammals also stick together during shark attacks and other threats. They attack as a group and can even ram a big shark to kill it.\nFun Facts\nCan Dolphins Survive Outside the Water?\nTwo things are particularly problematic for dolphins: the heat and their own weight. Imagine the temperature is about 41 degrees Fahrenheit (5 degrees Celsius) outside and you have to wear a thick winter coat, a scarf and a cap. Now you enter an airplane to travel into tropical regions, but you are not allowed to take off your clothes. What is going to happen? Sooner or later you will get a thermal shock.\nThe same would happen to dolphins on shore. Their own weight is also a big problem. In the water the pressure on the dolphin\u2019s organs is much lower, so that on shore the animal practically squashes itself.\nAnimals in the Same Biome:\nVideo: 30 Facts About Dolphins"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphin Behavior | Dolphins World", "url": "https://www.dolphins-world.com/dolphin-behavior/", "text": "Research on dolphin intelligence provides valuable information that reveals the reasons for their particular behavior. These cetaceans can perform unusual activities within the animal world and perform complex actions.\nFROM DAY TO NIGHT.\nMost dolphins are active during the 24 hours, both day and night although they are mainly active during the morning and afternoon. Everything they do during the day depends on the conditions of their habitat, the season of the year (breeding season, mating, etc.), the time of the day and the physiological conditions of their bodies.\nSLEEPING BEHAVIOR.\nThere was a general uncertainty about the way dolphins sleep, but after several studies, it became evident that they do sleep but not the way humans do. Since they need some degree of consciousness to reach the surface and breathe, they keep one cerebral hemisphere active while the other rests. However, dolphins in captivity have an entirely different resting behavior than wild dolphins as they keep their blowhole off the water and do not respond to light stimuli, apparently having a deeper sleep, perhaps because they are not concerned about predators in their tanks that could threaten them.\nOne unusual behavior is when they do a sort of \u201ca cough,\u201d throwing their food out.\nThe case of the Indus river dolphin (Platanista gangetica minor) is particular because of its habitat; the river full of dangerous materials, muddy waters and strong currents, allow this dolphin to rest only 4-60 minutes in short bursts throughout the day.\nTRAVEL BEHAVIOR.\nSome species move from one place to another in an almost straight direction. They can travel alone or in the company of other individuals, swimming on the surface of the water to save the energy produced by the friction of the water on the submerged body, to orient themselves better or to get rid of the parasites in their skin. If they are resting, they group tightly and surface often to breathe.\nFEEDING BEHAVIOR.\nThe feeding activities can be carried out individually or in groups, cooperating with each other to capture larger prey and having less energy expenditure. One unusual behavior is when they do a sort of \u201ca cough,\u201d throwing their food out.\nThe dolphins of Shark Bay, Australia, have demonstrated to the astonished researchers that they have traits of a culture development, understanding this as a set of knowledge, ideas, beliefs, customs, and practices learned in a society and transmitted from generation to generation. This conclusion was the result of watching these cetaceans protecting their \u201csnout\u201d from rough surfaces with marine sponges, and later their offspring also did this; a behavior that was not inherited but transmitted from parents to their offspring.\nLET\u2019S PLAY!\nDolphins are very curious and enjoy playing with objects and other dolphins. They jump up to 4.9 meters above the surface of the water falling on their backs or with their belly down. They often follow the waves of the stern or the bow of boats.\nThey jump up to 4.9 meters above the surface of the water.\nMost dolphins play chasing one another, using objects and passing them on to others for attention. They commonly make bubbles in the water and take the time to recreate themselves in the ocean. Occasionally, this playful behavior includes other species of dolphins and animals such as Risso dolphins (Grampus griseus), Pantropical spotted dolphins (Stenella attenuata), pilot whales (Globicephala) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae).\nOther games are only fun for them; they have been seen catching birds and submerging them several meters down, without eating them later.\nTHIS BEHAVIOR IS NOT NICE \u2026\nThe habitat of dolphins also has a lot of dangers. If they notice something unpleasant near the pod, they quickly react swimming to the surface, exhaling, striking the water with their tail and grouping very close to each other. Any external element that disturbs dolphins has negative consequences that include stress, wounds, abnormal migrations and even less reproductive success.\nAdult males swim in the perimeter of the pod territory to monitor the environment and to communicate others the presence of danger if something happens. Usually, dolphins avoid sharks or flee if they are in the proximity, but there are cases in which these cetaceans have attacked and killed sharks.\nNormally, dolphins avoid sharks or flee if they are near, but if necessary, they know how to defend from them.\nFRIENDLY DOLPHINS\nThe sociability of dolphins is evident due to their continuous association with other dolphins of the same species and occasionally interactions even with other species of cetaceans and animals in general.\nIf there is something for which people recognize dolphins, it is because of its charming \u201cpersonality.\u201d Docile and friendly to the human presence, they are also close with their companions. They establish strong social ties, assist wounded dolphins, cooperate to feed themselves and survive, and even voluntarily approach divers and bathers. Did you know that there are unconfirmed reports of dolphins helping humans to fish and sometimes they even offer them fish, octopus, and squid as gifts?\nReferences\nRonald Schusterman, J. A.

Commerson\u2019s Dolphin \u2013 In aquariums, people often misidentify this species as a baby killer whale. This is because the species has black and white colored skin. Adults reach just five feet in length on average.\nHabitat of the Dolphin\nThese marine mammals occupy a wide range of different habitat types. Some live in freshwater habitats, but most live in saltwater. They live in coastal seas, open ocean, rivers, river deltas, lakes, estuaries, bays, and much more. You can also find some saltwater species in brackish water habitats where freshwater and saltwater mix.\nDistribution of the Dolphin\nThe various species each have their own unique ranges and distribution. Some have cosmopolitan distribution and live in oceans virtually across the globe. Others live only in tiny regions, and you cannot find them anywhere else in the world.\nAs a whole, this group lives across every ocean on Earth, as well as many rivers, estuaries, and even lakes.\nDiet of the Dolphin\nAll members of this group have carnivorous feeding habits. The vast majority hunt for fish, squid, and other aquatic prey. A handful of larger species hunt for other marine mammals, including seals, sea lions, whales, and smaller toothed whales.\nSome species eat just about anything they can catch, and have opportunistic feeding habits. Others specialize on certain types of prey. For example, some killer whales follow the salmon runs as their primary diet.\nUnique Hunting Strategies\nMany members of this group utilize their intelligence to access prey they otherwise could not easily catch. Some use bubble netting, where the members of the pod blow bubbles around a school of fish to confuse and bunch them together to easily catch them. Others drive aquatic prey up onto the shore so that they can easily catch it and wiggle their way back into deeper waters.\nDolphin and Human Interaction\nHumans interact with a number of different species in this group. Zoos and aquariums house several different species, the Bottlenose Dolphin being the most common species. They feed the animals a variety of different fish, including herring, capelin, smelt, salmon, and more.\nTrainers teach these intelligent animals a number of different behaviors to help mentally stimulate them. They also teach them behaviors that help the trainers care for them, known as husbandry behaviors. Some husbandry behaviors include allowing the veterinarians to take blood, do ultrasounds, insert feeding tubes, and more.\nSadly, humans often cause damage to wild members of this group. Pollution and habitat destruction both threaten wild species, and overfishing depletes the available prey for these predators. Additionally, people in certain regions hunt some species in this family, and fisheries that do not target them sometimes accidentally trap cetaceans in their nets.\nDomestication\nHumans have not domesticated these marine mammals in any way.\nDoes the Dolphin Make a Good Pet\nNo, these animals do not make good pets. You must have a slew of different permits to house these animals.\nDolphin Care\nAs social animals, these marine mammals must live in groups, even when in human care. For this reason, zoos and aquariums must provide ample space and deep pools for them to swim in freely. Additionally, facilities have multiple connected habitats so that they can separate animals if needed and allow them to have space.\nAs most species have primarily piscivorous diets, zoos and aquariums typically feed them fish. Their diet includes a variety of different fish, such as herring, capelin, salmon, smelt, and squid.\nBehavior of the Dolphin\nDifferent species have different behaviors. Most have complex social behavior, and live in groups known as pods. Some pods contain just a handful of animals, while other pods contain hundreds or more. In some species, smaller pods come together at certain times of year or around a prolific food source. Pods often work together to capture prey.\nReproduction of the Dolphin\nBreeding habits and reproductive rates vary based on the species at hand. However, as mammals, all species give live birth. The females develop the young in their uterus, and after birth they feed their young milk. The gestation period varies from species to species. Nearly all species give birth to a single offspring, known as a calf.\nBeliefs, Superstitions, and Phobias About the Dolphin\nPeople have used these creatures in a wide variety of different religions and cultures to represent a variety of different stories and symbols. Many stories and myths include the marine mammals aiding humans, particularly sailors who find themselves in trouble. The different stories and myths vary based on the species, the region, and the culture or religion."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Amazon River Dolphin (Pink Dolphin) images!\nThe Amazon pink river dolphin is the biggest and smartest animal of the freshwater dolphin species.\nDiscover why this elusive dolphins species turns a pink coloring and much more below!\nThe Amazon river dolphin (also known as the pink dolphin and botos) is a freshwater animal. It lives in the Amazon and the Orinoco rivers as well as in waterways located in Bolivia, Columbia and Peru. The river dolphin is smaller than other types of saltwater dolphins, and the species has excellent hearing. These dolphins must live in warm, shallow water areas because they have very little blubber. River dolphins suffer in captivity with few aquariums able to keep them alive.\nAmazon river dolphins also generally become more pink as they age, which has led to the species becoming known as the \u2018pink dolphin.\u2019\n5 Incredible Amazon Pink River Dolphin Facts\n\u2022 Also known as the pink dolphin: There are many competing theories on why the Amazon river dolphin tends to become more pink as it ages that you can discover below!\n\u2022 The largest species of river dolphin: River dolphins also live in China and across the Indian subcontinent, but the Amazon river dolphin is the largest species. Males are 50% larger than females and can weigh more than 450 pounds.\n\u2022 Not one, but three species?: Scientists are currently divided on whether the Amazon river dolphin is actually one, two, or three different species. To see more about this ongoing debate, read our \u2018species\u2019 section below!\n\u2022 Different bodies than ocean dolphins: Unlike ocean dwelling dolphins, river dolphins have a hump instead of a dorsal fin.\n\u2022 Upside down swimmers: Amazon river dolphins will frequently swim upside down. Its believed the humps on their back rub across the river\u2019s floor and help them locate prey.\nAmazon River Dolphin Scientific Name\nThe Amazon river dolphin is also called a boto or the pink river dolphin, and its scientific name is Inia Geoffrensis.\nThe animal\u2019s common name comes from where it often makes its home and its skin color. The name boto is the one used by the natives. It is also a popular character in South American mythology. In legends, the animals have amazing musical skills and are seductive. They also love parties. Some myths claim that the dolphins can shapeshift into human form and have magical abilities.\nOther freshwater dolphin types are the Yangtze river dolphin, and the South Asian river dolphin. Freshwater dolphins belong to the Mammalia class. There are four river dolphin families, which include the Iniidae, Pontoporiidae, Lipotidae and Platanistoidea.\nAmazon River Dolphin Species\nThere is considerable debate within the scientific community as to whether the Amazon river dolphin is actually one, two, or potentially even three different species.\nIn 2014, scientists in Brazil published research in journal Plot One that river dolphins in the Araguaia river were a unique species, the Araguaian river dolphin. Also, there has been considerable debate whether river dolphins living in Bolivia are a unique species.\nAs of 2020, the IUCN recognizes three subspecies: the Amazon river dolphin, the Bolivian river dolphin, and the Orinoco river dolphin.\nAmazon River Dolphin Appearance and Behavior\nThe pink river dolphin features that distinctive dolphin smile. They have rounded foreheads and long, slender beaks.\nWhile other river dolphin species \u2014 such as the Ganges river dolphin \u2014 have dimorphism where females are larger than males, the opposite is true in Amazon river dolphins. Males can grow to be about 50% larger than females and weigh in excess of 400 pounds (180 kg).\nThe animal has conical-shaped teeth that they use to catch small fish and other prey. The river dolphin features a long nose that can measure up to 23 inches long, and this is about four times longer than the nose of ocean dolphins. The river dolphin has a two-chambered stomach, and they breath by emitting air through a blowhole.\nThe animals swim with great precision. Because river dolphins are extremely flexible, they can maneuver around rocks, tree trunks and other objects. They also have the ability to swim forward using one flipper while the other flipper paddles backward. This swimming method lets them make tight turns. River dolphins also like to swim upside down.\nRiver dolphins have exceptionally large brains, and while dolphins are known for swimming in groups, river dolphins tend to spend more time alone or among small groups of two to four dolphins. You might see a bigger group of them in areas that are rich with food, but it\u2019s less common with river dolphins.\nThe Amazon river dolphin doesn\u2019t have a dorsal fin. Instead, it sports a modified hump. The animal makes its way through rivers and flooded areas using strong flippers and a tail fluke. Compared to oceanic dolphins, river dolphins swim slowly. Their top speed is around 35 miles per hour. The reason for this is that their neck vertebrae are not fused. This gives them more flexibility, but it means that they can\u2019t swim as fast. River dolphins are able to turn their heads without shifting their bodies.\nLike their ocean cousins, pink river dolphins are friendly and curious. They interact with humans frequently. River dolphins have unique ear adaptions to help them survive in their watery environment. Dolphins hear sound from their throats instead of from their outer ear to their inner ear. The animal\u2019s ear is also acoustically separated from its head. Separating these two body parts are sinus pockets. The combination gives the animal enhanced directional hearing under the water. Dolphins use an organ called a melon to emit high frequency clicks. This allows them to produce bio sonar. They use it to orient themselves.\nDolphins are reliant on echolocation. The animal species uses echolocation so well that a river dolphin could survive even if it were blind. Echolocation lets the animal determine the size and shape of any surrounding item or object. River dolphins have small eyes, and they are unable to see well. Also, their eyes are on the sides of their heads. This means that their vision features two separate views instead of the forward view that people see.\nResearchers believe that some types of river dolphins are blind while others just have extremely poor eyesight. A number of the animals are killed because they inadvertently come into contact with nets and fishing boats.\nPink Dolphin: Why Amazon River Dolphins Are Also Known as the \u2018Pink Dolphin\u2019\nOne of the defining features of Amazon river dolphins is they often turn pink. Scientists are still researching the reasons for this unique coloration, but a few theories stand out.\nFighting: While not aggressive with humans, Amazon pink river dolphins will often fight one another and leave significant amounts of scar tissue. It\u2019s hypothesized this scar tissue turns pink, and is a reason why older males tend to have the most distinctive pink coloration.\nCamouflage: Amazon pink river dolphins live in rivers along the Amazon rain forrest which are often inundated with incredible amounts of rain. This high level of rainfall causes the muddy bottoms of rivers to turn a red/pink hue. Amazon pink river dolphins may have simply evolved to better blend in with their surroundings.\nIt\u2019s important to note that most Amazon river dolphins are born a more gray, and males tend to become more pink as they age. In addition, this pink coloration normally covers parts of their body while areas of grey remain. It\u2019s hypothesized that males with more pink coloration are better able to attract mates.\nIvan Sgualdini/Shutterstock.com\nAmazon River Dolphin Habitat\nAmazon pink river dolphins live in freshwater areas including lakes, enormous rivers and small tributaries. As the Amazon is fed by large stretches of rain forrest, every year it floods its banks for extended periods of time. During this period, Amazon pink river dolphins will expand across the vast inland seas that are created in floodplains.\nYou\u2019ll find them in Bolivia, Columbia, Ecuador, Brazil, Venezuela and Peru. The Amazon pink river dolphin also lives in the Amazon and Orinoco riverways and in the Araguaia River.\nAmazon River Dolphin Diet\nAmazon river dolphins have teeth that are similar to the molar teeth that humans have. Like people, the animals use their teeth to break up food before swallowing it. River dolphins aren\u2019t picky about what they eat. The mammals will dine on turtles, shrimp, crabs and more than 40 different species of fish including piranhas.\nAmazon River Dolphin Predators and Threats\nAnimals that prey on the river dolphin include large snakes, jaguars and caimans. However, once the species has passed adolescence they have few natural predators.\nHuman development and farming have had a major impact on the habitats of the river dolphin. These activities have impacted the ecology of the waterways. Human fishing is also threatening the species. Overfishing is a problem because it decreases the animal\u2019s food supply. The dolphins also get caught in the nets.\nPollution is another threat to the Amazon river dolphin. Small gold mining operations cause mercury pollution, and this makes its way to dolphins through the food chain. River dolphins eat a lot of catfish, which dwell on the bottom of waterways where mercury generally accumulates.\nAmazon river dolphins are endangered. The Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources has taken steps to protect the dolphin species. They\u2019ve made it illegal for fishermen to kill the dolphins. The\nAmazon River Dolphin Reproduction, Babies and Lifespan\nIn South America, spring is the rainy season. During this time, acres and acres of rainforest floods, turning into an enormous tree-covered sea. The water becomes deep enough for the river dolphins to swim amongst the trees. Mating season occurs when the water recedes, and the male and female dolphins are constricted to the river channels. The dolphin species is polygamous, meaning males mate with several females each year. However, females don\u2019t mate every year. They mate every two to three years.\nFemale river dolphins are more attracted to males that are a brighter shade of pink. To impress the females, male river dolphins smack the water with bunches of grasses or branches in their mouths. Sometimes, they hold up a turtle to capture the attention of a female. When a female river dolphin becomes pregnant, she\u2019ll carry the calf for 11 to 15 months. The animal species gives birth to just one calf. After a baby dolphin is born, it will nurse for over a year. Baby dolphins are often around 30 inches long, and they weigh around 22 pounds. Adult female dolphins usually have their calves from July to September. Once they\u2019re born, babies remain close to their mothers for protection.\nSexual maturity is based on the dolphin\u2019s size. When a female reaches 5.5 feet in length, she becomes sexually mature. Males reach the stage once they\u2019re 7 feet long. In the wild, river dolphins live for an average of 12 to 18 years, but they can live for as long as 30 years.\nAmazon River Dolphin Population\nThe estimated river dolphin population is difficult to estimate because the dolphins live in remote, muddy waters, and lack a distinctive dorsal fin that makes spotting them easier. However, river dolphins are under threat.\nFor instance, the Araguaian river dolphin population is from 600 to 1,500 animals.\nView all 122 animals that start with A"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "10 Most Awesome Facts About Dolphins", "url": "https://www.themost10.com/facts-about-dolphins/", "text": "There are so many cute animals around that it is hard to choose a favourite one. From koalas to puppies and pandas, there are some really amazing species to learn more about. Surely one of the most endearing though has to be dolphins. These loveable marine creatures are not only very warm and friendly but also pretty safe to be around. While you might know a little bit about these animals, there are a lot of dolphin facts you might not have heard about before. Here are the ten most awesome to take onboard.\n10 \u2013 Dolphins Can Be Found All Over The World\nWhile you might assume that these cute marine animals are found in places like the Caribbean, the fact is that they are at home in most oceans around the planet. In all, there are 36 species of dolphins and they can live not only in oceans but also freshwater lakes and coastal estuaries too. They can also survive in temperatures which go from around 0 degrees up to more than 30 degrees. Scotland for example has the most northerly pod of bottlenose dolphins in the world in its chilly seas.\n09 \u2013 Underwater Noise Pollution Is A Threat\nYou might think that Dolphins are well protected from noise pollution by being underwater. This is not true though as noise pollution can still be something that affects them. Pollution from boats, oil & gas industries and underwater building can all cause these animals distress. Too much underwater noise also hampers their ability to communicate with each other, navigate the world\u2019s waterways and hunt for food.\n08 \u2013 They Can Be Fast\nWhen you see animals in water, it can sometimes be hard to gauge exactly how quickly they move. Sharks for example look big and cumbersome but can actually travel really fast. This is also true of dolphins. Bottlenose dolphins for example can get up to speeds of 30mph over short distances. This makes them fast sprinters and helps them to not only catch prey but also outrun predators. It also means they can keep up with boats when swimming alongside them.\n07 \u2013 They Have A Cool Way of Eating Fish\nOne of the main things which dolphins will eat in their daily life is fish. They do not eat it the same as we do though! Dolphins have a clever trick which is actually a self-defence mechanism too. They will swallow fish headfirst so that any spines do not catch in their throat. This naturally means that they reduce the chances of the spines sticking in their throats, causing injury or blockages.\n06 \u2013 Blowing Bubbles Is A Thing With Them\nWhile they may look cute, dolphins are actually very good hunters of food. One very clever tactic they use is to blow bubbles to herd their prey up the surface. This then makes it easier for the dolphins to catch more fish due to them being herded together. Dolphins will also use a technique called \u2018fish-whacking\u2019 to hunt. This sees the dolphin hit the fish with their tail to knock them out. Once stunned, the fish is then much easier to catch for the dolphin.\n05 \u2013 Their Language is Very Sophisticated\nWe have already noted that dolphins love to communicate with one another. But did you know that they have a complex language of sounds to achieve this? In fact, scientists think that these animals have some of the most elaborate acoustic senses in the whole animal kingdom. Sounds dolphins make to chat to one another include whistles, clicks, squeaks and squawks.\n04 \u2013 Dolphins Are Very Intelligent\nDid you know that a bottlenose dolphin can recognise its own reflection in a mirror? This makes them one of the only species (next to humans and apes) who can do this. This alone confirms they have a decent level of intelligence. To add further to this view, dolphins are one of the few animals who use tools. They have been observed placing sea sponges over their beaks while foraging on the seabed, to protect them from sharp rocks.\n03 \u2013 They Sometimes Only Use Half Their Brain\nThis sounds like it would not be possible but it really is true. Observers have found that dolphins can sleep but keep one half of their brain active at the same time. It has also been found that they can sleep with one eye open too. This is believed to allow them to watch out for predators whilst resting and make sure their pod is safe from attack.\n02 \u2013 Fishing Equipment Is Their Enemy\nAs well as noise pollution, dolphins face real threat from fishing gear. Every year, many are killed accidently by getting tangled in driftnets, long lines or via hook & line gear. This is especially prevalent in the waters around the UK where they can often get caught up in fishing equipment. Much research is now being done on using fishing kit which is more sustainable and does not pose a threat to dolphins.\n01 \u2013 Their Skin Is Very Delicate\nYou might not know this but dolphins have very delicate skin. Even the slightest touch on a hard surface can rip or tear their skin. Don\u2019t worry though! Dolphins heal very quickly which means that any injuries to their skin soon get better. This is true for even the deepest of cuts or abrasions. This excellent healing ability is very useful for them in the wild and helps them to survive.\nWe all know that dolphins are very cute and friendly animals. Anyone who has swam with them or seen them racing along in the ocean knows that. The ten facts above though are a little more obscure and might not be ones you knew before. Finding out more about the animal kingdom is always worthwhile and helps us understand the species we share the planet with a little better."}

Each dolphin has a special whistle that it creates soon after it is born. This whistle is used for identification, just like a human\u2019s name. Dolphins also produce high frequency clicks, which act as a sonar system called echolocation (ek-oh-low-KAY-shun). When the clicking sounds hit an object in the water, like a fish or rock, they bounce off and come back to the dolphin as echoes. Echolocation tells the dolphins the shape, size, speed, distance, and location of the object.\nBottlenose dolphins have a sharp sense of hearing.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "17 Fin-tastic Facts About Blue Dolphin Cichlids For Kids", "url": "https://kidadl.com/animal-facts/blue-dolphin-cichlid-facts", "text": "Blue Dolphin Cichlid Interesting Facts\nWhat type of animal is a blue dolphin cichlid?\nA Cyrtocara moorii, also known as hump head, is a medium-sized cichlid fish of the family Cichlidae.\nWhat class of animal does a blue dolphin cichlid belong to?\nA Cyrtocara moorii belongs to the class of Actinopterygii.\nHow many blue dolphin cichlids are there in the world?\nThe exact number of this fish species in the world is unknown, but they are prevalent in Lake Malawi in Africa.\nWhere does a blue dolphin cichlid live?\nA Cyrtocara moorii lives in areas with sandy substrates of Lake Malawi of East Africa.\nWhat is a blue dolphin cichlid's habitat?\nThe blue dolphin cichlid's preferred habitat is a place with sandy substrates across the coastal areas, depth ranging from 10-49 ft (3-14 m).\nWho does Blue dolphin cichlid live with?\nA Malawi blue dolphin can cohabitate with large species of the same cichlid tribe, such as Fossorochromis rostratus and Taeniolethrinops laticeps. This medium-sized African cichlid fish takes advantage of sharing space with large cichlids by snacking on the morsels rooted out by the larger ones.\nHow long does a blue dolphin cichlid live?\nA Malawi dolphin lives for nearly ten years.\nHow do they reproduce?\nMalawi blue dolphins are sexually mature at three, and hereafter they breed regularly. Like most fish species, cichlids reproduce by spawning. Male cichlids, which are usually brighter blue than females, display deep, brighter colors to attract females. Males decide the breeding place, usually a flat rock or stone, or sometimes dig a pit in which the females lay their eggs. Then, the male fertilizes the eggs.\nFemale Malawi blue dolphins, being mouth breeders, scoop up the eggs into their mouths for incubation. The brood remains in their mouths for another one to three weeks, even after hatching. Young females can breed 15-25 fry while the older ones can produce up to 80 fries. After hatching, the fry enjoys free swimming, and they feed on brine shrimp.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nAs per IUCN red list, the conservation status of blue dolphin African cichlid is Vulnerable.\nBlue Dolphin Cichlid Fun Facts\nWhat does blue dolphin cichlid look like?\nA Malawi blue dolphin is moderate size fish with a sturdy, wide-body, and tapered snout. Their snout looks similar to a dolphin, so Malawi blue dolphins and blue dolphin cichlid are the other names given to them. Cichlids are a full blue color, and depending on their origin, they have a different amount of black marks on their back and fins. Male cichlids are brighter in color than females. The deep color of males is the only feature to differentiate from females, but it may not be accurate in all cases.\nMales and females, as they grow, develop a lump on their forehead, which is also called cranial or nuchal hump. In reference to this nuchal hump, cichlids are commonly called hump-heads. Like some saltwater fish, they also have a set of pharyngeal teeth in their throat along with their regular ones. To help with the predators, they have spiny rays behind their pelvic, pectoral, dorsal, and anal fins. These fins have soft front parts perfect for effortless swimming. They have a set of nostrils, one on each side, using which it smells the water by sucking water inside and expelling after some time. Some other freshwater fish also share the same feature.\nHow cute are they?\nThey are good-sized and good-looking fishes to add to your aquarium, the bright blue color adds beauty to the space. In addition, their dolphin-like snout and cranial hump make them exceptionally unique.\nHow do they communicate?\nMale cichlids turn brighter than usual to communicate with females to invite them for mating. These cichlids express their intolerance by being aggressive towards tank mates. The females become aggressive at the time of breeding and spawning.\nHow big is a blue dolphin cichlid?\nA hump-head mouthbrooder is nearly 7.9 in (20 cm) long. The blue dolphin cichlid max size can be 10 in (25 cm). Malawi blue dolphins are three times smaller than Boulengerochromis microlepis, the world's largest cichlids.\nHow fast can a blue dolphin cichlid swim?\nThe exact velocity of their swimming is not measured, but they are pretty good swimmers. The soft front part of their fins helps them with easy movement in the water. They swim at the bottom and middle level in an aquarium, and they require more open space for swimming.\nHow much does a blue dolphin cichlid weigh?\nThere is no concise information available on the weight of the blue dolphin cichlid. However, the maximum weighing cichlid was recorded at 10 lb (4.5 kg).\nWhat are their male and female names of the species?\nThis species does not have any particular name for males and females and, in general, are called a female cichlid and a male cichlid.\nWhat would you call a baby blue dolphin cichlid?\nA baby of this species has no particular name, but baby fish in general are called fry.\nWhat do they eat?\nCichlids are carnivorous and prey on benthic invertebrates. Therefore, they must be given various foods when kept in aquariums like tablet foods, flake foods, live or frozen food. High protein food like brine shrimp, blood worms, and pieces of prawns and earthworms can keep them healthy. High-quality pellets can also supplement their regular diet. It is advisable to give three to five small portions than one large meal to maintain its health.\nAre they poisonous?\nCichlids are not poisonous and can make good tank mates to similar-sized cichlids. They neither bite nor are dangerous but may sometimes behave in a semi-aggressive way.\nWould they make a good pet?\nAfrican cichlids are always an excellent addition to improve aquarium beauty and can be made a good pet. This is one of the more peaceful cichlids. However, one needs to take proper care for them to thrive long in our fish tank. Many parameters like lighting, temperature, and hardness of water are needed to be maintained in aquariums.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nThere are specific care instructions to keep these fish happy and healthy pets. This peaceful fish can be handled by a person who is not much experienced in cichlids. They need a good-sized fish tank appropriate for them, regular water changes, and suitable tank mates.\nThese fish are native to Lake Malawi, so we have to make sure that tank parameters like temperature, hardness, ph, have to match Lake Malawi's water. The temperature should range from 73-82 F, pH should be between 7.2-8.8, and hardness is 1o -18d GH. Water movement and lighting should be moderate. They need an aquarium with a minimum capacity of 75 gallons, and the tank has to be at least five feet long. They can go well in either freshwater or brackish freshwater, but with regular filtration. Bad quality water can spoil their eyes. A sand substrate would make a perfect base for the aquarium as these fish love digging and hiding in the sand. Sand used for saltwater fish can improve the pH of water, and maintaining pH above neutral is very important. However, higher ph means more ammonia which means more harmful water. So regular water changes in the aquarium are a must for cichlids. Sand used for freshwater fish can also be used. Crushed coral or aragonite sand can also be used as the aquarium base, as they dissolve more quickly than salts and maintain the required hardness and ph.\nDid you know...\nAmong all cichlids, the rarest one is the Cichlasoma beani, which is the most desirable among fish keepers but very difficult to procure.\nThere is a need to provide some rock or woodworks as caves so they can hide. But, you should not clutter the aquarium with more rock works as open space is very important. As these fish tend to dig the substrate, plants and rock showpieces have to touch the bottom of the aquarium and not on the substrate. Though it is not a community fish, it can be kept along with other similar species like Frontosa and some catfish like Synodontis catfish.\nLike other fish species, Cyrtocara moorii are also prone to some diseases, and the itch is one of them. The itch can be healed in the early stages by increasing temperature to 86F by gradually increasing one degree per hour for three days.\nAre blue dolphin cichlids aggressive?\nYes, cichlids are not community fish and are semi-aggressive with their tank buddies, especially during breeding time.\nDo humans eat them?\nHumans do not eat cichlids, and they are very much sought-after fish in aquarium trading. In addition, many fishkeepers desire to pet them in their aquarium.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly animal facts for everyone to discover!

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "15 Fin-tastic Facts About The Bottlenose Dolphins For Kids", "url": "https://kidadl.com/animal-facts/bottlenose-dolphins-facts", "text": "Bottlenose Dolphins Interesting Facts\nWhat type of animals are bottlenose dolphins?\nA bottlenose dolphin or common bottlenose dolphin is a mammal. It is not a fish, as thought by many. They are warm-blooded marine mammals, which make use of their gills for breathing. This species was previously known as bottlenose dolphins, but later the name was changed to common bottlenose dolphins (even at times called Atlantic bottlenose dolphins).\nWhat class of animals do bottlenose dolphins belong to?\nThe bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) belongs to the family of Delphinidae. This species comes under the class of Mammalia under the Animalia kingdom.\nHow many bottlenose dolphins are there in the world?\nThe overall population of bottlenose dolphins is still unknown. At present, the population estimation of common bottlenose dolphins is around 600,000. The population of its other subspecies, the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins is also countless, indicating that the overall population of these marine mammals is stable.\nThe population count of common bottlenose dolphin species is done by a special technique of chromosome banding. This study also helps in the identification of relationships within a group of dolphins.\nWhere do bottlenose dolphins live?\nA bottlenose dolphin is a marine mammal, which occupies ocean waters. The common bottlenose dolphins or Tursiops truncates are mostly found in the tropical oceans and the temperate oceans. They are also found in the sub-tropical oceans, scattered throughout the world. They prefer ocean surface temperature that varies between 50\u00b0F and 90\u00b0F, which is similar to the range of 10\u00b0C and 32\u00b0C.\nBottlenose dolphins can be seen in the waters all over the world. This mammal, which is often confused for a fish, occupies the waters of the Pacific Ocean. They stretch from the Australian coasts to Japan, and also from the coasts of Chile to southern parts of California. They occupy the Pacific waters as far as the Hawaiian islands. During the hotter months, common bottlenose dolphins can also be observed near Monterey in the north.\nThe presence of bottlenose dolphins can be found in the Atlantic waters too. From Patagonia to Nova Scotia, the population of common bottlenose dolphin species is high. They can also be seen in South African, up to Norway. The maximum population of this species of marine mammals can be found along the coasts of the United States of America. They are abundant in the Gulf of Mexico. A bottlenose dolphin can also be seen in the Black Sea, and the Mediterranean sea.\nThe variety of bottlenose dolphins found in the Indian Ocean goes by the name of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin.\nWhat is a bottlenose dolphin's habitat?\nThe most common habitat of a bottlenose dolphin or a common bottlenose dolphin is the coastal regions. Bottlenose dolphins are found in warmer waters of the lagoons and bays. Bottlenose dolphins have been observed to adapt themselves to a large variety of marine habitats. They are also found in the shallow water, in and around harbors, estuaries. Some species of bottlenose dolphins can also be seen in the cool, deep open sea waters.\nTheir choice of habitat is mostly influenced by factors such as the depth of the ocean water, the abundance of food, water temperature, sediment type, and so on. These bottlenose dolphins also undergo seasonal migrations. The type of bottlenose dolphin species that occupy the coastal areas of the United States of America is often found migrating. Their migration destinations range between North Carolina or New Jersey.\nWho do bottlenose dolphins live with?\nBottlenose dolphins have been observed to be traveling alone. But there are instances when they travel in groups too. These groups consist of 12 or so members. On extremely rare occasions, groups of even 100 bottlenose dolphin species traveling together have been seen.\nHow long do bottlenose dolphins live?\nThe average life span of a bottlenose dolphin or common bottlenose dolphin is 40 years. In many instances, the female bottlenose dolphins have outlived the males. In these instances, the bottlenose dolphin's lifespan has been found to be more than 60 years.\nHow do they reproduce?\nBottlenose dolphins are marine mammal species. They are often confused with fish. These mammals reach maturity to reproduce between 5-14 years old. Like most other mammals, the females mature earlier than the males. The females attain maturity at the age of 5-10 years. But the males attain maturity around 8-13 years. There are instances when some common bottlenose dolphins have been found to be actively reproducing throughout their lifetime. This is very rare among mammals.\nTheir process of reproduction is very similar to other mammals. They reproduce through the process of internal fertilization. Common bottlenose dolphins have a polygamous mating system. Their breeding system usually begins in spring, but they can reproduce throughout the year. After three to five years, a female bottlenose dolphin is seen to be ready to reproduce. The gestation period of this species is approximately a year. At a time, the females give birth to a single baby.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nAccording to the IUCN Red List, the bottlenose dolphins are categorized as of Least Concern. This tag indicates that the population of common bottlenose dolphin species is quite sufficient. The majority of this population is observed in the eastern coastal regions of North America. Although these mammals, which are often confused with fish species have a stable population, yet there are a few threats that loom over them. These threats include marine pollution by the oil spills, which causes several diseases among the bottlenose dolphins. Alterations in the water quality are another threat to which these mammals are subjected.\nBottlenose Dolphins Fun Facts\nWhat do bottlenose dolphins look like?\nThis mammal is the most common type of dolphin that be seen in the waters around the world. Their mouths are curved, which gives the illusion that there is a smile on their face. The top portion of the body of a common bottlenose dolphin is either bluish-gray, or it can be dark gray. Their underside is usually white, but can also be pale gray. Behind the dorsal fin, the color often turns black.\nThe dorsal fin and the flukes of the tail are made up of connective tissues. These areas do not have any muscle or bones. Their lower jaw is elongated much like the upper one and together they form the snout. The snout (also called the rostrum) is the main reason behind their names. They have a blowhole on their head which is the real nose.\nHow cute are they?\nThe bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncates) is a very cute mammal. Often mistaken for being a fish, these dolphins are very smart. They have elongated jaws and a curved mouth, which gives an illusion of a smiling face.\nHow do they communicate?\nBottlenose dolphins maintain their communication through various types of body language, whistles, and sounds. Among types of body language, there is slapping their tail, butting heads, jaw snapping, and so on. Bottlenose dolphins use vocalizations (including whistles and sounds) to make other dolphins alert or to keep a count of the other members. Scientists believe that these mammals make various sounds to maintain their social life.\nThese mammals produce high-frequency sounds, which is their key form of communication. The tonal sounds of a whistle are one of their most melodious tones. These tones allow common bottlenose dolphins to stay in touch with their members. These tones also help them to coordinate their hunting strategies.\nHow big are bottlenose dolphins?\nThe average length of these mammals ranges between 78.7-157.5 in (200-400 cm). The males of this species are larger than their female counterparts. The length of the males varies from 98.4-137.8 in (250-350 cm). This makes them at least six to seven times larger than queen angelfish.\nHow fast can bottlenose dolphins move?\nA bottlenose dolphin is a marine mammal, which has an average speed of 3-7 mph (4.8-11.3 kph). Many a time these mammals can take higher bursts of about 18-22 mph (29-35.4 kph). They can maintain such a high speed for only a short interval.\nHow much do bottlenose dolphins weigh?\nThe average weight of bottlenose dolphins ranges from 330.7-1433 lb (150-650 kg). This makes them at least four times heavier than an albacore tuna or longfin tuna.\nWhat are the male and female names of the species?\nMuch like the other dolphin species, there are separate names for males and females of this species. A male bottlenose dolphin is called a bull. and a female is called a cow.\nWhat would you call a baby bottlenose dolphin?\nThe common name for baby bottlenose dolphins is calves.\nWhat do they eat?\nThe diet of bottlenose dolphins is made up primarily of various kinds of fish. They have a variety of prey, that includes fish, crustaceans like crabs or shrimps. Their diet also includes squids. Bottlenose dolphins travel in groups to search for their food. They focus on bringing together several fishes. This process is called herding. Then by turns, they charge through the group to feed themselves. Many times they trap the schools of fish against any object, like sandbars. Although they have teeth, yet they do not chew their food. They grip the fish using their teeth and swallow them entirely.\nAre they dangerous?\nNo, bottlenose dolphins are not at all dangerous. They are very friendly mammals, and one of the smartest species.\nWould they make a good pet?\nThey might not make very good pets. Although they are very clever and extremely smart creatures, there have been instances when these mammals have turned very aggressive towards humans.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nDid you know...\nNational Geographic has noted some very unique and interesting facts about bottlenose dolphins. One of such features explains that these dolphins are great swimmers. They have abilities to glide through the water using their special dorsal fin. This fin is curved, which gives them an advantage.\nAccording to National Geographic, these dolphins can dive into very deep waters (as deep as 273.4 yd or 250 m under the water surface). Bottlenose dolphins have special mechanisms for traveling sounds. The sounds travel to their inner ear via their lower jaw. National Geographic also points out that these dolphins are exceptionally good acrobats!\nAnother unique fact about these dolphins is the count of their teeth. They have conical teeth, approximately 80-100 in number. This dolphin enjoys its sea life and has a very good breath-holding capacity. Holding its breath for more than five minutes is not very difficult for this smart mammal.\nOne of the fun facts about bottlenose dolphins is that they are very curious creatures. They are curious about the ocean divers. There are instances when these dolphins have even rescued the divers who got injured. Coexisting with humans is one thing that these dolphins have mastered. These dolphins are extremely capable of social interaction. They are on the list of the smartest living creatures and can solve complex problems with ease. Numerous researches are going on to inquire about the intelligence of these dolphins.\nWhat is special about bottlenose dolphins?\nThere are numerous special things about bottlenose dolphins. To begin with, a bottlenose dolphin (scientific name Tursiops truncates) is a super swimmer. These mammals which are found in ocean water all around the world, have special sensing capabilities called echolocation. They use this technique to search for their food and any object in the water. This technique helps these dolphins to understand the shape, size, speed, distance, or location of the object. The clicking sounds hit various objects in the ocean, and return to the dolphin as echoes. When the sounds hit back to the dolphin, it understands its speed, distance, and location of its prey. The bottlenose dolphins can guide their ways in the ocean following the echoes.\nThe bottlenose dolphin's sounds\nA common bottlenose dolphin lacks a vocal cord. They have special air sacs close to their blowholes, through which they produce various sounds. Each sound made by a bottlenose dolphin is unique. These vocalizations help them to maintain their social life and also to keep a track of the members of their group. A very melodious sound produced by a bottlenose dolphin is the tonal whistle. This type of tonal whistle is mostly used by the off-springs to communicate with their mothers. The hunting strategies are also conveyed by tonal whistles.\nThe burst-pulsed vocal sounds are a bit more complex. They vary distinctively from whistles. When these dolphins are extremely excited, they tend to avoid any kind of physical aggression by these types of sounds. These instances include food search expeditions, or if more than one dolphin is fighting for a single food. The various whistles produced by bottlenose dolphins are quite similar to grunts, moans, squeaks, trills, and so on. All these sounds are unique in their frequency, volume, and even pattern.\nThe identification of a bottlenose dolphin can be done through its signature whistle. These whistles are so unique that scientists can easily distinguish one dolphin from the other by taking a look at the sonogram shapes. These mammals make such sounds to communicate their emotional state when they want to reach out to other individuals. They cooperate with these special sounds.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly animal facts for everyone to discover!

This is because PAH levels are higher when compared to industrialized countries, contaminating the marine flora and fauna.\nDolphins such as Australian humpback dolphins and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins can be found in Australia.\nThese dolphins may face threats from over-fishing, causing them to face issues with diminishing food supplies due to human competition. Lower food resources would require these dolphins to decisively deal with competition for food resources or migrate away.\nShark nets laid near the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is one of the threats for the decline in their population, as these dolphins get tangled in these nets and lose their life.\nDolphins cannot survive underwater for a long period as they are marine mammals. They must frequently come to the surface to get fresh air before another dive.\nDolphins are the only mammals that give birth to their calves' tails first instead of their head. A dolphin\u2019s skin is extremely frail and can easily damage its dorsal fin when making contact with reefs and rocks in the coastal waters.\nWhat is unique about the Australian snubfin dolphin?\nAustralian snubfin dolphins have a small and triangular dorsal fin located on the far back of their bodies which is why they got their name, snubfin. This species has smaller tails which help in identifying them individually. Their tails are visible when they are about to dive and when they stick their tails out of the waters. This species of dolphins do not have beaks like other dolphin species.\nIs the Australian snubfin dolphin endangered?\nNo, this dolphin species is not yet Endangered. They are listed as a Vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List. With only less than 10,000 individuals found in their natural habitat from the coast of Papua New Guinea to Queensland, Australia, these dolphins have seen a drastic decline in their population. The major reason for the decline in their population is accidentally getting caught in the shark nets which helps to minimize the threat of shark attacks in the Shark Control Program in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly animal facts for everyone to discover!

These dolphins are considered to be very acrobatic, and often leap out of the water. They are also known for their playful nature, and often interact with human swimmers. Dusky dolphins are currently listed as \u201cleast concern\u201d by the IUCN, but there is some concern about their future due to bycatch and coastal development.\nDusky Dolphin Description\nThe Dusky Dolphin is a small to medium-sized dolphin found in off-shore waters of the Southern Hemisphere. Adults range in length from 1.6 to 2.4 m and weigh between 80 and 235 kg. The Dusky Dolphin is dark grey or blue-grey above and white below, with a pale grey band running along its sides. The flippers are relatively long and pointed, and the dorsal fin is tall and falcate. Dusky Dolphins are highly sociable animals, living in groups of up to several thousand individuals. They are often seen swimming close to the surface, engaging in leaping and acrobatic behavior. Dusky Dolphins are known to eat a variety of small fish, squid and crustaceans. They are also one of the few species of dolphin known to engage in cooperative hunting with other dolphins, as well as with humans. Dusky Dolphins are found in coastal waters off Argentina, Chile, Peru, URUGUAY and South Africa. Although they have been hunted for their oil and meat in the past, they are now protected from commercial exploitation by law. However, they continue to be killed as bycatch in commercial fisheries, and their populations are believed to be declining.\nDusky Dolphin Habitat\nDusky dolphins are found in temperate and tropical waters off the coast of Chile, Peru, New Zealand, and Australia. They prefer to live in deep waters near the continental shelf, where they can find plenty of food. Dusky dolphins are very social creatures, living in groups of up to 1,000 individuals. Within these groups, there is a strict hierarchy, with each dolphin having a clearly defined role. Dusky dolphins are very active creatures, spending most of their time swimming and chasing prey. When they\u2019re not hunting, they can often be seen riding the waves near the shore. Dusky dolphins are an essential part of the marine ecosystem and play a vital role in keeping the ocean healthy.\nDusky Dolphin Diet\nDusky dolphins are carnivores, feeding primarily on small fish and squid. They have been known to eat up to 28% of their body weight in a single day. Dusky dolphins are pack hunters, working together to corral their prey into tight groups before taking turns darting into the middle to snatch a meal. This cooperative hunting strategy enables them to take down much larger prey than they could alone. Dusky dolphins have also been known to eat the occasional crustacean or octopus. While their diet is relatively consistent throughout the year, they may altered what they eat depending on the season and availability of certain prey.\nDusky Dolphin Size\nDusty Dolphins are one of the small cetacean species, with males reaching a maximum size of 2.4 m and females 2.6 m. Dusty Dolphins are fast swimmers and very acrobatic, frequently leaping out of the water and somersaulting. Dusty Dolphins are found in warm waters throughout the world, including in the Mediterranean Sea, off the coast of Africa and in the waters around South America. They are also known to inhabit areas of high human activity, such as around fisheries. Dusty Dolphin populations appear to be healthy and stable at present. However, they are known to be at risk from bycatch in fishing nets and pollution from plastic waste in the oceans. Dusty Dolphins are a protected species under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).\nDusky Dolphin Lifespan\nDusty Dolphins live in small pods of around 10-20 individuals, and they are known to be very social creatures. Dusty Dolphins have a lifespan of around 20 years. However, little is known about their life history or ecology due to their remote habitat and the difficulties of conducting research in such an environment. Nevertheless, Dusty Dolphins are an intriguing species, and further study may help us to better understand these fascinating creatures.\nDusky Dolphin Behavior\nDusky dolphins are social creatures that often form large pods of up to 1,000 individuals. They are known for their acrobatic displays, which include breaching, spy-hopping, and tail-slapping. Dusky dolphins are also very vocal, producing a variety of clicks and whistles. These sounds are used for communication and echolocation. Dusky dolphins have a well-developed sense of touch, and they frequently engage in tactile interactions such as rubbing and petting.\nDusky Dolphin Speed\nDusky Dolphins are one of the fastest dolphins, often reaching speeds over 30 miles per hour. They are known for their high-energy acrobatics, which they use to herd fish into tight groups before hunting them. Dusky Dolphins are also highly social creatures, living in large pods that can number in the hundreds or even thousands. The dolphins communicate with each other using a variety of sounds, clicks, and whistles, and they are thought to have one of the most sophisticated dolphin languages. Dusky Dolphins are found in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and they are a popular species for dolphin-watching tours.\nDusky Dolphin Hunting\nDusky dolphins are a type of dolphin that is found in the waters off the coast of Chile. They are a small dolphin, with a dark grey body and a white belly. Dusky dolphins are very social animals, and they often travel in large groups. They are also very playful, and they are known for their acrobatic leaps out of the water. Dusky dolphins are hunted by humans for their meat and oil. The hunting of dusky dolphins is thought to be one of the main reasons for the decline in their populations. In recent years, there has been an effort to reduce the hunting of dusky dolphins, and to protect their populations.\nConclusion\nDusky dolphins are a species of dolphin that can be found in the waters near New Zealand. They are an interesting species because they exhibit two different types of behavior- one where they cooperate with other dolphins to catch prey, and another where they work alone to catch prey. This dichotomy has been observed in other species of animals as well, and scientists continue to study why this occurs. What do you think could be the reason for this difference in behavior?"}

They have developed echolocation to hunt and feed. They are very playful and friendly.\nDolphins are friendly mammals known for their friendliness. There are more than 40 dolphin species.\nDolphin Facts for Kids\nThey are very intelligent compared to other animals.\nThe dolphin is a carnivore (a meat-eater).\nBottlenose dolphins are the most common species of dolphins.\nTo breathe, dolphins use a blowhole on their heads.\nDolphins communicate with one another by clicking and whistling.\nThey locate prey and objects in the ocean by echolocating.\nA baby dolphin is called a calf\nA male dolphin can live for 40 years, while a female dolphin can live for 60 years.\nTypes of Dolphins\nOrcinus Orca\nYou likely know the Orcinus Orca from its more commonly used name, the killer whale. Often referred to simply as \u201corca,\u201d the killer whale is the largest dolphin species. It has mostly black skin on top with white highlights and mostly white underneath.\nFully grown adults generally measure between 23 and 32 feet in length and weigh up to 6 tons. That makes it just slightly smaller than your school bus. The orca lives between 50 and 80 years and mostly hunts, roams colder waterways and coastal areas near the poles. They are seen at the Equator and in other warm waters, too.\nThe orca is a massive animal and expert predator and a carnivore that truly is capable of hunting and killing a whale while working in a pack. Its skin coloring helps the orca to ambush prey from above and below.\nThe killer whales generally travel and hunt in groups of between five and 30 and use their own unique communications via audible sounds.\nAmazon River Dolphin\nAs its name implies, the Amazon River is this dolphin\u2019s home. It grows to be up to 8 feet long, weighs up to 450 pounds, and lives about 30 years. It is a carnivore with a distinctively bulbous head and lengthy bottlenose that enables the dolphin to reach prey hiding beneath fallen trees and other submerged obstacles.\nIts greyish skin color helps it to blend into the surroundings to avoid predators and ambush prey.\nFacts for Kids x To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Facts for Kids\nThey are most active during the annual spring rainy season in South America, which swells the Amazon River and its tributaries. The rising waters form an inland sea that enables them to range over a much wider area and capture more prey.\nThe inland seas generally exist for about six months before ebbing back into the more traditional watercourses of the Amazon River system.\nCommon Bottlenose Dolphin\nThe Common Bottlenose Dolphin is the most commonly occurring dolphin sub-species and is the one most people commonly think of and recognize on television and in films.\nThey measure between 6 and 13 feet in length, weighs between 300 and 1,400 pounds, and lives between 40 and 60 years. It has a modestly protruding bottlenose that gives it its distinctive facial features with large round eyes and a slim and sleek profile along its grayish body.\nThey roam waters along with the New England, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and West Coast coastal waters. It also is found among many Pacific islands and enjoys a relatively wide and warm range.\nIt is among the most-known and most-studied of the dolphin sub-species. They often are the stars of aquatic shows at amusement parks, which raises questions regarding the quality of life they might have while in captivity.\nStriped Dolphin\nThe Striped Dolphin is very similar in size and shape to the common bottlenose but features a distinctive dark stripe of color along its sides. Males generally weigh up to 350 pounds measure up to 9 feet in length.\nFemales generally weigh up to 330 pounds and measure up to 8 feet in length. Both sexes live for up to 58 years and generally roam the coastal waters along with New England, the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, West Coast, and Pacific Islands.\nThey are carnivore that lives and roams in tight groups, often numbering between 25 and 100. Between 40 and 50 pairs of small, conical, and very sharp teeth enable it to catch and tear into prey.\nThey are extremely athletic and sometimes are seen leaping 20 feet or higher above the water\u2019s surface. They are especially noted for their twisting motion while leaping through the air, known as roto-tailing.\nIrrawaddy Dolphin\nThe Irrawaddy Dolphin looks very much like a small beluga whale but with a dorsal fin. They have a rounded face instead of a protruding bottlenose and is noted for their expressive face and ability to spit small spouts of water from their mouth and up into the air as a way of socializing.\nThey often roams in small packs of six or fewer, likely due to the smaller freshwater habitat. They sometimes gather in packs of 25 or so, though.\nMales measure about 9 feet in length and weigh up to about 290 pounds. Females measure up to 8 feet in length and generally weigh a little less than their male counterparts.\nThe freshwater dolphins have a consistently gray color throughout and generally live in rivers and coastal waters along with Southeast Asia. The gray color helps them to blend into the darker river waters while hunting for food.\nSpinner Dolphin\nThe Spinner Dolphin resembles the striped dolphin, but with a short stripe running from its eyes to the front flippers. It is lightly colored underneath and with an alternating light- and dark-gray on top.\nMales generally are slightly larger than females, with adults measuring between 4 feet and 7 feet in length and weighing between 130 and 170 pounds.\nThey typically live about 20 years and roams the waters in Alaska, New England, the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and West Coast, as well as Pacific Islands.\nSightings most often occur in the Pacific Islands region while the exceptionally athletic mammals leap out of the water while roto-tailing. The resulting spinning motion gives them their well-deserved name.\nSpinners are carnivores that usually feed on squid, shrimp, and small fish during nighttime hours. They use the nightly migrations of smaller species to ambush them at depths ranging from about 650 feet to 1,000 feet beneath the surface.\nSouth Asian River Dolphin\nThe South Asian River Dolphin is a freshwater river located mostly in southern Asian river systems. It has a long bottlenose and generally lives and hunts alone, although it sometimes is seen in small packs. They measure up to 9 feet in length, with females, generally being larger than males. They wight up to 190 pounds and live for up to 26 years.\nA pair of very tiny eyes and a thick membrane covering them render them virtually blind. While near-blindness is a distinct disadvantage in most locales, it helps to protect the eye sockets against the muddy waters encountered in its river environment.\nLarge, relatively slow-moving river systems like the Ganges River in China carry a lot of silt and mud that make it virtually impossible to see beneath the water. The lack of visibility levels the playing field and enables them to hunt and feed effectively.\nShort-Beaked Common Dolphin\nThe Short-Beaked Common Dolphin has an appropriately short bottlenose that gives it its very descriptive name. Adults typically weigh about 170 pounds and measure about 6 feet in length.\nThey feature a unique hourglass coloring created by a dark layer on top that narrows beneath the dorsal fin to create an hourglass shape. They live for up to 40 years and mostly roam waters in the New England, Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, West Coast, and Pacific Islands areas.\nThey are highly social and travels in packs that can include dozens of dolphins. The species ranks among the most populous in the U.S. and around the globe and so closely resembles its cousin, the long-beaked common dolphin, that biologists once mistakenly thought they were the same species.\nThey generally travel in packs that can include hundreds and often spin and somersault while leaping through the air.\nMaui Dolphin\nThe Maui Dolphin is the world\u2019s most endangered species with less than 100 estimated to be living off the western coast of New Zealand\u2019s North Island. The dolphin is a slightly larger subspecies of Hector\u2019s dolphin.\nAn adult generally weighs up to 145 pounds and measures just over 5 feet in length.\nThey have a uniquely rounded dorsal fin that helps it to move into shallow waters more readily without exposing its dorsal fin and location to predators. Its body generally is gray in color on top with lighter coloring underneath.\nThey live for up to 20 years and produce offspring about two to four years.\nThey are carnivore and hunt in small packs and generally shares the same space as commercial fisheries. The effects of commercial gill-netting and other impacts greatly depleted the Maui Dolphin\u2019s numbers to such an extent that its range has diminished to a very small locale.\nRisso\u2019s Dolphin\nRisso\u2019s dolphin is among the largest dolphin species. Adults measure between 8 feet and 13 feet in length and weigh between 660 and 1,100 pounds and live for about 35 years.\nThey do not have a bottlenose and instead have a non-descript mouth and a generally rounded head. Their bulbous heads form a crease in front that gives them a flattened profile and likely helps to stun prey.\nThey can dive as deep as 1,000 feet or more and stay submerged for up to 30 minutes on a single breath of air.\nRisso\u2019s generally have dark-gray bodies with light coloring underneath so that they can blend into their surroundings better and ambush prey. They sometimes roam alone but usually are in groups of 10 to 30, including other species of dolphins and whales.\nSome of the more extended travel groups can number into hundreds and including whales. They live for about 35 years.\nHector\u2019s Dolphin\nHector\u2019s dolphin has a uniquely shaped head that forms more of a point and roams the coastal waters of New Zealand. It is a close relative of the Maui Dolphin and ranks among the smaller species.\nAdults grow up to 110 pounds and measure up to 5 feet in length, which makes it one of the smallest species.\nThey have a rounded and dark dorsal fin that sets it apart from all other species on the New Zealand coastal waters other than its slightly larger cousin, the Maui Dolphin.\nThey have a tri-color skin that is mostly light gray with the dark gray dorsal fin and dark streaks from the nose to its flippers. A lighter streak beneath helps it to stay hidden from prey located beneath it.\nFun Facts about Dolphins"}

They are remarkable creatures that have developed a form of sonar called echolocation to hunt and prey. They are very friendly and playful. Below are some interesting facts about dolphins.\nDolphins are marine mammals that are closely related to whales and porpoises.\nDolphins are part of the family of toothed whales that includes orcas and pilot whales. They are mammals and breathe through a blowhole on the top of their head.\nThey vary in size from 4 feet (1.2 meters) and 90 pounds (40 kilograms) for Maui\u2019s Dolphin and up to 30 feet (9.5 meters) and 10 tons for Orca or Killer Whale.\nThere are almost forty species of dolphin, and they are found worldwide, mostly in the shallow waters along the continental shelves. Five species live in the river.\nDolphins are carnivores, mostly eating fish and squid. Dolphins live in social groups of five to several hundred. They use echolocation to find prey and often hunt together by surrounding a school of fish, trapping them and taking turns swimming through the school and catching fish.\nDolphins will also follow seabirds, other whales and fishing boats to feed on the fish the birds scare to the surface or discard.\nDolphins are considered to be amongst the most intelligent of animals. They are friendly and extremely playful. They are also easy to train. These qualities have made them a favorite of many people.\nScientists believe that dolphins conserve energy by swimming alongside ships, a practice known as bow-riding.\nDolphin vary in color, but they are generally gray with darker backs than the rest of their bodies.\nMost dolphin species have a long lifespan. It is estimated that some may have lived for more than 100 years.\nDolphins mate throughout the year. Gestation lasts from 9 to 17 months depending on the species. They usually have only one baby. When it is time to give birth, the female will distance herself from the pod, often going near the surface of the water. As soon as the calf is born, the mother must quickly take it to the surface so it can take its first breath. The calf will nurse from 11 months to 2 years, and after it is done nursing it will still stay with its mother until it is between 3 and 8 years old.\nDolphins are at risk because the oceans are being polluted. They are also losing their habitats and many countries still allow dolphins to be hunted. Fishing nets also pose a problem for the dolphin population as does the increase in boating traffic.\nDolphin Worksheets\nThis bundle contains 11 ready-to-use Dolphin Worksheets that are perfect for students who want to learn more about Dolphins which are highly intelligent marine mammals that live in water but breathe through a blowhole on the top of their head.

They can grow as long as 9.1 ft (2.8 m)!\nHow fast can a Rough-Toothed Dolphin move?\nThis species, Rough Toothed dolphins, have a top speed of 14.9 mph (24 kmph), making them slower than other species of dolphins. This dolphin species swims with its body close to the surface of the water. These marine mammals are highly gregarious and intermix with the bottlenose dolphins, pantropical spotted dolphins, Fraser\u2019s dolphins, spinner dolphins, and short-finned pilot whales to swim in groups.\nHow much does a Rough-Toothed Dolphin weigh?\nThe Rough-Toothed dolphins weigh in the range of 198-341 lb (90-155 kg).\nWhat are their male and female names of the species?\nThe male Rough-toothed dolphins are called bull whereas the female Rough-Toothed dolphins are called cow.\nWhat would you call a baby Rough-Toothed Dolphin?\nA baby of the Rough-Toothed dolphin species is referred to as a calf.\nWhat do they eat?\nThese dolphins inhabit warm ocean waters like the Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and the Atlantic Ocean as fish are abundant in these waters. Their diet mainly comprises silverside, needlefish, mahimahi, squid, and saury. Their major predators include sharks and killer whales.\nAre they poisonous?\nNo, these marine animals aren't poisonous at all. They pose no significant threat to humans.\nWould they make a good pet?\nThere are no known instances of these marine animals being kept as pets. However, in captivity, these dolphins adapt their behavior quite well. They are wild animals, and they are better off in the sea.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nDid you know...\nWhen a dolphin of their species has suffered an injury, a fellow dolphin of this species will help it inhale air by supporting it at the surface of the water.\nAre Rough-Toothed Dolphins endangered?\nNo, these dolphins are not endangered yet.\nRough-Toothed Dolphin vs Bottlenose Dolphin\nThe Rough-toothed dolphins have a narrow upper jaw as compared to the bottlenose dolphins. The bottlenose dolphins have a flat and wide jaw. The Rough-Toothed dolphins have a long ridge at the underside of the socket of the eye which isn't present in that of the bottlenose dolphin.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly animal facts for everyone to discover!

On average the males measure 3.8m (12.5ft) long compared to 3.7m (12.1ft) long for females with an average weight of 650kg (1433lbs).\nThey are the largest of the beaked dolphin species. Animals found in colder regions tend to be larger in size.\nTwo forms are often recognized the nearshore and offshore. Those individuals considered nearshore are often smaller and lighter in color.\nDiet\nThe bottlenose dolphin is a carnivore. Their diet is mostly focused on fish but cephalopods, crustaceans, small rays and sharks are also consumed.\nFish are swallowed head first to ensure the spines do not catch in their throat.\nTo find food they will emit pulses of sound from their forehead. These may also serve to stun prey and help make them easier to catch.\nThey can not chew their food. Most is swallowed whole but some is torn in to smaller chunks. Another method to break up food is to shake it in the air and strike it with their tail.\nCommon bottlenose dolphins have been observed to strand prey and then strand themselves to catch it.\nEach day a dolphin will eat as much as 5% of its body weight in food. This may amount to as much as 14.5kg (32lbs) of food.\nIn areas where dolphins live alongside humans they may follow fisherman's boats to catch prey or bait which is discarded."}

Incredible Irrawaddy Dolphin Facts - Kidadl", "url": "https://kidadl.com/animal-facts/irrawaddy-dolphin-facts", "text": "Irrawaddy Dolphin Interesting Facts\nWhat type of animal is an Irrawaddy dolphin?\nIrrawaddy Dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris) belong to the euryhaline species of oceanic dolphins. They are shy aquatic mammals with a charismatic streamlined body and small dorsal fins. They are not whale dolphins, however, they look similar to baby belugas whales and the snubfin dolphins of Australia.\nWhat class of animal does an Irrawaddy dolphin belong to?\nThe Irrawaddy Dolphins belong to the class of aquatic mammals or aquatic Mammalia.\nHow many Irrawaddy dolphins are there in the world?\nThe populations of Irrawaddy Dolphins are decreasing at an alarming rate and currently, there are less than 7,500 dolphins in the world. The Chilka Lake is believed to have around 146 of them.\nWhere does an Irrawaddy dolphin live?\nIrrawaddy Dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris) live in oceans and in freshwater bodies.\nWhat is an Irrawaddy dolphin's habitat?\nIrrawaddy dolphins belong to the parts of South and Southeast Asia. They can be located in freshwater bodies like rivers, lakes, and estuaries. The freshwater populations of Irrawaddy dolphins live close to the coastal areas of the Bay of Bengal, New Guinea, and Lao Pdr. They like to slow swim while observing the surroundings around them. Also, they live in the water bodies like the brackish water of Chillika lake in India and Songkhla lake of Thailand. The Irrawaddy dolphin habitat is constantly threatened due to climate change and overfishing.\nWho do Irrawaddy dolphins live with?\nIrrawaddy Dolphins live in patches of four to five dolphins. They like to stay in sheltered river deltas close to human civilization where fishermen live. They help them to catch fishes by driving large schools of fishes towards their gill nets and then tap the sides of their boats. Sometimes, groups of as large as 15 members and as low as two members have been found. The Irrawaddy dolphin habitat does not change i.e. they prefer to remain in the same location like a mangrove forest with an established social circle.\nHow long does an Irrawaddy dolphin live?\nIrrawaddy Dolphins have a lifespan of approximately 30 years. However, the oldest living Irrawaddy Dolphin lived for 28 years. They generally live in brackish waters such as the Mangrove forest of Bangladesh.\nHow do they reproduce?\nThe Irrawaddy Dolphin reproduces in the age span of three to nine years. They give birth to one calf every couple of years. It is observed that mating happens between December to June and the birth period lies between June to August. These dolphins are found to mate outside of their own groups. It is believed that the male of the species endeavors to impress the female and often mates with multiple females. The gestation period is nine months. However, in the case of captive dolphin, it was found to last as long as 14 months.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nThe IUCN currently classifies Irrawaddy dolphins as 50% Vulnerable and 50% Endangered. As they live close to coastal areas, they do not have natural aquatic predators such as male sharks. However, threatened by human activity, they protect themselves by virtue of their social bonds. They use their social circle to hit or agitate predators and drive them away. The hunchback helps them to hit any predator who comes too close. The low reproduction rate and human activities are the main threat to the declining status. They also suffered greatly during various wars and fishing expeditions carried out during the 1970s. As most dolphins live in river mouths that are populated by humans, they are greatly affected by waste and chemicals released into the sea.\nCurrently, they have acquired endangered status and there are many organizations that monitor the water levels in their habitat zones. Overfishing has caused a decrease in the number of crustaceans and smaller fishes which are the primary food source for Irrawaddy dolphins. There is a danger of extinction and dolphin conservation is a must need to save them. You can help in the conservation of Irrawaddy dolphins by 'adopting' one symbolically via a conservation society like the WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature). Here, you pay a certain amount for the organization to look into the upkeep of the animal. Another way is by looking into the conservation commissions of your own country. Some countries like Cambodia have set up a Dolphin Commission with protection rager officers to take care of the animals. Dolphins in the Mahakam River in Indonesia are also protected by conservation laws. If Irrawaddy dolphins are found to be extinct then it could disrupt the natural ecosystem of the ocean and result in an abundance of their prey (mollusks and fishes).\nIrrawaddy Dolphins Fun Facts\nWhat do Irrawaddy dolphins look like?\nThe Irrawaddy dolphins are instantly recognizable by their rounded head. They have a plain gray to grayish-blue color with a lighter underbelly. Irrawaddy dolphins look quite similar to Beluga whales, but the two are not related.\nHow cute are they?\nBecause of their rounded heads and small fins, these dolphins look extremely cute and friendly! Their curved lips give them a perpetually smiling expression with beady and expressive eyes crowning their head. They have an acrobatic and streamlined body and cut smoothly through the water. They are notorious, cheeky, and sometimes even called mysterious by the photographers trying to capture images of them.\nHow do they communicate?\nThe Irrawaddy dolphins communicate via echolocation. These sounds range in a frequency of around 60 kHz and cannot be picked up by a human ear. Different dolphins use different vocal pitches which others can use to distinguish individuals. Apart from this, they also bump into each other and flip their tails as indications. During the mating seasons, males may also bump against each other's heads as a form of aggressive behavior to signify territory. They may gently graze against each other's fins to show affection. They do not use any vocal signals. Their preferred communication language consists of buzzes, clicks, whistles, and creaks. Whistles are useful in communicating with other dolphin species. To hear the signals, Irrawaddy dolphins have a sound conducting tissue located in their jaw. They do not have external ears or auditory canals. A well-known sight is of these dolphins leaping out of the water to indicate joy or simply looking out for predators.\nHow big is an Irrawaddy dolphin?\nThe Irrawaddy dolphin length can range from 5ft 9 in - 9ft 1 in.\nHow fast can an Irrawaddy dolphin swim?\nMahakam river dolphins can swim at a speed ranging between 20-25 mph when feeling threatened or chased by a predator. However, for other times they are slow swimmers that occasionally leap out of water.\nHow much does an Irrawaddy dolphin weigh?\nThe Orcaella brevirostris (Irrawaddy Dolphin) can weigh in between 198-400 lb (90-200 kg).\nWhat are their male and female names of the species?\nThe name of male and female species of Mekong river Irrawaddy dolphins are Orceaella brevirostris and Orceaella heinsohni respectively.\nWhat would you call a baby Irrawaddy dolphin?\nThe female Irrawaddy dolphins undergo a gestation period of about 14 months and give birth to their young ones called calves.\nWhat do they eat?\nThe coastal Irrawaddy dolphin diet consists mainly of carnivore foods like cephalopods, fish, crustaceans, and fish eggs. They live in a pack of 6-15 Irrawaddy dolphins and spit water to attract small fishes. They hit large animals with their rounded head to play before consuming their food. This species of wild dolphin living in coastal waters feed upon the remaining fishes that get stuck in the bottom of the seabeds while strangled in the fishing gear. The Irrawaddy dolphin habitats and prey are under threat due to global warming.\nAre they friendly?\nThe Irrawaddy dolphins, Orcaella brevirostris, of the Irrawaddy River (Myanmar) have a friendly nature. They help fishers herd fish by driving the fishes towards the gill net laid out for fishes in the water bodies.\nWould they make a good pet?\nIrrawaddy dolphins have charismatic and friendly nature. Therefore, they have become a vital source of eco-marine tourism in Asia and Southeast Asia. They have become a source of stable income for most of the communities involved in eco-tourism. The dolphins perform as the show stopper of many aquatic shows due to their high spirit and smiling faces. However, they are not meant to be pets. While they are portrayed as friendly animals, like any wild and predatory animals, Irrawaddy dolphins can be aggressive. They have been known, at times to attack humans.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nDid you know...\nThe Irrawaddy Dolphin can submerge their body into deep water for more than six minutes. However, they take time of about one to two minutes for diving. Contrary to popular belief, Irrawaddy dolphins spend most of their time underwater and very rarely come up to the surface. They are social creatures and enjoy living in small groups. They are also location-specific and do not follow any migratory routes.\nThe Irrawaddy Dolphin has been listed as the unique and only existing species of the Orcaella genus.\nThe Irrawaddy Dolphin population has become a vital point of discussion as to whether one would place them in the list of Monodontidae or in Delphinapteridae.\nThe Irrawaddy dolphins have 12-19 peg-like teeth on each side of the jaws - a unique and identifiable trait.\nThe Irrawaddy Dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) is worshipped by the groups of Khmer and Lao people. In Ancient China, they were worshipped as the Goddess of the Yangtze River.\nThe Irrawaddy Dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) was first described in 1866 by a specimen in the Vishakhapatnam Harbor (in the present-day east coast of Andhra Pradesh).\nHow much does an Irrawaddy dolphin weigh when born?\nThe Irrawaddy Dolphin newly born weighs approximately 22 lb (10 kg).\nHow do Irrawaddy dolphins hunt?\nThe Irrawaddy species of dolphins hunt in groups. These groups can have as low as five members or as many as 13 members. The Irrawaddy dolphin diet consists of smaller fishes and they herd them by spitting water at a distance of up to 5 ft. In this way, they can attract more fishes towards themselves. The Irrawaddy dolphin adaptations include a hunchback. They hit prey with their rounded hunchback before consuming them. Sometimes, this way of hitting with the hunchback is also considered as playing with their prey. Sometimes, it is seen that they herd fishes towards a fisherman's net as well. These 'tamed' Mekong River dolphins work together with the fishermen who then give a portion of the haul to the dolphins.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly animal facts for everyone to discover!

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Bottlenose Dolphin Facts and Information - SeaWorld", "url": "https://seaworld.org/animals/facts/mammals/bottlenose-dolphin/", "text": "Scientific Classification\nCommon Name bottlenose dolphin, Atlantic bottlenose dolphin, Pacific bottlenose dolphin, bottle-nosed dolphin Kingdom Animalia Phylum Chordata Class Mammalia Order Cetacea Suborder Odontoceti Family Delphinidae Genus Species Tursiops truncatus\nFast Facts\nDescription Bottlenose dolphins are light to dark gray over their dorsal surface, fading into a white or cream along their ventral region. They have a streamlined fusiform body shape. The source of their common name, bottlenose dolphins exhibit a pronounced anterior rostrum (often referred to as a beak), typically 7 to 8 cm (3 in.) in length. Said rostrum generally contains 72 to 104 conically-shaped, homogenous teeth, with tooth counts varying among individuals. Their dorsal fin is falcate.\nIt should be noted that two distinct ecotypes are recognized. The coastal ecotype typically exhibits smaller average body size with relatively larger flipper size. Comparatively, the offshore ecotype typically exhibit larger average body size and darker coloration, among other morphological distinctions. Size Coastal ecotype: average 2.5 to 2.7 m (8.2 to 8.9 ft.)\nOffshore ecotype: 3.7 m (12 ft.)\nAtlantic bottlenose dolphins as a whole are typically smaller than Pacific bottlenose dolphins; however, bottlenose dolphins frequenting cooler, temperate waters in either ocean tend to exhibit sizes indicative of the relatively larger offshore ecotype.\nCalves are approximately 111 to 116.3 cm (43.7 to 45.7 in.) long at birth.\nMale: Males may be slightly larger than females Weight Coastal ecotype: average 190 to 260 kg (419 to 573 lbs.)\nOffshore ecotype: average 454 kg (1,000 lbs.); maximum 650 kg (1,433 lbs.)\nNewborn calves weigh approximately 20 kg (44 lbs.)\nMale: Physically mature males tend to be more massive than physically mature females Diet Dolphins are active predators and eat a wide variety of fishes, squids, and crustaceans such as shrimps. The diet of coastal bottlenose dolphins is diverse and depends upon geographical location. Many dolphins eat only fish, although some also eat small numbers of cephalopods, crustaceans, small rays, and sharks. Gestation Approximately 12 months Estral Period Roughly 12 month anestrus followed by an approximate 12 month polyestrus consisting of at least 3 distinct cycles, all of which are typically focused in the late spring. There is little to no indication of senescence (menopause) in the female bottlenose dolphin. Successful births and rearing have been witnessed up through 48 years of age in the Sarasota dolphin population. Nursing Duration A calf may nurse for up to 18 to 24 months. The maximum nursing period observed was seven years in Sarasota Bay, Florida, and may serve as a bonding activity. Sexual Maturity Typically exhibited as a function of age-dependent body size\nMale: become sexually mature at about 10 to 13 years and 2.4 to 2.6 m (8 to 8.5 ft). In the wild, males in Sarasota Bay reach sexual maturity between the ages of 8 and 13 years.\nFemale: have been known to reach sexual maturity from 5 to 13 years old. In Florida waters, the average female is sexually mature at about 5 to 12 years and 2.2 to 2.3 m (7.2 to 7.6 ft). The average age at which bottlenose dolphin females in Sarasota Bay have their first offspring is 8 to 10 years. Life Span Survival rates have been increasing in marine mammal parks and aquariums, with the most recent study showing an annual survival rate of 0.97 (which means 97% of the population is expected to survive from one year to the next) for dolphins in U.S. facilities. This corresponds to a median life span of 22.8 years.\nSurvival rates reported for wild populations have varied widely, from .902 to .961, with median life spans between 8.3 and 17.4 years. These differences may be due to differences in study methodology (i.e., tracking a live population vs determining the age of dead animals that stranded), or may reflect true lifespan variations in different wild populations.\nThe oldest living U.S. dolphin in human care was born February 27, 1953, at Marineland of Florida (now the Dolphin Conservation Center at Marineland, St. Augustine, Florida). Nellie the dolphin passed away at Marineland on April 30, 2014. She was 61 years old.\nThe Sarasota Dolphin Research Program has studied dolphins in Sarasota Bay, Florida, since 1970 and is the longest running study of a wild dolphin population in the world. Based on this study, the oldest bottlenose dolphin is Nicklo, who was 67 years old when she was last sighted in 2017 in the Sarasota Bay population. Researchers extracted a tooth from her in 1984 to determine her age. Range Temperate and tropical marine waters worldwide; distribution is generally limited to surface water temperatures of 10\u00b0 to 32\u00b0C (50\u00b0 to 90\u00b0F).\nIn the Pacific, they are found from northern Japan to Australia and from southern California to Chile; In the Atlantic, they are found from Nova Scotia to Patagonia and from Norway to the tip of South Africa; In the Indian Ocean, they are found from Australia to South Africa.\nBottlenose dolphins are also found in the Mediterranean and Black Seas. Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins are found in the Indian Ocean from Indonesia to Australia to South Africa, the Red Sea and in the tropical and subtropical waters of the western Pacific. Habitat Bottlenose dolphins inhabit warm temperate waters, adapting to several marine and estuarine habitats, including, occasionally, rivers. Habitat use is influenced by environmental heterogeneity; meaning these animals distribute through an ecosystem depending on factors like resources, depth, water temperature, sea-bed gradient and type of sediment.\nPopulation Global: The worldwide population of common bottlenose dolphins is about 600,000. Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins are abundant, but the overall population is unknown. Status IUCN: Least Concern\nCITES: Appendix II\nUSFWS: Protected in U.S. waters by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972; not considered endangered or threatened\nFun Facts\nDolphins frequently ride the bow wake or the stern wake of boats. They have been seen jumping as high as 4.9 m (16 ft.) out of the water and landing on their backs or sides, in a behavior called a breach. Both young and old dolphins chase one another, carry objects around, toss seaweed to one another, and use objects to invite each other to interact. Such activity may be practice for catching food. Adults eat approximately 5% of their body weight per day. Bottlenose dolphins often cooperate when hunting and catching fish. In open waters, a dolphin pod sometimes encircles a large school of fish and herds them into a tight ball for easy feeding. Then the dolphins take turns charging through the school to feed. Occasionally dolphins will herd fish to shallow water where they are easy prey. Bottlenose dolphins generally do not need to dive very deeply to catch food. Depending on habitat, most bottlenose dolphins regularly dive to depths of 3 to 46 m (10 to 150 ft.). They are, however, capable of diving to some depth. Under experimental conditions, a trained dolphin dove 547 m (1,795 ft). In the past, bottlenose dolphin groups have been referred to as pods, social groups of unchanging composition. More recently, long-term studies of bottlenose dolphins have now shown that their group composition changes. Coastal bottlenose dolphins are primarily found in groups of 2 to 15 individuals. The associations of the animals are fluid, often repeated but not constant. Solitary coastal animals are observed in various regions of the world. The dolphin's sleek, fusiform body, together with its flippers, flukes, and dorsal fin, adapt this animal for ocean life. A dolphin's forelimbs are pectoral flippers. As it swims, a dolphin uses its pectoral flippers to steer and, with the help of the flukes, to stop. Bottlenose dolphins routinely swim at speeds of about 5 to 11 kph (3 to 7 mph). The maximum voluntary breath hold recorded for a coastal bottlenose dolphin was 7 minutes 15 seconds The maximum breath hold duration registered for a tagged off-shore bottlenose dolphin was 14 minutes. In the wild, group composition and structure are based largely on age, sex, reproductive condition, family relationships and association histories. Adults eat approximately 5% of their body weight per day. Bottlenose dolphins often cooperate when hunting and catching fish. In open waters, a dolphin group sometimes encircles a large school of fish and herds them into a tight, dense mass for easy feeding. The dolphins take turns charging through the school to feed while the others keep the fish from scattering. Occasionally dolphins herd fish to shallow water and trap them against a shore or sandbar. For more information about bottlenose dolphins, explore the Bottlenose Dolphin InfoBook.\nEcology and Conservation\nDolphins are important predators of fish, crustaceans, and other marine fauna. They have been hunted in many parts of the world for meat and other by-products made from dolphin parts (such as fertilizer, and machinery lubricants made from their jaw oil). Possessing a larger brain than a human's, dolphins show a high degree of certain types of intelligence, making them popular subjects for research in fields such as cetacean physiology, psychology, and sociology. Their capacity for learning has also made them ideal trained performers in oceanarium and zoological shows.\nUnder the Marine Mammal Act of 1972, the taking of dolphins requires a special permit. Bottlenose dolphin populations were drastically reduced around the turn of the last century due to commercial fishing operations. Today, fishing gear and nets can accidentally entangle, injure or drown dolphins. Dolphins, particularly coastal animals, are also affected by heavy boat traffic, habitat loss and pollution. Industrial and agricultural pollutants (including pesticides, herbicides and fire retardants) often enter coastal habitats through runoff, resulting in high levels of toxins both in the water and in dolphin tissues.\nNot only is it illegal, but it also may be dangerous to approach a wild dolphin. Marine parks like SeaWorld and Discovery Cove provide a safe environment for humans to interact with dolphins.\nBibliography\nByrum, Jody and Nuzzolo, Deborah. Bottlenose Dolphins. Third Edition.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "17 Facts about Dolphins - Ponce Inlet Watersports", "url": "https://ponceinletwatersports.com/facts-about-dolphins/", "text": "Dolphins are some of the most intriguing and popular creatures in nature today because they can be found all over the world doing their thing no matter where you go or what environment you\u2019re in! Marine dolphins are found in all oceans, from icy waters to warm ones. They live comfortably at temperatures that range between 0\u00b0 and 30\u00b0 degrees Celsius. Today we are going to cover the fun & exciting facts about Dolphins!\nHow many different species of Dolphins exist?\nThe dolphin is a creature that has captured the curiosity of humans for centuries. There are 49 species of dolphins in total.\nWhere do Dolphins live?\nDolphins are creatures of the sea, colonizing every inch from coast to deep waters. Some dolphins prefer a coastal lifestyle while others enjoy living in shallower water that is further out at sea but still close enough for quick access back and forth.\nDo Dolphins live in freshwater?\nRiver dolphins, such as the Amazon River dolphin (boto) and South Asian river dolphins live their lives only in fresh water rivers and lakes. They are sometimes known as \u201ctrue\u201d river monkeys because they can\u2019t cross over to saltwater oceans, but that doesn\u2019t mean these mammals don\u2019t have a lot of stories for us!\nSouth American freshwater species have always been fascinating subjects for scientists, who believe them to be an evolutionary link between marine animals like porpoises or whales\nThese river dolphins have a strange lifestyle. For example, the tucuxi or sotalia are among these freshwater populations of marine dolphin species that permanently live in freshwater rivers and streams like those found mostly northward to South America\u2019s Amazon River basin. The Guiana Dolphin lives mainly in coastal waters off northeast Brazil and Guyana while Irrawaddy Dolphins call estuaries near India home for some time every year during their annual migration from cold-water!\nDifferences between Dolphins and Porpoises?\nPorpoises are a smaller cousin to the dolphin. Porpoise teeth and dolphins are different, so if you need help telling them apart make sure you\u2019re looking at their mouth! When it comes to size, porpoises can be less than 8ft (2.5m) in length with chunkier bodies from head-to-fin when compared to dolphins who have slender builds where they get thinner as they move towards the tail fin which is usually more triangular or pointed on these creatures of watery wonderment.\nHow are Dolphins different from fish?\nDolphins are not your typical fish. There are a lot of differences between the two creatures, but one difference that nearly always stands out in people\u2019s minds is how they breathe. Fish extract oxygen from the water and don\u2019t need to surface; whereas dolphins have adapted over time into mammals that require air in order to survive \u2013 otherwise they would drown!\nWho is the biggest Dolphin?\nThe killer whale (orca) is the largest member of the dolphin family and can grow up to 9.8m, weigh 10,000kg and have a unique black dorsal fin that reaches 2 meters in height at maturity. Orcas are born with an average size of about 6ft 11in \u2013 8 ft 6in but they begin to bulk after birth as males reach maturing age between 12-20 years old while females take much more time before becoming sexually mature around 30+ years old.\nWhich species is the fastest Dolphin?\nDalls porpoises are very agile swimmers and can reach speeds of up to 35mph. They create unique rooster-tail-shaped waves while swimming, which has been used as a way to identify them at sea. Orcas also have the ability for high-speed movement but probably only Dall\u2019s Porpoise matches their agility when it comes to reaching such fast speeds from dolphin species in general.\nHow do Dolphins eat fish?\nDolphins have three stomachs, which act as a storage unit for swallowed food. The first chamber receives the food and is responsible for holding it until all of the other two chambers are ready to work on digesting it. The second compartment breaks down any large pieces that were not broken up by chewing or grinding in order to dissolve them. The third compartment is where they will be absorbed through the walls of the small intestine like nutrients.\nDolphin hunting methods\nDolphins generally do look for ways to make life easier and more efficient.\nOne way that they do this is by herding , a technique in which dolphins surround fish schools or other prey animals tightly as possible with their bodies at the water\u2019s surface until there\u2019s just one remaining bit of space left.\n, a technique in which dolphins surround fish schools or other prey animals tightly as possible with their bodies at the water\u2019s surface until there\u2019s just one remaining bit of space left. Corralling is a technique wherein dolphins herd animals to certain areas where they are easier for the hunter to catch.\nis a technique wherein dolphins herd animals to certain areas where they are easier for the hunter to catch. With their mesmerizing eyes and dexterous tail, dolphins are masters of stealth. They do use this skill to stun or confuse prey before they attack with a swift move from the side.\nor confuse prey before they attack with a swift move from the side. Eco-localization is a process that dolphins have developed in which they emit and reflect soundwaves, making them able to find food from long distances away.\nWhat types of food do Dolphins eat?\nDolphins are busy mammals who enjoy eating different types of fish depending on what is available. Mackerels and herring have a lot of fat, but squid do not so they must eat more quantities to fuel their hungry stomachs for the day ahead. Dolphins can be found in many oceans around the world because food availability varies from region to region!\nHow Long Can a Dolphin Hold It\u2019s Breath?\nDolphins are some of the most loved sea animals for their playful personalities and high level of intelligence. These mammals are frequently spotted jumping in Florida waters due to their need to come up for air. You may be wondering; exactly how long can a dolphin hold its breath? The answer might surprise you!\n\u201cBottlenose dolphins, for example, can stay underwater for around 8 to 10 minutes.\u201d\nDolphins enjoy communicating\nDolphins don\u2019t just use their sonar to find food; they also use it for communication. They have the astounding ability to use sound waves to create a variety of noises including clicks, whistles and moans.\nHow smart are Dolphins?\nBottlenose Dolphins, along with only a few other species of animals in the world have been documented using tools, are capable of recognizing themselves in mirrors, and can use their intelligence to solve problems. Dolphins also show characteristics such as emotionality, playfulness, and curiosity which sets them apart from most other animal species on earth.\nHow do Dolphins sleep?\nBottlenose Dolphins are the most intelligent of all aquatic mammals and take their sleeping habits one step further. The bottlenose dolphin sleeps with just half a brain at a time so that it can keep an eye out for its group as well as to watch out for predators like sharks!\nHow many teeth do Bottlenose Dolphins have?\nDolphins have 72-104 teeth. They only get one set of teeth for life! Dolphins do not use their teeth to chew, instead they catch their food and swallow it whole using a suction force that comes from the mouth lining sucking in water at high velocity; this is called \u201cinhaling.\u201d\nBiggest problems facing Dolphins?\nOne of the main threats to Bottlenose Dolphins is getting caught in fishing gear. Dolphins can become entangled or captured in commercial fishing gears such as gillnets, seines, trawls, trap pots and longlines.\n\u201cDolphins live all over the world but many populations around Asia-Pacific seem particularly threatened by increased catches.\u201d\nConclusions\nNow that you\u2019ve read up on the facts next time you see them hopefully you will feel a little more knowledgeable. Through education, research, and rescue, Dolphins can have a peaceful coexistence, cooperation, and communication between marine mammals, humans, and the environment we share with them!

In order to swim as efficiently as possible, a bottlenose dolphin's skin flakes and peels to have new skin cells replace old cells almost every two hours\u2014which is nine times faster than humans. This helps ensure a smooth body surface to increase the ease of their swimming under the sea.\n2 They can actually speak to one another.\nScientists have found that dolphins have a \"highly developed spoken language\" much like that of humans, making a combination of pulses, clicks, and whistles that allow them to communicate. One 2016 study, published in Physics and Mathematics, describes how the language \"exhibits all the design features present in the human spoken language, [which] indicates a high level of intelligence and consciousness in dolphins\u2026 [T]heir language can be ostensibly considered a highly developed spoken language.\"\n3 Dolphins have the longest memories of any animal.\nForget elephants\u2014dolphins are the animals with the longest-lasting memories. Research published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B in 2013 proved that bottlenose dolphins can remember the whistles of other dolphins that they lived with for two decades, even when they were separated from one another. While elephants and chimpanzees have both been found to have impressive recall, neither comes close to a 20-year period of memory.\n4 Dolphins recognize themselves in mirrors.\nUsually, when an animal looks into the mirror they either ignore what they see, or think the reflection is another animal and act aggressively. Not so with dolphins\u2014who can recognize that it is not another animal looking at them, but rather their own reflection. For a definitive 2001 study at the New York Aquarium, researchers installed mirrors in the tank of a pair of bottlenose dolphins, marking each dolphin with temporary ink\u2014which the dolphin then stared at in the mirror. \"Our findings show that self-recognition may be based on a different neurological substrate in dolphins,\" the researchers concluded.\n5 Dolphins listen with their jawbones.\nScientists believe that sound is carried from the water to the dolphins' inner ear by way of its lower jawbone. The jaw is hollow (unlike land-dwelling mammals) and contains a fatty substance that connects up to the ear. When a dolphin's lower jaw is covered, it has trouble distinguishing sounds, while covering its ears has no impact on its ability to hear.\n6 Dolphins are conscious breathers.\nHumans are unconscious breathers. We breathe in and out without realizing it, whether we're asleep or awake or just totally unaware. Dolphins, however, have to make an active decision about each and every breath. As Bruce Hecker, director of husbandry at the South Carolina Aquarium, told Scientific American, a dolphin must be fully aware that their blowhole is at the surface, and then deliberately make the choice to inhale.\n7 And they can inhale eight gallons of air in a single second.\nA study published in the Journal of Experimental Biology in 2015 analyzed the breathing patterns of dolphins. The researchers found that they could inhale eight gallons of air in a second and exhale 34 gallons per second\u2014three times faster than humans, allowing them to replace as much as 95 percent of the air in their lungs in a single breath.\n8 Dolphins' eyes move independently.\nWhile humans' eyes move in the same direction, coordinating with each other, dolphins have much more leeway\u2014with each eye located laterally on the sides of their heads and operating independently from one another. This means that they can get a far more expansive view of what's happening around and even behind them as they swim through predator-filled water. But that's not all\u2026\n9 They literally sleep with one eye open.\nAccording to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation, dolphins only rest half of their brain at any given time. For one period of sleep, they'll rest their left brain; then, they'll do the same with their right brain.\nThat means that part of their brain can still open the blowhole while it's above the water to take in air while the other part of the brain is sleeping. You can actually tell which part of a dolphin's brain is currently active since their opposite eye remains open, allowing it to swim straight and watch for predators.\n10 And they live on power naps.\nDolphins can't just conk out for the night and get a solid eight hours of peaceful sleep like we humans do\u2014they'd drown if they tried it. (See: that whole active breathing thing.) Instead, the Dolphin Research Center in Florida told Mental Floss they take power naps of 15 to 20 minutes throughout the day, allowing them to get rest without risking being under water for too long.\n11 Some can jump as high as 15 feet!\nDolphins can get some serious air. Researchers at the Wild Dolphin Foundation, for example, have reported seeing dolphins jump in the wild as high as 15 feet\u2014with the spinner, spotted, and Commerson's dolphins tending to be the highest jumpers. The reason for this behavior? It requires less energy to jump than swim, since the air is less dense than the water.\n12 The ancient Greeks called dolphins \"sacred fish.\"\nThe ancient Greeks were big fans of dolphins, calling them \"hieros ichthys,\" which translates to \"sacred fish.\" The animals played a role in some Greek myths (usually portrayed as benevolent creatures assisting the characters). They were believed to be especially friendly to mankind, and killing a dolphin was considered sacrilegious.\n13 And many philosophers incorporated dolphins in their writings.\nAncient thinkers such as Pliny, Herodotus, Aelian, and Aristotle commented on the moral nature of dolphins and their human-like traits. For example, Pliny told the story of a boy who, swimming across a lake, encountered a dolphin that took him on his back and \"carried the poor frightened fellow out into the deepest part; when immediately he turns back again to the shore, and lands him among his companions.\" And Aristotle reflected on, \"The voice of the dolphin in air is like that of the human in that they can pronounce vowels and combinations of vowels.\"\n14 They live in rivers, too.\nWe usually think of dolphins as being dwellers of the salty ocean, but there are seven species of dolphin that prefer the fresh water of the river\u2014including the Amazon river dolphin, the South American tucuxi, and the Irrawaddy dolphin (which can live in both salt and fresh water). Sadly, a number of these species are listed as endangered or vulnerable, such as the Ganges river dolphin, of which there are fewer than 2,000 left.ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb\n15 Baby dolphins are born tail first.\nTo prevent drowning, a baby dolphin is born with its tail first, and the mother swiftly breaks the umbilical cord by swimming away fast before doing a U-turn and rapidly escorting her newborn to the surface so it can take a breath. In other words, the new mom does not get a lot of time to rest after giving birth. (Incidentally, when a baby dolphin nurses, it has to hold its breath.)\n16 Dolphins are extremely maternal.\nSome animals get a bad rap for pushing their young out into the wild as soon as they're born\u2014but not dolphins. According to Shimi Kang, MD, author of The Dolphin Way: A Parent's Guide to Raising Healthy, Happy, and Motivated Kids\u2014Without Turning into a Tiger, we could actually learn something from the parenting skills of these sea creatures!\nAs King wrote for HuffPost, these creatures have both \"a balanced authoritative parent-child relationship and a balanced lifestyle, including what many of today's kids are missing\u2014play and exploration, a sense of community and contribution, and the basics of regular sleep, exercise, and rest.\"\n17 They love to play-fight.\nDolphins are friendly creatures, no doubt. But just like humans, they love to goof off with their friends. In 2014, researchers from the University of South Mississippi observed dolphins play-fighting as if they were children. And, according to their findings, this type of play actually helps dolphin calves practice and perfect their locomotor and social skills.\n18 Dolphins enjoy intimacy.\nOne of the few animals besides humans to enjoy intercourse are dolphins, Dara Orbach, a marine mammologist at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, told Science. They have been known to practice foreplay and numerous positions when copulating.\n19 And they can live as long as humans.\nFun fact: The orca whale is a species of dolphin, not a whale. Even more fun fact: While the average orca lives to about 50, it's not uncommon for them to get to 70 or 80 years old. The funnest fact? An orca named Granny lived until she was 105 years old!\n20 Every year, dolphin teeth grow a new layer.\nSpeaking of dolphin ages\u2026 these creatures grow a new layer of teeth every year, creating rings that tell you how old each dolphin is (not unlike a tree).

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Amazon River Dolphin (Boto) Facts - Animals", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/amazon-river-dolphin", "text": "Common Name : Amazon river dolphins Scientific Name : Inia geoffrensis Diet : Carnivore Size : Up to 8 feet long Weight : Up to 450 pounds Current Population Trend : Unknown\nEvery spring when the rains fall in South America, the Amazon River and its tributaries begin to spill their banks. Eventually, thousands of square miles of rainforest are flooded, creating a vast, tree-canopied sea.\nInto this seasonal sea, which remains for half the year, swims the Amazon river dolphin, or boto. Botos have the characteristic dolphin smile and, unlike their marine cousins, bulbous foreheads and long, skinny beaks. Most strikingly, males can be pink.\nThe coloring is believed to be scar tissue from rough games or fighting over conquests. The brighter the pink, the more attractive the males are to females\u2014at least during mating season, which takes place when the water has receded and males and females are confined to the river channel again.\nDuring the wet season, however, females venture far into the flooded forest, likely to escape the aggressive males. A unique adaptation lets botos swim easily between trees and through tangles of branches: unfused neck vertebrae, which allows them to bend at up to a 90-degree angle.\nIn addition, the boto\u2019s long snout comes in handy for rooting through river mud for crustaceans or darting among branches after small fish. Echolocation allows them to navigate and find prey in the dark, muddy water.\nBotos are the largest of the four river dolphin species, reaching up to eight feet long and 450 pounds. They have powerful flippers and tail flukes and a modified hump in place of a dorsal fin.\nMale botos sometimes beat the water with branches or grasses held in their mouth, or even hold live turtles aloft, in courtship displays aimed at impressing females. Females give birth to one calf after a pregnancy of 11 to 15 months. The young nurse for more than a year, staying close to their mothers.\nHumans are the only threat to Amazon river dolphins, hunting them for catfish bait or trapping them accidentally in gill nets. Traditional Amazonian belief holds that the boto is a magical being able to take the form of a human and come ashore\u2014with a hat to hide its telltale blowhole.\nPlease be respectful of copyright.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Are Dolphins Dangerous? 17 Facts That Prove They Are \u2014 Best Life", "url": "https://bestlifeonline.com/dangerous-dolphins/", "text": "Dolphins have an impressive reputation. Not only are they incredibly intelligent, but they also tend to interact with humans on a regular basis\u2060. But unfortunately, just because dolphins have a perpetual grin and an overall friendly demeanor doesn't mean they're safe.\nIn fact, these mysterious creatures have been responsible for more than a few vicious and fatal attacks. Want to know more? Read on for all the ways dolphins are a lot more dangerous than you thought.\n1 Dolphins bite.\nDolphins have sharp teeth that they usually use to rip apart their prey. Bottlenose dolphins, for example, have between 80 and 100 teeth that they use to grab, grip and secure their prey.\nHowever, the creatures can (and do!) bite humans on occasion. Because of the potential danger, officials at the Commerce Department's National Marine Fisheries Service have even released fliers with warnings that \"dozens of bites have been reported\" and \"people have been pulled underwater\" by the animals. In fact, as recently as 2012, an 8-year-old girl was infamously bitten by one of the animals at SeaWorld.\n2 And attack.\nDolphins do more than just bite their victims during an attack. When Valerie Ryan was attacked by a dolphin, the animal \"plowed into [her] with [its] snout. It was very powerful and painful, and the speed was amazing,\" she said. The incident left the woman with six spinal fractures, three broken ribs, and a damaged lung, as well as post-traumatic stress.\n3 They're always developing new ways to hunt and kill their prey.\nWhen dolphins are hungry, they turn into calculating predators who are capable of developing unusual methods to trap their prey. For instance, dolphins that live in the shallow waters of Florida have been observed using their tails to kick up mud in a circular formation in order to trap fish inside, while dolphins who live in Shark Bay, Australia, have been seen using sponges as tools to dig up prey from the seafloor.\nWhat's more, dolphins are able to communicate these tactics with other dolphins, which means they're always improving their skills. According to the Smithsonian, \"dolphins learn different tricks for catching food from one another in a kind of cultural transmission.\"\n4 They sometimes hunt in groups of 1,000 or more.\nAdd this to the list of terrifying sights we never want to see: Hundreds of dolphins hunting for food at the same time. According to the Smithsonian, bottlenose dolphins sometimes hunt in groups of more than 1,000 members, although they typically stick to pods of around 10 to 15 individuals, according to National Geographic.\n5 They frequently torture their food before eating it.\nOctopuses have a few deadly defense mechanisms at their disposal, which is why dolphins need to be careful when making these creatures into a meal. That's why dolphins \"beat up\" octopuses by viciously and relentlessly tossing them around in order to break them into smaller pieces before consuming them. Eek!\n6 They murder other animals just for fun.\nSure, it's a vicious world out there in the animal kingdom, but dolphins don't only kill other creatures to survive. Sometimes, they have mysteriously murderous motivations. According to the New York Times, dolphins \"are killing fellow mammals in droves, wielding their beaks as clubs and slashing away with rows of sharp teeth.\"\nApparently, the underwater beasts \"have been found to bludgeon porpoises to death by the hundreds\" and while \"most animal killers\u2026eat their prey, dolphins seem to have murderous urges unrelated to the need for food.\"\n7 They even kill each other's babies.\nWhile it may be hard to accept, scientists have discovered that adult dolphins sometimes kill the babies of other dolphins. According to a 2002 study published in the Journal of Wildlife Diseases, nine bottlenose dolphin calves were found in Virginia in 1996 and 1997 that had \"died of severe blunt-force trauma.\"\nThe young animals had apparently suffered \"multiple rib fractures, lung lacerations, and soft tissue contusions\" and \"one had a bite wound across the left mandible that exhibited deep punctures consistent with the tooth placement in an adult bottlenose dolphin.\"\n8 Male dolphins attack female dolphins.\nae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb\nAlong with attacking other creatures, dolphins also go after their own kind. One 1992 study published by the National Academy of Sciences found that when male dolphins want to mate, they not only chase females, but they also show violent physical aggression toward them, which includes \"hitting with the tail, head-jerks, charging, biting, or slamming bodily into the female.\"\n9 They're a lot bigger than you probably thought.\nWhen you picture a dolphin, you probably imagine an animal that's about the same height as a grown man. But it turns out, these creatures are a lot bigger. According to National Geographic, the common bottlenose dolphin grows anywhere from 10 to 14 feet and weighs around 1,100 pounds!\n10 They're dangerously fast.\nIf you ever find yourself on a dolphin's bad side, don't put any money on your ability to outswim it. Thanks to their streamlined shape, which allows them to glide through the water, and their powerful tails, which propel them forward, dolphins have been observed traveling up to 22.4 miles per hour. To put that in perspective, Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps' top speed is 6 miles per hour, according to ESPN.\n11 They can launch themselves out of the water.\nDolphins' impressive speed is one of the ways they're able to work up enough power to launch themselves out of the water. While it's not an unusual sight to spot the creatures leaping over waves, bottlenose dolphins are actually capable of launching themselves up about 16 feet into the air, reports National Geographic. In some cases, this ability has even led to scary situations in which dolphins have jumped on to boats\u2014a fear you never knew you needed to have until now!\n12 They can dive deeper than any human.\nThere's no hiding from these seasoned travelers! Dolphins aren't only capable of launching themselves out of the water, they can also dive incredibly well\u2014meaning there are approximately zero ways you can escape one if you find yourself under attack. The skillful swimmers can dive as deep as 820 feet under the ocean's surface, according to National Geographic. For comparison, the deepest world record no-limit free-dive by a human was 702 feet.\n13 They're smart enough to be used by the U.S. Navy.\nDolphins are so clever, they're even used by the U.S. Navy. According to National Geographic, since the 1960s, the military has trained bottlenose dolphins \"to find and retrieve equipment lost at sea and to identify intruders swimming into restricted areas.\" You certainly wouldn't want to be an enemy who finds themselves face to face with a military-trained dolphin.\n14 They've got toxic friends.\nWhile dolphins may be smart, you can't always assume that they're, well, sober. That's because the animals are known to ingest some toxic substances. According to BBC One's Dolphins\u2014Spy in the Pod, \"Bottlenose dolphins play with toxic pufferfish that secrete a neurotoxin that in high doses can kill but in small doses seemingly have a narcotic effect.\"\nThe Daily Mail reports that in the BBC footage \"dolphins were filmed gently playing with the puffer, passing it between each other for 20 to 30 minutes at a time, unlike the fish they had caught as prey which were swiftly torn apart.\" The animals were then \"seen floating just underneath the water's surface, apparently mesmerized by their own reflections.\"\n15 They know when they're taunting us.\nIn a piece called \"Dolphins Are Scarier Than Sharks\" for HuffPost, marine scientist and longtime surfer Apryl DeLancey wrote about a frightening experience she had with a dolphin at Manhattan Beach in California. While she was surfing, a dolphin started circling her and the surfer next to her. \"The circles got smaller and smaller until it finally purposely bumped the back of my board and then jumped over me,\" she recalled. \"After the jump, the dolphin went back to circling us and eventually gave up and took off. It seemed to be either taunting us or wanted us to interact with it.\"\nDeLancey wrote that she's had other dolphins jump over her board, too; she says sharks, on the other hand, have always minded their business and left her alone.\n16 Humans' \"misconceptions\" about dolphins could be deadly.\n\"People see marine mammals differently, particularly dolphins,\" Trevor R. Spradlin, a federal dolphin expert, told the Times. \"There's this misconception that they're friendly, that they're Flipper, that they want to play with people.\"\nObviously, you'll want to treat any dolphin you encounter like the enormous, 1,100-pound wild animal that it is.\n17 Dolphin attacks can be fatal.\nUltimately, dolphins are seriously scary because they can seriously kill you. Nat Geo Wild describes a 1994 case in which two men in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, were rammed by a dolphin. Sadly, one man passed away due to internal injuries sustained during the incident.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "What do dolphins eat? - Whale & Dolphin Conservation USA", "url": "https://us.whales.org/whales-dolphins/what-do-dolphins-eat/", "text": "There are more than forty species of dolphin and they live in environments ranging from freshwater rivers, estuaries, and coastal waters to deep sea open oceans. Most dolphins are opportunistic feeders, which means they eat the fish and other animals sharing their homes. All dolphins eat fish and those living in deep oceans also eat squid and jellyfish.\nBottlenose dolphins are found worldwide in temperate and tropical seas and the types of fish they eat, is dependent on where they live and what time of year it is. Bottlenose dolphins living in the Moray Firth, Scotland, favour salmon when it is available in the spring and summer months. In the winter, salmon is scarce, and so they eat herring and mackerel. Bottlenose dolphins living elsewhere eat their favoured local fish which can be mullet, mackerel, catfish and more tropical species of fish. All dolphins have teeth but they don't chew their food, they just, grab, bite and swallow!\nAmazon river dolphins are known to eat more than 40 different species of freshwater fish and they also eat freshwater crustaceans. Spinner dolphins eat fish, jellyfish and krill. Dusky dolphins eat shrimp, squid and various fish, including tiny anchovies. Rough-toothed dolphins live in deep water oceans and eat mostly squid. Commerson\u2019s dolphins feed on small fish, crabs, octopus, and small crustaceans in kelp beds close to shore and near the seabed. New Zealand dolphins feed on species of small fish and squid in shallow coastal waters.\nOrcas are the biggest members of the dolphin family; resident orcas in Northern British Columbia, Canada eat only fish \u2013 their favourite is salmon. Other orcas specialise in eating much bigger prey including seabirds and mammals such as sea lions, dolphins and whales. Orca diet depends on what food is available to them where they live and what techniques they have learnt from their elders to hunt their food.\nBaleen whales extract their prey from seawater as it flows through or is forced through their baleen plates using their tongues and sometimes their throat muscles. They eat small shrimp-like krill, copepods and fish.\nWhile toothed whales, such as dolphins, are thought to have a keen sense of taste, they lack an olfactory nerve and associated lobes and therefore it is believed that they are not able to smell their food. In baleen whales they are present but of limited use though there have been anecdotal reports that these whale might be capable of some airborne smell recognition.\nHow do whales and dolphin drink?\nThey get all the water they need directly from the food they eat. Their main prey (fish and squid) contains large amounts of water. Dolphins don\u2019t lose water by sweating, like we do, and so they need less water than us in their diets."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "How Smart Are Dolphins? - Treehugger", "url": "https://www.treehugger.com/how-smart-are-dolphins-5112510", "text": "Besides humans, dolphins are said to be the smartest animals on Earth \u2014 smarter, even, than any other primate. They have extraordinarily large brains in comparison to body size and exhibit exceptional levels of emotional and social intelligence. They have the capacity to communicate through language, solve complex problems, use tools, and remember a great number of pod members for long periods of time, just like humans.\nDolphins are highly social and have been proven to deeply care for and learn from one another. However, they're also acutely self-aware. They are one of the only known animals that can recognize themselves in a mirror.\nFind out more about what makes these cetaceans so clever and how, exactly, their smarts stack up against human intelligence.\nDolphin Brain Size Dolphins are second only to humans in brain-to-body size ratio, beating out all other highly intelligent members of the primate family. In terms of mass, a bottlenose dolphin's brain typically weighs 1,500 to 1,700 grams, which is slightly more than a human's and four times the weight of a chimpanzee's. Although brain size doesn't alone determine intelligence, having a big brain, compared to body size, can certainly help free up space for more complex cognitive tasks, scientists say.\nDolphin Cognition\nRadekk / Getty Images\nRenowned dolphin researcher Louis Herman referred to dolphins as humans' \"cognitive cousins\" on account of the many characteristics they share with humans and great apes, even though cetaceans and primates are only slightly related.\ufeff\ufeff Cognition is an umbrella term used to describe high level brain functions like thinking, knowing, remembering, judging, and problem-solving. These functions allow us to use language, imagination, perception, and to plan.\nProblem-Solving\nAn experiment conducted in 2010 at the Dolphin Research Center in Grassy Key, Florida, found that a bottlenose dolphin named Tanner tapped into his problem-solving capabilities to imitate the actions of other dolphins and humans while blindfolded.\ufeff\ufeff With his eyes covered by latex suction cups, Tanner resorted to another sense \u2014 his hearing \u2014 to determine the proximity and position of other dolphins and his trainer (in a follow-up study). Even though the sound of a human in the water differs from the sound of another dolphin in the water, Tanner was still able to mimic his trainer's changing swimming styles without being able to see him.\nFuture Planning\nskynesher / Getty Images\nMany other dolphins have risen to fame with their various feats of sophistication. Consider Kelly, a resident of the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Mississippi, who earned a reputation in the early 2000s for gull baiting.\ufeff\ufeff Her cheeky tricks started after the staff began rewarding the dolphins with fish every time they cleaned up a piece of litter. Kelly resolved to hide a piece of paper under a rock at the bottom of the pool so that she could tear off one small sliver at a time, knowing that she would earn more treats with more pieces of paper.\nThen, once Kelly discovered that a seagull would earn her even more fish than a piece of paper, she began hiding fish where she hid the paper, and baiting gulls with her own treats. This case of the trainer being trained by the trainee showed that Kelly was, in fact, capable of planning for the future and understood the concept of delayed gratification.\nCommunication\nTroyVSmith / Getty Images\nDolphins have an extensive and complex communication system that allows them to decipher exactly which member of the pod is \"talking.\" Although those in captivity have been trained to respond to certain hand motions, they naturally communicate through pulses, clicks, and whistles rather than vision.\nIn 2000, behavioral ecologist Peter Tyack proposed the idea that the pitch of a dolphin's whistle functions as a means of individual identification \u2014 like a name.\ufeff\ufeff They use their \"signature whistles\" to announce their presence or let others in the pod know where they are. They'll even emit their unique whistles especially loudly when they're in distress.\nThere are other similarities, in addition to these name-like whistles, between dolphin and human communication. One study published in 2016 found that some Black Sea bottlenose dolphin vocalizations were \"signals of a highly advanced spoken language.\"\ufeff\ufeff They're capable of carrying on conversations and stringing together \"sentences\" with their various-pitched pulses taking the place of words.\nWhat's more, they follow a very humanlike trajectory of language development, starting out as babblers and learning the laws of language over time. And, of course, the many dolphins that have been taught tricks in captivity prove that they, too, are capable of learning human words and grammar (even the difference between \"take the hoop to the ball\" and \"take the ball to the hoop\").\ufeff\ufeff\nEcholocation\nLike toothed whales, bats, shrews, and some birds, dolphins use a physiological process called echolocation, also known as bio sonar. This allows certain animals to locate distant, sometimes invisible objects using only sound waves, which travel four and a half times faster in water than on land. Whereas most other species (even whales) create these sounds with their larynxes, dolphins force air through their nasal passages to produce sequences of short, broad-spectrum burst-pulses known as \"click trains.\"\ufeff\ufeff\nThese clicks then travel through water at a speed of nearly 1,500 meters (1,640 yards) per second, bouncing off any nearby objects and returning to the dolphin via its lower jaw bones, ultimately letting it know what's nearby. The process is sensitive enough to even reveal the size, shape, and speed of an object that is hundreds of yards away.\ufeff\ufeff\nIt was through echolocation that Tanner was able to detect his trainer's location and mimic his exact movements without being able to use sight. Dolphins use echolocation to find both food sources and potentially threatening things in the water.\nSelf-Recognition\nJoe Raedle/Getty Images\nOne of the most prominent testaments to dolphin intelligence is their ability to recognize themselves in a mirror. The mirror test \u2014 also called the mark test or MSR, for \"mirror self recognition\" test \u2014 is a technique designed to measure self-awareness. The only animals to have passed the test so far are dolphins, great apes, orcas, a single elephant, the Eurasian magpie, and cleaner wrasse.\nThe mirror test usually involves anesthetizing an animal and marking a part of its body that it can't normally see, then, when it wakes up, putting it in front of a mirror to see whether it investigates the mark. If it does, there's evidence that it recognizes itself in the reflective surface. Two male bottlenose dolphins were tested using this method in 2001, and researchers determined that they not only recognized themselves, but provided a \"striking example of evolutionary convergence with great apes and humans.\"\ufeff\ufeff\nThe study mentioned such exploratory behaviors as \"repetitious head circling\" and \"close viewing of the eye or genital region reflected in the mirror.\" More recent tests have revealed that dolphins actually recognize themselves in a mirror earlier in life than humans do \u2014 about seven months versus 15 to 18 months.\ufeff\ufeff\nMemory\nLong-term memory (scientifically known as LTSR, \"long-term social recognition\") is another indicator of cognitive capacity, and a 2013 study revealed that dolphins have the longest known memory other than that of humans.\ufeff\ufeff The experiment, led by University of Chicago animal behaviorist Jason Bruck, included 43 bottlenose dolphins that had been part of a breeding consortium between the U.S. and Bermuda for decades. First, the researchers played whistles of unfamiliar dolphins over a speaker until the dolphins got bored of them. Then, they played the whistles of old social partners from which they had been separated for 20 years, and the dolphins perked up, some of them whistling their own \"names\" and listening for a response.\nDolphins Use Tools\nDolphins, like primates, crows, and sea otters, also use tools, a skill once thought to be possessed by only humans. In the '90s, an Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin population that had been the center of long-term research was observed on several occasions carrying around sponges through deep water channels.\ufeff\ufeff The phenomenon mostly occurred among females.\nWhile the study noted that they could be playing with the sponges or using them for medicinal purposes, researchers determined that they were most likely using them as a foraging tool, perhaps to protect their snouts from sharp objects, stinging sea urchins, and the like.\nAre Dolphins Smarter Than Humans? Despite the running joke that Kelly the dolphin \"trained her own trainer,\" intelligence tests indicate that dolphins do not actually surpass humans in cognition. One measure to take into account, considering intelligence has been repeatedly linked to brain size, is the encephalization quotient \u2014 or EQ \u2014 which considers an animal's brain mass compared to the brain mass predicted for an animal of its size. Other than humans, who possess an EQ of around 7.5, dolphins have the highest EQ of any animal, about 5.3. This means their brains are more than five times the mass they're expected to be.\nEmotional Intelligence\nThe many cetaceans witnessed pushing deceased pod mates in the water for days have provided substantial anecdotal evidence that dolphins feel grief, a complex emotion experienced only by social creatures with large, complex brains. But a 2018 study published in Zoology quantified the occurrence, saying that of all surveyed cetacean species, dolphins attended to dead conspecifics most often (92% of the time).\ufeff\ufeff\nJeff Foott / Getty Images\nAs demonstrated by their friendly countenances, dolphins are also brimming with personality. Data shows there are both bold and shy types, and that dolphins' individual personalities determine the structure of their social networks.\ufeff\ufeff For instance, bold dolphins play a central role in group cohesion and the spreading of information.\nTheir emotional capacity has even led some researchers to draft and lobby for a cetacean-specific Declaration of Rights.\ufeff\ufeff Lori Marino of Emory University, Thomas I. White of Loyola Marymount University, and Chris Butler-Stroud of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, who proposed the document during the world's largest science conference (the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Vancouver, Canada) in 2012, said dolphins should be perceived as \"nonhuman persons\" because they exhibit individuality, consciousness, and self-awareness. The Declaration of Rights aims to prevent the killing of these clever marine mammals by commercial whaling.\nSocial Intelligence\nGeorge Karbus Photography / Getty Images\nDolphins live in complex groups and exhibit strong bonds with their pod mates, with whom they swim and hunt. Pods can contain anywhere between two and 15 dolphins. Like humans, their social networks are composed of close family members and acquaintances. They are thought to have a \"collective consciousness\" that sometimes results in mass stranding. One dolphin's distress calls will cause others to follow it ashore. When being herded together, they huddle instead of trying to jump the net. These acts provide proof that dolphins are compassionate.\ufeff\ufeff\nWithin their social systems, they also form long-term cooperative partnerships and alliances, exhibit conformity (as is the case with the tool-using population), and learn from their pod members.\ufeff\ufeff\nDolphins Have Spindle Neurons\nStudies show that dolphins have special, spindle-shaped neurons called Von Economo neurons, or VENs, that aid in the intuitive assessment of complex situations, like social interplay. VENs are housed in the anterior cingulate cortex, the part of the brain responsible for emotion, decision-making, and autonomic functions, and are found only in a handful of social species outside of the great ape category. Dolphins have three times as many VENs as humans.\ufeff\ufeff\nSocial Learning\nDolphins learn to forage, play, and even perform tricks simply by observing their pod members. This phenomenon is evident in the conformity demonstrated by the Indo-Pacific pod of tool-using dolphins, and also in Wave, the wild bottlenose dolphin that left researcher and conservationist Mike Bossley in shock when it leapt from the water of Australia's Port River and began \"tail-walking.\"\ufeff\ufeff This trick, in which the dolphin uses its tail flukes to \"walk\" on the water's surface while remaining in a vertical position, is often taught to dolphins in captivity. It was discovered that Wave had learned the behavior from another, once-captive dolphin, and that other members of the pod had picked up on the stunt as well.\nThis kind of social learning happens frequently among wild species, but most often, the techniques that permeate animal populations involve essential tasks, such as feeding and mating. Tail-walking, however, seemed to have no adaptive function. It isn't clear why the wild dolphins picked up on such a trivial trick \u2014 or why they performed it more frequently after Billie, the once-captive dolphin that sparked the behavior, had died \u2014 but this phenomenon remains one of the best examples of dolphin social learning decades after it was first discovered."}

You\u2019ve probably heard about how highly intelligent they are, but did you know they use their tongues as straws or that they\u2019re born with mustaches? Let\u2019s dive into five amazing dolphin facts and look at some adorable dolphin calf pictures!\n#1: Baby Dolphins Use Their Tongues as Straws\nNewborn dolphins use their tongues as straws while nursing. Lynne Nicholson/Shutterstock.com\nImagine trying to take a swig of juice while you\u2019re underwater. Pretty impossible, right? Baby dolphins are faced with a unique roadblock when it comes to nursing from their mothers: they\u2019re underwater. Since breastmilk is a liquid, you might be wondering just how baby dolphins can drink their mother\u2019s milk while remaining in the water.\nThe answer is astounding: they use their tongues as a straw. Dolphin calves roll their tongues up like a straw when it\u2019s time to drink their mother\u2019s milk. Dolphin calves don\u2019t control how much they eat. Instead, their mothers do. Once a dolphin calf is latched onto its mother\u2019s nipple, the female dolphin shoots milk directly into the baby dolphin\u2019s mouth. This makes it possible for a full feeding to take just a few seconds.\nAnother thing that makes it easier for baby dolphins to drink milk underwater is the consistency of the breastmilk. It is about as thick as a milkshake, which makes it less difficult for baby dolphins to get their nutrition while swimming under the sea!\n#2: One Dolphin Calf Blew Underwater Milk Rings to Imitate its Trainer\nA dolphin calf and its mother come up for air. Christian Wittmann/Shutterstock.com\nBaby dolphins are smart cookies! One six-month-old baby dolphin named Dolly learned how to copy its trainers smoke rings underwater. This tiny dolphin saw her trainer blow a cloud of smoke, so it swam back to its mother, got a mouthful of breastmilk, and swam back. She then spat the milk out in the water, creating a smoke-like cloud around her!\nDolly\u2019s trainer stated that he didn\u2019t work with her to do this trick at all. Instead, she made the connection that spitting out the milk underwater would look similar to smoke in the air. This incident just goes to show how incredibly intelligent baby dolphins are!\n#3: Dolphins are Born with Mustaches\nDolphin calves are born with tiny hairs around their snouts. Willyam Bradberry/Shutterstock.com\nDid you know baby dolphins are born with a mustache? It\u2019s true, but the more astonishing thing about this mustache is what it does for the tiny sea animals. Since baby dolphins are born with less-than-perfect eyesight, they need a different way to locate their mothers during their first few days on the earth.\nThe tiny hairs are short and grow around the baby\u2019s snout. After a few days, these hairs naturally shed since dolphin calves no longer need them.\n#4: Baby Dolphins Can\u2019t Breathe Underwater\nDolphin calves must come to the surface for oxygen. Tomas Picka/Shutterstock.com\nBaby dolphins are marine animals, so you might assume that they can breathe underwater like other fish. You will probably be surprised to learn that dolphin calves are mammals! That means baby dolphins and their parents lack gills, which makes it impossible for them to breathe underwater. Instead, they must come to the surface to get air.\nBecause of this, baby dolphins are born tail-first. This ensures that they don\u2019t drown before they can surface for their first breath of air. Dolphin calves can hold their breath underwater for up to 15 minutes since they can conserve the air in their lungs and only need to use a little at a time to keep oxygen flowing to their brains.\nBaby dolphins also don\u2019t breathe out of their mouths like other mammals. Instead, they take oxygen in from blowholes, which are on the tops of their heads. Each time a dolphin calf takes a breath, they fill about 80% to 90% of their lungs. When you compare that to the typical human breath that fills only 10% of lungs, it puts it into perspective just how miraculous baby dolphins are!\n#5: Dolphin Calves Learn to Swim in the Mother\u2019s Womb\nDolphin calves can swim from the moment they are born. marshalgonz/Shutterstock.com\nWhen baby dolphins are born, they must immediately swim to the surface to take their first breath of air. But how do they know how to swim so soon? The answer is amazing: they learn to swim while they\u2019re gestating in their mothers\u2019 wombs!\nScientists say that baby dolphins have been observed swimming around inside the womb as early as 9 weeks gestation. Since dolphins have a gestation period that ranges anywhere from nine to twelve months, dolphin calves have plenty of time to get all the practice they need to learn how to swim!"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Communication - Dolphin Research Center", "url": "https://dolphins.org/communication", "text": "Dolphin Communication\nCommunication in bottlenose dolphins appears to be extensive and complex. A dolphin maintains an intricate social network that includes a few close associates (such as mothers and calves or pair-bonded males), plus more casual relationships with others who come and go within a larger group. Dolphins hunt together to find food. Pods of dolphins coordinate their movements to herd prey, and then take turns swimming into the middle of the assembled fish to eat. There is still much to learn about how dolphins communicate though a number of generalities have emerged from research.\nSound travels 4.5 \u2013 5 times faster through water than through the air. For this reason dolphins rely on sound for communication more than any other mode. Scientists believe that every bottlenose dolphin develops a distinctive high-pitched whistle, called a signature whistle (Tyack, 2000). This whistle appears to serve as a means of individual identification, much like a name. It may let the rest of the pod know which pod members are around, where they are, and, perhaps, something about their mental state. Dolphins in distress sometimes emit their signature whistles very loudly. Whistles may serve to establish or maintain vocal or physical contact between dolphins. Dolphins often respond to another dolphin\u2019s whistle by whistling themselves or moving toward the whistler. If they become separated, a young calf and its mother whistle frequently until reunited. Dolphins also whistle when separated from other group members.\nDolphins do not always respond immediately to another dolphin whistling. Sometimes, many dolphins in the group whistle at once, repeating their signature whistles over and over. In this case, the whistling may help the dolphins keep track of each other.\nBottlenose dolphins also seem to whistle while foraging on various prey items (Acevedo-Guiterrez 2004). Scientists believe that as a group of dolphins finds a school of potential prey they will vocalize more frequently. This increase in vocalizations attracts more dolphins to the area that can assist with rounding up the fish, allowing all individuals to get a larger meal. An increase in the number of dolphins nearby also provides safety for all individuals, as sharks and other large predators are likely to want to feed from the same food source the dolphins have discovered.\nDolphins are capable of imitating certain sounds very accurately and often learn other dolphins' whistles. One reason for imitating another dolphin's whistle may be to get its attention within a large group. Preliminary research seems to support this idea although details of the exact reason for imitation are still under investigation.\nDolphins may use other sounds besides whistles to communicate. Courtship behavior can yield pulsed yelps. When under duress, dolphins emit pulsed squeaks. Aggressive confrontation can produce buzzing click-trains.\nDolphins do not generally rely on visual communication, although they have excellent eyesight both above and below the water\u2019s surface. There is often silt and other particles floating in the water column that can make it difficult for dolphins to communicate visually over long distances. However, when close to each other, body language may play a role in dolphin communication. Researchers are still studying the behaviors and situations when dolphins use body language and there are still many questions regarding the meaning of any specific body movement. Following is a list of dolphin behaviors observed here at Dolphin Research Center. These behaviors are possibly used as a means of visual communication.\nArch: Bend head and tail ventrally.\nEyewhite display: Rolling eyes, showing the whites.\nFlex: Bend head and tail dorsally.\nHeadwag: Rapid, side to side shaking of the head.\nPlay dead: Roll over submissively in the vicinity of another dolphin.\nSnit: Sharp, sideways head jerk with closed or open jaws; may be accompanied by sound.*\n*May indicate agitation or aggressive behavior.\nTo some extent, dolphins may also communicate by touch. Calves swim close to their mothers, brushing their bodies with their flanks and pectoral fins. This may serve to strengthen their bond and promote or strengthen social ties. On the other hand, dolphins use touch in rough, aggressive ways during courtship and when establishing dominance. They use their teeth to make parallel scratches, called rake marks, on each other's skin. Scientists continue to study these behaviors and the situations in which dolphins use them to learn exactly what they might mean. Below is a list of behaviors that we have observed our dolphins using here at Dolphin Research Center, possibly to communicate by touch.\nBite : Close mouth around body part of another animal.*\nButt : Hit with melon or snout.*\nHold hands: Swim with pectoral fins overlapping.\nMouth: Touch another animal with open mouth.\nNuzzle: Touch or rub another animal with closed mouth.\nPectoral Pat: Tap or stroke with pectoral fins.\nPush: Forcefully press against another animal with head or rostrum.*\nRam: Hit another animal full force, head-on.*\nRub: Two animals touch body parts, moving against each other with friction.\nStranding on chest: One animal inverted, lifting another out of water, putting recipient between the flippers (often between mother and calf).\nStranding on rostrum: One animal lifting another out of the water, carrying recipient on the rostrum (often between mother and calf).\nTail kick: Strike with tail.*\nTooth rake: Draw teeth across the body of another animal.*\n*May indicate agitation or aggressive behavior.\nFor many years, researchers have looked for evidence of a dolphin language, a way to share complicated information such as stories, family histories, and philosophy in the way that humans do. Although a few dolphins have learned to use a simple artificial language consisting of hand gestures or computer-generated whistles, extensive research to date has failed to demonstrate a natural language in dolphins.\nReferences\nAcevedo- Guiterrez, A., and S.

This includes the waters off the UK and Ireland, where you can spot them swimming and playing in bays and river estuaries!\n2) These beautiful creatures have a short thick beak (as their name suggests!) and a curved mouth, giving the appearance that they are always smiling. They are usually grey in colour, and measure around two to four metres in length.\nLove animals? You\u2019d love our magazine! Ask your parents to check out Nat Geo Kids magazine!\n(AD)\n3) Social creatures, bottlenose dolphins travel in groups, called \u201cpods\u201c, of around 10-15. In these groups they play and hunt together, as well as cooperate to raise young dolphin calves and help each other.\n4) Bottlenose dolphins are super swimmers, gliding through the water using their curved dorsal fin on their back, a powerful tail and pointed flippers. They can reach speeds over 30km an hour and dive as deep as 250m below the surface!\n5) These cool creatures are awesome acrobats, too, and can be seen flipping (or \u201cbreaching\u201c) out of the water. In fact, they can launch themselves up to five meters out of the water before crashing back down with a splash! There are different theories as to why they do this \u2013 it could be to get a better view of things in the distance, clean parasites off their bodies, communicate with other pods or just for good fun!\n6) Although they live underwater, the bottlenose dolphin must come up to the surface to breath air. It breathes through what\u201ds called a \u201cblowhole\u201c, a hole at the top of its head. These clever creatures can open this hole when inhaling and exhaling out of the water, and close it when below the ocean surface. They can hold their breath underwater for around seven minutes.\n7) Bottlenose dolphins are kings of communication! They send each other messages in different ways \u2013 they squeak and whistle and also use body language, leaping out of the water, snapping their jaws and even butting heads!\n8) These magnificent mammals also produce high-pitched clicks to help them navigate and find food \u2013 a process called \u201cecholocation\u201c. When the clicking sounds hit an object in the water \u2013 such as a rock or fish \u2013 they bounce back to the dolphin as echoes. From this, the super swimmers can work out the location, size and shape of the object. Cool, eh?\n9) Carnivores, our finned friends eat mostly fish, but will also eat crustaceans such as shrimp and squid, too.\n10) Thankfully, bottlenose dolphins are not classed as endangered. However, illegal hunting, fishing nets and pollution pose threats to these incredible creatures.\nLove reading about sea life?

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphin Intelligence | Dolphins World", "url": "https://www.dolphins-world.com/dolphin-intelligence/", "text": "AN EMPOWERING INTELLIGENCE\nThe intelligence of dolphins is one of their most outstanding features. Among the thousands of members that the animal kingdom has, dolphins take one of the top places regarding intelligence.\nThe brain is the organ involved in the ability of understanding, reasoning, learning, and other cognitive processes. The dolphin\u2019s brain is astonishingly complex, almost comparable to that of humans. And it is large related to their body. Through magnetic resonance imaging, their brains have been found to be 4-5 times bigger than those of other animals of similar sizes.\nThe bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is the second place in a list of species with a higher encephalization ratio (EQ), which compares the mass of the encephalon against its body size.\nIn addition to a developed neocortex, the cerebellum has more convolutions (turns of the brain surface) than that of other mammals. The connections between the neurological areas and the motor areas of the organ exhibit a great sensitivity to pain and a pronounced tendency to stress.\nSome scientists claim that the social intelligence of these cetaceans competes with that of the great apes.\nMost of their behaviors show the development of their brain and their ability to understand situations. They process information from their environment in a similar way to people, and some say that they can solve problems like humans. For example:\n\u2013 Their forms of communication are complex, evolving and diverse.\n\u2013 They are creative and playful animals. Their behavior is not mechanical or rigid; they seem to enjoy playing and look for the companionship of other individuals.\n\u2013 Their empathy suggests that they experience emotions such as sadness or joy.\n\u2013 They have an excellent learning ability; this is why they are highly requested animals for water parks, although the activities of these places are highly controversial.\n\u2013 They can transmit learning to other generations of dolphins.\nThere have been cases where they use tools. For example, sponges to protect your snout from rough surfaces.\n\u2013 The members of a pod collaborate with each other and sometimes with other species of animals.\nSome scientists argue that the social intelligence of these cetaceans competes with that of the great apes because they can demonstrate empathy towards the companions and help them when they are injured or immobilized.\nSigns of higher intelligence are related to self-awareness and dolphins are. Proof of this is that when they look in a mirror, they can recognize themselves and know that they are the ones in the mirror; This is a sign of the development of abstract thinking. Likewise, their learning ability is comparable to that of a 3-year-old child, according to cognitive psychologist Diana Reiss of the New York City University.\n+ According to science, their ability to learn is comparable to that of a 3-year-old toddler.\nINTELLIGENCE TESTS\nMany other experiments on dolphins have proved their superior thinking ability compared with other animals and similar to that of humans:\n\u2013 They respond positively to television, that is, show interest and curious attention to the moving images displayed on the device.\n\u2013 They have been seen playing with inanimate objects that they find in their surroundings.\n\u2013 They play with bubbles of water as they swim, and then take the time to observe their creations.\n\u2013 They can solve complex problems and can imitate the actions of human beings. A dolphin named Tanner was blindfolded and told to imitate the actions of a trainer who was in the water. As the dolphin could not watch, emitted sounds and interpreted the sound waves to make replicas of the movements of the instructor.\nThe differences between human intelligence and that of dolphins are that the former need to manipulate their environment, but dolphins do not, and that is why they concentrate their intellect in other things.\nThere are still many questions regarding dolphin intelligence. There are still many things to discover, but what is known so far is enough to say that these animals are very, very intelligent.\nARE DOLPHINS SMART? THE ONGOING DEBATE ABOUT DOLPHIN INTELLIGENCE\nMost scientists refuse to take a firm stand on the intelligence level of dolphins, and although many will admit that dolphins seem to be intelligent creatures, it is not a proven fact. The biggest problem researchers are running into seems to be the actual definition of intelligence and the way to test it in animals.\nIf you were to step out into the street and ask the first ten people you see whether or not they believed dolphins were creatures of intelligence, 8 of 10 would probably say yes. If you ask two scientists the same question, you just may be opening up a debate that could last for hours.\nDarwin\u2019s theory bases intelligence on the ability of a species to recognize what it needs to survive, while others believe that the size and architecture of the brain, the capacity to communicate or the ability to solve problems are the indicators.\nAnother reason why the research is limited is that it is complicated and expensive to do it in the wild. Dolphins in captivity may respond differently based on their surroundings and are therefore may not be representative of the wild dolphin.\nWhile most of us outside the scientific realm recognize that dolphins are intelligent, we do not know the intricacies of the dolphin\u2019s brain. It has two hemispheres just like the human brain. However, theirs split into four lobes instead of three. The fourth hosts all of the senses, whereas in humans, they are in different parts. Some believe that having all of the senses in one lobe allow dolphins to make quick and often complicated judgments that are well beyond the scope of human ability.\nWhen studying the neocortex, which is the outside surface of the brain responsible for perceptions, memories, and thoughts, dolphins have more convolutions than the most intelligent humans. Even more, dolphins may be able to use the hemispheres of their brain separately as they have different blood supplies.\nSome researchers think that the size and complexity of the brain at birth is a better measure of intelligence. If that statement holds up, however, once more the dolphin comes out on top. The bottlenose dolphin has a brain mass at birth that is 42.5% of the brain mass of an adult. In contrast, human babies at birth have 28% of their adult counterparts. At 18 months, the brain mass of a bottlenose dolphin is 80% of the adults, while humans don\u2019t achieve this level until the age of three or four.\nWhile the research certainly makes it look like the dolphin may be the closest to our level of intelligence, it may be quite some time before this can be confirmed.\nReferences\nRichard C Connor.

Individuals normally associate with each other for less than a few days. These diurnal animals generally live in the same area, sometimes, throughout their lives. Hector's dolphins are known to be active and playful animals: bow-riding and playing with seaweed are common activities in this species. Hector's dolphins typically spend their time swimming along the coastline, coming to the surface to breathe, diving to forage as well as playing. They can frequently be observed leaping out of the water and landing on their side with a loud splash. In addition, sometimes they flex their body at the surface and can swim on their sides while feeding. In order to show aggression, these dolphins usually splash water with their tail, chase, bite or make bubble-blows."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphin | San Diego Zoo Animals & Plants", "url": "https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/dolphin", "text": "You might not realize that dolphins are closely related to whales. The scientific order, called Cetacea, includes dolphins, whales, and porpoises. The dolphin family Delphinidae has 36 species in all. It can get confusing at times, because some members of the dolphin family have the word whale in their common name. In fact, the largest dolphin is the killer whale! Depending on the species, dolphins range in color from white, pearl, and pink to darker shades of brown, gray, blue, and black.\nA dolphin is a mammal, and needs to breathe air through its blowhole, just as whales and porpoises do.\nDolphins have smooth skin, flippers, and a dorsal fin. They have a long, slender snout with about 100 teeth, and a streamlined body. The single blowhole on top of their head has a flap that opens to reveal a pair of nostrils, which dolphins use for breathing when they surface.\nEver wondered how dolphins sleep and get air to breathe at the same time? It would seem that if they fall asleep in the ocean, they'd sink, and then they wouldn\u2019t be able to breathe! Because of their bone and body structure, and their ability to hold more oxygen in their body than humans can, dolphins are more buoyant\u2014they float better. When they sleep, they don't sink. Rather, they float about 10 inches (25 centimeters) below the surface of the water. Small movements of their flukes periodically push them up to the surface so they can take a breath through their blowhole.\nDolphins have an eye on each side of their head. Each eye moves independently of the other, so dolphins can see ahead, to the side, and behind them. They can also see very well both underwater and above water. Their vision out of the water is about as good as a cat\u2019s or a dog\u2019s vision. Dolphins that live in rivers have much less well-developed vision, probably because they live in murky water where good eyesight wouldn\u2019t help them.\nDolphins use clicking sounds for echolocation, and many use whistles to communicate with other members of their pod, or group. In addition to clicks and whistles, researchers have described dolphin sounds as screams, calls, moans, trills, grunts, squeaks, and even a creaky door sound. Bottlenose dolphin researchers think that slow clicks and high-pitched whistles are signs of contentment, while harsh, low squawks express annoyance.\nTheir ear holes are tiny, about the size of a crayon point, but dolphins probably have the best hearing in the Animal Kingdom. They receive sounds through their jawbone and head, and the vibrations pass into the tiny bones of their inner ear.\nAll dolphins make sounds that travel underwater, bounce off something, and then return to the dolphins as echoes. This sophisticated echolocation allows dolphins to find food or avoid predators, even in dark or murky water. Dolphins that live in rivers have excellent echolocation for fishing in muddy waters.\nDolphins\u2019 natural abilities to swim fast and leap clear of the water are what make them such entertaining performers. They are the most agile and speedy of all marine mammals. They are known to travel with ships, leaping in front of the bow and swimming in the wake."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Are Dolphins Mammals? These Are 5 Important Facts You Need to Know", "url": "https://content.dolphinsplus.com/blog/are-dolphins-mammals-", "text": "Although dolphins swim in water and appear to be \"fish-like\" compared to other animals living in the ocean, they are classified as cetaceans (marine mammals) and not fish. Evolving sometime around the Eocene Epoch, cetaceans such as dolphins and whales are thought to share a common ancestor with the hippopotamuses. Fossils discovered in Pakistan over 40 years ago confirmed the fact that dolphins transitioned from being land mammals to sea mammals probably due to a rapidly changing environment necessitating adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle.\nWhat Makes Dolphins Mammals?\n1. Dolphins are Warm-Blooded\nWarm-blooded animals maintain body temperatures higher than environmental temperatures through metabolic processes different from cold-blooded animals. The ability to control body temperature regardless of environment is a characteristic of homeothermic animals, such as dolphins and birds. Evolutionary biologists hypothesize that birds and mammals evolved warm-bloodedness specifically to prevent fungal infections. Cold-blooded animals such as amphibians and reptiles frequently suffer a variety of fungal infections.\n2. Dolphins Breathe Through Lungs, Not Gills\nWatching dolphins swim in the ocean, you've probably wondered why they continuously make trips to the surface. That's because they are mammals and have lungs much like humans do. When dolphins surface for air, they exhale to blow away water covering their blowholes. The water spray you see coming out of a dolphin's blowhole is not water coming from the lungs but water coming off the dolphin's body. This allows dolphins to inhale oxygen free of water. Additionally, dolphins only breathe through blowholes and never through their mouths. Because a dolphin's eating and breathing remains separate, they can swallow prey without getting water into their lungs.\nDolphins also have collapsible lungs to avoid suffering decompression sickness when they dive deeper than normal. Collapsible lungs allows dolphins to breathe much more quickly than humans. They are able to exchange 80% of the air in their lungs with each breath, while humans are only capable of exchanging 17%. Learning more about how these amazing lungs function under extreme pressure may help researchers develop technologies to reduce risks to humans in similar situations.\n3. Dolphins Give Birth to Live Young\nAll mammals give birth to live young. Reptiles, amphibians, fish and insects lay eggs that hatch at some point in the future. Although birds are warm-blooded, they are neither reptiles or mammals but belong in their own group. Sexual maturity of dolphins varies, and is related to the size of the animal, not age. Reproductive maturity will typically occurs at 85 \u2013 95% of their mean adult body length, in most cases, this is between 5 \u2013 12 years of age. A dolphin pregnancy last around 12 months. Female dolphins can realistically bear calves once every 2 to 4 years but the average interval between dolphin births is three years.\n4. Dolphins Have Hair\nDolphin calves have hair on their rostrum when they are born, which falls out soon after birth. However, you can still see hair follicles through adulthood. Dolphins do not need hair to maintain body temperature since they have plenty of blubber to keep organs warm. Evolutionary biologists think that the presence of dolphin body hair at birth indicates the ancestors of dolphins (land mammals) had hair to help them maintain body temperature in colder environments. Marine mammals that live on land and in water use fur as a primary means of insulation. However, blubber is the primary means of insulation for most marine mammals, including dolphins.\n5. Dolphins Lactate Like Other Mammals\nFemale dolphins have mammary glands that produce milk even while gestating, meaning pregnant dolphins can feed older calves while waiting for another to be born. Calves typically nurse two to four years and some will remain with mothers for four or five years. Studies into the composition of dolphin milk have found that it does not resemble human milk but is more similar to high-fat milk produced by dogs, reindeer and rabbits. What is interesting about dolphin milk is that it is extremely low in lactose, which differs from dog, rabbit and reindeer milk. In addition, calves can drink milk from their mother's teet while under water because they can manipulate their tongues in a \"straw\" like formation to form a seal over the mother's nipple.\nAlthough social behavior is not considered a definitive characteristic of a mammal, the fact that dolphins are large brained species and engage in an intricate social network may be another reason why dolphins are categorized as mammals instead of fish. Even more remarkable is that bottlenose dolphins show an evolutionary convergence of cognitive and social features similar or equal to other large-brained mammals (e.g., primates)."}

Large brain animals like humans, chimpanzees, and dolphins have a number of things in common. They generally live long lives. They form stable communities. They demonstrate complex emotions such as happiness, sadness and grief. They can assess situations and problem solve. And their offspring are totally dependent on their parents during childhood.\nDolphins brains are large and complex. They are fast learners, have advanced communication systems and develop complex social networks. They make plans together and cooperate with one another to hunt, protect themselves and bring up their young. Dolphins have senses of empathy, altruism and attachment. They are creative and playful creatures, and seem to enjoy playing and seek the companionship of others. They will work together to take care of injured or sick pod mates.\nDolphins are one of only a few species that pass the \u2018mirror test\u2019. They recognise their own reflection in a mirror; they inspect themselves and look at parts of their bodies in the mirror that they can\u2019t usually see, they also make movements and examine themselves for this movement. These behaviours indicate self-awareness of a highly intelligent species."}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "75 Animal Facts That Will Change the Way You View the Animal Kingdom", "url": "https://bestlifeonline.com/animal-facts/", "text": "With an estimated 7.77 million species of animals on the planet, the animal kingdom is an undeniably diverse place. But while the breadth of earthly biodiversity may be well known, the incredible things our animal counterparts can do are often hidden to humans. From furry creatures you never realized kissed to those who enjoy getting tipsy, these amazing animal facts are sure to wow even the biggest animal lovers out there.\n1 Koala fingerprints are so close to humans' that they could taint crime scenes.\nKoalas might not seem to have a lot in common with us, but if you were to take a closer look at their hands, you'd see that they have fingerprints that are just like humans'. In fact, they're so similar when it comes to the distinctive loops and arches, that in Australia, \"police feared that criminal investigations may have been hampered by koala prints,\" according to Ripley's Believe It or Not. Any koalas who want to commit crimes would be wise to do so wearing gloves.\n2 Parrots will selflessly help each other out.\nParrots may be associated with pirates, but it turns out African grey parrots are nothing like the infamously greedy, treasure-seeking criminals. Instead, researchers have discovered that the colorful birds will \"voluntarily help each other obtain food rewards\" and perform \"selfless\" acts, according to a 2020 study published in Current Biology. Study co-author Auguste von Bayern noted, \"African grey parrots were intrinsically motivated to help others, even if the other individual was not their friend, so they behaved very 'prosocially.'\"\n3 Prairie dogs kiss.\nPrairie dogs are quirky creatures for a number of reasons: They're giant rodents, they dig massive interconnected underground homes, and they kiss. While they're actually touching their front teeth in order to identify each other when they seem to be sweetly sharing a smooch, the BBC explains that scientists believe prairie dogs \"'kiss and cuddle' more when they are being watched by zoo visitors,\" because they \"appeared to enjoy the attention.\"\n4 Ghost crabs growl using teeth in their stomachs.\nCrabs may be able to intimidate other creatures with their claws, but if that's not enough, ghost crabs will growl at their enemies like a dog. However, unlike our canine friends, crabs make these fearsome noises using teeth located in their stomachs. \"There are three main teeth\u2014a medial tooth and two lateral teeth\u2014that are essentially elongated, hard (calcified) structures. They are part of the gastric mill apparatus in the stomach, where they rub against each other to grind up food,\" Jennifer Taylor, from the University of California, San Diego, told Newsweek. She and her colleagues were able to nail down the source of the noise after noticing that \"the crabs [were] 'growling' at\" them.\n5 The mantis shrimp has the world's fastest punch.\nYou might think that boxers have the most impressive jabs, hooks, and uppercuts on the planet, but it's the mantis shrimp that boasts the world's fastest punch. Traveling at about 50 mph, when a shrimp punches, its little fist of fury (which, of course, isn't a fist at all) is \"accelerating faster than a .22-caliber bullet,\" according to Science. National Geographic shared the tale of one such small smasher, explaining that \"in April 1998, an aggressive creature named Tyson smashed through the quarter-inch-thick glass wall of his cell. He was soon subdued by nervous attendants and moved to a more secure facility in Great Yarmouth. Unlike his heavyweight namesake [former professional boxer Mike Tyson], Tyson was only four inches long. But scientists have recently found that Tyson, like all his kin, can throw one of the fastest and most powerful punches in nature.\"\n6 Female lions do 90 percent of the hunting.\nWhile male lions attract their fair share of attention thanks to their impressive manes, it's the female lions who do the bulk of the work when it comes to feeding their families. \"Lionesses, not male lions, do the majority of hunting for their pride,\" according to CBS News. \"Lionesses hunt around 90 percent of the time, while the males protect their pride.\"\n7 Narwhal tusks are really an \"inside out\" tooth.\nNarwhals are unlike most other whales because they have what appears to be a giant tusk. But that's not actually a tusk at all\u2014what you're seeing is a tooth. Harvard University's Martin Nweeia told the BBC that the \"tooth is almost like a piece of skin in the sense that it has all these sensory nerve endings,\" adding that it's \"essentially built inside out.\"\n8 The world's oldest known breed of domesticated dog dates back to 329 BC.\nDogs are well known for being man's best friend, and it turns out that's a relationship that goes back longer than you might expect. According to Guinness World Records, the oldest known breed of domesticated dog goes all the way back to 329 BC. \"Saluki dogs were revered in ancient Egypt, being kept as royal pets and being mummified after death,\" they note. \"There are carvings found in Sumer (present-day southern Iraq) which represent a dog, closely resembling a saluki, which date back to 7000 BC.\"\n9 And the oldest evidence of domesticated cats dates back 9,500 years.\nCats have also been hanging around humans for thousands of years. Guinness World Records reports that we've been domesticating cats for 9,500 years. Proof of this came in 2004 when the \"bones of a cat were discovered in the neolithic village of Shillourokambos on Cyprus. The position of the cat in the ground was next to the bones of a human, whose similar state of preservation strongly suggests they were buried together.\"\n10 Puffins use twigs to scratch their bodies.\nPuffins surely have enough to be proud of with their beautiful beaks, but the seabirds also happen to be quite clever. According to a 2019 study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), Atlantic puffins in both Wales and Iceland were observed \"spontaneously using a small wooden stick to scratch their bodies.\" Indeed, in a video shared by Science, a little puffin can be seen picking up a tiny twig before using it to scratch an itchy spot on its belly.\n11 Bottlenose dolphins are even more right-handed than humans.\n\"Most humans (say 70 percent to 95 percent) are right-handed, a minority (say 5 percent to 30 percent) are left-handed,\" according to Scientific American. And the same holds true for bottlenose dolphins. In fact, the savvy swimmers are even more right-handed than we are. A team led by Florida's Dolphin Communication Project took a look at the feeding behavior of bottlenose dolphins and found that the animals were turning to their left side 99.44 percent of the time, which \"actually suggests a right-side bias,\" according to IFL Science. \"It places the dolphin's right side and right eye close to the ocean floor as it hunts.\"\n12 There's a kind of ant that only lives in a small area of Manhattan.\nIf you're ever in the area of \"the Broadway medians at 63rd and 76th streets\" in New York City, keep an eye on the ground for crawling critters and you might spot something rare. That's where the \"ManhattAnt\" can be found, an ant that only lives in the one small area of the city. \"It's a relative of the cornfield ant, and it looks like it's from Europe, but we can't match it up with any of the European species,\" Rob Dunn, a biology professor at North Carolina State University, told the New York Post. Dunn and his team discovered the isolated ant variety in 2012.\n13 Cows painted with zebra-like stripes can avoid being bitten by flies.\nCows have to deal with pesky flies that are beyond annoying for the docile creatures. Luckily, farmers can now protect their animals by painting them with zebra-like stripes. According to a 2019 study published in PLOS One, \"the numbers of biting flies on Japanese Black cows painted with black-and-white stripes were significantly lower than those on non-painted cows and cows painted only with black stripes.\" IFL Science suggests this might work because \"the stripes may cause a kind of motion camouflage targeted at the insects' vision, confusing them much in the way that optical illusions \u2026 confuse us.\"\n14 Capuchin monkeys wash their hands and feet in urine.\nMonkeys are undeniably cute. They can also be pretty darn gross. Capuchin monkeys, for example, urinate on their hands and feet when they're feeling \"randy.\" \"We think the alpha males might use urine-washing to convey warm, fuzzy feelings to females, that their solicitation is working and that there's no need to run away,\" primatologist Kimran Miller told NBC News. \"Or they could be doing it because they're excited.\" Either way, ew!\n15 Sperm whales in the Caribbean have an accent.\nPeople who come from different areas around the world tend to speak with inflections, fluctuations, and patterns that are specific to their home regions. Apparently, the same can be said for whales. Researchers from Dalhousie University in Canada and the University of St. Andrews in the UK have found evidence that seems to show whales in the Caribbean have a different \"accent\" than whales in other oceans.\n16 Some pigs in China are the size of bears.\nIn Nanning, the capital of China's Guangxi province, a man named Pang Cong has a rather remarkable animal living on his farm: a 1,102-pound pig. That's roughly the same size as a full-grown adult male polar bear. According to Bloomberg, massive swine of that size \"can sell for more than 10,000 yuan ($1,399), over three times higher than the average monthly disposable income\" in the area.ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb\n17 Some sharks glow in the dark.\nSharks boast some enviable\u2014and terrifying\u2014features, like their sleek design and razor-sharp teeth. And while glow-in-the-dark sharks sound like something you'd see in a sci-fi film, they're totally real, as noted in a 2019 study published in iScience. Researchers were already aware that some shark species produce a glow that only other sharks can see, but now scientists have discovered that \"previously unknown small-molecule metabolites are the cause of the green glow,\" according to CNN. This glow \"helps sharks identify each other and even fight against infection on a microbial level.\"\n18 Some snails have hairy shells.\nWhile it's not a secret that snails have shells, you probably didn't know that some actually have hairy shells. These hairs are rather handy to have, as they help a snail stick to wet surfaces like leaves.\n19 Cowbirds use secret passwords to teach their young.\nCowbirds lay their eggs in other bird species' nests, which means that the little ones eventually need to reconnect with their own kind when the time is right. And when that time comes, the young birds have a trick for figuring out who to reach out to. \"Juvenile cowbirds readily recognize and affiliate with other cowbirds. That's because they have a secret handshake or password,\" according to Science Daily. To put it more simply, they use \"a specific chatter call\" to beckon each other.\n20 Baby Tasmanian devils make life-long friendships.\nIf you have best friends who have been around since you were a child, then you have something in common with Tasmanian devils. Research has shown that Tasmanian devils form bonds when they're young that last for the rest of their lives. As Zoos Victoria's Marissa Parrott told IFL Science, \"In the wild, when baby devils leave their mums, we believe they all socialize together.\" As the website notes, \"young devils have their own dens,\" \"engage in friendly sleep-overs,\" and when given the chance, they prefer \"to share with their \u2026 original friends.\"\n21 A grizzly bear's bite is strong enough to crush a bowling ball.\nThose who find themselves in the presence of a grizzly bear will surely want to stay out of reach of this animal's super sharp claws. But they'll certainly also want to keep out of the grizzly's mouth, because these creatures \"have a bite-force of over 8,000,000 pascals,\" according to National Geographic. That means grizzly bears can literally crush a bowling ball between their jaws. Yikes!\n22 Humpback whales use bubbles to hunt.\nYou might think that a whale's massive size is the only edge they'd need when it comes to hunting in the open waters. But humpback whales actually team up to use a \"bubble-net\" technique in order to catch their prey. \"Sometimes, the whales will swim in an upward spiral and blow bubbles underwater, creating a circular 'net' of bubbles that makes it harder for fish to escape,\" Science News reports.\n23 A housefly buzzes in an F key.\nWhen you hear a housefly buzzing around your home, you might be annoyed by the persistent sound. However, the next time it happens, try to soothe yourself by noting that the airborne pest is actually buzzing in an F key. How melodious!\n24 Moray eels have a second pair of \"Alien-style\" jaws.\nIf you already thought that eels were kind of creepy, then this fact isn't going to make you feel any better about them. Moray eels have what's called pharyngeal jaws, which are a second pair of \"Alien-style\" jaws that are located in the throat and emerge to grasp prey before pulling the unfortunate meal down into the eel's gullet.\n25 Ducks can surf.\nOver in New Zealand, surfers have noticed the same thing that those who ride the waves in California have witnessed: ducks can surf. The birds do so in order to catch food or simply to move through the water quickly. Sports reporter Francis Malley spotted a female duck and her babies catching a wave and told the New Zealand Herald, \"The mother was surfing on her belly on the whitewash. I've never surfed with ducks before so this was a first.\"\n26 Slow lorises are the only venomous primates.\nThey may be cute, but their bite can kill. According to Popular Science, these adorable animals secrete toxins from a gland in the crook of their inner arms. Their bites have caused anaphylactic shock and even death in humans. Better watch out!\n27 Pigeons can do math.\nYou might think of pigeons as\u2026 not that smart. But it turns out, they're actually quite intelligent. In fact, one 2011 study published in the journal Science found that the birds are capable of doing math at the same level as monkeys. During the study, the pigeons were asked to compare nine images, each containing a different number of objects. The researchers found that the birds were able to rank the images in order of how many objects they contained. Put simply, they learned that the birds could count!\n28 Zebra stripes act as a natural bug repellant.\nCows may benefit from artificial stripes, but zebras have the real deal. One 2012 report published in the Journal of Experimental Biology suggests that zebras' black and white stripes may be an evolutionary feature to fend off harmful horsefly bites. \"A zebra-striped horse model attracts far fewer horseflies than either homogeneous black, brown, grey or white equivalents,\" the researchers wrote.\n29 Wild chimps like to drink.\nHumans aren't the only animals who enjoy a drink or two. A 2015 study published in the journal Royal Society Open Science reveals that chimpanzees in Guinea had a fondness for imbibing fermented palm sap and getting tipsy in the process.\n30 Sea otters are adept at using tools.\nWhile many scientists believe that tool use among dolphins is a relatively new phenomenon, a 2017 study published in Biology Letters suggests that otters may have been using tools for millions of years. Sea otters frequently use rocks to break open well-armored prey, such as snails.\n31 Frogs can freeze without dying.\nWhy tolerate the cold when you could just freeze yourself solid? According to Kenneth Storey, a professor at Carleton University in Ottawa, frogs undergo repeated freeze-thaw cycles. \"We have false springs here all the time where it gets really warm and all the snow melts and then suddenly\u2014bam\u2014the wind comes from the north and it's back down to minus 10, minus 15 [Celsius], and they're fine,\" Storey told National Geographic.\n32 Male horses have way more teeth than their female counterparts.\nMale horses have 40 to 42 permanent teeth, while females have just 36 to 40. According to the VCA Animal Hospital, the original purpose of these extra teeth was as fighting weaponry.\n33 Koalas sleep up to 22 hours a day.\nIf you thought your cat was sleepy, just wait until you hear about koalas. According to the Australian Koala Foundation, these cuties sleep between 18 and 22 hours a day. The koalas' diets require a lot of energy to digest, which is why they've got to nap so much.\n34 A group of ferrets is called a business.\nNo, it's not because they're so professional\u2014it's a modernized form of \"busyness,\" the word originally used to describe a group of these weasel-related mammals.\n35 Octopuses can taste with their arms.\nAnd yes, they are called arms, not tentacles. According to the Library of Congress, the animals can taste and grab with the suckers on their arms. Even more impressive? Octopuses are capable of moving at speeds of up to 25 miles per hour.\n36 Dolphins have names for one another.\nYou already know that dolphins are smart. But did you know that they even have their own names? One 2013 study published in PNAS found that bottlenose dolphins develop specific whistles for one another.\n37 Reindeer eyes turn blue in the winter.\nReindeers have beautiful baby blues\u2014but only in the winter! According to the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, \"the eyes of Arctic reindeer change color through the seasons from gold to blue, adapting to extreme changes of light levels in their environment.\" The change in color impacts how light is reflected through the animals' retina, and improves their vision.\n38 Giraffes have black tongues.\nScientists believe that it's so they don't get sunburns while they eat. The animals' tongues are also around 20 inches long.\n39 Alligators will let manatees swim ahead of them.\nIn busy waters, manatees will nudge alligators to get in front, and alligators generally oblige.\n40 Sloths can take up to a month to completely digest a single leaf.\nEverything about life is slow for these sleepy mammals. Most sloths will only have a bowel movement once a week, and it can take them up to 30 days to completely digest a single leaf. For comparison, it takes the average human 12 to 48 hours to ingest, digest, and eliminate waste from food.\n41 Adult cats only meow at humans.\nYou probably know that cats love to talk to their humans. But did you know you're unlikely to see your feline friend interact the same way with another cat? That's because other than kittens meowing at their mothers, cats don't meow at other cats.\n42 Elephants and humans have similar self-soothing techniques.\nElephant calves will suck their trunks to comfort themselves. The babies do it for the same reason humans do (it mimics the action of suckling their mothers).\n43 Female bats give birth to babies that weigh up to a third of their weight.\nAccording to Bat Conservation International, bats give birth to babies\u2014known as pups\u2014that can weigh as much as one-third of the mother's weight. If that doesn't sound like a lot, imagine a person giving birth to a baby that weighed 40 pounds.\n44 Painted turtles survive winter by breathing through their butts.\nNot all creatures head to warmer climates when it gets cold out, and that means they need to learn to survive in chilly conditions. Painted turtles need to adapt to frozen ponds, which restrict their access to the air above the water. They do that by breathing through their butts\u2014specifically, the all-purpose orifice called the cloaca. Thanks to a process called cloacal respiration, the turtles are able to get oxygen directly from the water around them.\n45 Dogs have way fewer taste buds than humans.\nWhile you may think that Fido has the same dinnertime experience as you do, he's actually got a much different taste bud arrangement. Humans have about 9,000 taste buds, while dogs have only around 1,700. And while they can identify the same four taste sensations as people, dogs are not fond of salt.\n46 Otters have the world's thickest fur.\nThey're thought to have up to one million hairs per square inch. Their fur consists of two layers and is designed to trap a layer of air next to their skin so their skin doesn't get wet.\n47 Alligators can grow for more than 30 years.\nAccording to a 2018 study published in Copeia, alligators often haven't hit their full size until 33.\n48 A group of owls is called a parliament.\nTheir legislative powers, however, are still up for debate.\n49 Snow leopards don't roar.\nSnow leopards have less-developed vocal cords than their fellow large cats, meaning that they can't roar, but make a purr-like sound called a chuff instead. For a 2010 study published in the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, scientists researched why some cats have a higher-pitched meow than others. They found that it's not size that determines a kitty's call, but habitat.\n50 Axolotls can regenerate their parts.\nThe salamanders are the only vertebrates that can replace their skin, limbs, tail, jaws, and spines at any age. On the flip side, humans can regenerate lost limb buds as embryos and fingertips as young children.\n51 A group of rhinos is called a crash.\nIndividual male rhinos are referred to as bulls, and females as cows.\n52 Squirrels will adopt orphans.\nTurns out, squirrels have an intense motherly instinct. One 2010 study by researchers at the University of Guelph found that the animals will take in the orphaned pups of their late family members.\n\"Social animals, including lions and chimpanzees, are often surrounded by relatives, so it's not surprising that a female would adopt an orphaned family member because they have already spent a lot of time together,\" said lead researcher Andrew McAdam, an evolutionary biologist. \"But red squirrels live in complete isolation and are very territorial. The only time they will allow another squirrel on their territory is the one day a year when the females are ready to mate or when they are nursing their pups.\"\n53 Giant anteaters have two-foot tongues.\nAccording to National Geographic, it's the longest tongue of any known mammal.\n54 Cows have best friends.\nCows have stronger social ties than you might think. One 2013 study conducted by researchers at the University of Northampton found that when cows were separated from their BFFs, their heart rates increased as a sign of stress.\n55 Moths experience love at first scent.\nWhen a male moth catches a whiff of a female moth, he'll travel miles to find her\u2060\u2014based off her scent alone. According to the experts at Audobon, \"they don't know what the female sounds like, or even what she looks like. But when they smell her, boy, do they know it, and they use her seductive musk to track her down.\"\n56 Horses have distinct facial expressions.\nHorses can make 17 facial movements, which is 3 more than chimps and only 10 fewer than humans, according to a 2015 study published in PLOS One.\n57 Deer can run up to 35 miles per hour.\nYes, white-tailed deer can hit top speeds of 35 miles per hour. Think that's fast? Reindeer can run up to 50 miles per hour.\n58 An octopus has three hearts.\nOctopuses have two more hearts than you do. Two hearts are used to pump blood to their gills, while the third brings blood to the rest of their body. If that's not enough, they also have nine brains.\n59 Some worms can jump.\nCertain species of the Amynthas worm, which have recently been identified in the Midwestern United States, can jump and detach their tails when disturbed.\n60 Crocodiles can live up to 100.\nNile crocodiles can live for a full century. And they can do a lot of damage over the course of those 100 years: Approximately 200 people die every year from Nile crocodile attacks.\n61 Ravens are masters of deception.\nJust how smart are ravens? A 2002 study published in Animal Behaviour found that these tricky birds have the ability to deceive each other. The entire corvid family\u2014which includes crows, ravens, and jays\u2014is exceptionally intelligent. These birds have also been known to play pranks on one another, and to tease other animals.\n62 Rats laugh.\nWhile scientists don't exactly think they have a sense of humor, rats will make a laugh-like sound when tickled.\n63 Tigers have striped skin.\nYou might think it's just their fur, but no, tigers have striped skin. And speaking of those stripes, much like our fingerprints, they're unique to every tiger.\n64 Cats recognize their own name but choose not to respond.\nSorry, cat owners, you're not just being paranoid: Your pet does know when you're calling their name, and they're ignoring you anyway. In a 2019 study published in Scientific Reports, researchers discovered that while cats can distinguish their own name, they don't necessarily feel obligated to respond.\n65 Cows produce more milk when listening to slow music.\nCall it a moo-d. Researchers at the University of Leicester School of Psychology found that cows produced 1.54 more pints per day\u2014a 3 percent increase\u2014when they were played slow music, as opposed to more upbeat tunes.\n66 Butterflies taste with their feet.\nNot only do butterflies taste using their feet\u2014the receptors on their legs are also 200 times stronger than human taste buds. When a butterfly lands on a plant, they use these sensors to determine whether or not what they're standing on is edible.\n67 The spur-winged goose's diet makes it poisonous.\nDon't plan on eating a spur-winged goose if you happen to come across one during your travels. These birds, natives of sub-Saharan Africa, have flesh that's often poisonous to humans, thanks to their diet of blister beetles, which contain the deadly cantharidin poison.\n68 Vampire bat saliva keeps blood from clotting.\nVampire bats do more than just bite their prey\u2014they also keep the other animal's blood from clotting. Their saliva works as an anticoagulant, so that the blood can flow freely as they feed. Here's another fun fact: The protein in the anticoagulant has been nicknamed \"Draculin.\" Spooky!\n69 Wombat poop is cube-shaped.\nWombats use their droppings to warn other animals to stay off their turf. Luckily, their cube-shaped poop makes it easy to see that a spot is governed by wombats, as the little squares tend to stay put more easily than spherical droppings would.\n70 Giraffes with darker spots are more dominant.\nYou can learn a lot from the color of a giraffe's spots. According to a 2019 study in Animal Behaviour, giraffes with darker spots are more dominant than giraffes with lighter spots. And not only that: Dark-spotted giraffes also tend to be more solitary.\n71 Orcas can learn to speak dolphin.\nGroups of killer whales have their own dialects that are further influenced by the company they keep. A 2014 study published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America revealed that orcas housed with bottlenose dolphins over a long period of time were able to replicate the dolphins' language.\n72 Queen mole rats make other female mole rats infertile.\nTo ensure her dominance, the queen mole rat works to make it impossible for other female mole rats to have litters. In fact, the queen can produce a substance in her urine that renders other female mole rats infertile.\n73 Horned lizards squirt blood from their eyes.\nThe horned lizard has a pretty impressive trick for evading predators. When a horned lizard finds itself in a perilous situation, it can squirt a stream of blood from its eyes. The predator then runs off, because, well, wouldn't you?\n74 Catfish have taught themselves how to kill pigeons.\nRelax, pigeons\u2014it's not all catfish. But yes, in southwestern France, a group of European catfish have learned to kill pigeons, launching themselves out of the water to grab the sunbathing birds.\n75 Primitive crocodiles could gallop.\nIf you think crocodiles aren't frightening enough, consider this: They used to gallop. While modern-day crocodiles can move surprisingly fast, giant crocodiles during the Cretaceous period could use their legs to chase and kill dinosaurs.\nAdditional reporting by Desir\u00e9e O."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphin Evolution | Dolphins World", "url": "https://www.dolphins-world.com/dolphin-evolution/", "text": "A DOLPHIN STORY\nThe initial presence of dolphins on the Earth dates back millions of years. It is hard to believe, but scientists think that the earliest ancestors of dolphins were not marine creatures. They were terrestrial animals that today seem to have little in common with dolphins.\nThe fossil records indicate that the origin of all members of the modern order Cetacea is the order Artiodactyla, a group whose members are terrestrial mammals being their closest living relatives those belonging to the family Hippopotamidae (Hippopotamuses). Artiodactyls have two fused fingers, and the tip of their legs are called hooves.\nMany signs prove that dolphins have terrestrial origins. They need to come to the surface of the water to get air is one factor. Their bones strongly resemble the limbs of many animals that live on land. Dolphins have spines that move vertically, and this is a characteristic mainly found in animals that can run on land. When you look at the movements of fish, their spines move horizontally.\nThe process of evolution can be very slow, and it allows living creatures to develop an anatomy that is structured to thrive in their environment.\nThe size and the shape of the skull have changed over time too. It has become larger which is an indication that the development of the fat pad in the lower jaw emerged. It extends to the middle ear, and this helps dolphins to be able to hear as well as to use the process of echolocation.\nWhat is interesting though is that unlike many other mammals, they didn\u2019t change to being herbivores. Instead, they continued to be carnivorous in the water as they would have been on land.\nThe nostrils later evolved into blowholes, so they spend less energy when reaching the surface of the water to breathe. The movement of the ears closer to the eyes is also part of the evolution process. Those changes over time helped them survive in the water.\nThe body of actual dolphins does show two small pelvic bones that are rod shaped. These limbs aren\u2019t on the outside, but they are vestigial legs.\nThe most direct link of the first cetaceans in the line of the artiodactyls is with the extinct taxonomic family Raoellidae, whose members lived during the early and middle Eocene in China, Pakistan, India, and Mongolia. They were hoofed mammals looking for their food walking near bodies of water.\nScientists believe that the oldest ancestors of dolphins were land animals and not aquatic.\nIn 1983 the fossil of an animal that the scientists named Pakicetus was discovered in Pakistan. The bones were of an elementally terrestrial mammal believed to have been an archaic cetacean because although it could remain on land, it also ventured into shallow waters. The pakicetidae family, these first cetaceans, appeared about 50 million years ago during the Eocene.\nThey had four legs and hooves such as camels and horses. We know now that the bone structure of the flippers of dolphins is similar to that of the extremities of mammals, with five phalanges and joints. Thus, the family pakicetidae was a transition link between the exclusively terrestrial mammals and the aquatic as they started to spend more and more time in the water.\nAnother theory suggests that modern cetaceans have their origin in mesonychids (Mesonychid family), a group of carnivorous ungulate mammals with teeth similar to whales and also related to artiodactyls that lived 55 million years ago and began to inhabit shallow water regions due to shortages of food supplies on land and climate changes.\nAfter that, the following 15 million years the archaic cetaceans continued developing evolutionary modifications to adapt to life at sea. They still had paws and depended on the land to raise their offspring, but they were looking for their food in the ocean. The family of the Archaeoceti (Family Archaeoceti) to which the Pakicetus belonged, evolved from the Mesonickids and lasted until the Eocene-Oligocene, becoming increasingly aquatic members.\nIn the late Eocene, 38-45 million years ago, basilosaurids (Basilosauridae Family) appeared and lived, fully aquatic archaeocytes whose limbs were more elongated resembling the flippers. The base of their skull enlarged as it happens with modern whales and their hind legs were already atrophied; Possibly only used during mating.\nCetaceans with beards (Mysticeti) and toothed (Odontoceti) separated from a common ancestor about 35 million years ago. Since the early Miocene, the Odontoceti species developed echolocation as they have now.\nSometime about 12-15 million years ago, the first Dolphins of the Delphinidae family appeared. Among the first dolphins were Kentriodon and Hadrodelphis, belonging to the Kentriodontidae family and inhabitants of the ocean during the late Oligocene and Miocene.\nGenetic studies show the current relationship of cetaceans to the Hippopotamidae family, which extends from the early Miocene.\n12-15 million years ago, the first Dolphins of the Delphinidae family appeared.\nFAMOUS ANCESTORS\nSome dolphin ancestors are here below. However, they are cetaceans in general, and they are not specifically dolphins.\nSimocetus rayi.\nThis species was present in the Oligocene, 30-34 million years ago in the northern Pacific Ocean. It had a length of 2 or 3 meters, and perhaps its head housed a small melon. Its snout was curved downward, and it had a blowhole positioned forward and lacked dental alveoli (divisions of alveolar bone) in the incisors. Its diet consisted mainly of mollusks and crustaceans.\nWaipatia maerewhenua.\nThis species existed 24-26 million years ago in the southeast Pacific Ocean. It was about 3 meters long and resembled modern river dolphins because of its long snout and heterodont dentition (with multiple dental forms).\nZygophyseter varolai.\nIt inhabited the Earth during the Miocene 8.4-10.5 million years ago in what is now the Mediterranean Sea. Its length was between 6.5 and 7 meters and physically resembled a sperm whale although this cetacean had long teeth. Its feeding habits were comparable to those of the extant Orcas or killer whales (Orcinus orca).\nMessapicetus.\nA genus of odontocete cetaceans that lived 9-13 million years ago during the Miocene period. It measured between 3 and 5 meters in length, and its aspect was very similar to the present dolphins. Their cranial features indicate that they probably used echolocation and possessed a melon. They fed on fish and squid.\nMODERN DOLPHINS\nDolphins with current physical characteristics appeared on the planet only about 5 million years ago. In fact, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) saw the Earth initially 2-5 million years ago. Since then there have been no drastic changes in their morphology, although there have been adaptations related to its distribution, habitat and food availability.\nReferences\nhttps://dolphins.org/physiology\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_cetaceans\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin#Evolution\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1088639/\nhttp://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evograms_03"}

(An animal that there are fossil records of from around this time named Pakicetus may represent this initial stage). For some reason, this change must have suited them, as they gradually evolved, and their bodies changed form, so that they eventually lost the ability to move onto the land at all. An interim stage in this development is represented by the Protocetids and examples of the first exclusively aquatic dwelling form are the Durudon and the 60 foot/18 metre long Basilosaurus. They lived some 38 million years ago.\nIllustration source: Cetacean Palaeobiology, University of Bristol, Department of Earth Sciences\nAbout 30 million years ago, Squalodon appeared; a toothed whale. Although it probably was not a direct ancestor of dolphins, it appeared to use echolocation, a key attribute that would become a vital skill later to modern dolphins.\nDuring the early Miocene (about 20 million years ago), echolocation developed in its modern form. Various extinct dolphin-like families flourished belonging to Kentriodontidae, which were small to medium-sized toothed cetaceans and thought likely to include ancestors of some modern species. Kentriodontids date to the late Oligocene to late Miocene. Kentriodontines ate small fish and other organisms; they are thought to have been active echolocators, and might have formed schools.\nThe genus Tursiops, which bottlenose dolphins belong to, first appeared in the fossil record about five million years ago.\nMovie clips on the evolution of dolphins and whales\nThe Evolutionary History of Whales \u2013 Cetacean Evolution Part 1\nEvery Living Whale Family \u2013 Cetacean Evolution Part 2\nWould you like to learn more about the lives of dolphins in a fun and entertaining way?

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphin Communication | Dolphins World", "url": "https://www.dolphins-world.com/dolphin-communication/", "text": "Dolphin Language and Communication\nCommunication, strictly meaning, involves the transmission and feedback of coded messages. However, the complexity of the communication processes seems to be exclusive to the human race.\nDespite this, it is clear that dolphins have a sophisticated communication system which is the reason for their success against their predators. In short, dolphins survive because they communicate with each other and this allows them to organize and cooperate to increase their probabilities of survival.\nHOW DO DOLPHINS COMMUNICATE?\nDolphins communicate through the emission and reception of sounds; Each dolphin develops its distinctive sound since the first years of life. All individuals produce a unique sound, which is different to the others so they can fully identify each other.\nDolphins emit two types of vocal sounds: continuous tone and burst-pulsed sounds.\nBut, how do they produce these sounds? While dolphins are devoid of vocal cords, they emit sounds through their larynx, in the region of the nasal air sacs. These sounds do not mean that dolphins have a voice, but there is a tissue in the nasal area that has structures that project in the duct. When the air passes through that section, the tissue vibrates, and so the sound is produced.\nDolphins emit two types of vocal sounds: continuous tone and burst-pulsed sounds. The first type includes whistles, squeaks and some species of squeals. They are \u201cfrequency modulated sounds\u201d because dolphins modify the tone of the sound, this is, it can rise and fall over time. The burst-pulsed sounds are recognized by the superposition of sound waves and refer to the \u201cclicks,\u201d produced successively at regular intervals.\nWHERE, WHEN, WHAT\nDifferent emissions, different context. Dolphins can make sounds to interact socially: when they separate from their peers, when they are excited, when alarmed or just when they feel happy. The sound depends on the situation. Lost dolphins have been observed to produce whistles frantically in an attempt to call their companions, and individuals of some species emit pulsating sounds if they become excited or angry; Apparently, this is intended to make known their emotional state to other dolphins.\nSometimes bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) produce a blast that invites other individuals to play, as a way of informing them that they are in a good mood and want to have fun with them. Very high pulsating sounds are used during aggressive encounters to call other dolphins, and others direct to the genital area of \u200b\u200bfemales when males chase them and flee. Mothers often whistle their offspring for several days after birth.\nBottlenose dolphins distinguish different frequencies depending on what they want to communicate. Low-frequency sounds (0.25-50 kilohertz) are used to communicate in social situations while high frequencies serve in echolocation. Another case: during the aggressive persecutions of Indo-Pacific dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), they issue a kind of crunch that is called \u201cpop\u201d sound.\nThe human ear perceives successive clicks as a sound without interruption, but the truth is that they are short. We do not know much about the purpose of the different sound emissions and researchers are still working on sound-target identification.\nSIGNALS WITHOUT \u201cVOICE.\u201d\nAlthough dolphins rely primarily on sounds to exchange information, they also communicate through touch and body language:\nIdentification of body coloring patterns.\nStains, stripes, and specks may indicate to other dolphins the health status or the age of their companions. For example, the skin of the Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) develops spots when it begins to get old, and the scars in the skin of the Risso dolphin (Grampus griseus) informs others of their combat skills and experience.\nPostures.\nThe body positions convey the idea of \u200b\u200bthe dolphin\u2019s mood. An S-shaped posture demonstrates anger or aggression and is a way of saying \u201cdo not mess with me now.\u201d If they are in a fight, they can expand their pectoral fins and extend their jaws to look bigger and more dangerous.\nTouch.\nThe skin of these cetaceans is very sensitive to the touch. If they are in a good mood, then they can make physical contact with the flippers by pressing them against the flippers of another dolphin.\nTail Slapping.\nIt is a vertical blow of the tail against the water surface that often indicates aggressiveness, but it can also express the desire to leave the area where they are or ask for attention.\nFlipper Slapping.\nIt probably has the same goals as the blows on the surface with the tail, but in this case, Dolphins hit their flippers against their body or the water surface.\nDOLPHIN LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION\nDolphins are almost constantly making one of two kinds of sounds: communicative or navigational. They produce these different sounds in a variety of ways.\nEcholocation sounds are produced in their nasal passages just below their blowholes and are called clicks. Dolphins create these clicks sometimes in such rapid succession that they sound like buzzes or even quacks. These sounds are produced just behind the melon, an oily, slightly off-center lump on what you\u2019d call the dolphin\u2019s forehead, and the sound waves are focused forward through this organ.\nScientists are not entirely certain how the melon works, but it does seem to amplify, clarify and direct the dolphin\u2019s echolocation sounds which allow dolphins to detect remarkably detailed information from the world around them. In one test, a dolphin found a marble-sized sphere at more than the length of a football field. Some scientists speculate that echolocation sounds may also be used to deliver an acoustic shock to small prey.\nIn the larynx, dolphins can produce high-pitched whistles and squeals which can rapidly change pitch. Whistles are single tones, with no vibrations that make them sound like buzzes. As far as scientists can tell, the whistles are a form of communication with other dolphins, and squeals are used to express alarm or sexual excitement.\nDOLPHIN COMMUNICATION\nLike some other animals, dolphins do have communication. But do they communicate linguistically? There\u2019s some evidence for it. Dolphins tend to stay within their pods and may have trouble understanding \u201cforeign\u201d dolphins. In studies done on dolphins near Scotland, individuals appear to have names; or at least, other dolphins use specific and unique whistles only in the presence of certain other dolphins, as if calling them by name. Unlike any other animal besides humans, dolphins exhibit a tendency to take turns when vocalizing \u2013 making their communications sound like a conversation.\nThere have also been very basic linguistic studies of dolphin sound patterns. According to some studies, dolphin sounds follow the same basic patterns of all human-based language, from Morse code to Chinese.\nReferences\nhttps://dolphins.org/communication\nDenise L. Herzing.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Fin-tastic Facts About The Baiji Dolphin For Kids - Kidadl", "url": "https://kidadl.com/animal-facts/baiji-facts", "text": "Baiji Interesting Facts\nWhat type of animal is a baiji?\nBaiji is a type of freshwater dolphin. It is possibly an extinct species of river dolphins now. The Yangtze river dolphin had sharp teeth and a beaklike nose. The baiji stomach was divided into three compartments where a regular dolphin had two compartments.\nWhat class of animal does a baiji belong to?\nThe baiji dolphin belongs to the mammal class. They were one of the five species of river dolphins found in the world. This species of river dolphins (popularly known as Yangtze river dolphin) is now regarded as extinct.\nHow many baijis are there in the world?\nAccording to the whales and dolphin conservation experts, the baijis are a near-extinct species. In the 1950s, there were some 6000 baijis in the Yangtze river. But their population depleted drastically after that. There are some unconfirmed sightings of one or two baijis in Yangtze river, but that can not be substantiated.\nWhere does a baiji live?\nThe baijis were native to the Yangtze river in China before their feared extinction. It was the only species of river dolphins found in the Yangtze river.\nWhat is a baiji's habitat?\nThese endangered river dolphins were found in the warm and temperate water zones. The baijis were found in the freshwater of river Yangtze in China. They were also found in the fresh water lakes of Poyang and Dongting. Baijis were seen close to the sandbars, which are created at the entry point of tributaries. Sediments deposited in this water are ideal for baijis, as they are nutrient-rich and have smaller fish for their consumption.\nWho do baiji live with?\nBaijis were social in nature and lived in groups called schools before they were endangered. They were known to be shy and don't interact much. Their sonar system was an important part of their socializing, alerting predators about group coordination, and expressing emotions.\nHow long does a baiji live?\nNot much is known about the baiji behavioral pattern and life span as they are very varied in human interaction. But the last found baiji some years back was calculated to be 24 years old.\nHow do they reproduce?\nThe mating rituals of the baijis are a mystery too. The ovulation in females is periodic, and the sperm density in male baijis is varied as per the season. The mating season is believed to be twice a year, during spring and autumn. The mating process can take place between only those males and females who have attained sexual maturity. The female baijis have a gestation period of 6-12 months after which she gives birth to one baby. Male baijis reach sexual maturity at four years and female baijis reach sexual maturity at eight years of age.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nBaijis are critically endangered, possibly extinct. The primary threat to the Baiji population was bycatch. The other protection threats were pollution, dams, vessel collision, and prey depletion due to excessive fishing. The noise pollution around and inside the river also weakened their sonar navigation system. The dam built on the river blocked the migration of the baijis in the lakes and tributaries. Their protection status is now critically endangered or extinct.\nBaiji Fun facts\nWhat do baijis look like?\nBaijis look like the cute bottle-shaped mouth dolphins we have watched in many movies. The baijis have greyish bluish-colored skin and a white underbelly. They have a broad, stocky body with round flippers. The dorsal fin is small and triangular with a wide base and located more than halfway back. Their long beak-like mouth is slightly upturned at the tip. They have tiny eyes positioned higher up on the head.\nHow cute are they?\nDolphins are considered to be one of the cutest sea animals ever. These mammals are known to be friendly and caring with their offspring and others too. The baijis are intelligent, smart, and a bit aloof too.\nHow do they communicate?\nThe baiji uses echolocation to navigate and find food. They would communicate with others using whistles and other such acoustic signals.\nHow big is a baiji?\nThe baijis are large animals with a maximum length of 2.6m. They are definitely longer than many species found in the surrounding region.\nHow fast can a baiji swim?\nThe baijis are fast swimmers with a speed of 37 mph. They use that sonar system for swimming and looking for food or any danger.\nHow much does a baiji weigh?\nThe baijis weigh 92.5-368 lb. The female baijis are heavier and longer than male baijis. The average female baijis weigh 141-368 lb, and a male baiji will weigh 92.5-275 lb.\nWhat are their male and female names of the species?\nLike other dolphins, the females baijis are called 'cows', and the male baijis are called 'bulls'.\nWhat would you call a baby baiji?\nThe baby baiji is called a 'calf'.\nWhat do they eat?\nThe baijis eat other smaller fish. They use their long mouth to probe the muddy bottoms for food. They use echolocation to find food. They eat both surface and bottom feeders. The baijis eat fishes like carp, yellow catfish, and copper fish. They swallow the whole fish.\nDo humans eat them?\nDolphin meat is considered a delicacy in some countries like Japan. But due to the near extinction of Baiji, humans can\u2019t hunt and eat them, it is against the law.\nWould they make a good pet?\nThe near extinction of the Baiji dolphins has caused great concern for humans. The collective industrialization and habitat loss have led to losing a rare animal on this planet. Therefore we must look at conserving our animal and plant kingdom in their natural habitat. It wouldn't be advisable to make such a rare species our pet, you wouldn't even be able to find any if they are extinct, too.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nDid you know...\nBaiji dolphin is possibly the first species of dolphin to go extinct due to the impact of human behavior.\nBaiji was regarded as the goddess of the Yangtze river. The fisherman and boatmen believed the baiji dolphin protected them.\nAccording to Chinese folklore, there was a beautiful young girl who lived with her evil step father. He took the girl on a boat to sell her in the markets. Out on the river, the man was completely smitten by the girl's beauty and tried to take advantage of her. The girl jumped into the river to protect herself and a big storm followed which sank the boat. After the storm settled, people could see beautiful dolphins swimming in the river, which they thought was an incarnation of the girl. Thus, baiji is regarded as the symbol of peace and prosperity in the region.\nDuring the Great Leap Forward, the people forgot the reverence with which the baiji dolphin was worshipped and it was hunted for its skin and flesh which also led to a drastic depletion of its population.\nThe baiji is the only member of the mammal family called Lipotidae.\nParts of baiji skeleton and stomach anatomy are unique. The baiji has three compartments in the stomach. Other dolphins have two.\nThe female baiji is larger than male baijis.\nA group of baiji dolphins is called school, pod or herd.\nThe mother baiji trains its baby baiji to swim, how to raise to the surface for air, and other things. The calf of the baiji dolphin may nurse until it is 18 months old, but that time the mother baiji teaches the baby baiji to hunt for small fishes.\nWhy did baijis go extinct?\nThe Yangtze river is the third-longest and largest river in the world and the biggest in the river in Asia. The main reasons for the extinction of baiji are Chinese industrialization, excessive fishing, bycatch, water and noise pollution. The Yangtze river is a source of livelihood for almost 12% of the world's population. This creates enormous pressure on the ecosystem of the river and baiji\u2019s delicate habitat too. The baiji dolphin sensitivity to noise due tod its echolocation system was a major reason why it was getting increasingly difficult for the dolphin to survive.\nWhy are baijis called white dolphins?\nBaiji are called white dolphins because in Chinese, 'baiji' means white finned dolphin.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly animal facts for everyone to discover! Learn more about some other mammals including spinner dolphin, or common dolphin.\nYou can even occupy yourself at home by drawing one on our Baiji dolphin coloring pages."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Pacific White-Sided Dolphin | NOAA Fisheries", "url": "https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/pacific-white-sided-dolphin", "text": "Pacific White-Sided Dolphin. Credit: NOAA Fisheries\nAbout the Species\nPacific white-sided dolphins, known for the distinct coloring that give them their name, are a playful and highly social marine mammal. They are also sometimes known as the \u201chookfin porpoise\u201d because of their large, curved dorsal fin, though they are not technically porpoises. In the United States, Pacific white-sided dolphins live off the coasts of California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. They can be seen traveling in schools of thousands, but group sizes are usually between 10 and 100 animals. These extremely playful dolphins are often seen \u201cbow riding\u201d (swimming near the front part of a ship) and jumping, somersaulting, or even spinning in the air. Pacific white-sided dolphins in the United States are not endangered or threatened, but they are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. A primary threat to Pacific white-sided dolphins is entanglement in fishing gear, such as gillnets and trawls. NOAA Fisheries is dedicated to the conservation and protection of Pacific white-sided dolphins. We are working to help conserve this species through collaborative management, integrated science, partnerships, and outreach.\nPopulation Status\nNOAA Fisheries estimates the population size for Pacific white-sided dolphins in its stock assessment reports. In all, there are three stocks of Pacific white-sided dolphins in U.S. waters. Population trends for the North Pacific stock off the coast of Alaska are unknown. A survey of the two stocks off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California from 2008 to 2014 found a population of more than 21,000 dolphins.\nProtected Status\nCITES Appendix II Throughout Its Range MMPA Protected Throughout Its Range\nAppearance\nThese dolphins have a robust body, short rostrum (snout), and large dorsal fin compared to their overall body size. Their back, flukes (tail), and lips are black; their sides, dorsal fin, and flippers are gray; and their belly is white. They have a white or light gray stripe along their sides that extends from their eye to their tail, sometimes referred to as \"suspenders.\" Pacific white-sided dolphins are most likely to be confused with common dolphins and Dall\u2019s porpoises because they have similar large light-colored flank patches. The average adult Pacific white-sided dolphin weighs about 300 to 400 pounds and is between 5.5 and 8 feet long, with males being generally larger than females.\nBehavior and Diet\nPacific white-sided dolphins feed on a variety of prey, such as squid and small schooling fish (capelin, sardines, and herring). They can dive underwater for more than 6 minutes to feed. They have small conical teeth that help them catch and hold on to their prey; each tooth row contains 23 to 36 pairs of teeth. Instead of using their teeth to chew their food, dolphins use their teeth to grip food before swallowing it whole\u2014head first\u2014so the spines of the fish do not catch in their throats. Pacific white-sided dolphins often work together as a group to herd schools of fish. Each adult eats about 20 pounds of food a day.\nWhere They Live\nPacific white-sided dolphins are pelagic, meaning they live in the open ocean and nearshore waters, but are unlikely to be found close to shore. They live in the temperate waters of the North Pacific Ocean. In the United States, they are found off the coast of California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. Worldwide, they are found in the southern Bering Sea (around the Aleutian Islands), Sea of Okhotsk, Sea of Japan, and Yellow and East China Seas to the south of Japan.\nWorld map providing approximate representation of the Pacific white-sided dolphin's range.\nLifespan & Reproduction\nThe Pacific white-sided dolphin can live more than 40 years. Males reach sexual maturity around 10 years and females around 8 to 11. They mate and give birth from late spring to fall, except in the central Pacific, where calves are born in late winter to spring. Gestation is usually 9 to 12 months, and calves weigh about 30 pounds at birth and are about 3 to 4 feet. Mothers nurse their calves for up to 18 months and females usually give birth every 3 years.\nThreats\nInteractions with Fishing Gear One of the main threats to the Pacific white-sided dolphin is entanglement in fishing gear. Dolphins can become entangled or captured in commercial fishing gear such as gillnets, seines, trawls, trap pots, and longlines. Before a 1933 United Nations moratorium that banned large-scale drift nets, Pacific white-sided dolphins were often captured by Japanese fisheries. In addition, every year between 1978 and 1991, thousands of Pacific white-sided dolphins suffered mortality and serious injury when caught incidentally in high-seas fisheries for salmon and squid. These fisheries were closed in 1991 and no other large-scale fisheries have operated in the central North Pacific since 1991. Ocean Noise Low-frequency underwater noise pollution can interrupt the normal behavior of Pacific white-sided dolphins. Noise interference hinders their ability to use sound, which in turn disturbs their ability to communicate, choose mates, find food, avoid predators, and navigate.\nScientific Classification"}

They have a great cultural significance to communities in southeast Asia as a result.\nIrrawaddy dolphins live in coastal areas in South and Southeast Asia, and in a small number of isolated freshwater bodies, including three main rivers: the Mekong (Cambodia, Laos), the Ayeyarwady (Myanmar), and the Mahakam (Borneo) river. They also live in two lakes: Chilka Lake in India, and Songkhla Lake in Thailand.\nThey inhabit a 118-mile stretch of the Mekong river between Cambodia and Laos and are extremely rare, with an estimated 85 dolphins on the verge of extinction.\nIrrawaddy dolphins are endangered due to pollutants in the water, urbanisation close to their coastal homes, fishing reducing their food source and entanglement in nets and climate change.\nInteresting Irrawaddy Dolphin Facts\n1. They are mammals and breathe air\nAt first glance, Irrawaddy dolphins appear to be a type of fish. However, like all dolphins and whales, they are mammals. Irrawaddy dolphins do not have gills and must breathe air from above the surface of the water to survive.\n2. They have unusual habitats\nBodies of water have different salinities, or concentrations of salt. Irrawaddy dolphins are euryhaline, which means that they can survive in a wide range of salinities. They live in areas where low-saline freshwater meets high-saline ocean water. As ocean tides, currents, and other forces mix the waters together, the Irrawaddy dolphin\u2019s body adjusts to the changing salinities.\n3. Irrawaddy dolphins are known for their short noses\nPart of their scientific name, brevirostris, means \u201cshort-beaked.\u201d\n4. They are 1 of 2 species in their genus\nThe Australian snubfin dolphin (Orcaella heinsohni) is the other.1 They were recognized as separate species in 2005.\n5. Their rounded heads have earned them a special name\nIrrawaddy dolphins are known as \u0e42\u0e25\u0e21\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e27\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e15\u0e23 (loma hua bat, or \u201calms-bowl dolphin\u201d) in Thai. The name refers to their head shape, which resembles a bowl used in religious ceremonies.\n6. Irrawaddy dolphins are related to \u201ckiller whales\u201d\nNext to the Australian snubfin dolphin, the Irrawaddy dolphin\u2019s closest relatives are orcas, which are sometimes known as \u201ckiller whales.\u201d Both are oceanic dolphins and members of the Delphinidae family.\n7. They can herd fish by squirting water\nIrrawaddy dolphins can squirt water from their mouths over a distance of 1.5 meters (about 5 feet). They use this ability to force fish into smaller areas, where they are easier to catch.\n8. Irrawaddy dolphins can spyhop\nSome whales and dolphins, including the Irrawaddy dolphin, engage in a behaviour called spyhopping. This is when the animal pokes their head vertically out of the water to survey their surroundings for predators and prey.\n9. They prefer small groups\nIrrawaddy dolphins are usually seen in groups of 2 to 5 individuals, although they are sometimes spotted in groups as large as 15.\n10. Staying in groups keep them safe\nIrrawaddy dolphins are vulnerable to threats from sharks. By staying in groups, they become more difficult to hunt and have better chances of survival.\n11. Groups also help them hunt\nThe dolphins can form a circle around prey such as squid and crabs, preventing them from getting away.\n12. Irrawaddy dolphins can remain underwater a long time\nThey can stay submerged for up to 12 minutes without needing to return to the surface to breathe.\n13. They help people fish\nIrrawaddy dolphins have developed mutualistic relationships with humans in which both the dolphins and the people benefit. The dolphins are known to chase fish into nets for humans. In return, the dolphins are rewarded with a portion of the catch.\n14. Irrawaddy dolphins are bothered by noise\nThese sensitive dolphins are disturbed by noise pollution from boats and other sources. The noise causes them to dive deeper and stay further from populated areas.\n15. They are important in Cambodia and Laotian culture\nIrrawaddy dolphins are sometimes believed by Cambodia and Laotian people to be the reincarnations of ancestors. Some people even claim that dolphins have saved drowning villagers and protected people from attacks by crocodiles.\n16. They are considered sacred\nKhmer and Vietnamese fishers have regarded Irrawaddy dolphins and Australian snubfin dolphins as sacred. If the dolphins are caught in fishing nets, the fishers will release the dolphin from the rest of the catch.\n17. Irrawaddy dolphins have become popular tourist attractions\nBecause Irrawaddy dolphins have little natural fear of humans, they will frequently approach and interact with people. Both wild and captive populations of Irrawaddy dolphins have become tourist attractions.\n18. Special zones have been created to protect them\nLocal governments have established areas to protect Irrawaddy dolphin populations. In these areas, human activity is limited, and the dolphins are kept safe from harm. These efforts are helping to increase the populations of this threatened species.\nIrrawaddy Dolphin Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification"}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Common Bottlenose Dolphin | NOAA Fisheries", "url": "https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/common-bottlenose-dolphin", "text": "Common Bottlenose Dolphin. Credit: NOAA Fisheries\nAbout the Species\nCommon bottlenose dolphins (referred to hereafter simply as bottlenose dolphins) are found throughout the world in both offshore and coastal waters, including harbors, bays, gulfs, and estuaries of temperate and tropical waters (estuaries are the areas where rivers meet the sea). They are one of the most well-studied marine mammals in the wild. In addition, they are easy to view in the wild because they live close to shore and are distributed throughout coastal and estuarine waters. But this puts bottlenose dolphins at increased risk of human-related injuries and death. They are a highly intelligent species and use sound both for communication and to hunt for food. Bottlenose dolphins in the United States are not endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), but they are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). They are vulnerable to many stressors and threats including disease, biotoxins, pollution, habitat alteration including freshwater incursions, vessel strikes, human feeding of and activities causing harassment, interactions with commercial and recreational fishing, energy exploration and oil spills, and other types of human disturbance, such as underwater noise. NOAA Fisheries helps conserve bottlenose dolphins through collaborative management, integrated science, partnerships, and outreach. Our scientists use a variety of innovative techniques to study, protect, and rescue bottlenose dolphins in distress (e.g., disentanglement response and strandings). We facilitate collaborative approaches to better understand and reduce harmful effects of human activities on bottlenose dolphins and their habitat based on sound science, conservation, public input, and public outreach.\nPopulation Status\nLike all marine mammals, bottlenose dolphins are protected under the MMPA. NOAA Fisheries estimates population size for each population of bottlenose dolphins in U.S. waters in stock assessment reports. In all, 61 stocks of common bottlenose dolphins have been identified in U.S. waters. Population trends for many of the U.S. stocks are unknown. Five stocks along the Atlantic Coast are considered depleted under the MMPA.\nProtected Status\nCITES Appendix II Throughout Its Range MMPA Protected Throughout Its Range MMPA Depleted Western North Atlantic Central Florida Coastal stock MMPA Depleted Western North Atlantic Northern Florida Coastal stock MMPA Depleted Western North Atlantic Northern Migratory Coastal stock MMPA Depleted Western North Atlantic South Carolina-Georgia Coastal stock MMPA Depleted Western North Atlantic Southern Migratory Coastal stock\nAppearance\nCommon bottlenose dolphins get their name from their short, thick snout (or rostrum). They are generally gray in color. They can range from light gray to almost black on top near their dorsal fin and light gray to almost white on their belly. Bottlenose dolphins living in nearshore coastal waters are often smaller and lighter in color than those living offshore.\nBehavior and Diet\nBottlenose dolphins may travel alone or in groups, and the groups often break apart and reform. Their travel is characterized by persistent movement in a consistent direction. Resting is often characterized by tight group formations, slow movement, and intervals of methodical breathing. Social behavior includes breeding, playing, aggression, and gentle body contact, such as rubbing. Calves maintain what is called \u201cbaby position\u201d while swimming. In this position, the calf has easy access to nursing and may gain benefits by reducing drag from swimming in it\u2019s mom\u2019s slip stream. When in baby position, the mom surfaces first, and the calf surfaces slightly after and just behind and to the side of its mother. Bottlenose dolphins can thrive in many environments and feed on a variety of prey, such as fish, squid, and crustaceans (e.g., crabs and shrimp). They use different techniques to pursue and capture prey, searching for food individually or cooperatively. For example, they work together to herd fish into groups and then take turns charging through the school of fish to feed. They may also trap schools of fish against sand bars and seawalls for an easy meal. They also use passive listening and/or high frequency echolocation to locate prey. Instead of using their teeth to chew, dolphins grip fish with their teeth, then swallow the fish whole\u2014head first\u2014so the spines of the fish don't catch in their throats.\nWhere They Live\nBottlenose dolphins are found in temperate and tropical waters around the world. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, including harbors, bays, gulfs, and estuaries, as well as nearshore coastal waters, deeper waters over the continental shelf, and even far offshore in the open ocean. In the United States, bottlenose dolphins are found along the West Coast off California, Oregon, and Washington, in the Hawaiian islands along the East Coast from Massachusetts to Florida, throughout the Gulf of Mexico, and in the Caribbean.\nWorld map providing approximate representation of the common bottlenose dolphin's range.\nLifespan & Reproduction\nBottlenose dolphins can live at least 40 years, with some females outliving males at 60 years or more. They generally begin to reproduce when they are between 5 and 15 years old, with the exact age varying by population. Female bottlenose dolphins can reach sexual maturity before males. Females are pregnant for about 12 months and give birth, on average, every 3 to 6 years. Once calves are born, they nurse for 20 months or so and generally stay with their mothers for 3 to 6 years. Females as old as 45 have given birth.\nThreats\nBottlenose dolphins are exposed to a variety of human-caused and natural threats and stressors. Some of the most pressing threats are discussed below. Interactions with Fishing Gear One of the main threats to bottlenose dolphins is getting caught in fishing gear. Dolphins can become entangled or captured in commercial fishing gear such as gillnets, seines, trawls, trap pots, and longlines. In addition to interactions with commercial fisheries, dolphins may become entangled in or ingest rod-and-reel gear used by recreational anglers or for-hire fishing vessels, such as charter boats and headboats, which can lead to serious injury or mortality. This problem is increasing, especially in the southeast United States and is largely the result of dolphins taking the bait and the catch directly from fishing gear, eating discarded fish, or being fed fish (illegally) by humans, causing them to associate anglers with food. In addition, fishermen sometimes become frustrated when dolphins take their catch and can retaliate with violence towards dolphins. Habitat Destruction and Degradation Common bottlenose dolphins living near shore are also susceptible to habitat destruction and degradation by contaminants and oil spills. For example, in areas with high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) dolphin immune systems can be negatively affected. Dolphins in areas affected by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill were found to have compromised immune systems and decreased reproductive success (PDF, 685 pages). In addition to chemical contamination, physical habitat alteration due to shoreline development and infrastructure projects, freshwater diversions, and increased boat traffic is also of concern. Biotoxins Several common bottlenose unusual mortality events (UMEs) have occurred in recent years, linked to harmful algal blooms (HABs), such as red tide. Several HABs (or several HAB-related die-offs) have been confirmed along the coast of Florida and others were suspected elsewhere in the Gulf of Mexico. Dolphins can be exposed to HAB toxins through the air or by eating contaminated prey. Biotoxin exposure can lead to both acute and more chronic health issues for dolphins. Illegal Harassment and Feeding Activities Bottlenose dolphins are easy to view in the wild, but this also puts them at increased risk of human-related injuries and death. Feeding and attempting to feed dolphins is not only illegal under the implementing regulations of the MMPA but is harmful because it changes their behaviors and reduces their wariness of people and vessels. They learn to associate humans with food and change their natural hunting practices by begging for handouts and taking bait/catch directly off fishing gear. Dolphins, including calves, also learn these unnatural and risky feeding strategies from each other. Dolphins are then more vulnerable to vessel strikes and to fishing gear entanglements and ingestion. They also may fall victim to extreme retaliatory acts, such as shooting, by frustrated boaters and fishermen. Dolphins may also be disturbed or harassed by the presence of humans and watercraft. Harassment is illegal under the MMPA and occurs when \u201cany act of pursuit, torment, or annoyance has the potential to injure the animal or disrupt its behaviors.\" The implementing regulations of the MMPA further prohibit \u201cthe negligent or intentional operation of an aircraft or vessel, or the doing of any other negligent act which results in disturbing or molesting a marine mammal.\u201d Any human-caused change to a dolphin\u2019s behavior may constitute disturbance or harassment. Certain critical survival behaviors are particularly vulnerable, and disturbance may lead to injuries or death. Long-term negative effects may include compromised health, reduced reproductive success, and displacement from or avoidance of important habitats.\nScientific Classification"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphin Social Structure | Dolphins World", "url": "https://www.dolphins-world.com/dolphin-social-structure/", "text": "Dolphins are highly sociable mammals that establish close links with other individuals of the same species and even with dolphins of other species sometimes. They seem to show empathic, cooperative, and altruistic behaviors.\nMost species live in groups called pods composed of 2 to 30 dolphins as the number varies, but in some areas with abundant food, many pods can merge forming superpods with more than 1,000 members.\nDolphins depend on this interaction for hunting, mating and defending themselves. In some cases, these superpods include more than one species of cetaceans that seem to interact well together.\nPODS, THE REASON\nWhy do dolphins group? They have several reasons to join, besides following a sample learned since they born. Small dolphin species gather into multi-member pods as a way to compensate for their size when facing predators.\nIn this sense, these groups provide protection to an animal that does not have large jaws or razor sharp teeth. When Dolphins are together, it is easier for them to survive if they cooperate with each other, either through communication or intimidating the predator if it is a large number of individuals.\nDYNAMIC OF THEIR SOCIAL STRUCTURES\nIt seems that dolphins are free spirits. Studying the dynamic of the social composition of the pods, scientists discovered that when dolphins belong to a group, nothing binds them to it in a matter of space and time, this means that they can move freely to different pods that are in their vicinity, then the movement of members is continuous.\nThis type of social network is flat and open, and scientists found no evidence of a rigid, closed or semi-closed structure, so dolphins do not have permanent \u201cmembership\u201d in any pod.\nThese open associations are another indication of their high intelligence since these actions require a lot of brain capacity. Likewise, the hydrodynamic shape of their body supports the need to move continuously between several groups of different environments.\nEven though pods do not lack social hierarchy, this depends on the species. For example, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) establish dominance biting, chasing and striking their tails or fins against the surface of the water. The marks of teeth remain in the skin of the dolphins and are practically in all the species meaning that confrontations are also part of their life. That is why, when they want to demonstrate \u201cwho rules here,\u201d they may not be so charming as usual but more aggressive than we think.\nOn the other hand, the composition and structure of the groups depend on certain circumstances: age, sex, family ties, reproductive condition and even the history of associations. Studies on the behavior of dolphins indicate that dolphins can have preferences for meeting with particular individuals and that they can be remembered and recognized after experiencing extended periods of separation. Amazing, right?\nDolphin social structure.\nTYPES OF PODS\nThe characteristics of the groups differ according to the number of members and the circumstances mentioned above. Dolphins do not behave the same when they change from one pod to another.\nThere are three types of pods:\nNursery groups (mothers-offspring).\nA calf stays with its mother from birth up to a few years after weaning. Usually, the mother\u2019s bond with her son is very close and continues until the young dolphin is 6 or 8 years old. Since offspring are vulnerable, the females with calves join and form groups where they help each other to feed and protect their offspring. If a young female gets pregnant, she can return to her natal pod to give birth and care for her calf along with her female relatives, forming a multigenerational group.\nThe males usually do not get close to these groups.\nJuvenile pods.\nWhen reaching a certain age, both males and females leave their breeding group and join with other young dolphins, but curiously, they go to the group of their mothers occasionally for a while and then return to their youth group.\nTwo male dolphins can stay together for 10, 15 or 20 consecutive years.\nThe members of these groups are engaged in socializing with others and establishing a preamble to mating. Genres, however, are not intimately related for extended periods of time and once a female becomes pregnant, she joins the nursery group.\nAdult males.\nThe structure of the male pods is very complex and similar to a human male group, you will see why.\nOften males are related to 2 or 3 individuals of the same gender and create partnerships for cooperation purposes. Two male dolphins can stay together for 10, 15 or 20 consecutive years. The smaller groups have the objective of cooperating to ensure the mating of the others with a specific female. The larger groups make alliances with other herds of males to defend themselves but also to compete. They continue moving from pod to pod throughout their lives.\nINTERNAL SOCIAL STRUCTURE\nMales are dominant in all groups, but there is no evidence of strong social bonds between them and females. An example of social interaction and their high intelligence is the regular playing activities they perform. Juvenile and adult dolphins often chase each other and toss items such as seaweed back and forth.\nMost experts believe that the social relationships formed by dolphins are long lasting.\nDolphins often have close body contact with other dolphins through rubbing, petting, and even hitting each other.\nCOMMUNICATION, THE GROUND FOR SOCIALIZATION.\nDolphins communicate with their pods usually through whistles. Each dolphin has a unique whistle that identifies it with other members of its group. If an individual is in distress, it uses a particular sound that indicates help is needed, so the pod responds quickly.\nSOCIAL ACTIVITY BEYOND LIMITS.\nAlthough it would be normal that dolphins socialize only with their kind, the interest of some species of dolphins to interact with humans is evident. In the wild, dolphins are extremely curious, and they will often engage in contact with people if a chance comes up. In captivity, dolphins are very attached to the people that usually interact with them, like trainers or researchers.\nReferences\nWilliam F.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Hourglass Dolphin: 15 Facts You Won't Believe! - Kidadl", "url": "https://kidadl.com/animal-facts/hourglass-dolphin-facts", "text": "Hourglass Dolphin Interesting Facts\nWhat type of animal is an Hourglass Dolphin?\nThe Hourglass dolphin (Lagenorhynchus cruciger) is a type of dolphin and belongs to the Animalia kingdom and Delphinidae family.\nWhat class of animal does an Hourglass Dolphin belong to?\nThe Hourglass dolphin is a type of mammal. Yes, if you thought that they were a type of fish then this piece of information should clarify your doubt. While fishes breathe through gills, dolphins have air lungs which they use to breathe and they are warm-blooded in nature.\nHow many Hourglass Dolphins are there in the world?\nThere are an estimated 144,330 hourglass dolphins that have been recorded south of the Antarctic. There are no direct threats to these species primarily their habitat is largely away from human reach unless in rare instances.\nWhere does an Hourglass Dolphin live?\nThe Lagenorhynchus cruciger, hourglass dolphin, is largely seen in the pelagic zone i.e. waters further away from the land, the open ocean in colder regions. Their habitat is known to extend up to the south coast of New Zealand near the South Shetland Islands around Tierra del Fuego.\nWhat is an Hourglass Dolphin's habitat?\nHourglass dolphins (Lagenorhynchus cruciger) live in the ocean. They are the only small dolphin that swims south of the Antarctic convergence where cold Antarctic waters meet the warmer waters of the subantarctic. The warmest recorded surface temperature associated with this species was 13.4 degrees C.\nWho do Hourglass Dolphins live with?\nThe Lagenorhynchus cruciger lives in social groups called schools usually a group of 12. They can join up to form large pods of up to 100 individuals. They are sociable with other species of animals and coexist with other wild fishes and creatures in the oceans. Hourglass dolphins swim where few cetaceans go.\nHow long does an Hourglass Dolphin live?\nThe exact lifespan of the hourglass dolphin is not known. They live an average lifespan similar to other species of dolphins. Atlantic white-sided dolphins are known to have lived for 27 years and Pacific white-sided dolphins are known to have lived for 46 years.\nHow do they reproduce?\nNot much is known about their mating behavior. The Lagenorhynchus cruciger, hourglass dolphin, gives birth during the months of August to October. Copulation occurs belly to belly. The female's gestation period lasts 12-13 months and yields a single calf each time. Females protect their calves avoiding research vessels. The juveniles are nursed for a period of 12-18 months after which they become independent and capable of hunting for themselves. They reportedly sometimes kill their young done usually by males to try and take control of the harem.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nHourglass dolphins are classified as Least Concern species by the International Union For Conservation Of Nature (IUCN).\nHourglass Dolphin Fun Facts\nWhat do Hourglass Dolphins look like?\nThe dolphin derived its name from the hourglass pattern it possesses. They have a unique cross-carrier, a cross-like color scheme on their flank. Hourglass dolphins have two white-colored markings on their bodies connected by a thin white band on either flank and narrow under the dorsal fin similar in appearance to an hourglass pattern. The dolphin's second white patch begins where the other ends. Its colored black on top and white on the bottom the two white patches are connected by a narrow strip. They have distinctive fins that can be hooked atop a broad base. They have conical teeth which they use to crack open shells of crustaceans. They have 26-34 teeth in their upper jaws and 27-35 teeth in their lower jaws. Males are relatively smaller and lighter in shade than males.\nHow cute are they?\nDolphins are sociable and playful beings and loved by both adults as well as kids all around the world. Visiting the hourglass species of dolphins can be a far-fetched dream since they live near the Antarctic regions. However, other species of dolphins are often displayed in Dophinariums.\nHow do they communicate?\nThey communicate using a range of communication channels including sounds, whistles as well as using body language. They are social beings and love to communicate not just to their own kind but to other species of animals as well as humans. They are intelligent and are loved by all.\nHow big is an Hourglass Dolphin?\nThe Hourglass dolphin length is 5.2-5.9 ft (1.6-1.8 m) which is five times bigger than the smallest marine mammal the otter which is 3-4 ft (83-110 cm) in length.\nHow fast can an Hourglass Dolphin move?\nHourglass dolphins are known to be avid fans of bow-riding in the wake of fast boats and can reach a speed of up to 22 kph. They also tend to make a lot of sprays as they surface to breathe.\nHow much does an Hourglass Dolphin weigh?\nThe Hourglass dolphin weight is 154-200 lb (70-90 kg). This depends on their diet and their environment as well. The largest member of the dolphin family is the killer whale.\nWhat are their male and female names of the species?\nA male is referred to as bulls and the females are referred to as cows. Females are relatively smaller and lighter in shade than males.\nWhat would you call a baby Hourglass Dolphin?\nBaby hourglass dolphins are called calves. Females give birth to one baby per birth and both parents equally take care of the juvenile.\nWhat do they eat?\nThe Hourglass dolphin diet is carnivorous. Their diet ranges from smaller fish to squid, and crustaceans. They share feeding grounds with other cetaceans such as sei, pilot, bottlenose, and minke whales. If food is thrown at dolphins they are known to jump and catch their food. Given that hourglass dolphins largely dwell in the middle of the ocean they consume food available in the water body itself.\nAre they dangerous?\nAll dolphins are whales but not all whales are dolphins. Some species of whale dolphins are dangerous in the sense that they attack both animals as well as humans if they are troubled. Some commit infanticide on their young ones. However, this is not the case with all species of dolphins. These hourglass dolphins are friendly unless provoked.\nWould they make a good pet?\nNo, they are innately wild beings and best thrive in their natural habitat. In the case of the hourglass dolphin, they are further away from the reach of common human beings, and seeing them near human habitats is a rare instance. They are primarily seen in Antarctic regions. Owing to the fact that rapid climate change has led to global warming, this has made the position of such species at threat.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nDid you know...\nAn hourglass dolphin was once seen on the coast of New Zealand on 5 September 2010. It was discovered that it was probably left stranded. Scientists conducted a post mortem on the body to find out more information related to this species. This was a rare event that happened. In the past, such an event occurred 150 years ago. Scientists recorded this event to be a historic one.\nDolphins have a flat cornea hence their eyes are incapable of forming clear images on the retina rendering them blind but the eye may still serve as a light receptor as per records.\nOnly six complete specimens of hourglass dolphins have been studied as specimens in science making them one of the least understood animals on planet earth. They are not considered endangered, however.\nHow do Hourglass Dolphins catch their food?\nHourglass dolphins largely consume smaller fishes. For this, they are known to swim to lower sections of the water body. They have conical teeth which they utilize to cut through possible prey. Trained species of dolphins catch the food if it's through at them. Larger species of whale dolphins are also known to hunt sea birds to prey on and they do this primarily by jumping to catch them.\nDo Hourglass Dolphins migrate?\nYes, they are migratory and migrate seasonally depending on the cold water currents. The largest number of these species is found in the Drake Passage which lies between the tip of South America and Antarctica. Climate change has the potential to raise sea temperatures significantly which could disrupt the life of vital marine animals like the hourglass dolphins.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly animal facts for everyone to discover!

Pink Dolphins have a number of different nomers including: Boto, Boutu, Pink Freshwater Dolphin, or Pink Porpoise, Pink River Dolphin or Amazon River Dolphins. While most people assume the Pink Dolphin is closely related to their ocean counterparts they are actually only distantly related to Sea Dolphins. In fact Pink Dolphins, actually belong to a different genus family. Ocean dolphins belong to \ufffddelphindae\ufffd, while river dolphins belong to \ufffdplatanistoidea\ufffd. Pink Dolphins are typically smaller than ocean Dolphins, but they have longer snouts and sharper teeth. Pink River Dolphins also have a much smaller dorsal fin and a larger tail than ocean Dolphins. Pink Dolphins grow to 6-8 feet in length and weigh 185-355 lbs when full grown. The male Pink Dolphins are usually larger than their female counterparts. Pink Dolphins or Amazon River Dolphins are only one of five different river Dolphin species. Pink Dolphins are the most intelligent of all the river dolphins. The While then name \ufffdPink Dolphin\ufffd has stuck, Pink Dolphins vary in color from light gray to pink or even brown. Pink Dolphins have very small eyes and are almost blind. The rivers in which they live are usually very murky so there eyesight is of little consequence, they use sonar and hearing to navigate the river. Pink Dolphins eat crustaceans, crabs, small river fish and even small turtles. Pink Dolphins have an infused neck vertebrae which allow them to turn their neck 180 degrees. Their neck flexibility makes it easier for the Pink Dolphins to feed. Pink Dolphins typically give birth in May-June when the river is at its highest point. They carry their calves for 9-12 months and calves are born 75 cm long and weigh over 1 kg. Pink River Dolphins are endangered due to deforestation and the destruction of their habitat. The increased river traffic has harmed the Pink Dolphins, as their curious nature has caused many of them to become injured from the propellers on boats. Also, the noise from motorboats can also cause the River Dolphins to become disoriented and have difficulty navigating the river water ways. Pink Dolphins are very friendly, social creatures. Perhaps their friendly nature is the source of some of the myths that surround these interesting animals. Amazonian folklore is that an Amazon River Dolphin, is a mermen, metamorphosing into a handsome young man who come ashore and seduces young girls, impregnating them before returning to the river. Another legend says that if you make eye contact with an Amazon River Dolphin, you will experience a lifetime of nightmares.

Despite having small eyes (Ganges and Indus river dolphins\u2019 eyes even lack a lens), river dolphins navigate muddy waters with ease thanks to exquisite sonar\u2014perhaps the best among all the cetaceans. They are often friendly and curious toward people.\nriver dolphin Amazon, or pink, river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis). \u00a9 Ivan Sgualdini/Fotolia\nBritannica Quiz Animals: Fact or Fiction? Curiosity may have killed the cat, but kinkajous, bluebacks, and mustelids are alive and well in these questions! They\u2019re just some of the amazing animals featured in this fact or fiction quiz.\nThe largest species is the Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis). Also called boto, bufeo, and pink dolphin, it is common in the turbid waters of the Amazon and Orinoco river basins. A male Amazon river dolphin can grow to over 2.4 metres (8 feet) and 160 kg (350 pounds); females are slightly smaller. Its colour can vary from dark gray to mottled pink-and-gray to bright pink. The young are gray. Corpulent but extremely flexible, this dolphin navigates with the grace of a flying bird among the branches of submerged trees when annual rains flood the forest. Amazon river dolphins are usually seen in groups. They often swim and play with another small dolphin, the tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis), which is found in both fresh and marine waters and is not classed with river dolphins. In some parts of the Amazon, river dolphins will herd fish into fishermen\u2019s nets; in other areas, they will raid the nets instead.\nThe Araguaian boto (I. araguaiaensis), which is physically similar to the Amazon river dolphin, was classified as a separate species in 2014 on the basis of its distinct DNA. This species inhabits the Araguaia-Tocantins river system in Brazil.\nThe Bolivian river dolphin (I. boliviensis), native to a few remote streams in the Bolivian Amazon, is slightly smaller than the Amazon river dolphin, and its skin is coloured grayish pink. The Teot\u00f4nio rapids between Bolivia and Brazil separate the two species, and DNA studies suggest that neither competition nor interbreeding has occurred between the Bolivian river dolphin and the boto for many tens (or possibly hundreds) of thousands of years. Population estimates suggest that the species may contain as many as 25,000 individuals.\nThe smallest river dolphin species, the La Plata river dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei), also lives in South America. Also known as the franciscana, it inhabits the coastal waters of Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina. Gray above and pale below, this little dolphin grows only 1.2\u20131.7 metres (4\u20135.6 feet) long and weighs 20\u201360 kg (45\u2013135 pounds). Females are larger than males.\nThe Ganges river dolphin, or susu (Platanista gangetica), inhabits the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Karnaphuli, and Meghna rivers and their tributaries in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan. Adults can be nearly 3 metres (10 feet) long. This dark-coloured dolphin frequently swims on its side, trailing a flipper to probe the bottom for fish, shrimp, and mollusks. Its close relative, Platanista minor (Indus river dolphin, bulhan, and Indus susu), is sometimes classified with P. gangetica as a subspecies and is found only in Pakistan. Both species are endangered because of heavy industrial river traffic, hunting for meat and oil, and construction of dams that restrict migration.\nThe baiji, or Chinese river dolphin (Lipotes vexillifer), was native to China\u2019s Yangtze River. Pale blue-gray above and lighter below, it grew to 2.4 metres (8 feet). As the waters of the Yangtze grew more crowded and polluted, the baiji became the world\u2019s most endangered cetacean. Despite reports of an encounter with this river dolphin in 2007, the last confirmed sighting occurred in 2002. Although the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) considers the species to be critically endangered, it is now widely believed to be functionally extinct.\nIn addition, the Atlantic humpback dolphin (Sousa teuszii, family Delphinidae), which is also widely known as the Cameroon river dolphin, is a marine species that also inhabits rivers, estuaries, and nearshore waters along the African coast between southern Morocco and southern Angola. The IUCN classified the Atlantic humpback dolphin as a vulnerable species between 2008 and 2017 but reclassified the species as critically endangered in 2017 after studies suggested that fewer than 3,000 remained in the wild."}

They also have a flexible neck, which allows it to sweep its head from left to right. Size 2 to 3 meters (6.5 to 9.8 ft.) Weight up to 160 kg (353 lbs.) Diet Botos feed on a large variety of fishes (over 43 species), generally near the bottom. Range Botos occur throughout the Amazon and Orinoco river basins, from the deltas upstream to where impassable rapids, waterfalls, lack of water, and possibly low temperatures block their movement. Three geographic populations have been recognized as subspecies: I. g. geoffrensis in the Amazon basin, except for the Madeira drainage in Bolivia above the Teotonio rapids, I. g. boliviensis in the upper Madeira drainage, and I. g. humboldltiana in the Orinoco basin. Habitat Botos swim into flooded forests in the high-water season and often search for prey among the roots and trunks of partially submerged trees. Mark/recapture studies have shown that some individuals are resident to specific areas year-round, whereas others move several tens to hundreds of kilometers within the rivers, but there does not appear to be any actual seasonal migration.\nThey occur most often within 150 m of the edges of rivers, with lower densities in the centers of large rivers. Population Unknown; in the Amazon basin, abundance and encounter rates are only available for a few river segments. Their population does not appear to be severely fragmented but they are especially vulnerable to habitat degradation Status IUCN: Data Deficient; the species was previously listed as Vulnerable but is now considered Data Deficient due to the limited amount of current information available on threats, ecology, and population numbers and trends\nCITES: Appendix II\nUSFWS: No data\nFun Facts\nThe Boto is the largest member of the river dolphin family (Platanistidae). The Guarayo Indians of Bolivia refer to the Boto as the Inia. The species name, geoffrensis comes from Geoffrey St. Hilaire (1772-1850). He was a prominent French professor of natural history and was instrumental in procuring the first Boto specimens. Historically, the Boto was spared from human persecution because of the belief that it had special powers. Botos have poor vision so they rely on their echolocation to navigate through the muddy waters and find food. Botos have bristle-like hairs at the ends of their snouts that help them search for food on the muddy river bottoms.\nEcology and Conservation\nHydroelectric development currently poses the biggest threat to the boto. To meet Brazil's increasing need for electric power, dam construction in the Amazon River basin is expected to increase significantly in the future. Damming activities separate dolphin populations from many fish species that they prey upon.\nAgriculture poses another major threat. Clearing flood-plain forests to make way for crops and pastures affects these dolphins by eliminating part of their food chain. Some fish species rely heavily on fruits and seeds that fall from native forest trees into the water. In turn, botos rely on those fish for survival.\nToxic chemical pollutants from agricultural pesticides, mining, and paper milling are potentially harmful to the dolphins and the entire river ecosystem. Very little research has been conducted to determine concentration levels of these chemicals or their impact on the environment.\nMercury is often used to separate gold from soil and rock in mining operations along the Amazon The effects of the bioaccumulation of mercury in Botos are unknown but the high levels recorded in the Amazon ecosystem give reason for concern..\nCommercial fishing in the Amazon basin is on the rise, and with it, a probable increase in dolphin mortality due to incidental entanglement in fishing nets.\nThe Boto is hunted for fish bait, and as human food. Botos are also killed deliberately in some areas because fishermen regard them as competitors and because they damage fishing nets (F. Trujillo pers. comm. to B.D. Smith).\nIn 1986, the Cetacean Specialist Group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Species Survival Commission decided to concentrate its efforts on all river dolphins, which are disappearing around the world.\nBibliography\nWWF Global \u2013 Boto \u2013 Amazon River Dolphin - Species Profile. http://wwf.panda.org/knowledge_hub/endangered_species/cetaceans/about/river_dolphins/pink_river_dolphin//.

In the western north Pacific region of their range, these animals usually mate in winter and summer months. Meanwhile, those in the Mediterranean region tend to mate in the autumn. Females usually give birth every 4 years. Gestation period lasts for 12 - 13 months. Females and their young are known to form mothers-and-calf schools. Newborn calves live in these groups with their mothers for 16 months, after which they are weaned. According to scientific studies, sexual maturity of these dolphins depends more on their length than the age. Thus, the animals are ready to mate at a length of 7 feet (2 meters). When it comes the age, males of this species are usually able to mate within 7 - 15 years, whereas females are ready to mate at 5 - 13 years old."}

Unlike dolphins, which are mammals, dolphin fish are a type of ray-finned fish. The dolphin fish most likely got its confusing common name because it was previously classified in the genus Dolfyn. It also has a melon-shaped head, much like that of a true dolphin. In the modern classification system, the fish belongs to the genus Coryphaena.\nIf a restaurant menu includes \"dolphin,\" it's referring to the dolphin fish, not the mammal. Some restaurants use the alternative names mahi-mahi and pompano to prevent confusion.\nFast Facts: Dolphin Fish Scientific Name : Coryphaena hippurus (common dolphin fish); Coryphaena equiselis (pompano dolphin fish)\n: Coryphaena hippurus (common dolphin fish); Coryphaena equiselis (pompano dolphin fish) Other Names : Dolphinfish, dolphin, mahi-mahi, dorado, pompano\n: Dolphinfish, dolphin, mahi-mahi, dorado, pompano Distinguishing Features : Brilliantly colored fish with single dorsal fin spanning the length of the body; males have protruding foreheads\n: Brilliantly colored fish with single dorsal fin spanning the length of the body; males have protruding foreheads Average Size : 1 meter in length and up to 40 kilograms (88 lb) weight\n: 1 meter in length and up to 40 kilograms (88 lb) weight Diet : Carnivorous\n: Carnivorous Life Span : Up to 5 years, but usually less than 2 years\n: Up to 5 years, but usually less than 2 years Habitat : Temperate, subtropical, and tropical oceans worldwide\n: Temperate, subtropical, and tropical oceans worldwide Conservation Status : Least Concern\n: Least Concern Kingdom : Animalia\n: Animalia Phylum : Chordata\n: Chordata Class : Actinopterygii\n: Actinopterygii Order : Perciformes\n: Perciformes Family : Coryphaenidae\n: Coryphaenidae Fun Fact: The dolphin fish is a very fast swimmer, reaching speeds of nearly 60 mph.\nDescription\nThere are two species of dolphin fish. The common dolphin fish (also known as mahi-mahi or dorado) is C. hippurus. The other species of dolphin fish is C. equiselis, which is also known as the pompano dolphin fish.\nBoth species in the genus Coryphaena have a compressed head and single dorsal fin running the full length of the body. Both the anal and caudal fins are sharply concave. A mature male (bull) has a prominent protruding forehead, while a female has a rounded head. Mature females are smaller than males. Their long, slender bodies are well-suited to fast swimming. Mahi-mahi swim up to 50 knots (92.6 kph or 57.5 mph).\nPompano dolphin fish are sometimes mistaken for juvenile common dolphin fish or mahi-mahi because they are small, reaching a maximum length of 127 centimeters (50 in). Pompano dolphin fish are bright blue-green with silver-gold sides. The fish fade in color to dull gray-green when they die.\nA typical mahi-mahi reaches a length of one meter and a weight of 7 to 13 kg (15 to 29 lb), but fish over 18 kg (40 lb) have been caught. These fish are brilliantly colored in shades of blue, green, and gold. Pectoral fins are iridescent blue, the back is green and blue, while flanks are silvery-gold. Some individuals sport red spots. Out of water, the fish appears golden (giving rise to the name dorado). Upon death, color fades to yellowish-gray.\nDistribution\nBoth species of dolphin fish are migratory. The common dolphin fish prefers coastal and open water from sea level to a depth of 85 meters in temperate, subtropical, and tropical oceans worldwide. The pompano dolphin fish range overlaps that of the common dolphin fish, but it usually lives in the open ocean and occurs as deep as 119 meters. The fish form schools and tend to congregate in seaweed and under floating objects, including buoys and boats.\nDiet and Predators\nDolphin fish are carnivores that prey upon zooplankton, squid, crustaceans, and smaller fish. The fish is prey to other large oceanic predators, including billfish and sharks. Both species are important for commercial and sports fishing. The fish are generally considered safe to eat, but they are moderately contaminated with mercury and can serve as a vector for ciguatera poisoning.\nReproduction and Life Cycle\nDolphin fish grow and mature very quickly. Fish reach maturity between 4 and 5 months of age and start spawning when they reach a length of about 20 centimeters. Spawning occurs throughout the year when water currents are warm. Females spawn two to three times each year, producing 80,000 to a million eggs each time. Pompano dolphin fish have a life span of up to 3 to 4 years, but most live less than 2 years. Mahi-mahi live up to 5 years, but rarely exceed 4 years.\nConservation Status\nBoth the common dolphin fish and pompano dolphin fish are categorized as \"least concern\" on the IUCN Red List. Its population is stable. However, the fish face threats from declining habitat quality. The species has high commercial value and is extensively harvested. Many countries have imposed bag limits and size limits to support sustainable fishing.\nSources"}

It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nDid you know...\nThe spinner dolphins received their name for their ability to spin multiple times in the water. The species name is longirostris is Latin for long beak, referring to their slender shaped beak. They are popularly known for their impressive aerial displays, breaching, and spinning regularly.\nIt is a wide-ranging, open ocean species and is lovable in nature. They are responsible for accidentally catching and also killing spinner and spotted dolphins. They spin multiple times to shake off remoras and parasites to indicate location and direction. Spinner dolphins are also known for doing full aerial somersaults, head slaps, tail slaps, and spy hops. When spinner dolphins rest, half of their brain rests, and the other half tells them to breathe and monitor the surroundings.\nCan spinner dolphins do tricks?\nYes, they can do acrobatics, and aerial acts and also high jumping spins that they take out of the water. They can jump 10 ft high and spin multiple times.\nWhy are they called spinner dolphins?\nThey are called spinner dolphins because of their ability to swim multiple times in one jump.

Pink dolphins aren't the same as the regular gray dolphins you see in the water; they've evolved to fit their environment.\nRiver dolphins are only distantly related to sea dolphins. Amazon pink dolphins are the most intelligent of the five species of river dolphins, with a cognitive capacity 40 % more than that of humans.\nThe Amazon River is home to pink dolphins, but they can also be found in the Orinoco basins and the upper Madeira River. Although they are primarily pink, these dolphins have a variety of skin colors, including light grey, pink, and brown.\nThe Amazon River pink dolphins make up the world's most significant population of river dolphins, while the other four species are either extinct or on the verge of extinction. Pink dolphins are also found in parts of Asia.\nPink Dolphin: Fact Or Fiction?\nIs there any creature more beautiful than a dolphin? They're one of the most intelligent animals on the planet, with beauty and grace to match.\nWatching dolphins leap from the sea into the air is a thrilling experience. They're pretty easy to detect with big beaks, round heads, and bright pink skin! Wait.\nIs it possible for dolphins to have pink skin? Isn't it true that the majority of dolphins are gray? And what about those long beaks? That may not seem quite right if you've seen a lot of saltwater dolphins. However, we're discussing a distinct freshwater dolphin. To be precise, the Amazon river dolphin!\nThe boto is another name for the Amazon river dolphin. Pink river dolphin inhabits the Amazon and Orinoco River basins in South America. Thousands of miles of rainforest are flooded when rivers overflow. This increases the size of the boto's habitat. Botos can be spotted swimming in and around wet tree roots and other rainforest plants during rainy seasons.\nThese freshwater dolphins have a longer beak and a rounder forehead than other dolphins you've probably seen. These marine dolphins are also smaller, standing roughly 8 ft (2.4 m) tall and weighing around 450 lb (204 kg). Many Amazon river dolphins have vivid pink skin, including the Bolivian river dolphin.\nThe Amazon pink river dolphin is the subject of various South American tales, not all positive. According to one mythology, dolphins transform into their human form known as 'boto encantado' at night to seduce young girls in the Amazon region.\nAnother legend holds that if you go swimming alone, the dolphins will whisk you away to a mystical undersea city, causing locals to avoid coming near the water between nightfall and dawn or entering water bodies alone.\nSome say they are also the protectors of the Amazon manatees. Thus anyone hoping to see one must first encounter the pink dolphin.\nHarming dolphins is considered bad luck, and eating them is even worse.\nDangerous Pink Dolphins\nMost of the time, dolphins do not pose a threat to humans. Indeed, the creatures are curious, friendly, and approachable.\nThey have a lot of fun with humans, teasing them and trying to get their attention. There have even been reports of the animal defending people from sharks or assisting a lost person returning to land.\nDolphins are only likely to attack humans when they are irritated or provoked. If you come across a river dolphin and wish to feed them, be aware that this may be illegal.\nPink Dolphin: Hong Kong Facts\nThe pink dolphins of Hong Kong are Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, often known as Chinese white dolphins. Their skin isn't pink; the creatures dwell in muddy waters with little sunlight, so coloring isn't an issue.\nThe dolphins' bubblegum pink color comes from warm blood flowing through vessels close to the skin's surface.\nPink dolphins have long been a popular tourist attraction in Hong Kong and a part of the city's maritime history. In 1637, British adventurer and writer Peter Mundy discovered and reported the unusual species along the Pearl River in Hong Kong. Since then, their population has shrunk dramatically, and they are on the verge of extinction unless we do something to help.\nPink River Dolphin Baby Facts\nA pink river dolphin is a mammal that belongs to the subgroup of marine mammals known as dolphins. They have baby dolphins and, unlike fish, have lungs that allow them to breathe air.\nMale dolphins mature when they reach a length of roughly 7 ft (2.1 m), while female dolphins mature when they reach a length of 5.5 ft (1.6 m). July and September are the most common months for calves to be born. The gestation period is approximately 9-12 months long.\nWhen they reach their first birthday, dolphins are about 21 in (53.3 cm) long and weigh about 15 lb (6.8 kg).\nMost dolphin species use slow-wave sleep to rest one hemisphere of their brain. These freshwater dolphins remain attentive enough to keep breathing and keep an eye out for Amazon river dolphin predators while in this state.\nThe dolphins of the Indus River sleep in a unique way. The dolphin must remain vigilant to avoid injury because it lives in waters with strong currents and much floating debris. The dolphin sleeps in small bursts of 4-60 seconds to keep itself secure.\nPink River Dolphin Body Facts\nThe Amazon pink river dolphin is the largest and most intelligent but sadly the most endangered species of the five freshwater species. A fully grown dolphin can reach a length of 9 ft (2.7 m), a weight of 400 lb (181 kg), and a lifespan of 30 years.\nTheir food consists of more than 53 species, including piranhas, and is the most diversified among toothed whales (particularly during the wet season). Pink dolphins also have larger brains than humans, with 40 % more brain capacity!\nDespite their reputation as shy creatures, they are enthralled by people and play curiously with local youngsters without displaying violent tendencies. They also communicate by creating a three-dimensional echogram of their dark riverine world with high-frequency sonar pings.\nThat is the actual puzzle. Botos turn pink for unknown reasons, according to experts. However, they know that all Amazon river dolphins are born with grey skin. Later in life, some of them, primarily males, turn pink.\nThey often become pinker as they get older. Some specialists believe pink skin is scar tissue. Male botos have a reputation for fighting a lot. As their bodies amass battle scars, they may turn pink. This could also explain why botos get pinker as they get older. After all, older dolphins are more likely to have been involved in more conflicts and to have more scars.\nThe pinkest color is found in adult males. The pink dolphin has a reputation for being blind, according to legend. This isn't the case at all in reality. While the Amazon pink dolphin's eyes are small and spherical, they have excellent vision.\nWith few pink dolphins left, the species' future is bleak, primarily if appropriate conservation measures are not implemented. The amount of waste poured into Hong Kong's oceans is one of the leading causes of their dwindling numbers.\nHuman development and farming have had a significant impact on river dolphin habitats. These operations have influenced the ecosystem of the waterways. Human fishing is a threat to the dolphin species as well. Overfishing is an issue because it depletes the food source of animals.\nAnother concern to the Amazon river dolphin is pollution. Small gold mining operations cause mercury pollution, and it reaches dolphins through the food chain. River dolphins eat a lot of catfish, which live on the bottom of waterways and accumulate mercury.\nDolphins in the Amazon River are Critically Endangered. The Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources has taken measures to safeguard dolphins. The killing of dolphins by fishers is now prohibited.\nPink river dolphins, unlike other dolphins, have unfused vertebrae in their necks, making them highly agile. They can maneuver past tree trunks, boulders, and other impediments because they can tilt their heads 90 degrees. They may also use one flipper for swimming forward while the other is used to paddle backward, allowing them to turn with greater precision.\nThey are frequently spotted swimming upside down, probably to improve their vision on the river's bottom. Despite their small eyes, they have excellent vision above and underwater and, because of their superb sense of echolocation, have little trouble navigating the Amazon's muddy waters to catch their prey.\nAs the name suggests, the Amazon pink river dolphins slowly turn pink. These are freshwater river dolphins. The Amazon Basin, the upper Madeira River in Bolivia, and the Orinoco Basin, respectively, are home to the three subspecies of the Amazon pink river dolphin.\nPink river dolphins eat up to 53 different types of fish, including small fish like croakers, catfish, tetras, and piranhas, making up one of the most diverse toothed whale diets. Other species that they eat include river turtles and freshwater crabs.\nDespite its small size, the dorsal fin is considered lengthy, and the pectoral fins are likewise enormous in these Amazon river dolphins. When crossing flooded forests and obtaining prey, the fin size, unfused vertebrae, and relative size enable enhanced maneuverability.\nAmazon river dolphins' distribution in rivers and surrounding areas vary according to the time of year; during the dry season, Amazon river dolphins are found in the Amazon river basin, but during the rainy season, when rivers overflow, pink dolphins disperse to flooded areas, including both forests and plains.\nThe Amazon pink river dolphins are the world's largest. The life expectancy of the Amazon pink river dolphins in the wild is unknown. However, healthy animals have been reported to live between 10-30 years in captivity. The Amazon pink river dolphins are generally observed alone or in pairs, but these Amazon river dolphins also are found in pods of up to eight individuals."}

This dolphin is also known as a 'sea caw' because of its black-and-white coloration. In Latin, the species is called 'cruciger', meaning 'cross-bearing', since the black and white coloration on the back of the animal appears to be a cross from above. This small and robust dolphin has a stocky and short body. The dolphin has a large dorsal fin. In addition, the tail of the animal often seems to be keeled. Presently, there is no accurate information on the life expectancy of the Hourglass dolphin. However, we can get an idea about the life expectancy of this animal from the lifespan of related species. The dolphin is thought to live as long as other members of its genus. For example, the Atlantic white-sided dolphin lives up to 27 years, while the Pacific white-sided dolphin can live up to 46 years."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Spinner Dolphin | NOAA Fisheries", "url": "https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/spinner-dolphin", "text": "Spinner dolphin. Credit: Adam U (NOAA Fisheries Permit #14097)\nAbout the Species\nSpinner dolphins are probably the most frequently encountered cetacean in nearshore waters of the Pacific Islands Region. Spinner dolphins received their common name because they are often seen leaping and spinning out of the water. The species' name, longirostris, is Latin for \u201clong beak,\u201d referring to their slender shaped beak or rostrum. Regarded as one of the most acrobatic of dolphins, spinner dolphins are well known for their habit of leaping from the water and spinning up to seven times in the air before falling back into the water. Experts believe that spinner dolphins use these behaviors primarily for acoustic signaling or communication, but the activity can also be a way to remove ectoparasites, such as remoras.\nProtected Status\nCITES Appendix II Throughout Its Range MMPA Protected Throughout Its Range MMPA Depleted Eastern stock\nAppearance\nSpinner dolphins are relatively small compared with other species of oceanic dolphins. They are slender, with thin, recurved flippers, and dorsal fins that usually range from slightly curved to erect and triangular. Among Gray\u2019s spinner dolphins (the subspecies that includes Hawaiian spinner dolphins), adult females are 4.6 to 6.7 feet long and adult males are 5.2 to 6.8 feet long. They reach weights of at least 181 pounds. There is a great deal of color variation in spinner dolphins across the globe, depending on the region and subspecies of dolphin. Gray\u2019s spinner dolphins exhibit a tripartite color pattern with counter shading from dark to light. The three-part color region consists of a dark gray dorsal/back cape, a light gray side, and a white belly. Individual dolphins are identified by their unique dorsal fins. Researchers take photographs of the dolphins' dorsal fins and then match the shape, nicks, and notches in each fin to a catalog of known individuals to obtain life history information for each animal.\nBehavior and Diet\nSpinner dolphins feed at night on species including small fish, shrimp, and squid that are found about 650 to 1,000 feet below the surface of the water. Spinner dolphin prey species follow a vertical and horizontal migration pattern, staying in deep waters in the ocean during the day, and then moving up in the water column (vertical migration) and inshore (horizontal migration) at night. Spinner dolphins take advantage of the nightly migration that brings their prey species to shallower depths and closer to shore by feeding throughout the night. When resting, spinner dolphins move back and forth slowly as a single unit, with the animals in tight formation but spaced just out of contact with one another. They may engage in resting behaviors for about four to five hours daily. This behavior may vary seasonally, coinciding with the shifts in day length. During rest, spinner dolphins rely on vision rather than echolocation for scanning their environment. Group movements during rest are typically in open, sandy-bottom areas where predators are more visible. At the end of their rest period, spinner dolphins usually abruptly increase their activity level, including their swim speeds, aerial behaviors, vocalizations, and make shorter dives than when resting. In 1994, researchers described spinner dolphins swimming in a \u201czig-zag\u201d pattern following their rest period. They swam toward the open waters and then doubled back into shallower waters. This back-and-forth swimming repeats a zig-zag formation over most of the area, possibly functioning as a social cue for the entire group to coordinate their movement into the deeper seas. Likewise, the dolphins\u2019 acoustic behaviors rise and fall synchronously with the zig-zag swimming patterns. When these patterns subside, the spinner dolphins swiftly race to the offshore waters of their foraging grounds, where they are sometimes joined by bottlenose or spotted dolphins. At this point, spinner dolphins\u2019 dive times are extended and the dolphins begin their foraging movements.\nWhere They Live\nHabitat In most places, spinner dolphins are found in areas of deep waters where they likely track prey. Although the pelagic stock of Hawaiian spinner dolphins are found in the deeper waters offshore of the islands, the rest of the Hawai\u02bbi population has a more coastal distribution. During daytime hours, the island-associated stocks of Hawaiian spinner dolphins seek sanctuary in nearshore waters, where they return to certain areas to socialize, rest, and nurture their young. These areas are typically in clear, calm, and relatively shallow waters. They usually have a sandy bottom that presumably provides an environment in which the dolphins are able to visually monitor for predators, as they cease echolocation while they rest. Spinner dolphins use a variety of bays and nearshore coastal waters throughout their range, but they seem to prefer certain bays. Distribution Spinner dolphins are found throughout the world in tropical and warm-temperate waters. Four subspecies of spinner dolphins have been described worldwide: Stenella longirostris longirostris (also known as Gray\u2019s spinner dolphin)\u2014which includes the Hawaiian spinner dolphin\u2014in the tropical Atlantic, Indian, and western and central Pacific Oceans.\nS. l. orientalis in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean\nS. l. centroamericana near Central America\nS. l. rosiventris, the dwarf spinner dolphin, in southeast Asia to northern Australia The Gray\u2019s spinner dolphin is the typical form of spinner dolphin found in most areas of the world.\nLifespan & Reproduction\nLike all marine mammals, spinner dolphins are slow reproducers. They live for about 20 years, with some individuals living for at least 25 years. Spinner dolphins may mate year-round, with multiple males mating with one female. Gestation is similar to other dolphin species and lasts approximately 11 months. Spinner dolphins calve year-round, generally about once every 3 years, and lactate often for 1 to 2 years. They reach sexual maturity at around 7 years of age.\nThreats\nHuman Interactions and Viewing Pressure Viewing wild marine mammals in Hawai\u02bbi has been a popular recreational activity for both tourists and residents over the past several decades. We estimate that there are upwards of 70 tour operators that provide dolphin-directed tours focused on Hawaiian spinner dolphins. More than 100 commercial boat tour and kayak tour operations may opportunistically view these animals. Tours operate out of various harbors along most of the coasts of the main Hawaiian Islands, bringing guests to well-known locations for spinner dolphin viewing. Researchers have observed up to 13 tour boats at a time in some locations, with vessels jockeying for position on a single spinner dolphin group and more than 60 swimmers in the water attempting to closely interact with the dolphins at once. In addition, a number of residents and visitors venture on their own, independent of commercial operators, to view and interact with spinner dolphins. Some operators and various media outlets have encouraged the expectation for close interactions with wild dolphins, and routinely promote close vessel or in-water encounters with the dolphins. This contradicts established wildlife viewing guidelines. Commercial operators and individuals interested in viewing or closely interacting with Hawaiian spinner dolphins increasingly target the dolphins' essential daytime habitats. Encounters with dolphins in these areas are very common due to the predictability of spinner dolphin behavior. Viewing spinner dolphins in their natural habitat can be an educational and enriching experience if conducted safely and responsibly from a distance. However, closely approaching, swimming with, pursuing, interacting, or attempting to interact with the dolphins could disrupt their daytime behaviors. Some interactions with people in essential daytime habitats may disturb individual dolphins or resting groups, even rising to the level of \u201ctake\u201d under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which is illegal. Response to disturbance varies among individuals, but ultimately diverts time and energy from fitness-enhancing activities (such as resting and recuperating after an energetically-costly night of foraging for prey). These responses may, over time, result in negative effects to the fitness of individuals or resident populations. For example, lack of consistent, undisturbed resting periods can reduce the amount of energy available for a spinner dolphin to engage effectively in foraging activities at night. Over time, this can result in overall poor body condition, which reduces the dolphin\u2019s ability to fight off disease, protect itself from predators, successfully reproduce, or rear young. Peer-reviewed scientific literature has documented disturbance responses by individual spinner dolphins, as well as changes to spinner dolphin group behavior patterns over time. Individual dolphin responses include: Increased displays such as leaping, spinning, or tail slapping when closely approached by vessels and swimmers.\nAvoidance behaviors, including increased swimming speed and moving away from swimmers and vessels, or leaving the bay completely in response to human pursuit.\nAggressive behaviors directed at people, including charging or threat displays. Researchers have also documented changes to spinner dolphins\u2019 behavior patterns in essential daytime habitats, including changes to patterns associated with aerial behaviors, residence times, and distribution within the habitat. Human-caused disturbances to daily behaviors may be incidents of 'take,' as defined (and prohibited) under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The chronic nature of these problems in Hawai\u02bbi and the observed changes to behavioral patterns over time are a cause for concern for this dolphin population. Marine Debris Marine debris is a growing concern within the marine environment, as it poses multiple threats to the marine ecosystem. For instance, spinner dolphins may ingest (either directly or through prey items) or become entangled in marine debris. These interactions may cause: Drowning\nDebilitation\nLimited predator avoidance\nInternal or external wounds\nSkin lesions or sores\nBlockage of the digestive tract, resulting in starvation that often leads to death\nReductions in quality of life and/or reproductive capacity\nImpairment of feeding capacity\nIntroduction and/or concentration of damaging or toxic compounds to the animal The severity of the effects of debris interactions on all dolphin populations remains unclear because many deaths likely occur undetected at sea We do not have sufficient information to determine the severity of the threat of direct ingestion of large debris on spinner dolphin populations. Some data indicates that spinner dolphin prey species are consuming very small plastics. In 2010, researchers analyzed mesopelagic fish in the North Pacific Central Gyre and found that 35 percent of the fish\u2014many of which were lantern fish (spinner dolphins\u2019 main prey)\u2014had ingested plastic. Larger fish generally had more pieces of plastic in their guts than smaller fish. We are particularly concerned about the ability for plastic debris to absorb organic pollutants that may be toxic to the marine organisms that ingest them. These contaminants can bioaccumulate as they move up the food chain to top predators such as spinner dolphins. Scientists have also found high levels of butyltin and organochlorine (chemical compounds found in some plastics) in migrating lantern fish species in the Western North Pacific, which may indicate a cause for concern for predators, such as spinner dolphins. Human-Made Noise Humans introduce sound intentionally and unintentionally into the marine environment. This could be from commercial and recreational ocean activities, navigation, oil and gas exploration and acquisition, research, and military activities. Spinner dolphins use sound to communicate, navigate, locate prey, locate predators, and sense their environment, which can be impacted by introduced anthropogenic noise How severely noise exposure affects dolphins and whales depends on factors including: Noise source\nDecibel level\nDistance between the source and the animal\nCharacteristics of the animal (for example, hearing sensitivity, behavioral context, age, sex, and previous experience with sound source)\nTime of day or season (which affects how sound travels through the water) In marine mammal populations, noise can seriously disrupt communication, navigational ability, and social patterns. Disease Spinner dolphins, like all marine mammals, can be susceptible to widespread disease. Outbreaks in spinner dolphins are not commonly reported, but scientists have previously detected serious diseases, such as toxoplasmosis and cetacean morbillivirus. Although the number of spinner dolphin deaths attributed to these diseases is fairly low (many are thought to be unreported), thousands of other marine mammal species have died from these diseases worldwide.\nScientific Classification"}

One is the Indus River Dolphin and the other subspecies is the Ganges River Dolphin. These endangered species of dolphin are seen in the parts of the Indian subcontinent. Ganges River Dolphins (Platanista gangetica gangetica) are mostly found in the rivers of Ganga and Brahmaputra, Eastern India, Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems, Nepal, and Hooghly river systems whereas the Indus River dolphins (Platanista gangetica minor) are mostly seen in the Indus river system of Pakistan. These River Dolphins live in one of the most densely populated areas and are restricted to freshwaters. These South Asian River Dolphins are some of the most intelligent animals. It is the National Aquatic Animal of India and Guwahati\u2019s official animal.\nWhat class of animal does a Ganges River Dolphin belong to?\nThe Ganges River Dolphin is a fresh and clean water dolphin that belongs to the mammalian class due to its ability to give birth to young ones. Ganges River Dolphin is the subspecies of the species South Asian river dolphin and comes under the Artiodactyla order of the Platanistidae family. Its scientific name is Platanista gangetica. The Ganges River Dolphin is also called Sanges susu or shushuk.\nHow many Ganges River Dolphins are there in the world?\nThe Ganges River Dolphin is known to be one of the only three freshwater river dolphins existing in the world now. There are around 3,500 Ganges River Dolphins left in the Indian region of the Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna basin. Their population is decreasing at a significant rate.\nWhere does a Ganges River Dolphin live?\nThe Ganges River Dolphin lives in freshwater rivers in South Asia. They are seen in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems of India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Hooghly river systems. South Asian River Dolphins are found in many tributaries, connecting lakes and streams. Indus river dolphins are mostly seen in Pakistan.\nWhat is a Ganges River Dolphin's habitat?\nThe Ganges River Dolphin is restricted to freshwater river systems in the regions of India. They prefer to live in slow-flowing rivers with plenty of food. These South Asian River Dolphins are found in many tributaries, connecting lakes and streams. Ganges River Dolphins also like to live in areas that form eddy counter currents that are located downstream like convergent tributaries and small islands. They are migratory species and migrate seasonally to tributaries or upstream with a high level of water conditions in a hot climate and back to river channels or downstream with a lower level of water conditions in the winters.\nWho do Ganges River Dolphins live with?\nGanges River Dolphins are blind. They mostly prefer to live alone. These South Asian River Dolphins are sometimes in small groups; usually a mother and its young one.\nHow long does a Ganges River Dolphin live?\nThe average lifespan of a Ganges River Dolphin (Platanista gangetica) is 18-22 years in the wild. The oldest male dolphin is known to be 28 years.\nHow do they reproduce?\nGanges River Dolphins breed year-round. These South Asian River Dolphins reach sexual maturity at 10 years of age. The gestation period of the Ganges River Dolphin is about 10 months but can go from 8-12 months. The female dolphin will give birth to a single offspring who is 27-35 in (68.6-88.9 cm) long. Weaning of the offspring begins at two months till they are nine months old and they become independent after weaning and the parents disperse. Another form of parental care is lactation until weaning.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nGanges River Dolphins are listed as Endangered species in terms of their conservation status. Their natural habitat is degraded due to the increase in the human population. Industries and agricultural activities pollute the river system. Many toxic chemicals are released into the rivers which really affects these dolphins. The modifications made by humans also play a major role in destroying their habitat. The use of nylon fishing nets by fishermen is another reason for putting them in danger. Hunting of dolphins for oil and meat also decreases the population. Hence, this species faces an extinction threat.\nGanges River Dolphin Fun Facts\nWhat do Ganges River Dolphins look like?\nGanges River Dolphins are a freshwater endangered species that is seen in parts of the Indian subcontinent. Adult Ganges River Dolphins are grayish brown in color whereas calves are chocolate brown in color. These species have sharp teeth in the upper and lower parts of the jaw. Ganges River Dolphins have smooth and hairless skin with relatively flat beaks and are widest at the tip. Females are larger than males. These species have a low triangular dorsal fin and have a body with big flippers. This fish species is essentially blind.\nHow cute are they?\nGanges River Dolphins are big-sized mammals and have smooth and hairless skin and a long thin snout. They are cute, adorable, and super intelligent. Everyone loves dolphins and they love to play.\nHow do they communicate?\nGanges River Dolphins are blind. It is impossible for them to resolve images because of the lack of lenses in the eyes. They use pulse sounds to communicate. Ganges River Dolphins use echolocation to find food, escape danger, and move around.\nHow big is a Ganges River Dolphin?\nThe Ganges River Dolphin is a large-sized freshwater mammal and has a length of 96-106.8 in (2.4-2.7 m). It\u2019s 10 times bigger than a hamster.\nHow fast can a Ganges River Dolphin move?\nGanges River Dolphins have a peculiar swimming method and can dive fast. They have a swimming speed of 27 mph (43.5 kph) while swimming upwards.\nHow much does a Ganges River Dolphin weigh?\nOn an average scale, an adult Ganges River Dolphin weighs around 330-374 lb (149.7-169.6 kg). It may differ according to the food habits and environment.\nWhat are the male and female names of the species?\nAs the Ganges River Dolphin is a freshwater dolphin, its species is P. gangetica. A male Ganges River Dolphin is called a bull and a female Ganges River Dolphin is called a cow.\nWhat would you call a baby Ganges River Dolphin?\nA baby Ganges River Dolphin is called a calf.\nWhat do they eat?\nGanges River Dolphins are carnivores as they only eat meat. Their diet contains a variety of aquatic animals including small fish, mollusks, and aquatic crustaceans.\nGanges River Dolphins do not have any known predators other than humans. They hunt them for oil, bait, and meat.\nAre they dangerous?\nGanges River Dolphins are usually not dangerous. They never attack humans. But the bull sharks found in the river are mistaken to be Ganges River Dolphins and those are the ones who attack others whereas these dolphins are harmless to humans but are predators to other fishes.\nWould they make a good pet?\nGanges River Dolphins are friendly and adorable animals that are super cute and intelligent. But river dolphins are not commonly kept as pets and they prefer to live in freshwaters.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nDid you know...\nGanges River Dolphins are blind as they lack lenses in their eyes. They are not able to resolve images. It is with the help of sounds, they are able to perceive objects. Ganges River Dolphins use echolocation to find food, escape danger, and move around.\nThe Ganges River Dolphin skull structure is different from the Indus River Dolphin and this led to both the sub-species being recognized as different from each other.\nWhy is the Ganges River Dolphin endangered?\nGanges River Dolphins are a freshwater species that has become endangered. There are 3500 individuals left in the Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna basin. Their population is decreasing mainly due to the degradation and modification of their habitat. Industries and agricultural activities pollute the river system. Many toxic chemicals are released into the rivers which really affects these dolphins. The modifications made by humans also play a major role in destroying their habitat. The use of nylon nets by fishermen is another reason for putting them in danger. All these reasons contribute to the significant decrease and hence they face a major extinction threat.\nSaving the Ganges River Dolphin\nGanges River Dolphins are important in the ecosystem. These dolphins help in maintaining the small fish population and also have been host to some parasites. They also act as key indicators of water and environmental quality. There are steps taken in order to protect them.\nThe Ministry of Environment and Forestry, in order to protect Ganges River Dolphins, declared a dolphin sanctuary named Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary. The Uttar Pradesh government in India uses old and traditional Hindu texts as a means of propagation to protect the dolphins from extinction by grabbing the support of communities.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly animal facts for everyone to discover!

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphin - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin", "text": "Dolphins are part of the toothed whales. Generally, they are among the smaller whales. Most live in salt water oceans, but some live in rivers \u2013 there are oceanic dolphins and river dolphins. Dolphins are from 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) to 4 metres (13 ft) long, but the largest dolphin, the killer whale (or orca), can be up to 8 metres (26 ft) long.\nAll dolphins live in groups called \"pods\". They are social animals at all stages of their life. They have some remarkable behaviours. A speeding group of dolphins is a sight to see. They \"porpoise\" in and out of the water at high speed. The function of this is not known for sure. It may be the fastest movement they are capable of. What they eat, almost exclusively, is fish. When they chase fish, the fish go into a \"bait ball\" to self-protect. In turn, the dolphins attack in a group and eat as many fish as they can.\nThe name 'dolphin' comes from the Ancient Greek \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03af\u03c2 (delphis) meaning \"with a womb\", because it was first thought to be a fish with a womb. It is now known to be a mammal, and quite an intelligent mammal. Dolphins breathe air. A dolphin's nose is on top of its head so the dolphin can easily breathe on the surface of the water. The skin of a dolphin has no scales. It is soft and smooth. However, it is very firm, due to how much muscle they have. Dolphins use echolocation to find their food.\nThe skin of a bottlenose dolphin is gray, smooth, and rubbery. They are always social. They can help each other fight off predators. Dolphins have fought off sharks in this way. They can kill large sharks by ramming them over and over again with their snouts and heads. They look after the young, when the mothers need to leave their calves to hunt for food. The young need to breathe more often than the adults, and the food may be in deeper waters.\nOceanic dolphins are marine animals living in the sea. They live in all of the oceans.\nThree of the four species of river dolphins live in fresh water rivers. The La Plata dolphin lives in saltwater estuaries and the ocean. Water pollution and the loss of habitat are a threat to some dolphins, especially those living in rivers and estuaries.\nDolphins (and other cetaceans) sleep in the water. There is danger from animals that eat dolphins. Dolphins sleep differently than a person. Dolphins have two sides of their brain, which they use to sleep. One side sleeps, while the other side stays awake. Dolphins do things while asleep:\nDolphins will keep one eye open to watch for animals that eat them while they sleep.\nDolphins also swim in circles when they are sleeping to look around for danger.\nDolphins get their nose out of the water to breathe.\nDolphin groups or species have their own way of sleeping. Pinnipeds, like seals, can sleep like dolphins.\nThe brain of a dolphin is like a human brain in size and development. Dolphins have reasonable eyesight. They can watch a thing in the water, and they can see colors, too. They can also see in dark places.\nA dolphin's hearing is better than their sight. There are small holes behind the eyes, and they are the ears of a dolphin. Dolphins can hear a sound underwater. They can know the direction of the sound very well.\nDolphins and humans [ change | change source ]\nCrete. Fresco of Dolphins, ca. 1600 BC, from Knossos\nDolphins have long played a role in human culture. Dolphins are common in Greek mythology and there are many coins from ancient Greece which feature a man or boy or deity riding on the back of a dolphin. The Ancient Greeks welcomed dolphins; spotting dolphins riding in a ship\u2019s wake was considered a good omen. In Hindu mythology, the Ganges River Dolphin is associated with Ganga, the deity of the Ganges river.\nDolphin meat is eaten in a few countries, including Japan and Peru (where it is referred to as chancho marino, or \"sea pork\"). Japan may be the best-known and most controversial example, but eating dolphin is not that common.\nDolphin therapy [ change | change source ]\nDolphin therapy is sometimes used for people with mental or physical handicaps. It involves contact with trained dolphins. It is not agreed whether this is any better than the usual treatments. Scientists continue to study dolphin therapy.\nSome examples:"}

As researchers delve into the underwater world of these brilliant cetaceans, they're learning that these creatures are full of surprises, from their intricate social lives to their intelligence. Here are just some of the ways dolphins are exceptional, both physically and mentally.\n1. Dolphins Evolved From Land Animals\nDolphins didn't always live in the water. The ancestors of these marine animals were even-toed ungulates, which had hoof-like toes at the end of each foot and roamed across the land. But about 50 million years ago, these ancestor animals decided that the ocean was a better place to live and evolved into the dolphins we know today.\nThe evidence for this evolutionary history can be seen in dolphins' skeletons today: Adult dolphins have remnant finger bones in their flippers, as well as vestigial leg bones.\n2. They Can Stay Awake for Weeks\nSamantha Haebich / Getty Images\nA 2012 study found that dolphins were able to successfully utilize their echolocation abilities for 15 days straight \u2014 without any sleep or rest. In other words, dolphins don't need much sleep at all. They manage this by resting one half of their brain at a time, a process called unihemispheric sleep.\nThough shocking, this ability makes sense. Dolphins need to go to the ocean's surface to breathe, so they have to stay constantly awake to be able to take breaths and avoid drowning. It also acts as a defense mechanism, protecting them from potential predators.\nMeanwhile, baby dolphins don't sleep at all for weeks after they are born. Researchers think this is an advantage because it helps the calf to better escape predators and keep its body temperature up while its body accumulates blubber. It's also believed that this lack of sleep encourages brain growth.\n3. Dolphins Don't Chew Their Food\nAlicia Chelini / Shutterstock\nIf you've ever watched a dolphin eat, you may have noticed that they seem to gulp down their food. That's because dolphins don't chew; they use their teeth only to grip prey. At most, dolphins will shake their food or rub it on the ocean floor to tear it into more manageable pieces.\nOne theory for why they've evolved to do away with chewing is because they need to quickly consume their fish dinner before it can swim away. Skipping the process of chewing ensures their meal doesn't escape.\n4. Dolphins Are Utilized by the U.S. Military\nSince the 1960s, the U.S. Navy has utilized dolphins to detect underwater mines. Much like bomb detection dogs work by smell, dolphins work by echolocation. Their superior ability to scan an area for particular objects allows them to zero in on mines and drop markers at the spots. The Navy can then find and disarm the mines. The echolocation skills of dolphins far outstrip any technology people have come up with to do the same job.\nHowever, these Navy programs have been highly controversial, as animal rights advocates have long opposed the use of dolphins for military purposes. Concerns include the stresses dolphins experience with sudden transportation and transplantation to new areas, muzzles that prevent them from foraging while working, and the risk of accidental detonation of a mine. Though the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program maintains that it complies with federal laws regarding the care of their dolphins, activists have continued to fight against exploitation.\n5. Dolphins Use Tools\nJoost van Uffelen / Shutterstock\nResearchers discovered that a population of dolphins living in Shark Bay, Australia uses tools. Some searched for cone-shaped sea sponges and tore them free from the ocean floor. Then, they carried the sponges on their beaks to a hunting ground, where they used them to probe the sand for fish that are hiding.\nThe behavior is called \"sponging,\" and it is not the first example of tool use in cetaceans. The researchers think this helps protect their sensitive snouts while they hunt.\nWhile this demonstrates dolphins' intelligence, it also shows evidence of their social skills. The practice is passed down from mother to daughter, which indicates the existence of culture among nonhumans.\n6. Dolphins Form Friendships Through Shared Interests\nStudying the same group of dolphins in Shark Bay, another group of researchers discovered that the dolphins formed friendships based on a shared interest \u2014 in this case, sponging. This behavior is less common in male dolphins, so by focusing on them, the researchers discovered a new way it informs dolphin relationships. Male spongers spent more time associating with other male spongers than non-spongers, indicating that a shared interest in the practice was an important factor in the formation of social bonds.\n7. Dolphins Call Each Other by Name\nWe know dolphins communicate, but a study published in 2013 revealed that their communication skills go as far as using names. Dolphins within pods have their own \"signature whistle,\" which acts as a unique identity signal just like a name.\nResearchers recorded dolphins' signature whistles and played them back to the pod. They found that the individuals only responded to their own calls, sounding their own whistle back in acknowledgment.\nWhat's more, the dolphins didn't respond when the signature whistles of dolphins from strange pods were played, indicating that they're looking for and responding to specific calls.\nConsidering dolphins are a highly social species with the need to stay in touch over distances, it makes sense that they would have evolved to use \"names\" much in the same way people do.\n8. Dolphins Work Together as a Team\nbluehand / Shutterstock\nIn addition to communicating with names, dolphins can also work together as a team, an ability previously thought to be unique to humans.\nResearch conducted in 2018 found that dolphins were able to synchronize their actions to solve a cooperation task and receive a reward. The test involved getting a pair of dolphins to press two separate underwater buttons at the same time. Once the dolphins figured out that the task was cooperative, they succeeded.\n9. Dolphins Get High on Fish Toxins\nPufferfish carry strong toxins which, if consumed in small doses, act as a narcotic. Dolphins have discovered this, and they've used this information for recreational benefit.\nIn 2013, the BBC filmed dolphins gently playing with a pufferfish, passing it between pod members for 20 to 30 minutes, then hanging around at the surface seemingly mesmerized by their own reflections.\nRob Pilley, a zoologist who also worked as a producer on the series, was quoted in The Independent: \"This was a case of young dolphins purposely experimenting with something we know to be intoxicating ... It reminded us of that craze a few years ago when people started licking toads to get a buzz.\"\n10. There Are 36 Dolphin Species\nThere is more than just one type of dolphin \u2014 in fact, the dolphin family Delphinidae contains 36 species. This also means that the conservation status of dolphins differs greatly. Many species, including the well-known common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), are thriving. Others, despite being protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and Endangered Species Act, maintain varying degrees of concern, such as the critically endangered baiji (Lipotes vexillifer).\nOne way you can help protect vulnerable dolphin species is to avoid single-use plastics, as these items end up in oceans and can harm the animals. You can also be mindful to only buy fish from sustainable fisheries (or avoid buying fish altogether) and join beach-cleanup initiatives."}

Data deficient LC NT VU EN CR EW EX Least Concern Extinct Current Population Trend : Unknown\nThe playful spinner dolphin makes itself known with a splash. Skilled acrobats, the small dolphins regularly leap out of the water and perform complicated aerial maneuvers. They can spin multiple times in one leap, which can be nearly 10 feet high.\nThe leaping and spinning likely serve several purposes, including the removal of irksome remoras, fish that latch on to eat parasites. Biologists also think the dolphins use their moves to communicate, each one signaling something different: \u201cLet\u2019s go\u201d or \u201cDanger!\u201d or \u201cI find you attractive.\u201d\nLike other dolphins, spinners also vocalize with whistles, echolocation clicks, and other sounds.\nSocial cetaceans\nSpinner dolphins live in large pods from a few dozen to a thousand or more in tropical and subtropical zones around the world. They are the most abundant dolphin species in the Indian Ocean. Feeding on small fish, squid, and shrimp mostly at night in the open ocean, they return to the shallows during the day to rest and socialize.\nSpinner dolphins sexually mature at around eight years old.\nFishing threats\nIn the eastern tropical Pacific, spinner dolphins frequently swim together with schools of yellowfin tuna. Fishermen look for dolphin pods, knowing they\u2019ll likely be with the tuna they want, and herd them with speedboats into a tight mass before deploying a large net over the pod. The dolphins are ensnared along with the tuna.\nWhen the purse seine fishery first began around 1960, dolphins (not just spinners) trapped as bycatch were killed\u2014a number estimated at around six million. Thanks to protection efforts, the dolphins today are usually released alive from the nets and the death rate is fairly low."}

The family Delphinidae is the largest in the Cetacea and relatively recent. Dolphins evolved about 10 million years ago, during the Miocene (The Miocene epoch is a period of time that extends from about 23 to 5.3 million years before the present).\nDolphins have a spindle-like shaped body that tapers at both ends, adapted for fast swimming. Their head contains the \u2018melon\u2019 (an oval shaped oily, fatty lump of tissue found at the centre of the forehead ), which is used for echolocation (non-human animals emitting sound waves and listening to the echo in order to locate objects or navigate). See more plant facts\nIn many species of dolphin, the jaws are elongated, forming a distinct beak however for some species like the Bottlenose Dolphin, there is a curved mouth that looks like a fixed smile. Teeth can be very numerous (up to 250) in several species. The dolphin brain is large and has a highly structured cortex, which often is referred to in discussions about their high intelligence.\nDolphins are often regarded as one of the most intelligent animal species. Dolphins often leap above the water surface, sometimes performing acrobatic figures. Scientists are not quite certain about the purpose of this behaviour, but it may be to locate schools of fish by looking at above water signs, like feeding birds.\nDolphins can also communicate with other dolphins to join a hunt, attempting to dislodge parasites, or simply doing it for fun.\nPlay is a very important part of dolphins lives and they can often be observed playing with seaweed or playfighting with other dolphins. Dolphins have even been seen harassing other creatures, like seabirds and turtles. Dolphins also seem to enjoy riding waves and are frequently seen \u2018surfing\u2019 coastal swells and the bow waves of boats."}

These five (or potentially six, according to a recent study) are found in eight river basins in South America and Asia: the Amazon, Orinoco, Ganges, Indus, Yangtze, Irrawaddy (Myanmar), Mahakam (Indonesia) and the Mekong (Cambodia). They have adapted to living and hunting in muddy waters, and the Ganges and Indus river dolphin species are even blind and rely on echolocation.\nAdvertisement\nLearn more about river dolphins, sometimes referred to as freshwater dolphins, in our expert guide by the WWF:\nHow many species of river dolphin are there?\nThere are five, possibly six, species of river dolphin found around the world:\nAmazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis)\nTucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis)\nGanges river dolphin (Platanista gangetica gangetica) - possibly two distinct species the Ganges river dolphin (Platanista gangetica) and the Indus river dolphin (Platanista minor)\nIrrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris)\nYangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis)\nAn Amazon river dolphin in the Tapajos River, Amazon Region, Brazil. \u00a9 Ricardo Lima/Getty\nThe pink Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), is found in the Amazon and Orinoco River basins stretching through Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Guyana. Unlike other river dolphins, it has a flexible neck which allows it to move its head left and right. This seemingly small adaptation is important because it allows the species to more easily enter flooded forests to hunt and breed. The Amazon river dolphin also has a long snout, a rounded head and small dorsal fin. It is the largest species of river dolphin, with adult males reaching 185 kilograms in weight, and 2.5 metres in length.\nTucuxi river dolphin. \u00a9 Kike Calvo/Universal Images Group/Getty\nThe Tucuxi river dolphin (Sotalia fluviatilis) is the smaller, jumping grey counterpart to the Amazon river dolphin and is also found in the Amazon River basin. Travelling in pods of about 10-15 they have a highly developed social structure. It looks more like its marine cousins, and just like them, the tucuxi jumps playfully out of the water - a beautiful sight.\nThe South Asian river dolphin consists of two subspecies, the Ganges and Indus river dolphins, although a new study has concluded that these dolphins are different enough to be considered as separate species, the Ganges river dolphin (Platanista gangetica) and the Indus river dolphin (Platanista minor).\nThere are only about 3200 Ganges river dolphins (Platanista gangetica gangetica) left in the world. The majority are found in India, and less than 100 in Nepal. It is essentially blind and relies on echolocation. It is the National Aquatic Animal of India.\nAn Indus river dolphin near Sukker, Pakistan. \u00a9 Zahoor Salmi/Getty\nThere are less than 2000 Indus river dolphins (Platanista gangetica minor) left in the world. They are found mostly in the lower parts of the Indus River in Pakistan, plus about 8 individuals in the Beas River in India. Following the construction of major irrigation systems their numbers declined dramatically and their distribution range was reduced by 80%. Most of the population is divided into isolated populations by six barrages without being able to migrate or spawn properly. The functionally blind species is adapted to live in the muddy river and relies on echolocation.\nAn Irrawaddy dolphin in Thailand. \u00a9 Kampee Patisena/Getty\nAccording to the latest census data released in October 2020, just 89 rare freshwater Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris) survive in the Mekong River. Besides the Mekong (Cambodia), the Irrawaddy dolphin is also found in the Irrawaddy (Myanmar) and Mahakam (Indonesia) Rivers. The total number of Irrawaddy river dolphins in the world is estimated at only 250 individuals.\nFeaturing a bulging forehead and short beak, this elegant animal will pop its head out of the water to breathe, followed by its back - the tail is rarely seen. It herds fish into their hunting area by squirting streams of water up to 1.5 meters. Some sub-populations in Myanmar have developed a collaborative fishing strategy with local traditional fishermen, proving that people and wild animals can coexist in harmony.\nA Yangtze finless porpoise swimming in the Yangtze River in Yichang in central China's Hubei province. \u00a9 Feature China/Barcroft Images/Getty\nThere are around 1000 smiling freshwater Yangtze finless porpoises (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis) alive today, of which 100 live in semi-natural reserves. The Yangtze finless porpoise, the only fresh water porpoise in the world, is known for its intelligence which is on par with that of a gorilla. At one point, this porpoise shared the waters with the Baiji dolphin (Lipotes vexillifer) . The Baiji or Yangtze river dolphin was last seen in 2002, and was declared functionally extinct in 2006.\nDo river dolphins have local nicknames?\nThe Amazon river dolphin is also known as the \u201cboto.\u201d\nAn Amazon river dolphin photographed underwater. \u00a9 Getty\nThe Ganges river dolphin is known in India as \u201csusu\u201d after the noise the dolphin makes when it breathes, and called \u201cswons\u201d in Nepal. The Ganges river dolphin is also known as the \u201cTiger of the Ganges\u201d for the role it plays as an ecosystem indicator species; much like a tiger does in a forest.\nWhy are river dolphins important?\nDolphins are important indicators of river health, the same rivers that are also the lifeblood of huge economies and hundreds of millions of people. Where freshwater dolphin populations are thriving, it is likely that the overall river systems will be flourishing too \u2013 as well as all of the communities, companies and countless other species that depend on them.\nHow are river dolphins different from their marine cousins?\nRiver dolphins migrate along some of the greatest rivers on the planet, between their hunting and spawning areas. However, unlike their marine cousins which may enter rivers, river dolphins do not enter the ocean. Since they evolved to survive in warm, shallow water and strong river currents, river dolphins are relatively small compared to other dolphins. Therefore, they have little to no blubber compared to other cetaceans. River dolphins are rarely kept in captivity because breeding success has been poor and the animals often die within a few months of capture.\nAn Indus river dolphin in Pakistan. \u00a9 Abdul Rauf/Getty\nWhat is echolocation?\nAll dolphins use echolocation, sensing sound waves in the water to navigate, detect prey and to communicate with each other. Some river dolphins, like the Ganges and Indus river dolphins are essentially blind. Although others do have some sight, they also still mostly rely on echolocation.\nWhat do river dolphins eat?\nAmong other things such as crabs and turtles, river dolphins depend on migratory fish as a major source of their food. Therefore, they are negatively impacted by the same problems migratory fish face. Besides travelling to and from their spawning areas they also migrate to follow their food. This is why dams and other obstacles to free flowing rivers that block their food fish from spawning also have such a harmful impact on the river dolphins\u2019 survival. The drastic reduction in their food supply has only added to their problems. According to WWF\u2019s Living Planet 2020 Freshwater Index (LPR2020), average population trends for monitored freshwater species appear to be falling steeply (84% decline in 50 years). In fact, almost one in three freshwater species are threatened with extinction.\nPlease note that external videos may contain ads:\nPink River Dolphins Of The Amazon Rainforest's Hunting Secret | Earth's Great Rivers | BBC Earth\nAre river dolphins endangered?\nAll river dolphins are Endangered or Critically Endangered according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Shortly after its status was degraded from \u201cendangered\u201d to \u201ccritically endangered\u201d in 2013, the Chinese Government gave the Yangtze finless porpoise the strictest protections available by law in 2014. This means Yangtze finless porpoise has the same conservation concern as the rare Irrawaddy river dolphin.\nWhat threats do river dolphins face?\nMegafauna such as dolphins tend to be less resilient to environmental changes because they are top predators of the river system, concentrated effects of toxic chemicals and heavy metals accumulated by creatures lower down the food chain. Additionally, they generally require complex and large habitats, reproduce at a later stage in life and have fewer offspring. The population of the Yangtze finless porpoise has suffered a 50% decline since 2006, and the Irrawaddy dolphin in the Mekong 44% since 1997.\nA Yangtze finless porpoise in the Yangtze river, China. \u00a9 chuyu/Getty\nThe drop is due in large part to the very same environmental destruction which is contributing to the emergence of zoonotic diseases such as COVID-19 - habitat degradation, water pollution and climate change. Furthermore, water flow modification such as hydroelectric dams, barriers and navigation projects, mercury poisoning from gold mining operations, being killed for use as fish bait, sand mining, over-exploitation and being caught as bycatch have also had significant negative impacts on river dolphin populations.\nWhat is being done to save the river dolphins?\nAcross Asia and South America, conservationists are working together to secure the future of river dolphins. Without action, these species could become extinct within a lifetime. WWF\u2019s River Dolphin Rivers Initiative aims to stop the decline of river dolphin populations in Asia and South America, and restore and double the most affected populations. In particular, Yangtze finless porpoise and Irrawaddy dolphin populations must be increased by the end of the decade to reduce their risk of extinction. This is their \u201c3000 Dolphin Dream:\u201d 3000 river dolphins extra by 2030, to be on the path to doubling the most threatened populations.\nVarious NGO\u2019s work together in the South American River Dolphin Initiative (SARDI) to determine the actual population of the Amazon and Tucuxi river dolphins by using drones, satellite tagging and environmental DNA to spot and count individuals in the Amazon to help determine future necessary actions to protect this species. A new interactive dashboard tool combining all available data gives a good insight into the plight of the Amazon and Tucuxi river dolphins.\nTwo Tucuxi swimming in Guapor\u00e9 river, Mato Grosso, Brazil. \u00a9 Helder Faria/Getty\nThe conservation organisation is advocating for stakeholders along the stretches of Ganges river dolphin habitat to adopt Best Management Practices, and they are implementing environmental flows to sustain the river\u2019s ecological integrity and ecosystem services. There is also work being done to conserve deteriorating river habitats such as reforesting river banks, and reduce the fishing pressure by diversifying the livelihood options of river-dependent communities. It is working with people who live along the river to reduce the use of agricultural and leather industry-related chemicals. In some areas, community fishery management zones are being established to help sustainably manage fish and prevent bycatch (accidental capture in nets).\nIn China, some porpoises are being relocated to safer parts of the river.\nWhen is World River Dolphin Day?\nWorld River Dolphin Day (also known as World Freshwater Dolphin Day) is on 24 October.\nWWF is one of the world's largest and most respected independent conservation organisations, with over 5 million supporters and a global network active in over 100 countries. WWF's mission is to stop the degradation of the earth's natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature, by conserving the world's biological diversity, ensuring that the use of renewable natural resources is sustainable, and promoting the reduction of pollution and wasteful consumption.\nAdvertisement\nMain image: An Amazon river dolphin in Brazil. \u00a9 Mike Lane/Getty"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "31 Facts About Dolphins' Intelligence No One Told You About!", "url": "https://kidadl.com/fun-facts/facts-about-dolphins-intelligence-no-one-told-you-about", "text": "Complex and large dolphin brains have developed and evolved over many generations.\nDolphins have a long lifespan with stable communities. These creative mammals display complex emotions like grief, happiness, and sadness.\nDolphin intelligence, commonly known as cetacean intelligence, is the cognitive ability of mammals of Cetacea infraorder of the animal kingdom. Dolphins are aquatic mammals of the extant families Iniidae, Platanistidae, Pontoporiidae, and Delphinidae, with Lipotidae as an extinct family. There are currently 40 dolphin species named dolphins. Dolphins have a body size range from 67-374 in (1.7-9.5 m). They have streamlined bodies with two limbs acting as flippers. They can frequently leap up to 30 ft (9.1 m). Dolphins can travel at 18 mph (29 kph) speed for short distances. Dolphins are known to grieve, learn, teach, scheme, and cooperate. The neocortex of several species contains elongated spindle neurons that were only known in hominids before 2007. These cells in humans are involved in the theory of mind, judgment, emotions, and social conduct. Spindle neurons in cetacean species are present in regions of the brain and are homologous to the location in humans, which suggests that they have the same functioning.\nAlthough dolphins are known to occupy the ocean, there are endangered freshwater dolphins. There are dozens of threatened species as they come into contact with human beings. Two of the major threats these animals face are pollution and getting entangled in a net or fishing gear. Dolphins usually prey on many species of fish that are hunted by commercial fishing ships and chances of dolphins getting stuck in these nets are high. So, the main fisheries are working towards using sustainable fishing gear.\nThe encephalization evolution in cetaceans species is identical to that of primates. Although cetaceans' evolution has increased their encephalization quotient (EQ), body mass, and brain mass, a few species underwent decephalization. However, the selective pressures that caused this are currently under debate. Odontoceti species have a higher EQ than Mysticeti among cetaceans.\nUltimate Facts About The Intelligence Of Dolphins\nAn ultimate fact about the intelligence of dolphins is that bottlenose dolphins or Tursiops truncatus have a brain mass of 3.3-3.7 lb (1,500-1,700 g), which is around four times a chimpanzee's brain mass and marginally greater than human beings.\nPreviously, brain size was considered to be a major indicator of animal intelligence. However, several factors impact intelligence. Scientists found spindle cells in the brains of bottlenose dolphins, beluga whales, Risso's dolphins, killer whales, humpback whales, sperm whales, and fin whales. Dolphin brains have similar complexity to that of elephant brains. Dolphin's brain is more complicated than a human being's brain and the cortex is thicker compared to that of Cetaceans. It was shown for the first time in 2014 that a dolphin species, the long-finned pilot whale, contains more neocortical neurons compared to any mammal studied until now, including humans.\nResearch on dolphins' behavior, both captive-bred and wild dolphins, provided enough data on these marine mammals. Studies show that these marine mammals not only learn as individuals but also pass on their learning to other dolphins. Mother dolphins also pass this knowledge down to their dolphin calves. Among many other animals around the world, there are only a number of other species of animals smarter than dolphins. These animals have abilities like problem-solving, using complex communication systems, and social interaction.\nAlthough research proved these animals' intelligence, dolphins do not have the same cognitive capabilities as us humans, so, they are not smarter species than us. The dolphin brain is similar to the human brain, with two hemispheres. Although, dolphins' large brains are split into four lobes and not three. The fourth lobe of the brain controls senses, while senses in humans are controlled by different parts. So, it is believed that all senses in one lobe allow dolphins to make frequent compound and quick judgments, well beyond the human scope.\nScientific Facts About Dolphins' Intelligence\nAs of the year 1984, scientists were able to observe bottlenose dolphins using tools, in Shark Bay, located in Western Australia.\nMany scientists do not take a firm stand on dolphins' level of intelligence, while many refer to these species as intelligent animals. Darwin's theory states intelligence in species is their ability to recognize what they need, while others think that the intelligence indicators are the ability to solve problems, capacity to communicate, or architecture and size of the brain. Studies on the neocortex, the outside surface of the brain that is responsible for memories, thoughts, and perceptions, show that dolphins have more convolutions compared to the most intelligent people and other mammals. Also, as the hemispheres in dolphins' brains have separate blood supplies, they may use them separately.\nIt was in Shark Bay, Western Australia that adult dolphins were observed to fit some marine sponges (from the ocean floor) around their beaks for protection against harmful, sharp rocks while foraging for fish. The sperm whales have the largest brain in the world, six to seven times bigger than that of a human. It weighs around 19.8 lb (9 kg). Orcas or killer whales have the second largest brain around the world. The surface area of bottlenose dolphins' brains is larger than that of human beings. Also, their bodies are strongly connected to the motive and sensorial regions of the brain, meaning dolphins are sensitive to stress and pain.\nDolphins are known to get involved in complex play behavior including bubble rings or air-core vortex rings. They use two major methods to produce bubble rings. The first one is to swim in circles repeatedly, then stop to inject them into the helical vortex formed. The second method is to rapidly puff a blast of air into the water, then allow this to rise to the surface that forms a ring. Dolphins usually examine their creations with sonar and visuals. They seem to enjoy biting their bubble rings that break into separate bubbles rising to the surface. Some whales also tend to produce bubble nets or bubble rings while foraging. Riding the waves is also a popular play for most dolphins, they either swim in the waves produced by a moving boat's bow, a behavior called bow riding, or natural waves close to shorelines similar to human body-surfing.\nCommunication In Dolphins\nDolphin facts include that types of dolphin species as per where dolphins live are coastal, estuarine, ocean, and freshwater dolphins.\nSpecies of the dolphin family are spread across oceans, usually in shallow waters. Several dolphin species prefer living in a particular water temperature. For example, bottlenose dolphins live in warmer waters and the Atlantic spotted dolphins are found all across temperate and tropical regions of the Atlantic Ocean. There are four river dolphin species. Some more types of dolphins are spinner dolphin, amazon river dolphin, Ganges river dolphin, and Commerson's dolphin.\nDolphins communicate using 'signature whistle' to find each other. Signature whistles from other dolphins are a manner of calling the name of another dolphin. Studies show that dolphins mimic movements, both of other animals and humans. Dolphins are highly successful against predators because they cooperate and organize well, like sharks. There are large areas in our brains that perform high cortical functions, like the ability to remember the past, compute the future, and set them in context. Dolphins also have these regions' developed, so we can assume that dolphins have the same abilities. However, there are some amusing differences between dolphins and humans. The major difference is that they live in water and humans on land. Humans use their hands to manipulate their surroundings. Dolphins, however, are well-adapted to their environment, so they do not need to alter much. Human beings receive information about their surroundings through sight and dolphins rely on sound waves. Also, dolphins use two to three times more ear cells than human beings, allowing them to distinguish between tones and high-frequency noises.\nMother dolphins usually guide their infant dolphins to the surface to take their first breath. Dolphins have high-frequency echolocation that can reach more than 200,000 cycles per second, which is generally used when they find something interesting. However, they use low-frequency sounds during normal activities.\nSigns Of Intelligence In Dolphins\nAn ecological fact about the intelligence of dolphins is that playing is also a great sign of intelligence and dolphins leap, backflip, spin, and tumble.\nAlthough not clearly defined by scientists, self-awareness is thought to be a precursor to advanced processes such as metacognitive reasoning that usually occurs in humans. Research suggests that bottlenose dolphins along with great apes and elephants are self-aware. A test used to define self-awareness in animals is Gordon Gallup's mirror test, where a temporary mark is made on the body of the animal, then presenting a mirror. Dolphins like spinner dolphins are named for being playful. They are known to take high jumping spins. While hunting they produce bubbles to swarm the prey towards the surface. Sometimes, dolphins use a technique known as fish-whacking, where they hit the prey fish with their tail to stun it and then catch the fish.\nOther than whistling, dolphins use squeaks, clicks, yelps, squawks barks, and groans, and these are the most elaborate acoustics among all animals. Studies show that bottlenose dolphins can sleep with only one-half of their brain active, with one open eye. It is believed that dolphins do this to an eye out for each other in their group, to stick close together and avoid sharks. So, they alternate between the brain hemispheres for a rested brain, which takes around four hours. It is still unknown whether dolphins dream during this time, however, it is known that they get a small amount of Rapid Eye Movement sleep, which is the phase in which we experience dreams. A captive group of dolphins kept at the French dolphinarium was apparently heard sleep-talking in a whale song, that they daily listened to during their public shows.\nSome studies state that dolphins, among many other species, can understand some concepts like numerical continuity, although, not just counting. They may have the ability to differentiate between numbers. Many researchers who observe set formation learning ability of animals rank dolphins' level of intelligence at above that of elephants. Although, they do not rank higher than highly intelligent species in problem-solving abilities. Also, a survey taken in 1982 of all the studies on set formation learning indicted that dolphins have a high rank of intelligence after a few other animals."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "What's the difference between dolphins and porpoises?", "url": "https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/dolphin_porpoise.html", "text": "Dolphins have longer noses, bigger mouths, more curved dorsal fins, and longer, leaner bodies than porpoises. The Northeastern Offshore Spotted Dolphin, shown here, has a falcate, or sickle-shaped dorsal fin and light spotting on the belly.\nPeople use the terms dolphins, porpoises, and whales to describe marine mammals belonging to the order Cetacea (from the Greek work ketos, \u201clarge sea creature\u201d), and often use them interchangeably. The orca, or killer whale, for example, is actually the largest member of the dolphin family.\nDolphins are by far more prevalent than porpoises. Most scientists agree that there are 32 dolphin species (plus five closely related species of river dolphin) and only six porpoise species.\nThe harbor porpoise has small pointed flippers and no beak. The dorsal fin is small and triangle-shaped.\nSo what\u2019s the difference? It essentially comes down to their faces (who can forget Flipper\u2019s famous \u201cgrin\u201d?), their fins, and their figures. Dolphins tend to have prominent, elongated \u201cbeaks\u201d and cone-shaped teeth, while porpoises have smaller mouths and spade-shaped teeth. The dolphin\u2019s hooked or curved dorsal fin (the one in the middle of the animal\u2019s back) also differs from the porpoise\u2019s triangular dorsal fin. Generally speaking, dolphin bodies are leaner, and porpoises\u2019 are portly.\nDolphins are also more talkative than porpoises. Dolphins make whistling sounds through their blowholes to communicate with one another underwater. Scientists are pretty sure that porpoises do not do this, and some think this may be due to structural differences in the porpoise\u2019s blowhole.\nDolphins and porpoises have many similarities, one of which is their extreme intelligence. Both have large, complex brains and a structure in their foreheads, called the melon, with which they generate sonar (sound waves) to navigate their underwater world.\nIt is likely that more (or fewer) differences between dolphins and porpoises will be revealed as researchers continue to investigate these intriguing sentinels of the sea."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Ocean Animals - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Ocean-animals.html", "text": "ocean Animals\nOcean animals consist of four main types of warm-blooded, live-bearing marine mammals - whales, seals, manatees and otters.\nThe evolutionary paths of these complicated animals finds them crawling out of the prehistoric ocean onto dry land as cold-bloodied creatures hundreds of millions of years ago.\nOnce on land, they developed lungs and limbs, their bodies gained the ability to regulate their own temperature and they began to bear live young. Then, some 50 million years ago, they returned to the sea again as robust mammals.\nEach family transformed back to sea animals in varying degrees.\nThe otters retained their hind limbs and nimble front paws for grasping food. On the others, the digits of the feet webbed back together into powerful flippers.\nThe return to the sea, with its vast food sources and immense territories, has been a very successful one for these ocean animals.\nThe largest living animal on Earth - the blue whale - and the biggest population of large carnivores - the seals- evolved only after they returned to the depths.\nWith the dolphin and the sea otter among them, ocean animals include some of the most complex, fascinating and intelligent beings on our planet. - Ocean Animals Facts\ncheck out our youtube channel!\nstart with the sea otter\nAlthough sea otters spend virtually all of their lives in the ocean, two things separate them from the other marine mammals, and make some scientists question them being included in the category.\nFirst and most obvious, sea otters have four usable legs with separate but webbed toes on each hind foot, and dexterous, hand-like front paws.\nSecond, although very well padded, sea otters do not have the same extensive blubber layer that all the other marine mammals bodies are lined with.\nInstead, the sea otter has what was nearly its downfall, the most densely furred and warmest coat in the animal kingdom, with over 800,000 hairs per square inch!\nSea otters, as opposed to river otters, eat and sleep on the water, wrapping their buoyant bodies in seaweed to keep from drifting while they nap.\nsegue to some seals - The pinnipeds\nSeals, sea lions, and walruses are all pinnipeds or \"fin-footed\" mammals. Venturing further from shore, and deeper into the depths than the otters, the seals are the next evolutionary step in our return to the sea.\nThe eared seals, including sea lions and fur seals, have small external ear flaps, powerful forward angled shoulder blades, larger front flippers and more flexible, separated hind flippers than the \"true seals\".\nEared seals spend a great deal of time on land, breeding and sunning on the shores. With long, powerful front flippers, their natural position is upright with the chest raised off the ground.\nTheir rear legs are two separate, front-facing flippers that can be rotated under the body, and they can rise up and move around with a two beat gate. Also often referred to as the \"walking seals\", the eared seals can actually walk, and even run, quite rapidly when necessary.\nThe \"true seals\" have returned even farther back to the ocean. They have no external ear flaps, smaller front flippers and rearward facing hind limbs that are fused together into one scalloped flipper, like a mermaids tail.\nThey move across land by stretching their upper bodies out and arching their backs to pull themselves forward.\nTrue seals also swim differently from eared seals, getting most of their propulsion from their fused, tail-like rear flippers and undulating motions similar to a dolphin to propel themselves, while the eared seals use their strong front flippers as big, highly effective oars, appearing to fly through the water like birds.\nWalruses have skeletons designed more like the eared seals, but have no ears. They move like the true seals in the water, but like the eared seals on land, and so are somewhere in between these two groups, and are classified in a genus of their own. - Ocean Animals Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Instead, their nostrils have moved to the top of their heads and come together as one large blow-hole that allows them to take in breaths while barely breaking the waters surface.\nX-rays of dolphin flippers reveal the remnants on life on land - three long finger-like digits, and one very short bone that is disappearing through adaption to a fully aquatic life.\nScientists believe the dolphins ancestors still lived at least partially on land about 65 to 70 million years ago.\na few more ocean Animal facts\nThere are two major types of seals - the \"eared seals\" with external ears like the sea lion and fur seal, and the \"true seals\" who have no external ears.\nThe sperm whales massive oil-filled head prevents it from getting \"the bends\" when it surfaces after deep water dives.\nThe largest \"true seal\" is the elephant seal.

Two subspecies of Hector\u2019s dolphins have been formally recognized based on multiple morphological distinctions and genetic evidence of reproductive isolation. One subspecies with the common name of Hector's dolphin occurs in the waters around the South Island of New Zealand. The other subspecies known as the M\u0101ui dolphin, or Maui\u2019s dolphin, occurs only in waters off the west coast of the North Island of New Zealand. Substantial declines in this species have been detected for most populations, mainly as a result of bycatch in gillnets. In 2017, NOAA Fisheries listed the M\u0101ui dolphin subspecies as endangered and the Hector\u2019s dolphin subspecies as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.\nProtected Status\nESA Endangered - Foreign Maui's dolphin subspecies ESA Threatened - Foreign South Island Hector's dolphin subspecies MMPA Protected Throughout Its Range\nAppearance\nHector's dolphins are among the smallest dolphins in the world. They have short and stocky bodies, no external beak, and a relatively large fluke. Both subspecies typically have a total body length of four to five feet at maturity, with M\u0101ui dolphins reaching a larger size than Hector\u2019s dolphins and females of both subspecies reaching larger sizes than males. They have a very rounded dorsal fin and paddle-like pectoral fins. Their distinctive gray, black, and white coloring changes as the dolphin ages from a newborn calf into an adult. As an adult, the sides of the head, tail, dorsal fin, and flippers are black; the throat, lower jaw, and belly are white; and most of the rest of the body is gray. A thin black line also curves from the head to just behind the blowhole. They have 26 to 32 pairs of small, conical teeth in the upper and lower jaws.\nBehavior and Diet\nHector\u2019s dolphins occur in small groups averaging two to four dolphins and up to 20 dolphins. Hector\u2019s dolphins display a wide range of behaviors, including body contacts, bubble-blowing, leaping, lobtailing (slapping the water surface with the fluke), and spyhopping (holding the body vertically with head above the water surface). Generally, they are less active in terms of jumping compared to some other species (e.g., spinner and dusky dolphins). Hector's dolphins have a varied diet that includes cephalopods, crustaceans, and small fish species. Species such as red cod, ahuru, arrow squid, sprat, sole, and stargazer comprise the bulk of their diet.\nWhere They Live\nHector\u2019s dolphins are coastal dolphins native to New Zealand. M\u0101ui dolphins are currently found only along the northwest coast of the North Island, between Maunganui Bluff and Whanganui. The South Island Hector\u2019s dolphins are found in the waters around the South Island and consist of at least three genetically distinct, regional populations. Hector\u2019s dolphins are typically sighted within about 20 nautical miles of the coast and in water less than 328 feet deep. Hector\u2019s dolphins have relatively small home ranges (typically less than about 31 miles) and high site fidelity, although some longer movements appear to be possible (e.g., over about 250 miles).\nWorld map providing approximate representation of Hector's dolphin's range.\nLifespan & Reproduction\nMaximum age is at least 22 years and sexual maturity is reached at about 6 to 9 years of age. Females typically produce single calves every 2 to 4 years, and calves remain with their mothers for 1 to 2 years, although 2 years is more common.\nThreats\nThe largest threat to both subspecies is bycatch in commercial and recreational gillnets and trawls. Habitat-related threats, disease, and tourism may also negatively impact the dolphins. Fisheries restrictions and other management efforts have gradually increased over time; however, both subspecies are still expected to decline. Low population growth rates also contribute to the dolphins\u2019 vulnerability.\nScientific Classification"}

Credit: NOAA Fisheries/J. Cotton\nAbout the Species\nRisso's dolphins, sometimes called gray dolphins, are found in the temperate and tropical zones of all the world\u2019s oceans. These cetaceans generally prefer deeper offshore waters, especially near the continental shelf edge and slope, where they can dive to at least 1,000 feet and hold their breath for 30 minutes. They are also very active on the ocean surface. Risso's dolphins are typically found in groups of between 10 and 30 animals, though they have been reported as solitary individuals, in pairs, or in loose aggregations in the hundreds or thousands. Occasionally, this species associates with other dolphins and whales. They are sometimes considered part of a subfamily referred to as \u201cblackfish,\u201d which also includes false killer whales, pygmy killer whales, melon-headed whales, long-finned pilot whales, and short-finned pilot whales. Risso\u2019s dolphins in the United States are not endangered or threatened. Like all marine mammals, they are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. NOAA Fisheries and its partners are working to conserve Risso\u2019s dolphins and further our understanding of this species through research and conservation activities.\nPopulation Status\nNOAA Fisheries estimates population size for each stock of Risso\u2019s dolphin in its stock assessment reports.\nProtected Status\nCITES Appendix II Throughout Its Range SPAW Annex II Throughout the Wider Caribbean Region MMPA Protected Throughout Its Range\nAppearance\nRisso's dolphins have a robust body with a narrow tailstock. These medium-sized cetaceans can reach lengths of approximately 8.5 to 13 feet and weigh 660 to 1,100 pounds. Males and females are usually about the same size. They have a bulbous head with a vertical crease and an indistinguishable rostrum. They have a tall, curved, sickle-shaped dorsal fin located mid-way down their back. Calves have a dark cape and saddle, with little or no scarring on their body. As Risso's dolphins age, their coloration lightens from black, dark gray, or brown to pale gray or almost white. Adult bodies are usually heavily scarred, with scratches caused from teeth raking between dolphins, as well as circular markings from prey (e.g., squid), cookie-cutter sharks, and lampreys. Mature adults swimming just under the water's surface usually appear white. Risso\u2019s dolphins have two to seven pairs of peg-like teeth in the front of their lower jaw to capture prey and usually none in their upper jaw. This low number of teeth is unusual when compared with other cetaceans.\nBehavior and Diet\nRisso's dolphins are typically found in groups that average between 10 and 30 animals, but they have been reported as solitary individuals, in pairs, or in loose aggregations of hundreds and thousands. Occasionally, this species associates with other dolphins and whales, such as bottlenose dolphins, gray whales, northern right whale dolphins, and Pacific white-sided dolphins. When at the surface, they have a small inconspicuous blow if backlit (which is more distinct after long dives), and their head partially emerges at a 45\u00b0 angle. Before diving, they usually take 10 to 12 breaths at 15- to 20-second intervals and will often display their tails (known as flukes). Risso\u2019s dolphins are very active on the surface, often leaping out of the water, slapping their pectoral flippers or tails on the water's surface, and raising their heads vertically out of the water (known as spyhopping). They occasionally 'porpoise'\u2014or move in and out of the water in a series of high-speed leaps\u2014most often when being pursued or hunted by predators. Risso's dolphins can dive to at least 1,000 feet and hold their breath for 30 minutes, but they usually make shorter dives of just a few minutes. They feed on fish (e.g., anchovies), krill, and cephalopods (e.g., squid, octopus, and cuttlefish) mainly at night, when their prey is closer to the surface. Most of their diet consists of squid, and they have been known to move into continental shelf waters when following their preferred prey.\nWhere They Live\nRisso's dolphins have a cosmopolitan distribution, meaning they can be found worldwide in temperate, subtropical, and tropical oceans and seas from latitudes 64\u00b0 North to 46\u00b0 South. Their preferred habitats appear to be mid-temperate waters of the continental shelf and slope between 30\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 latitude. They prefer areas of deeper waters (3,300 feet) with steep bottom topography, but they are known to inhabit shallow coastal areas as well. In the Northern Hemisphere, their range includes the Gulf of Alaska, Gulf of Mexico, Newfoundland, Azores, Norway, Japan, Russia, and the Red Sea. In addition, they are known to inhabit the Mediterranean Sea, are rare in the Black Sea, and do not appear to inhabit the Persian Gulf and some other very shallow, enclosed bodies of water. In the Southern Hemisphere, their range includes Argentina, Australia, Chile, South Africa, and New Zealand. Little is known of their migration patterns or movements, but Risso\u2019s dolphins may be affected by movements of spawning squid and oceanographic conditions.\nLifespan & Reproduction\nRisso\u2019s dolphins have an estimated lifespan of at least 35 years. Individuals become sexually mature when they reach a length of about 8.5 to 9 feet. Breeding and calving may occur year-round and the gestation period lasts approximately 13 to 14 months. The peak of the breeding and calving season may vary geographically (especially in the North Pacific), with most animal births occurring from summer to fall in Japanese waters and from fall to winter in California waters. Newborn calves are usually 3.5 to 5.5 feet in length and weigh about 45 pounds.\nThreats\nEntanglement One of the main threats to Risso\u2019s dolphins is becoming entangled or captured in commercial fishing gear such as gillnets, longlines, and trawls. Hunting Risso\u2019s dolphins are directly hunted for meat and oil in Indonesia, Japan, the Caribbean (the Lesser Antilles), Sri Lanka, and the Solomon Islands. Ocean Noise Underwater noise threatens Risso's dolphin populations, interrupting their normal behavior and driving them away from areas important to their survival. Increasing evidence suggests that exposure to intense underwater sound in some settings may cause this species to strand and ultimately die. Contaminants Contaminants enter ocean waters from many sources, including oil and gas development, wastewater discharges, urban runoff, and other industrial processes. Once in the environment, these contaminants move up the food chain and accumulate in predators at the top, such as Risso\u2019s dolphins. Because of their long lifespan and blubber stores, Risso\u2019s dolphins accumulate contaminants including trace metals and organochlorines like PCBs and DDTs in their bodies, threatening their immune and reproductive systems. Coastal populations generally are more susceptible.\nScientific Classification"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphin Mating and Reproduction - Everything You Need to Know", "url": "https://www.animalwised.com/dolphin-mating-and-reproduction-3233.html", "text": "Dolphins are thought to be very sociable and even friendly animals. We can see this by their gregarious nature, creating complex social dynamics in their pods. We also know of various instances where dolphins have built personal relationships with humans. While they have the potential to be friendly, we should not consider them frivolous animals. They exhibit some of the greatest intelligence in all the animal kingdom and limiting their characteristics is to do them a disservice. One of the most fascinating ways we can see this intelligence at work is when we look at dolphins mating. The structure and behaviors carried out during reproduction reveal how complex these aquatic mammals are. AnimalWised looks into dolphin mating and reproduction so you can see just why this is.\nDolphin characteristics\nBefore we explain specific behaviors linked to dolphins mating, we should provide some general background information. Dolphins are cetaceans, a type of mammal which was previously terrestrial, but then adapted to water via evolution. One aspect retained from their land walking heritage is their need to breathe air from the surface to intake oxygen. This is why it is common to see them swimming near the surface of the water. There are many different species of dolphin which display various morphologies. They range between 1.5 m (as can be seen in the Maui dolphin) to the killer whale, the largest dolphin species and not a whale at all. All of them have a stylized body and an elongated snout, but lengths vary. They have a blowhole on the top of their body, a kind of spiracle which allows them to breathe air from the surface. Dolphins can live on their own, but the majority live in groups. The size can vary according to individual and species. In a group, each member has a role depending on their age, sex, time of reproduction, etc. Among its main predators are sharks and other dolphins. For example, orcas (killer whales) regularly feed on dolphins. However, one of the most important and immediate threats to dolphins is we humans. They are victims of pollution, plastics, overfishing and other threats to their future.\nHow do dolphins reproduce?\nTo look at dolphins mating, we are going to focus mainly on bottlenose dolphins. These are perhaps the most famous and recognizable of all dolphin species, although this could be contended by orcas. Bottlenose dolphin mating is a mystery to most human beings, partly because it occurs underwater and is not regularly recorded. However, the process is very similar to that of other mammals. Females have an ovulation period after which they mate with the male for fertilization. Once fertilized, the embryo begins to form within the womb and labor occurs once fully developed. Bottlenose dolphins reach sexual maturity around the ages of 5 to 7. However, this does vary according to species as some can take up to 13 years. Males become sexually mature before females. Since it takes years to reproduce, many people wonder how long do dolphins live? Again, this depends on the species. Some can live up to 60 years, but bottlenose dolphins average between 30 and 40 years. Since their life expectancy differs from species to species, it is normal for the time they reach sexual maturity to also vary. What is common to all species is, once sexual maturity is reached, dolphins will become very sexually active. This is especially the case for males. How do dolphins mate? Now we know when they become sexually mature, we can look at the process of dolphins mating more closely. Before allowing the male to approach, there is a necessary mating ritual. This ritual consists of the male performing different swimming movements around the female. At first glance, they may look like other underwater games. During the procession of this mating ritual, it is common for several males to compete for the same female. They may even attack each other to show which is strongest. When the female dolphin eventually agrees to mate, she approaches with her genitals towards the chosen male. Female dolphins have a vagina and males have a penis and testicles. The female and male interlock with their bellies touching and fertilization n can begin. While the male has to penetrate deep for fertilization, the whole process may only take a few seconds and require copulation to be repeated several times. When do dolphins reproduce? Usually dolphins will mate during the warmer times of the year (spring/summer). They may migrate to warmer areas to reproduce. There is no single time or heat cycle for female dolphins. They can ovulate between two and seven times a year, depending on the species. They are seasonal polyestrous, meaning their reproductive season occurs between spring and autumn. Dolphins are polygamous and males can mate with several females in a single day. Additionally, they are one of the few non-human animals to have sex for pleasure. What kind of reproduction do dolphins have? As we have already seen, dolphins take part in sexual reproduction. This means that dolphins reproduce by intercourse and fertilization. They are viviparous animals, as almost all mammals are, meaning they give birth to live offspring.\nDolphin gestation period\nOnce fertilization occurs, dolphins begin to develop inside their mother's womb. There they are surrounded in placenta and are connected by an umbilical cord. The gestation period of the dolphin is around 12 months, again with some variance according to species. As with most female mammals, during pregnancy the female dolphin will tend to eat more food. This is both to ensure the proper development of the fetus and to ensure they can continued feeding after they have given birth. In some species, such as as the bottlenose dolphin, it has been observed that pregnant females will swim to warmer waters to give birth. A more temperate climate will help bolster chances of survival for their young. It is difficult to monitor dolphin reproduction in the wild. While we know a little about some species such as bottle ose dolphins, it is still largely unknown if all dolphin mating occurs in the same way for each species.\nHow are dolphins born?\nTo know more about dolphin reproduction, we should look into how the animals are born. Unlike human beings, dolphins do not exit the womb headfirst. Instead, they emerge at the tail end, followed by the rest of the body. Once the baby has left the womb, the umbilical cord is broken and the baby rises to the surface (usually with the help of the mother) to take their first breath. This process usually takes around 40 to 60 minutes, although it may extend to three hours. Since the female loses a lot of blood during labor, many predators can seize this moment to hunt her and her young. However, dolphins are one of the few non-human animals which enact attended births. When a dolphin is giving birth, other members of the pod place themselves around her for protection. During the labor process, one or more females may approach to verify everything is going OK. How many babies can dolphins have? Depending on the species, a dolphin will give birth to only one baby every 2-3 years. It is very rare for a dolphin to give birth to more than one dolphin calf at a time. How big are dolphin calves at birth? Depending on the species, at birth a dolphin can weigh up to 40 kg and measure between 1 and 1.5 meters. Once born, the dolphin goes through various stages of development, much of which has become a fascination for humans. More than dolphins mating, you can find out about these different life cycles below.\nBirth of a dolphin: video\nUnfortunately, there is little footage of dolphins giving birth in the wild exists. However, in the following video, you can see the birth of a dolphin calf in one of the Dolphin Quest enclosure:\nHow long do dolphins stay with their mother?\nWhen dolphins are born, they feed on breast milk. This is because, their mothers have mammary glands. In general, the lactation period of dolphins lasts between 12 and 24 months. Again, the length of breastfeeding time is species dependent. Also, in the wild, researchers are still analyzing details related to dolphin lactation, making difficult to create a general average for all dolphin species. Generally, dolphin young will remain with their mother for a few more years after the period of breastfeeding has been completed. The average seems to be around 3 to 6 years in total. During this time, the offspring learn everything they can about social relationships, hunting methods, finding food and anything else they may need to be an adult dolphin. It is common for a dolphin mother to go away from their child for certain periods, leaving them in the care of other dolphins in the group. Gradually offspring are encouraged to become more independent. Again, we want to emphasize that studies of dolphins in the wild are limited. Most dolphin studies have been carried out on captive specimens, the extent to which this affects their behavior, we do not know. This means it can be difficult to fully comprehend their true social relationships. Among the different dolphin species which exist, the bottlenose dolphin has been the most studied in the wild. However, there is still a lot to discover in terms of dolphin mating and reproduction.\nWhat do dolphins eat?\nDolphin feeding depends on age. Newborn dolphins feed on breast milk. As with other mammals, the dolphin will wean the babies off of breast milk onto more solid food. Once weaned, the dolphins will move on to an adult diet. Although for a long time it was a mystery, today we know that bottlenose dolphins have a daily diet of up to 5 kilograms of fish, squid, octopus, mollusks and other small marine animals. They do not chew they prey, but swallow them whole once they have them caught in their powerful jaws. To facilitate this process, they use the muscles at the back of their tongue and throat. These help them to either expel water or direct the fish to their stomach. Among the many fascinating facts about dolphins, one of them has to do with the mechanism they use to catch their prey. Specifically, they use echolocation. This is a skill which works like a radar. They emit sounds and the reflection of these sounds helps them to locate fish, other dolphins, predators and many other things in their environment. They can observe the location of prey from great distances. When they attack, they do so as a group. Several individuals form a circle or semicircle which surrounds a school of fish, then they make their attack in turns, allowing each member to eat.\nFascinating dolphin facts\nDolphins are fascinating animals which elicit much curiosity from we humans. Appropriately, here are some fascinating facts to pique this interest even further. How do dolphins move? Dolphins live in both freshwater and seawater, but prefer shallow waters nearer the shore in general. This is especially so in oceans where they prefer tropical and temperate climates. They don't like cold waters. To move themselves away from these colder waters, they make long migrations, reaching speeds of up to 54 kmph. Researchers believe it is not only warm temperatures they prefer, but the greater abundance of prey in the regions they go to. How do dolphins sleep? Since we would find it difficult to sleep in water without a lilo, especially when at the mercy of currents. Dolphins are able to do this without the aid of a flotation device via an ingenious method. They are able to turn half of their brain off to sleep, while the other half remains active and keeps the body afloat by kicking the tail back and forth. The tail kicking keeps the dolphin's head and their blowhole out of the water. This allows for air to pass into the blowhole and keep the dolphin alive. Another curious fact is that there are recorded instances of dolphins committing suicide by going underneath the water and never returning to the surface. Other curiosities about dolphins Since these marine animals are so interesting, here are a few short facts to enjoy: They lack a sense of smell.\nThey need to approach the surface every 10 minutes to breathe fresh air.\nto breathe fresh air. They have a highly developed sense of hearing, can listen at great distances and even differentiate the sound of certain materials.\nThey are collaborators with each other, live in groups and provide support when one of the members has been injured.\nThey communicate through echolocation, dancing and jumping.

The smile is simply their jaw shape.\nTop image credit: Courtnie Tosana\nDolphins help keep our environment in balance by eating other animals \u2013 mainly fish and squid \u2013 and are food for other marine animals like sharks. Scientists also see dolphins as indicators of the health of our oceans. Studying their biology can reveal if there are problems in the environment, like pollution, that are harming them; these problems could be affecting people too.\nCreature confusion\nThe world\u2019s largest dolphin is the orca \u2013 confusingly known as a killer whale. It can weigh up to 10 tons and measure up to 10m. The smallest dolphin \u2013 Maui's dolphin, which lives around New Zealand \u2013 only reaches 1.2m.\nThere are 42 species of dolphins and seven species of porpoises \u2013 their close relatives. Most species live in marine waters and in hot and cold climates. A few species, like the Amazon pink river dolphin, live in freshwater.\nClever communicators\nDolphins communicate in many different ways \u2013 including squeaking, clicking and whistling. Each dolphin has a unique whistle \u2013 it helps them recognise each other \u2013 meaning whistles work very much like human names.\nThey also use high-pitched clicking sounds for echolocation \u2013 to help them navigate and find food. The clicks hit objects in the water and then bounce back as echoes. This helps dolphins work out what and where objects are.\nDespite what some people think, dolphins don\u2019t communicate by smiling when they are happy. The smile is simply their jaw shape.\nAnimal athletes\nDolphins are extremely powerful animals. Some species can swim up to speeds of 50kph and regularly dive to depths of up to 55 metres to forage for their favourite foods of fish, squid and crustaceans. They travel and hunt in pods \u2013 groups of just a few, or 30 or more dolphins \u2013 and have big territories. These are on average around 100km\u00b2 \u2013 with some ranging up to a massive 400km\u00b2; that\u2019s about half as big as New York City.\nDolphins spend around 17% of their day hunting and feeding and 50% travelling around their range.\nBecause dolphins can\u2019t breathe under water, they hold their breath for a long time. When dolphins swim quickly, they leap out of the water to catch their breath. But when they swim slowly, they simply surface and breathe once or twice a minute.\nCredit: Mandurah Cruises\nBaby basics\nThe age at which dolphins are ready to mate depends very much on the species \u2013 anything from around 5\u201313 years old. Bottlenose dolphins generally mate between 5\u20137 years old and will give birth every two to three years. The length of a dolphin pregnancy varies from 9\u201316 months depending on the species, but for bottlenoses it is around 12 months.\nFemales usually just have one baby and they usually give birth surrounded by other members of their pod who protect them from predators. Dolphin babies are born fluke (tail) first and then feed off their mother\u2019s milk for around three years.\nCruel entertainment\nThere are over 3,000 dolphins \u2013 mostly bottlenose \u2013 in captivity around the world, suffering for people\u2019s entertainment. Many have been hunted and snatched from the wild; others have been bred in captivity. All are forced to live in pools and tanks many thousands of times smaller than their natural habitat - causing them physical and psychological harm. They endure unnatural and stressful interactions with tourists for selfie and swimming experiences and are trained to perform demeaning tricks.\nWith your help we will stop the cruelty that the wildlife trade for entertainment inflicts on the world\u2019s dolphins. We are exposing how dolphins suffer in captivity and are calling on travel agencies to stop selling tickets to dolphin entertainment venues.\nWith your support we can make this the last generation of dolphins in captivity. Together, we will keep these amazing animals in the wild \u2013 where they belong."}

The Bottle Nosed Dolphin and the Common Dolphin live in these waters. Other species pass through en route when migrating.\nWhales, dolphins and porpoises all have a blubbery layer of fat around their body. This blubber allows them to stay warm in cold waters such as the Galapagos waters and gives them extra energy during long migrations.\nTake a look at these amazing, intelligent mammals that live and pass through the cold waters of the Galapagos Islands:\nBottle Nosed Dolphin\nThe Bottle Nosed Dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is the most common and well-known dolphin. Bottled Nosed Dolphins can be seen riding the bow wave in front of boats.\nThe Bottle nosed Dolphin is grey, varying from dark grey at the top near the dorsal fin to very light grey and almost white at the underside.\nAdults range in length from 2 to 4 metres (6 to 13 feet) and weigh from 150 to 650 kilograms (330 to 1430 pounds). Males are longer and heavier than females.\nThe Bottlenose dolphin in the Galapagos cooler pelagic waters tend to be larger than their cousins who inhabit warmer, shallower waters. Those in colder waters have a fattier composition more suited to deep-diving.\nThe lifespan of the female Bottlenose Dolphin is about 40 years, whereas males rarely live more than 30 years.\nYou can read more about the Bottle Nosed Dolphin in the Marine section.\nCommon Dolphin\nThere are two species of Common Dolphin that inhabit the Galapagos waters: Long-Beaked Common Dolphins (Delphinus capensis) and the Short-Beaked Common Dolphins (Delphinus delphis). Common Dolphin can be seen in schools of more than 100. Schools of Common Dolphins are generally very active. These large groups often surface, jump and splash together.\nThe Common Dolphins typical behaviour includes breaching, tail-slapping, chin-slapping, bow-riding and porpoising.\nCommon Dolphins measure up to 2.4 metres in length and weigh around 110 kilograms. Common Dolphins have a distinctive yellowish hourglass pattern on their sides which makes them easy to identify. Their back and upper flanks are brownish or black and the chest and belly are creamy-white in color. There is a tan/yellow patch on the sides. Flukes, flippers and dorsal fin are dark and the beak is long and slim. There are black stripes from the flipper to middle of the lower jaw and from the eye to the base of the beak. Common dolphin males are slightly larger than the females.\nCommon dolphins face a mixture of threats due to human influence. Populations have been hunted off the coast of Peru for use as food and shark bait. In most other areas the dolphins have not been hunted directly. Several thousand individuals have been caught in industrial trawler nets throughout their range. Common dolphins were abundant in the western Mediterranean Sea until the 1960s but occurrences there have tailed off rapidly.\nYou can read more about the Common Dolphin in the Marine section.\nRisso\u2019s Dolphin\nThe Risso\u2019s Dolphin (Grampus griseus) is the only species of dolphin in the genus Grampus. Risso\u2019s dolphins can be easily identified by their scarred skin. This is caused by other Risso\u2019s dolphins who use their front teeth when playing and fighting. Risso\u2019s dolphins measure around 2.5 \u2013 4 metres in length and weigh between 300 \u2013 500 kilograms. Males are typically larger than females.\nRisso\u2019s dolphins are light grey in color and have no beak. They have a stocky head and white coloring under their chin. Their dorsal fin is like that of a shark.\nRisso\u2019s dolphins can be seen around the Galapagos islands, however, they inhabit all seas, particularly temperate waters. Risso\u2019s dolphins feed on squid and fish. They live in schools of 3 \u2013 50 individuals and are often in the company of other cetaceans (dolphins and whales).\nGlobal threats include hunting, human disturbance, habitat loss, prey depletion, pollution and entanglement in nets although they are classified as Data Deficient by the 2000 IUCN Red List.\nYou can read more about the Risso\u2019s Dolphin in the Marine section.\nSpinner Dolphin\nThe Spinner Dolphin (Stenella longirostris) is a small dolphin found in off-shore tropical waters around the world. The colder waters of Fernandina Island and Isabela Island are superb for dolphin and whale watching and Spinner Dolphins can regularly be observed. The Spinner Dolphin is famous for its acrobatic displays in which they will spin longitudinally along their axis as they leap through the air.\nThe Spinner Dolphin is a slender creature with a long, thin beak to which the distinct forehead slopes gently. Their flippers are long and pointed and it has a dark grey or black dorsal cape, paler flanks and sides and a creamy-white belly.\nSpinner Dolphins measure between 1.3 and 2.1 metres in length and weigh between 45 \u2013 75 kilograms. The Spinner Dolphin occupies both offshore and inshore waters.\nThe total population of Spinner Dolphins is unknown but it is certainly dramatically reduced by fishing activity in the eastern Pacific and regarded as endangered.\nYou can read more about the Spinner Dolphin in the Marine section.\nPantropical Spotted Dolphins\nThe Pantropical Spotted Dolphin (Stenella attenuata) can be found in all the worlds oceans and can regularly be observed in the Galapagos waters. The Pantropical Spotted Dolphin varies significantly in size and coloration throughout its range. The ones that inhabit the cooler, pelagic waters of the Galapagos are larger and more spotted than their warmer water relatives.\nThe Pantropical Spotted Dolphin has a long thin beak. The upper and lower jaws are darkly colored but are separated by what appear to be \u2018thin white lips\u2019. The chin, throat and belly are white to pale grey with a small amount of spots. The flanks are separated into three distinct bands of color \u2014 the lightest at the bottom, followed by a thin grey strip in the middle of the flank and a dark grey back.\nThe Pantropical Spotted Dolphin was beginning to come under threat due to the killing of millions of individuals in tuna purse seines (a large fishing net that hangs vertically in the water by attaching weights along the bottom edge and floats along the top). The 1980s saw the rise of \u2018dolphin-friendly tuna\u2019 in order to save millions of the species in the eastern Pacific Ocean.\nYou can read more about the Spotted Dolphin in the Marine section."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Commerson's Dolphin Facts and Information - SeaWorld", "url": "https://seaworld.org/animals/facts/mammals/commersons-dolphin/", "text": "Scientific Classification\nCommon Name Commerson's Dolphin Kingdom Animalia Phylum Chordata Class Mammalia Order Cetacea Family Delphinidae Genus Species Cephalorhynchus commersonii\nTwo subspecies are recognized: C. c. commersonii in southern South America and C. c. kerguelenensis in the Kerguelen Islands. The Kerguelen subspecies was apparently founded by a few individuals as recently as 10,000 years ago.\nFast Facts\nDescription Commerson's dolphins are a small and very distinctive species with mostly black on the head, fin and flipper regions and mostly white in the other areas of the body. Young Commerson's are usually brown or black and gray for the first four to five months. The dorsal fin is small and rounded at the tip and the beak is small or unnoticeable.\nFemale: In this species, females are typically larger than males. Size These are one of the smallest dolphins reaching lengths of up to 1.2 to 1.7 m (3.9 to 5.6 ft.). Females are typically larger than males. Newborn calves are approximately 55 to 65 cm (21.7 to 25.6 in.) in length. Weight Commerson's dolphins can reach weights of up to 35 to 60 kg (77 to 132 lbs.). At birth, calves average 4.5 to 5.5 kg (10 to 12 lbs.). Diet Commerson's Dolphins in South America appear to be opportunistic, feeding on various pelagic and bentho-pelagic species of fish, cephalopods, crustaceans, and benthic invertebrates in coastal waters but also on pelagic schooling fish in more open areas. In the Kerguelen Islands, they seem to have a more restricted diet, consisting mostly of semi-pelagic fishes (e.g. Champsocephalus gunnari) and to some extent benthic fishes. Incubation Gestation lasts a maximum of approximately 12 months. Estral Period Between late winter and early spring Nursing Duration Unknown; at least 4 or more months Sexual Maturity 5 to 8 years Life Span 15 to 18 years Range From the tip of South America (Peninsula Valdes to Tierra del Fuego), through the Strait of Magellan, around the Falkland Islands and the Kerguelen Islands. There are two populations of Commerson's dolphins; the population off the coast of southern South America and another population found around the Kerguelen Islands, which is considered a distinct subspecies. The two subspecies of Commerson\u2019s Dolphins are separated by 130\u00b0 of longitude and about 8,500 km or 5,270 miles. Habitat Commerson's Dolphins are found in cold inshore waters along open coasts, in sheltered fjords, bays, harbors and river mouths, and occasionally in the lower reaches of rivers. Population Global: Commerson's Dolphins seem to be the most abundant species of the genus Cephalorhynchus although much of its range has not been surveyed and there are only a few estimates of abundance\nStatus IUCN: Least concern; the Kerguelen subspecies is currently listed as Endangered in the regional IUCN Red List for French Southern Territories\nCITES: Appendix II\nUSFWS: Not listed\nFun Facts\nCommerson's dolphins typically eat 3.5 to 6 kg (8 to 13 lbs.) of food per day. This is proportionally a much greater amount than either killer whales or bottlenose dolphins ingest each day, and is due to their metabolic rate that is two to three times higher than many other whale or dolphin species. The first Commerson's dolphin calf ever born in a marine zoological environment was born at SeaWorld San Diego on February 21, 1985. The calf weighed approximately 9 kg (20 lbs.) and measured 61 cm (2 ft.). Commerson's dolphins are fast and highly maneuverable cetaceans regularly swimming at speeds of 11 to 13 kph (7 to 8 mph). These dolphins are commonly seen wave-riding in the bows or wakes of high-speed boats, shoreline breakers or groundswells. Commerson's dolphins are typically found alone or in small groups of 2 to 3 animals and occasionally spotted in larger groups of 20 to 30 or more dolphins. They often hunt cooperatively either encircling fish and taking turns passing through to feed on the clustered fish or even driving fish onshore and temporarily stranding themselves to snatch up the fish. To learn more about Commerson's Dolphin, explore the Commerson's Dolphin Infobook.\nEcology and Conservation\nFeeding behavior and group size depend on the habitat type. Group size may reach one hundred individuals when the dolphins are feeding on schooling pelagic fish. When they are feeding in tidal areas in front of small rivers, in kelp forests and in waters influenced by river discharge, they are more typically alone or in small groups.\nWithin their range, Commerson's dolphins are considered fairly common. However, some are inadvertently caught and killed in fishing nets throughout part of their range, especially off the coast of Argentina. In the past, local fishermen intentionally caught these dolphins for food, oil or bait. Now that this practice is illegal, the rate of hunting for Commerson's dolphins has allegedly declined. Yet, it is not known how much accidental catch or entanglement in fishing gear continues to affect population numbers. YIn some parts of their range, Commerson's dolphins have been found with elevated levels of industrial pollutants, which may also pose a threat to population numbers.\nAs with other species of cetaceans, international laws protect Commerson's dolphins.\nBibliography\nJefferson, T.J.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "All About Bottlenose Dolphins - Senses - SeaWorld", "url": "https://seaworld.org/animals/all-about/bottlenose-dolphin/senses/", "text": "Brain\nComparisons of mammal brains are described as the ratio of brain size relative to body size. Bottlenose dolphin brains are larger than many other mammals of the same body size. Scientists are still determining what aquatic adaptations require the large brain size. One likely theory is that a larger brain size in dolphins may be at least partially due to an increased size of the auditory region to facilitate sound processing.\nHypotheses that large brain size in dolphins indicates high intelligence are untested and disputed. The ability of an animal to process information is based upon its brain anatomy as well as the specific experiences the animal has. Rating the intelligence of different animals is misleading and extremely subjective. In fact, a reliable and consistent intelligence test for humans has yet to be developed. It would be improper to attempt to quantify or qualify the intelligence of animals using only human guidelines.\nHearing\nDolphins have a well-developed, acute sense of hearing.\nThe auditory cortex of the brain is highly developed.\nThe dolphin's auditory nerve is about twice the diameter of the human eighth nerve (connecting the inner ear to the brainstem) leading to more rapid sound processing for dolphins. In addition, a dolphin's auditory nerve supply is about three times that of humans \u2014 possibly providing more ultrasonic information to a dolphin's central nervous system for echolocation.\nHearing range.\nBottlenose dolphins hear tones with a frequency up to 160 kHz with the greatest sensitivity ranging from 40 to 100 kHz. The average hearing range for humans is about 0.02 to 20 kHz. In other studies, the hearing range for the bottlenose dolphin has been measured in 75 to 150,000 Hz (0.075 to 150 kHz).\nThe range of hearing of a young, healthy human is 15 to 20,000 Hz (0.015 to 20 kHz). Human speech falls within the frequency band of 100 to 10,000 Hz (0.1 to 10 kHz), with the main, useful voice frequencies within 300 to 3,400 Hz (0.3 to 3.4 kHz). This is well within a dolphin\u2019s range of hearing.\nSound reception.\nA dolphin's small external ear openings don't seem to be important in conducting sound. They lead to reduced ear canals that are not connected to the middle ears.\nSoft tissue and bone conduct sound to a dolphin's middle and inner ears. In particular, fat lobes in a toothed whale's lower jaw appear to be an adaptation for conveying sound to the ears.\nIn dolphins, ears aren't attached to the skull. Ligaments hold each ear in a foam-filled cavity outside the skull. This separation of the ears allows a dolphin to localize sound, which is important for echolocation. Humans and most land mammals cannot effectively localize sounds under water.\nEars, located just behind the eyes, are small inconspicuous openings, with no external pinnae (flaps).\nEyesight\nDolphins have acute vision both in and out of the water. A dolphin's eye is particularly adapted for seeing under water.\nBottlenose dolphins have a double slit pupil allowing for similar visual acuity in air and water. Their eyes are adapted to mitigate varying light intensities. Studies show that the visual acuity of dolphins is similar or below the range of many terrestrial animals. There is currently no reference that measures distance of visual capability.\nIn air, certain features of the lens and cornea correct for the refraction of light caused by the transition from aquatic to aerial vision. Without this adaptation, a dolphin would be nearsighted in air.\nA dolphin's retinas contain both rod cells and cone cells, indicating that they may have the ability to see in both dim and bright light. (Rod cells respond to lower light levels than cone cells.) Researchers theorize that all modern cetaceans, including all toothed whales, lack S-cone cells and therefore aren't able to discriminate color in the blue wavelengths.\nBehavioral studies have suggested they might have some color vision. However, behavioral color vision studies are difficult due to the inability to accurately determine whether the animal is responding to color versus brightness.\nDolphins' eyes have a well-developed tapetum lucidum, a light-reflecting layer that reflects light through the retina a second time, adapting their vision to low-light levels.\nDolphins are primarily monocular (using one eye to process visual stimuli), but also possess the capability for binocular vision (when both eyes are coordinated for vision).\nEvidence suggest that bottlenose dolphins use their right eye predominantly for approaching and investigation when processing visual information.\nTactile\nThe skin of bottlenose dolphins is sensitive to vibrations. Nerve endings are particularly concentrated around the dolphin\u2019s eyes, blowhole, genital area, and rostrum, suggesting that these areas are more sensitive than the rest of the body.\nTaste\nLittle is known about a toothed whale's sense of taste. They do have taste buds at the base of the tongue, although they haven't been well studied.\nOne research study showed that bottlenose dolphins can distinguish chemicals such as citric acid. In zoological parks, whales and dolphins show strong preferences for specific food fishes.\nThree studies indicated that taste buds may be found within 5 to 8 pits at the back of the tongue. One study found them in young dolphins and not adults. Another study could not trace a nerve supply to the taste buds. Regardless, behavioral studies indicate bottlenose dolphins have some type of chemosensory capacity within the mouth.\nBehavioral evidence suggests that bottlenose dolphins can detect 3 or 4 primary tastes (sweet, bitter, sour, salty), but the way they use their ability to \u201ctaste\u201d is still unclear.\nSmell\nOlfactory lobes of the brain and olfactory nerves are absent in all toothed whales, indicating that they may not have a sense of smell."}

Its diet is based on the fish such as herring and capelin.\nWord \"wholphin\" refers to the name of the parents of this animal: wh(ale) + (d)olphin. Despite its name, false killer whale is member of the family of oceanic dolphins, just like the bottlenose dolphin.\nThe first born and the oldest known wholphin is Kekaimalu. This female wholphin was born in 1985 in the Sea Life Park in Hawaii.\nFemale bottlenose dolphin was kept in the same tank with male false killer whale, resulting in the accidental creation of the first wholphin.\nFemale wholphin is fertile and able to produce new generation of wholphins after mating with dolphins. Produced offspring is more dolphin-like (it is 3/4 bottlenose dolphin and 1/4 false killer whale) due to breeding with bottlenose dolphin, but it is still much larger than the bottlenose dolphin.\nWholphin needs to reach mental maturity and develop proper maternal instincts (around the age of 9 years) in order to become successful parent. Researchers believe that the lack of maternal care and nursing can result in the premature death of newly born wholphins, which was probably the case with the first two calves of Kekaimalu.\nBaby wholphin depends on the mother's milk until the age of 9 months. After that period, it starts to consume fish. Young wholphin is weaned at the age of one to two years.\nOnly 2 wholphins currently exist in the captivity: Kekaimalu and her daughter Kawili Kai.\nThese two wholphins can be seen in the Sea Life Park in Hawaii, as a part of regular tour in the park."}

There has been an increase in the number of these dolphins in the past years.\nWhere does an Indus River Dolphin live?\nAn Indus River dolphin is found in a river. It is found in the benthic aquatic biome and is a freshwater river dolphin.\nWhat is an Indus River Dolphin's habitat?\nThe Platanista gangetica minor is found in South Asia. The Indus river dolphin's habitat is mainly in the Indus River in Pakistan. They are mainly concentrated in the South Central part of Pakistan. A few of them are also found in India in the Beas, a tributary of the Indus river.\nWho do Indus River Dolphins live with?\nThe Indus river dolphin may live alone or in pairs. Sometimes, the Platanista minor is also seen in groups of up to 10 individuals.\nHow long does an Indus River Dolphin live?\nThe Indus river dolphin lives for up to 30 years.\nHow do they reproduce?\nThey breed throughout the year. Their gestation period is around 10 months. Females give birth to one calf. They reach sexual maturity when they are about six years old. Sexual maturity occurs at almost the same age for males and females. The calves are nursed for about one year.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nAccording to the IUCN Red List, they are an Endangered species. Clearly, its conservation is crucial. The species is protected throughout its habitat under CITES Appendix II.\nIndus River Dolphin Fun Facts\nWhat do Indus River Dolphins look like?\nDolphins have a grayish rounded body with a small triangular fin at the back. They have a melon-shaped forehead. This is their round forehead that collects sounds from the surrounding environment. Their belly is pale white and they have a long snout and visible teeth. Their beak forms about 20% of the entire body's length. Their eyes are very small and they have external ears. Their neck is very flexible.\nHow cute are they?\nIndus river dolphins are very cute animals!\nHow do they communicate?\nIndus river dolphins produce a sound almost constantly. They use it to navigate, communicate, and forage. When they appear on the surface to breathe, they produce a sneeze-like sound. The communication channel of the animal is mainly acoustic.\nHow big is an Indus River Dolphin?\nRiver dolphins are 7-8.5 ft (2-2.5 m) in length. Females are larger than males.\nHow fast can an Indus River Dolphin swim?\nThese dolphins swim on their sides. This feature helps them to navigate in shallow waters. They are fast swimmers.\nHow much does an Indus River Dolphin weigh?\nRiver dolphins weigh around 155-245 lb (70.3-111.1 kg).\nWhat are their male and female names of the species?\nThere are no separate names for males or females.\nWhat would you call a baby Indus River Dolphin?\nA baby Indus river dolphin is called a calf.\nWhat do they eat?\nThe blind river dolphin feeds on prawns, carp, catfish, mollusks, and other small fish.\nAre they poisonous?\nThe short answer is no, however, as dolphins are at the top of the food chain, they may consume fish and accumulate toxic materials in their body. If consumed, this meat may prove to be poisonous. This problem is a quintessential example of bio-accumulation and has been the result of the decline of the dolphin population in the past few years.\nWould they make a good pet?\nThey have an Endangered status and are found in captivity. They won't be suitable as pets.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nDid you know...\nThe Indus river dolphin, Platanista gangetica minor, is found in Punjab, India. They are slightly different from the Ganges River dolphin. The tail lengths vary between these two subspecies. However, it is the geographical location that helps to differentiate them.\nThey are less athletic than other dolphins.\nThe existence of the dolphin is an indicator of the overall health of the river. If they are thriving well, it indicates that the river water is healthy. This is why these dolphins are so important.\nThe accidental capture of a dolphin is also known as bycatch.\nDolphins are hunted for their meat and oil. The oil is used for medicinal purposes.\nThe internal sonar system of the dolphin is so strong that it can differentiate between a dead and living fish.\nPeople consider the Indus dolphin as a part of their Harrapan heritage. Just like this animal, the gharial was also found in the Indus river. However, it is now locally extinct.\nAre Indus River Dolphins blind?\nYes, this subspecies is blind and depends on echolocation to navigate.\nWhy is the Indus River Dolphin endangered?\nThe Indus river dolphin is thriving better in Pakistan than it is in India. The Ganges river is the lifeline of the people in Northern India. Similarly, the Indus is crucial for the survival of people in Pakistan and India. Life is difficult for the dolphin as humans dominate almost the entire length of these rivers. Humans perceive them as threats as they both hunt for fish. Fishing is very common in these rivers. Sometimes, the species gets caught in fishing nets and fishing gears. Links have been found between over-fishing and this species becoming endangered. Sometimes they get hit by vessels because of this. Pollution along the length of the river is another factor that contributes heavily. They are affected by underwater noise pollution. Chemical pollution of water bodies is a cause of concern. Chemicals often overrun from adjoining irrigation and crop fields into the water bodies. Links have also been found between industrial pollution and the species going endangered. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) is doing considerable work in protecting this endangered species along with the national, state, and local governments. Local communities are being educated and they are helping in the conservation of this endangered species. Pingers are used to keep the dolphins out of fishing nets, these make a noise that is inaudible to humans, however, the dolphins being susceptible to a high range of sound frequencies can hear the sound and avoid the pingers. The Sindh Wildlife Department has started a hotline for the local people and told them to inform in case dolphins get caught in ponds or canals. However, even when they are rescued, the survival rate of the rescued animal back in the river is a matter of concern. Also, these animals tend to get very tense when they come in close contact with humans and it affects their blood pressure levels.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly animal facts for everyone to discover!

They are rarely seen ranging north of 40\u00b0 latitude or south of 35\u00b0 latitude. Rough-toothed Dolphins have also been seen along the Atlantic coast of the United States, in the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, Mediterranean sea, eastern tropical Pacific, and Indian Ocean.\nGeographic distribution of this species in not well known. The genus name \u2018Steno\u2019, of which this species is the only member, comes from the Greek for \u2018narrow\u2019, referring to the species nose \u2013 which is a diagnostic characteristic of the species.\nCharacteristics of the Rough-toothed Dolphin\nThe characteristic feature of the Rough-toothed Dolphin is its conical shaped head and slender nose. The flippers are set back further along the body than other similar dolphins (at sea this dolphin may be confused with the Spinner dolphin, Pantropical Spotted dolphin and Bottlenose Dolphin, all 3 of which are species that have been observed associating with Rough-toothed dolphins). Their dorsal fins are more pronounced.\nRough-toothed Dolphins lips, throat and belly are pinky-white. Their flanks are a light grey and the back and dorsal fin a much darker grey. Rough-toothed Dolphins grow up to about 2.5 metres in length and weigh about 150 kilograms. Rough-toothed dolphins have sharp, serrated teeth.\nRough-toothed Dolphin Behaviour\nThe Rough-toothed dolphin is a gregarious species found in groups of 10 \u2013 30 on average, as well as schools of up to 160 dolphins containing up to 8 smaller subgroups. The Rough-toothed Dolphin has not been observed to bow-ride but does \u2018skim\u2019 \u2013 (swim with their heads and chin above the surface of the water).\nRough-toothed Dolphin Diet\nThe Rough-toothed dolphin feeds on fish and squid as well as mollusks and cephalopods.\nRough-toothed Dolphin Communication\nLike other dolphins, rough-toothed dolphins communicate with body language and echolocate using clicks and whistles.\nRough-toothed Dolphin Reproduction\nLittle is known about the reproductive habits of this species. A rough-toothed dolphin was bred with a Bottlenose dolphin in captivity producing a hybrid offspring. What is known is that female rough-toothed dolphins reach sexual maturity at about 10 years, males at 14 years.\nRough-toothed Dolphin Predators\nSome sharks (including tiger sharks, dusky sharks, and bull sharks) and orcas will prey upon dolphins. Dolphins are also often trapped in fishing nets.\nRough-toothed Dolphin Conservation\nRough-toothed dolphins are classified as Data Deficient by the 2000 IUCN Red List.\nRough-toothed Dolphin and Humans\nRough-toothed dolphins are hunted for food in some regions. They are harpooned in Japan and West Africa. Entanglement in fishing gear poses a threat, and Rough-toothed dolphins have been reported caught in purse seines in the eastern tropical Pacific. Others have been reported caught in gill net and drift net fisheries in Sri Lanka and Brazil."}

Distribution is generally limited to surface water temperatures of 10\u00b0 to 32\u00b0C (50\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 F).\nIn the Pacific Ocean, bottlenose dolphins are found from northern Japan to Australia and from Southern California to Chile. They are also found offshore in the eastern tropical Pacific as far west as the Hawaiian Islands. Off the California coast bottlenose dolphins have been observed as far north as Monterey, particularly during years of unusual warmth.\nIn the Atlantic Ocean, bottlenose dolphins are found from Nova Scotia to Patagonia and from Norway to the tip of South Africa. They are the most abundant dolphin species along the United States' coast from Cape Cod through the Gulf of Mexico.\nBottlenose dolphins are also found in the Mediterranean and Black Seas.\nIndo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins are found in the Indian Ocean from Indonesia to Australia to South Africa, the Red Sea, and in the tropical and subtropical waters of the western Pacific.\nKnown range of bottlenose dolphins are indicated in dark blue.\nHabitat\nBottlenose dolphins inhabit warm temperate waters, adapting to several marine and estuarine habitats, including, occasionally, rivers. Habitat use is influenced by environmental heterogeneity; meaning these animals distribute through an ecosystem depending on factors like resources, depth, water temperature, sea-bed gradient and type of sediment.\nScientists theorize that differing ecological characteristics throughout their range have led to differences between bottlenose dolphin populations. Because bottlenose dolphin populations have inshore and offshore distributions, scientists identify two ecotypes with anatomical, physiological, behavioral, ecological and genetic differences. For example, bottlenose dolphins in Scotland favor deeper areas than those from Florida, U.S., that prefer shallow waters of less than 3 m (9.8 ft.) depth.\nCoastal dolphins generally form smaller cohesive groups (<20) than the offshore (>100).\nInshore bottlenose dolphins are typically seen in bays, tidal creeks, inlets, marshes, rivers, and waters along the open ocean beach, often at depths of 3 m (9.8 ft.) or less. Some inshore ecotypes seem to be adapted for warm, shallow waters. Its smaller body and larger flippers suggest increased maneuverability and heat dissipation.\nThe distribution/migration of prey correlated with seasonal changes in water temperature may account for the seasonal movements of some dolphins. Inshore bottlenose dolphins found in warmer waters show less extensive localized, seasonal movements and many have been observed staying within a limited, long-term home range, such as in Sarasota Bay, Florida. Adult males range more widely than females, often encompassing the ranges of several female bands. Dolphin communities may overlap providing for genetic exchange. These neighboring communities may be distinct in both behavior and genetics.\nIn the Northwest Atlantic, researchers determined that bottlenose dolphins within 7.5 km (4.65 mi.) from shore were coastal ecotypes. Dolphins beyond 34 km (21mi.) from shore were offshore ecotypes. They also observed that the two ecotypes overlap between those boundaries, and concluded that further habitat-use analysis must be done to explain that situation.\nIn the Gulf of California, coastal and offshore ecotypes differ in color, morphology, and group size. The coastal form is bigger, more robust, and with a lighter dorsal color than the offshore type. Its rostrum and pectoral flippers are shorter and groups are formed by <20 individuals. In this study, it was also seen that offshore bottlenose dolphins associate with sperm whales and have a similar trophic position with them (specifically females and juveniles). Dolphins benefit from this interaction by feeding on similar prey.\nMigration\nVariations in water temperature, movements of food fish, and feeding habits may account for the seasonal movements of some dolphins to and from certain areas.\nSome coastal dolphins in higher latitudes show a clear tendency toward seasonal migrations, traveling farther south in the winter. For example, coastal bottlenose dolphins on the Atlantic side of the U.S. migrate seasonally between New Jersey and North Carolina.\nCoastal dolphins in warmer waters show less extensive, localized seasonal movements.\nSome coastal animals stay within a limited home range: an area in which individuals or groups regularly move about during day-to-day activities.\nIndividual dolphins that live within a home range are called \"local residents\". Resident dolphins have been identified along the coasts of Georgia, Florida, Texas, southern California, Gulf of California, and South Africa.\nGroups of dolphins that reside within a home range make up \"resident communities\". The Sarasota, Florida resident dolphin community home range is an area of about 125 km 2 (48.3 mi 2 ). Home ranges may overlap.\nPopulation\nBottlenose dolphins are not endangered or threatened.\nThe worldwide population of common bottlenose dolphins is about 600,000.\nIndo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins are abundant, but the overall population is unknown.\nChromosome banding techniques have proven useful in bottlenose dolphin population studies. In some areas, scientists can identify individuals and determine relationships among dolphins in a group."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Facts about orcas (killer whales) - Whale & Dolphin Conservation USA", "url": "https://us.whales.org/whales-dolphins/facts-about-orcas/", "text": "Why are orcas called 'killer whales' when they are dolphins?\nDolphins and whales are closely related. Orcas were given the name \u2018killer whale\u2019 by ancient sailors\u2019 observations of groups of orcas hunting and preying on larger whale species. They called orcas asesina ballenas, or \u2018whale killer\u2019 \u2013 a term that was eventually flipped around to the easier \u2018killer whale\u2019. Their Latin name, Orcinus orca, also reflects this observation of orcas feeding on large whales. Orcinus translates to \u2018of the kingdom of the dead,\u2019 and orca refers to a kind of whale. We know that orcas are top predators, yes, but not the vicious \u2018whale killers\u2019 that the ancient mariners thought them to be. If you could give orcas another name, what would you call them?\nWhat do orcas eat?\nLooking at all populations, orcas are generalist eaters, consuming fish, seals and sea lions, dolphins and porpoises, sharks and rays, large whales, cephalopods (octopods and squids), seabirds and more. However, some orcas specialise on specific prey, and it turns out orcas are picky eaters! Once they\u2019ve learned what their family eats, they aren\u2019t likely to switch diets.\nHow do orcas sleep?\nOrcas sleep in a very different way to humans. We have a breathing reflex and when we sleep or become unconscious, we continue to breath automatically. Orcas cannot sleep in this way, they have to remain conscious, even when they are sleeping! This is because their breathing is not automatic - they have to actively decide when to breath, and so they must be conscious even when sleeping. If like us, orcas went into a deep unconscious sleep, they would stop breathing and suffocate or drown.\nTo get around this, orcas only allow one half of their brains to sleep at a time; the other half stays alert enabling them to continue breathing whilst looking out for dangers in the environment. They only close one eye when they sleep; the left eye will be closed when the right half of the brain sleeps, and vice versa. This type of sleep is known as unihemispheric sleep as only one brain hemisphere sleeps at a time. Orcas periodically alternate which side is sleeping so that they can get the rest they need without ever losing consciousness. When sleeping, orcas swim very slowly and steadily, close to the surface.\nHow do orcas communicate?\nIn orca populations, knowledge is passed down to younger individuals from their elders \u2013 what to eat and were to find it, how to catch it, who to avoid, vocalisations and calls unique to pods and family groups, and the distinct \u2018accent\u2019 of the population. Having multiple prey items to choose from probably led to the niche specialisations we see today \u2013 millions of year ago, different groups started eating different things to avoid competing for the same food. Now these groups are genetically different, in addition to their unique appearance and cultures."}

They are the most common type of dolphin, found everywhere except the Arctic and Antarctic. The bottlenose's so-called \"nose\" is actually the blowhole on the top of its head.\nThere are at least three species of bottlenose dolphins: the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), the Burrunan dolphin (Tursiops australis), and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus). These playful mammals have the largest brain mass per body size of any animal except humans. They display high intelligence and emotional intelligence.\nFast Facts: Bottlenose Dolphin Scientific Name : Tursiops sp.\n: Tursiops sp.

The dolphin's skin is dark gray on its back and pale gray on its flanks. Visually, the species is distinguishable from other dolphins by its elongated rostrum.\nA dolphin's flukes (tail) and dorsal fin consists of connective tissue, lacking muscle or bone. The pectoral fins contain bones and muscle and are analogous to human arms. Bottlenose dolphins living in colder, deeper waters tend to have more fat and blood than those living in shallow water. The dolphin's streamlined body helps it swim very quickly \u2014 over 30 km/hr.\nSenses and Intelligence\nDolphins have sharp eyesight, with horseshoe-shaped double-slit pupils and a tapetum lucidum to aid vision in dim light. The bottlenose has a poor sense of smell, since its blowhole only opens for breathing air. Dolphins seek food by emitting clicking sounds and mapping their environment using echolocation. They lack vocal cords, but communicate via body language and whistles.\nBottlenose dolphins are extremely intelligent. While no dolphin language has been found, they can comprehend artificial language, including sign language and human speech. They display mirror self-recognition, memory, understanding of numbers, and tool use. They exhibit high emotional intelligence, including altruistic behavior. Dolphins form complex social relationships.\nDistribution\nBottlenose dolphins live warm and temperate oceans. They are found everywhere except near the Arctic and Antarctic Circles. However, the dolphins living along shallow coastal waters are genetically distinct from those living in deeper water.\nBottlenose dolphin range. maplab\nDiet and Hunting\nDolphins are carnivorous. The feed mainly on fish, but also hunt shrimp, cuttlefish, and mollusks. Groups of bottlenose dolphins adopt different hunting strategies. Sometimes they hunt as a pod, herding fish together. Other times, a dolphin may hunt alone, usually seeking bottom-dwelling species. Dolphins may follow fishermen for food or work cooperatively with other species to catch prey. A group offshore from Georgia and South Carolina uses a strategy called \"strand feeding.\" In strand feeding, the pod swims around a school of fish to trap prey in the current. Next, dolphins charge toward the fish, pushing themselves and the school onto a mud flat. The dolphins crawl around on land to collect their prize.\nPredators\nBottlenose dolphins are preyed upon by large sharks, such as the tiger shark, bull shark, and great white. In rare cases, killer whales eat dolphins, although the two species swim together in other regions. Dolphins protect themselves by swimming in a pod, evading attackers, or mobbing predators to kill them or chase them away. Sometimes dolphins protect members of other species from predators and other dangers.\nReproduction\nBoth male and female dolphins have genital slits that conceal their reproductive organs to make their bodies more hydrodynamic. Males compete with each other to mate with females during the breeding season. Breeding occurs at different times, depending on geographic location.\nGestation requires about 12 months. Usually, a single calf is born, although sometimes the mother bears twins. The calf stays with its mother and nurses for between 18 months and 8 years. Males mature between ages 5 and 13. Females become mature between the ages of 9 and 14 and reproduce every 2 to 6 years. In the wild, bottlenose dolphin life expectancy ranges from 40 to 50 years. Females typically live 5 to 10 years longer than males. About 2% of dolphins live to 60 years of age. Bottlenose dolphins hybridize with other dolphin species, both in captivity and in the wild.\nBottlenose Dolphins and Humans\nDolphins display curiosity about humans and have been known to rescue people. They can be trained for entertainment, to aid fishermen, and to help find sea mines.\nInteractions between humans and bottlenose dolphins are usually friendly. George Karbus Photography / Getty Images\nHowever, human-dolphin interactions are often harmful to dolphins. Some people hunt dolphins, while many die as bycatch. Dolphins are frequently injured by boats, suffer from noise pollution, and are adversely affected by chemical pollution. While dolphins are often friendly toward people, there are cases of dolphins injuring or killing swimmers.\nConservation Status\nSome local populations are threatened by water pollution, fishing, harassment, injury, and food shortages. However, the common bottlenose dolphin is listed as being of \"least concern\" on the IUCN Red List. Dolphins and whales enjoy some level of protection in most parts of the world. In the United States, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) prohibits hunting and harassing of dolphins and whales, except in special circumstances.\nSources\nConnor, Richards (2000).

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Bottlenose Dolphin Facts: Animals of North America - WorldAtlas", "url": "https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/bottlenose-dolphin-facts-animals-of-north-america.html", "text": "5. Physical Description\nBottlenose dolphins are a species of marine mammals that belong, alongside whales and porpoises, to the Cetacean Order, whose closest terrestrial relatives on land include Hippopotamuses. Adults range from roughly 6.5 to 13 feet in length and from 330 to nearly 1500 pounds in weight. The top halves of their bodies are grey, while the bottoms are closer to white, a color combination which effectively camouflages them from both above and below while swimming. As their names suggest, bottlenose dolphins have narrow, bottle-shaped snouts, which help to streamline their sleek, powerful bodies, and subsequently place them among the ocean\u2019s most efficient swimmers. These snouts are filled with 18-28 conical teeth, which they use in hunting and feeding.\n4. Diet\nThe Bottlenose dolphins' diets' are composed primarily of fish species, such as mullet, tuna, and mackerel. They\u2019ve also been known to eat species of bottom feeders, as well as a variety of crustaceans and squid. Though dolphins occasionally hunt alone, they more commonly hunt in groups, relying on teamwork to herd schools of fish towards shores and maximize their kills. They make these kills with their sharp teeth and, at times, through a practice aptly nicknamed \u201cfish whacking,\u201d wherein they will stun their prey with their snouts, sometimes even knocking them out of the water. Dolphins have also been known to follow fishing boats, at times even stealing fish from their nets.\n3. Habitat and Range\nThe bottlenose dolphin is an extremely adaptive animal, which allows its range to be quite broad. Present throughout the majority of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans and their adjoining seas, these dolphins can be found both close along shorelines and far out at sea. And while they can thrive in a variety of environments, their size does tend to vary depending on their habitat, which is more affected by water temperature. Dolphins in warmer, shallower waters are generally smaller, while those in cooler, pelagic regions are typically larger. At the moment, bottlenose dolphins are not endangered, though they are, like many marine species, affected by habitat loss, pollution, and fishing. Smaller dolphins are also preyed on by a variety of shark species, such as bull, tiger, and great white sharks.\n2. Behavior\nBottlenose dolphins are extremely social animals, and as such can generally be found living in groups called 'pods'. These pods can range from 2 or 3 dolphins to, in rarer instances, in excess of 1,000 members. Within these groups, Bottlenose dolphins communicate with 'echolocation', a form of sonar wherein the dolphin detects objects by producing a range of squeaks and clicks, and listening for the resulting echoes. Dolphins are known for their playful nature, and can often be seen frolicking and leaping out of the water. That said, males are known to become very aggressive with each other during mating season, and the species has also been known to attack marauding sharks.\n1. Reproduction\nAs mammals, bottlenose dolphins bear live young, rather than laying eggs like fish, reptiles, and birds. During the species\u2019 breeding season, the males will compete for female mates, often fighting one another, and at times even working in pairs to isolate and protect a single female. Once mating has successfully occurred, a female will gestate for an average of 12 months. The resulting young, generally being just a single calf, will then be birthed in warmer, shallow waters. They will then suckle for anywhere from 18 months to as long as 8 years, and will often maintain a close relationship with their mothers well after weaning."}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Facts About Hector's and Maui's Dolphins: Animals of Concern", "url": "https://owlcation.com/stem/Two-Endangered-Dolphins-of-New-Zealand-Facts-and-Protection", "text": "Linda Crampton is a writer and former science teacher with an honors degree in biology. She enjoys writing about science and nature.\nUnique Dolphins in New Zealand\nThe Hector\u2019s dolphin and the Maui\u2019s dolphin are found only off the coast of New Zealand. The population of Hector\u2019s dolphins is estimated to be around 15,000 individuals. The animals are classified as \"nationally vulnerable.\" The critically endangered Maui\u2019s dolphin is thought to have a population of around 54 animals older than a year. The pressure to protect and conserve these marine mammals is becoming intense, especially in the case of the Maui\u2019s dolphin. Its population may require an emergency intervention in order for the animal to survive.\nThe two animals are subspecies of the same species. They are relatively small members of the order Cetacea, which includes whales, dolphins, and porpoises. The animals look quite similar, but there are significant differences between them. They are light grey and have black and white markings. The animals have a uniquely-shaped dorsal fin along their backs. The fin is rounded instead of being sickle-shaped as in other dolphins. It's often said to look like one of Micky Mouse's ears.\nNew Zealand consists of two sections\u2014the North Island and the South Island. Dolphins can be found by both islands.\nBiological Classification of the Animals\nHector's and Maui's dolphins are classified in the same genus and species (the first two parts of a scientific name). Scientists have decided that the genetics and skeleton of Maui\u2019s dolphins are sufficiently different from those of Hector\u2019s dolphins to warrant placing the animals in different subspecies.\nThe scientific name of the Hector's dolphin is Cephalorhynchus hectori hectori while the Maui's dolphin is classified as Cephalorhynchus hectori maui. The first subspecies is found in three separate areas around the South Island of New Zealand. The second lives on the west side of the North Island. The dolphins that are seen in this location are sometimes referred to as Maui or M\u0101ui dolphins or as North Island ones.\nPhysical Features of a Hector's Dolphin\nThe Hector's dolphin is named after Sir James Hector (1834\u20131907). Hector qualified as a surgeon but worked mainly as a geologist. He was the first director of the Geological Survey of New Zealand as well as the first director of the Colonial Museum. This museum is now known as the Museum of New Zealand, or Te Papa Tongarewa.\nHector's dolphins are one of the smallest marine dolphins in the world and reach a maximum length of about 1.5 meters (4.9 feet). They weigh between 40 and 60 kilograms (88 to 132 pounds). They are attractive animals.\nThe animals\u2019 bodies are generally light grey in color but also have black and white areas. Their flippers, dorsal fin, and tail flukes are black, and their face has a black mask. The dorsal flipper is rounded. The pectoral fins are sometimes described as \u201cpaddle-like.\u201d The lower surface of the animals is white. A white stripe extends upwards from the lower surface to each side of the body.\nUnlike the familiar bottlenose dolphins that are sometimes kept in captivity, Hector's dolphins lack a \"beak.\" The beak is a projection formed by the extension of the jaws beyond the rounded upper head.\nThe video below was made in 2016 and refers to a previous estimate of the Hector's dolphin population size.\nDaily Life of the Cetacean\nHector's dolphins live mostly in shallow water less than 100 meters deep and are found close to the shore. New research suggests that more of the animals live further away from the shore than was previously realized, however. The animals live in groups called pods, which consist of two to twelve animals. Pods sometimes join to form larger groups.\nThe dolphins feed mainly on fish and squid, which they catch in dives lasting about ninety seconds. Food is caught on the ocean floor, in the water, or at the surface of the water. Like all mammals, the dolphins breathe air and must periodically surface to obtain oxygen.\nHector's and Maui's dolphins find their prey by echolocation. During this process, a dolphin emits very high frequency sounds, also known as ultrasonic sounds. The sound waves bounce off solid objects and return to the animal, enabling it to judge the size, shape, distance, and direction of the objects. The dolphins also produce audible clicks and whistles as they communicate with each other.\nHector's and Maui's dolphins are active, curious, and confident animals. Maui's dolphins have been observed playing with seaweed, blowing bubbles, chasing each other, jumping out of the water, and fighting. Both animals like to swim close to boats. Some Hector's dolphins will swim next to humans in the water.\nReproduction and Lifespan\nHector's and Maui's dolphins are slow breeders. The females don't reproduce until they are about 7 to 9 years of age. They have only one calf (the name for a dolphin baby) every 2 to 4 years. The gestation period is about ten to eleven months. The calf stays with its mother for as long as two years.\nThe latest research suggests that Hector's dolphins live for around twenty years, so a female may have a maximum of four calves in her lifetime. This slow rate of reproduction means that the death of a few animals could have a serious effect on the population. The New Zealand Department of Conservation (a government organization) says that twenty years is a short lifespan compared to that of other dolphins.\nFacts About Maui's Dolphins\nUntil relatively recently, Hector's dolphins in New Zealand were classified into four groups, including the three groups around the South Island and the group beside the North Island. In 2002, research carried out by Dr. Alan Baker determined that the North Island dolphins were genetically distinct from the South Island ones. The North Island animals were placed in a different subspecies and given the name Maui's dolphins, while all the dolphins around the South Island continued to be known as Hector's dolphins.\nThe Maui's dolphin is the most endangered marine dolphin in the world. It isn't the most endangered cetacean, however. Only ten to fifteen vaquitas exist. This species is on the edge of extinction. The vaquita is classified as a porpoise, not a dolphin.\nThe Maui's dolphin looks very similar to the Hector's dolphin. It has a bigger skull and a slightly longer snout, however. It also has differences in its DNA, the molecule that contains its genes. If the animal becomes extinct, some of the genetic diversity of its species will disappear. The video below shows the animal as it swims.\nA recent population estimate showed that there are only about 54 individuals over the age of 1 year remaining. There is 95% certainty that this number is between 48 and 64. \u2014 Department of Conservation, New Zealand, with respect to the Maui's dolphin\nNumber of Individuals in the Two Subspecies\nIn the first edition of this article, the Maui's dolphin population was estimated to be approximately 63 animals over the age of one. This is now considered to be very close to the upper limit of the population size. As the quote above says, the New Zealand's Department of Conservation suspects that only around 54 adults exist. The number of calves is unknown. The estimated population of the Maui's dolphin is so small that the loss of even one animal would be a serious event for the subspecies.\nIt's thought that close to 30,000 Hector's dolphins lived around New Zealand in the 1970s. This number is greatly reduced today. The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) says that around 7,381 mature animals exist and classifies the Hector's dolphin population as endangered. This status is based on a 2008 population assessment, however. Thankfully, according the the Department of Conservation and its more recent data, the population is approximately double that of the IUCN's claim, so the situation doesn't seem to be quite so serious today.\nThough the dolphin's status is better than it was and its population has appeared to stabilize, the animals still need some help, as the zoologists in the video below mention. The video was posted on the last day of 2018. Some otherwise useful sources of information, including the maker of the video, still refer to the IUCN's earlier assessment of the animal's status as \"endangered.\" The IUCN is a respected organization. I wish it would update the dolphin's status and if necessary say why it disagrees with other assessments.\nThere is no disagreement about the plight of the Maui's dolphin. The animal's population is classified as critically endangered by all of the sources that I've seen., including the New Zealand Department of Conservation. \"Critically\" endangered means that the animals are in serious danger of extinction.\nThreats: fishing, disease, oil and gas exploration, boat strike, mining, tourism, noise \u2014 Department of Conservation, New Zealand, with respect to Cephalorhynchus hectori\nPopulation Threats\nThe biggest threat to both dolphins is fishing by set (gill) nets and trawling nets. The animals seem to have difficulty detecting gill nets, which generally have a fine mesh. It's possible that the mammals can detect the nets but find the source of trapped fish worth any risk in approaching them. Another contribution to the problem might be that they use echolocation only some of the time while they're swimming. The Department of Conservation says this is a possibility with respect to Maui's dolphins.\nMaui's dolphins live closer to shore than Hector's dolphins, making them more susceptible to danger from fishing nets. The animals become entangled in the mesh of the nets. This stops them from reaching the surface to breathe and causes them to drown.\nSome dolphins are struck by boats. Youngsters are particularly susceptible to being damaged by boat propellers because they swim more slowly than adults and also tend to swim closer to the surface of the water. Pollution and coastal developments hurt the dolphins' population as well.\nAnother potential danger for Maui's dolphins is seabed mining in the area where they live. A marine mammal sanctuary has been established in the area, however. Seabed mining is prohibited close to shore within the sanctuary. Set nets and trawling nets are also prohibited close to shore.\nSome people might think that losing the Maui's dolphin would be sad but not tragic because the similar South Island dolphins still exist. Even if people support this idea, the situation is still serious because the South Island subspecies is also a concern with respect to its population size.\nConservation of the Animals\nThe restrictions that have been put in place to protect the Maui's dolphin sound like a good beginning. Some conservationists who are familiar with the area where the dolphin lives are unhappy, however. They say that the protection measures don't cover enough of the animal's habitat. The conservationists are pressing for new fishing regulations. The fishing industry says that the livelihood of their workers is threatened by the proposed regulations because the rules would reduce their catch.\nThe debates and disagreements are taking up valuable time that is needed to prevent the extinction of the Maui's dolphin and allow its population to increase. I think that protecting both of the subspecies of Cephalorhynchus hectori is important. I hope a compromise is reached that is acceptable for conservationists and the fishing industry and that a suitable plan is put into action soon.\nReferences\nInformation about Hector's dolphins from the Department of Conservation, Government of New Zealand (The article contains links to other government sources of information about the animal.)\nThe Hector's dolphin entry on the Red List of the IUCN\nMaui dolphin information from the Department of Conservation\nThe Maui's dolphin entry on the IUCN\u2019s Red List\nSpecies directory entry for Cephalorhynchus hectori from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)\nThis content is accurate and true to the best of the author\u2019s knowledge and is not meant to substitute for formal and individualized advice from a qualified professional.\n\u00a9 2012 Linda Crampton\nLinda Crampton (author) from British Columbia, Canada on August 02, 2014:\nI agree, ologsinquito.

Also, dolphins are different than \"dolphinfish,\" which are also known as mahi-mahi.\nLike every mammal, dolphins are warm blooded. Unlike fish, who breathe through gills, dolphins breathe air using lungs. Dolphins must make frequent trips to the surface of the water to catch a breath. The blowhole on top of a dolphin's head acts as a \"nose,\" making it easy for the dolphin to surface for air.\nOther characteristics of dolphins that make them mammals rather than fish are that they give birth to live young rather than laying eggs and they feed their young with milk. Also, like all mammals, dolphins even have a tiny amount of hair, right around the blowhole.\nWhales and porpoises are also mammals. There are 75 species of dolphins, whales, and porpoises living in the ocean. They are the only mammals, other than manatees, that spend their entire lives in the water.\nAn area of Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary is home to a resident group of bottlenose dolphins. Many businesses conduct dolphin tours in this area, which can stress the dolphins. To help reduce disruption to dolphins in the sanctuary, the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, National Marine Fisheries Service, the Dolphin Ecology Project, and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society created the Dolphin SMART program. This program recognizes businesses that promote responsible viewing of wild dolphins.\nMore Animal Facts"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphin Intelligence: How Smart Are Dolphins? - Vallarta Adventures", "url": "https://www.vallarta-adventures.com/en/blog/how-smart-are-dolphins", "text": "How smart are dolphins?\nDolphins are capable of complex problem solving and social interaction. They are one of the smartest animals in the world. Research into the behavior of dolphins in the wild and in captivity has yielded incredible data on the intelligence of these marine mammals. Studies show that dolphins not only have the ability to learn as individuals, but those individuals can then pass their new knowledge onto others.\nAmong the many animals in the world, there are few smarter than dolphins. These amazing marine mammals are capable of impressive problem-solving, social interactions, and using what appears to be a complex communication system. In this guide, we dive deep into the topic of dolphin intelligence, discussing dolphin behavior and anatomy in attempt to answer the question: how smart are dolphins. At guide's end, we also provide you with resources and helpful links to our very own dolphin tours here at Vallarta Adventures. Learn more below, and book with us today!\nThese studies include tests with Kelly the dolphin, who was given a test in which she was rewarded with a fish for every piece of litter she brought to researchers. She quickly learned to take single piece of paper, keep it under rock, and tear off smaller pieces to get more fish. Then there was Billie the dolphin, who was trapped in a sealock and rescued. Billie spent three weeks in rehabilitation and was released back into the wild. There, researchers noticed that Billie had started tail-walking, a skill only taught to captive, trained dolphins. Billie had not been trained to tail-walk but had learned the skill simply by observing other dolphins in her rehab center. Billie was also able to teach wild dolphins in her community the skill.\nStudies also show dolphins in the wild learning to use tools and passing that knowledge down to further generations. One notable example is that adult dolphins will often attach sponges to their snouts to protect themselves while foraging for food. This skill is passed down from mothers to offspring.\nAre dolphins smarter than humans?\nCurrent tests for intelligence indicate that dolphins do not possess the same cognitive abilities as humans and are thus not the \"smarter\" species.\nLike humans, dolphins possess the ability to beneficially alter their surroundings, solve problems, and form complex social groups. However, dolphins do not display indicators of tool usage, problem solving, and structured discussion to the degree that humans do.\nWhy are dolphins so smart?\nDolphins live in complex social groups and have evolved to have highly-developed brains. These factors are the largest contributors to their intelligence.\nDolphins have relatively large and complex brains that developed over thousands of generations. Presumably, dolphin brains evolved to meet the needs of their environment. Intelligence and highly-involved social interaction became the means of survival for dolphins, and their brains adapted accordingly.\nHow big is a dolphin brain?\nRelative to body size, dolphin brains among the largest in the animal kingdom \u2014larger than even those of chimpanzees.\nDolphin brains typically weigh about 1600 grams. This makes dolphins second only to humans in brain-to-body weight ratio. However, dolphin brains are quite different from the brains of humans and great apes. Dolphins have much smaller frontal lobes \u2014 but they still have an impressive flair for solving problems and a built-in capacity to plan for the future. Unlike primates, dolphins process language and auditory information in the temporal lobes, located on their brain\u2019s flanks. Studies also show that dolphins process auditory and visual information in different parts of the neocortex. Dolphins also have an extremely well-developed and defined paralimbic system, which is responsible for processing emotions. Many scientists hypothesize that dolphins' highly-developed paralimbic systems play a large role in the intimate and complex social and emotional bonds that exist within dolphin communities.\nAre dolphins the smartest animals?\nBased on current metrics for intelligence, dolphins are one of the most intelligent animals in the world.\nWhile intelligence is difficult to quantify in any organism, many studies suggest that dolphins are second only to us humans in smarts. Using brain size as a barometer, dolphins come in second only to humans in brain-to-body size ratio. However, dolphins also excel intelligence-based tests. Research shows that dolphins mirror self-recognition, cultural learning, comprehension of symbol-based communication systems, and an understanding of abstract concepts \u2014 comparable to chimpanzees and other great apes.\nSee Dolphins \u2014 The Ocean's Smartest Animals \u2014 With Vallarta Adventures\nWant to experience the intelligence and incredible elegance of dolphins up close and personal?

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "All About Bottlenose Dolphins - Diet & Eating Habits - SeaWorld", "url": "https://seaworld.org/animals/all-about/bottlenose-dolphin/diet/", "text": "Food Preferences & Resources\nDolphins are active predators and eat a wide variety of fishes, squids, and crustaceans such as shrimps. The foods available to a dolphin vary with its geographic location.\nDolphins show strong preferences for certain species of food fish.\nCoastal dolphins tend to eat fishes and bottom-dwelling invertebrates.\nOffshore dolphins tend to eat fishes and squid.\nSome offshore dolphins were found with deep-sea fishes in their stomachs. This evidence suggests that offshore dolphins may dive to more than 500 m (1,600 ft.).\nFood Intake\nAdult bottlenose dolphins eat approximately 4% to 6% of their body weight in food per day. A nursing mother's daily intake is considerably higher \u2014 about 8%.\nA dolphin's stomach is compartmentalized for rapid digestion.\nMethods of Collecting and Eating Food\nFeeding behavior is flexible and adapted to a dolphin's particular habitat and available food resources.\nHunting strategies are varied and diverse.\nBottlenose dolphins often cooperate when hunting and catching fish.\nIn open waters, a dolphin group sometimes encircles a large school of fish and herds the fish into a small, dense mass. The dolphins take turns charging through the school to feed. Near the surface of the ocean, dolphins at Sarasota Bay, Florida, may roll to their sides with one pectoral flipper raised high. The dolphins encircle a school of fish, splashing their tail flukes and forcing them to bunch in a tighter and tighter group until the dolphins turn to grab a quick meal on the go. This hunting technique is referred to as \"pinwheeling\". \"Drivers and blockers\" is a rare example of an animal hunting technique that demonstrates a clear division of labor. While hunting fish, some of these highly specialized groups are \"divers\" who smack the water's surface with their tail flukes to herd fish into a circle. Others stay less than a body length apart from each other to block and prevent fish from escaping. This technique has been documented in bottlenose dolphins off the waters of Cedar Key, Florida. Occasionally dolphins herd schools of fish against sand bars, shorelines, or mud banks to trap them in shallow water where the fish are easy prey. This hunting technique is referred to as \u201cstrand feeding\u201d.\nDolphins also feed on individual, nonschooling fishes.\nA bottlenose dolphin may use its tail flukes to flip a fish out of the water, and then retrieve the stunned prey.\nDuring the hunting technique known as \"crater feeding,\" bottlenose dolphins dive snout-first into the sandy bottom trying to grab an unsuspecting fish. This technique got its name because of the craters the dolphins left behind in the sand.\nSome coastal bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Western Australia seem to use a certain species of sponge (Echinodictyum mesenterium) as a shield when foraging in areas with rocky or sandy bottoms. Researchers have observed a small number of females carrying the sponges on their beaks, diving down, and then dropping the sponge just prior to surfacing and swallowing prey. Researchers theorize that the sponge acts as a shield to protect the dolphin's beak (rostrum) from spines of certain fishes or stingrays, or from sharp shells or rocks when the dolphin digs into sandy-bottomed habitats in search of prey. This sponge-carrying tool-use behavior has only been seen in several female dolphins and some of their female offspring at Shark Bay.\nIn a behavior termed \"kerplunking,\" bottlenose dolphins foraging in shallow sea grass beds in Australia and Florida, slap the water's surface with their lower body and flukes creating a splash of bubbles to startle fishes out of hiding and make them easier to catch.\nOnce mullets enter shallow water off the west coast of Florida, dolphins swim around them while hitting the ocean floor with their tail flukes. This creates a ring of mud which surrounds the fish. In a panic the fish leap up into the air...and into the mouths of the dolphins.\nBottlenose dolphins often feed in association with fishing operations. Dolphins may accompany shrimp trawls or other fishing vessels and feed on discarded fishes caught incidentally in the nets.\nDolphins do not chew their food. Before eating large fishes, bottlenose dolphins shake them or rub them on the ocean floor until suitable-size pieces break off. They also strip meat from spiny fishes, reducing the chance of injury from sharp spines."}

With their expression that makes them look like they are always smiling, dolphins are a symbol of joy and freedom. Dolphins inspire pure and positive things - who doesn't remember Flipper? Dolphins are a very wide group of species. In fact, there are 40 species of dolphins navigating the earth's oceans and rivers. Some people think of them as sea dogs, because they are very friendly and interact well with humans. However, that is just the tip of the iceberg: our favorite marine animals are very interesting and complex creatures. There are so many things you might not know about them! This AnimalWised article will reveal 10 fun facts about dolphins that will surprise you.\nThe mysterious world of dolphins\nStarting the list of 10 fun facts about dolphins is a really amazing fact that you might not know: Dolphins are very close relatives of whales, including orcas. In fact, all these animals are cetaceans, a clade of carnivorous marine mammals that includes porpoises and baleen whales.\nDolphins have big families\nDolphins are very social with their own species and love to hunt, play and swim together. Large groups of dolphins may include some 1000 individuals. Imagine being on a boat and witnessing that many dolphins at the same time. Quite a show! Although the above figure may be high and lead us to think that there is a large number of dolphins, the fact is that some dolphin species are in serious danger of extinction, including the Amazon or pink river dolphin. Take a look at our article on the different types of river dolphins around the world to discover them.\nThe bottlenose dolphin, a true master\nThe two bottlenose dolphin species (Tursiops) are true jacks of all trades. In order to hunt and dig into the seabed and among the rocks they don't use their mouth or nose. Instead, to avoid injury, they use the materials they encounter while swimming.\nDolphins are extraordinarily clever\nAnother noteworthy fact about dolphins is that they are said to be even more intelligent and evolved than monkeys. Their brain is remarkably similar to the brain of a human being.\nWhat are mother dolphins like?\nDepending on the species, the gestation of a dolphin can last up to 17 months. Dolphin mothers are often very affectionate, expressive and protective, and they don't separate themselves from their young.\nDolphins' sense of hearing is extremely good\nWith regard to the senses, dolphins can see almost perfectly both in and out of the water. Their touch is very sensitive, and although they have no sense of smell, their ears completely makes up for this. These seafarers can hear frequencies 10 times above the human limit.\nThe origin of dolphins\nDolphins have come a long way to get where they are today. They are descendants of terrestrial mammals who returned to the waters about 50 million years ago. The interesting thing is that the other animals that descended from the same land mammals evolved differently, resulting in even-toed ungulates such as hippos, giraffes and pigs. All animals end up being relatives.\nDolphins are aware of death\nDolphins feel and suffer in a way very similar to human beings. They feel pain and may suffer from stress. It has been discovered that dolphins are aware of their own mortality; in extremely stressful circumstances, some dolphins have chosen to let themselves die by stopping their breathing voluntarily, which is something cetaceans can do. This is one of the most shocking facts about dolphins; together with humans, they are the only animals known to commit suicide. Of course, their awareness of the future and the complexity of their emotions are still being researched.\nDolphins can communicate\nIn order to communicate, dolphins use a sensitive and highly developed method called \"echolocation\". This method works for navigating long distances for a long time, sending signals to find prey and avoid obstacles and predators. How does it work? With echolocation, the dolphin emits a range of sound waves in bursts that help other dolphins to analyse the environment as the sound echoes. The sound is picked up by the teeth of the lower jaw that absorb sound vibrations.\nDolphins feel the suffering of their own\nTo end the list of 10 fun facts about dolphins, we know that they are not only very intelligent animals but also very sensitive to the suffering of another dolphin. If a dolphin is dying, others will come to come to its aid and support it, and between them they will take it to a point above the water level where it can breathe through the hole on the top of its body, known as a \"blowhole\"."}

After that, take a look at our other articles on the Most Endangered Marine Animals Due To Plastic Pollution and 17 Most Endangered Ocean Species and Marine Animals .\nGanges River Dolphin\nGanges River Dolphin\nThe Ganges River dolphins are carnivores, meaning they only eat flesh. They feed small fish, mollusks, and aquatic crabs, among other aquatic animals.The dolphin swims on one side with its flipper trailing along the muddy bottom, making it one of a kind.\nThis behavior is supposed to help it find food. There are no known predators of Ganges River Dolphins other than humans. They\u2019re after them for oil, bait, and meat.\nGanges River Dolphin 10 Cool Facts\n*P. gangetica is the species name for the Ganges River Dolphin, which is a freshwater dolphin. A male Ganges Dolphin is referred to as a bull, while a female Ganges Dolphin is referred to as a cow. *Susu, Hihu, Blind dolphin, Gangas dolphin, side swimming dolphin, and South Asian river dolphin are some of their other names. *The Ganges River Dolphin is a huge freshwater animal that is 96-106.8 inches in length (2.4-2.7 m). It\u2019s ten times the size of a hamster. *In the wild, a Ganges River Dolphin has an average lifespan of 18-22 years. The oldest male dolphin has been identified as being 28 years old. *Ganges River Dolphins are deafeningly deafeningly deafeningly de Because they lack lenses in their eyes, they are unable to resolve images. *They communicate by using pulse noises. Dolphins in the Ganges River use echolocation to find food, avoid danger, and migrate about. *They have a brownish tint and a narrow, extended snout, like some other river dolphins. They have a triangular hump around two-thirds of the way down their back due to the lack of a real dorsal fin. Their pectoral fins, which are bigger than those of most other dolphin species, compensate for the lack of a dorsal fin. *The dolphins of the Ganges River are carnivores, meaning they solely eat flesh. Small fish, mollusks, and aquatic crustaceans are among the aquatic species that they eat. *The dolphin is unique in that it swims on one side, with its flipper trailing down the muddy bottom. This habit is thought to assist it in locating food. Other than humans, there are no known predators of Ganges River Dolphins. They pursue them in search of oil, bait, and meat. *In the sea, the dolphin is unable to breathe. As a mammal, it emerges every 30-120 seconds to breathe in new air.\nThe South Asian river dolphins\nSouth Asian river dolphins are two toothed whale species of the genus Platanista that live in freshwater habitats in northern South Asia. Both species of the genus are threatened with endangered.\nWhen did the Ganges River Dolphin Become Endangered?\nWe all noticed different types of fish in the Ganges river due to the lock down.

The Gangetic River Dolphin, India\u2019s National Aquatic Animal, is a dolphin that may be found in the Ganges River. That is, the Central Government designated it as national aquatic life in 2009.\nThe Gangetic River dolphin is mostly found in the Ganges River, although it can also be found in the Ganges\u2019 tributaries including the Brahmaputra River. Another clean-water dolphin is the Indus River Dolphin, which can be found in Pakistan\u2019s Indus River.\nDolphins that are Gangetic want to be in a calm atmosphere.

Because of the growing human population, their natural habitat is deteriorating. Industries and agricultural activities pollute the river system. We dumped many harmful substances into rivers, having a significant impact on these dolphins.\nHuman alterations also contribute significantly to the destruction of their ecosystem. Fisherman\u2019s use of nylon fishing nets is another factor in placing them in danger. Dolphins are also being hunted for oil and flesh, which is reducing their population. Hence, this species faces an extinction threat.\nHow can the Gangetic River Dolphins catch fish and move if they are blind?\nHow can the Gangetic River Dolphins catch fish and move if they are blind\nThis dolphin employed echolocation, which is a fascinating fact.

The Ganges\u2019 water has gotten so contaminated that it is no longer safe to bathe in. The number of dolphins in the rivers has been steadily decreasing as pollution in the waterways has increased. Fishing and boating on rivers, on the other hand, interfered with the dolphins\u2019 natural environment and attempted to exterminate them, putting the dolphins on the verge of extinction.\nFor the past 30 years, no one has not seen dolphins in Kolkata\u2019s Hooghly River. Dolphins were also found in vast numbers in Bihar, but they are now endangered as well. According to a census, there were more than 5,000 Gangetic dolphins in India at one time, but today there are less than 1500.\nThe Indian Wildlife Protection Act has listed dolphins as Schedule 1 animals, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has designated them endangered. Lock down has not only brought these extinct species back to life, but it has also given them fresh hope.\nGanges River Dolphin Cool Facts Mid Geo\nAs soon as the river\u2019s water has become clear.

Ganesh Chaudhary, a wildlife photographer from Kolkata, not only observed but also photographed the dolphins.\nGanesh started after watching the dolphins that the dolphins had not been seen in Kolkata in 30 years. The extinction of dolphins was caused by pollution, but the dolphins have now reappeared once pollution levels have been decreased. In such a case, we have this big sign of protecting these Mammals, which begs the question, why and how? Ganges River Dolphin Cool Facts MidGeo\nThe fact that the dolphin has returned to the waterways demonstrates that our rivers are now clean. At this time, we must consider how to achieve development by building a balance between nature and humans. Because if nature and humans do not work together, all of humanity\u2019s life, including dolphins\u2019, will be lost.\nRivers will vanish from the feature of the earth. Human life will be on the verge of extinction as a result of this. As a result, we must consider how to achieve long-term development.\nDid you enjoy reading The Ganges river dolphin cool facts?

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "19 Killer Whale Facts About Orcas - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/killer-whale/", "text": "Killer Whale Profile\nOrcas (Orcinus orca), often called Killer Whales, are actually the worlds biggest dolphins and are members of the Delphinidae family which also includes species such as Bottlenose Dolphins and Pilot Whales.\nThey inhabit most of the world\u2019s oceans, ranging from the equator to the polar regions. It\u2019s thought they got the misnomer \u201cKiller Whale\u201d from sailors who saw them hunting whales.\nKiller Whale Facts Overview\nHabitat: Most often in coastal waters but found in open waters as well. Location: Ranging from the equator to the polar regions. Lifespan: In the wild, females can live to be 100 years old, while males can live as long as 60 years. Size: Females: 5-7m, Males: 6-8m Weight: Females: 1,400-2,700kg, Males: 3,600-5,400kg Color: Black & white Diet: Fish, penguins and marine mammals (seals, sea lion and sometimes whales) Predators: As apex predators, they have no known natural predators. Top Speed: 56 km/h (35 mph) No. of Species:\n1 Conservation Status:\nInsufficient data\nWhile they are still currently categorised as one species, scientists are now beginning to recognise that there are multiple types of Orca, which are likely sub-species or even different species all together.\nOrcas are aquatic mammals (cetaceans), so they are warm-blooded and breath air. They are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain, and they often hunt marine mammals (seals, sealions etc), fish and penguins.\nThey have complex social structures, some form pods composed mainly of matrilineal (descended from the mother) lines which will contain several generations of family members. Others form smaller transient groups which usually involves a mother and 2 offspring. And then there are roving males, who never become part of a pod.\nOrcas are highly intelligent, can communicate, have complex hunting techniques and even culture.\nInteresting Killer Whale Facts\n1. They are not \u2018whales\u2019!\nDespite the common misnomer of \u201ckiller whale\u201d, they are in fact members of the Delphinidae family which are oceanic dolphins.\nIt\u2019s thought that sailors who saw orcas hunting whales called them \u201cwhale killers\u201d which changed into \u201ckiller whales\u201d over time.\n2. They are killers.\nWhile they\u2019re not whales, they are killers and well known as extremely intelligent hunters. They often work together, in pods of as many as 40 members, to hunt marine mammals much larger than themselves (including whales).\nThey\u2019ve evolved a number of hunting tactics, as you can see in the incredible video below.\n3. There might be more than one species of killer whale.\nAlthough for a long time Orcas were considered one species, this is now being questioned.\nThere are several populations of orcas with specific traits, and it\u2019s being debated whether these are subspecies or separate species.\n4. They can live as long as humans.\nFemales can live as long as 100 years in the wild, while males can live as long as 60 years. In captivity however, they usually don\u2019t live longer than 10 years.\n5. You find them everywhere.\nThey can be found in oceans all over the world. They are some of the most widely distributed mammals in the world, competing only with humans and rats.\n6. Killer whales are apex predators.\nThis means that they are at the top of the food chain, and nothing else hunts them. Without the pressure of having to defend themselves from predators, they\u2019ve been free to evolve into incredible predators.\n7. They use echolocation.\nLike many cetaceans, they are able to use their clicking noises like sonar. One study showed that orcas are so good at echolocation that they able to identify their favourite type of salmon.\n8. They can\u2019t smell.\nThey don\u2019t have smelling organs, or even the part of the brain dedicated to this sense, so we\u2019re fairly sure they can\u2019t smell.\n9. They are some of the fastest swimming marine mammals.\nThey can swim as fast as 56 km/h, which is around 35mph \u2013 underwater!\n10. They sleep with one half of their brain at a time.\nAs orcas have to come up to the surface to breath, they can\u2019t fully sleep. So, they sleep with just one half of the brain, leaving one eye open as well.\nWhen the right side of the brain is asleep, the left eye is open and vice versa.\n11. They go through menopause.\nThere are only 3 species on the planet that go through menopause, humans, short-finned pilot whales and Orcas.\n12. Killer whales are super smart.\nOrcas have huge brains, the second biggest of all marine mammals in fact. But, in terms of measuring intelligence, it\u2019s the ratio of brain to body that\u2019s important, which for an orca is similar to that of a chimpanzee.\nThey have their own language, excellent memories, they teach each other hunting skills and they form tight-knit social groups.\n13. They have complex social lives.\nThey are famous for the complexity of their social lives. Some orcas stay their entire lives in pods in which all members are related to a matrilineal line.\nOthers form smaller groups which travel longer distances.\n14. They communicate and have dialects.\nOrcas communicate via 3 sounds: clicks, whistles and pulsed calls. Amazingly, different groups of orcas \u2018speak\u2019 different dialects.\nIn some cases, the difference between dialects can be as large the difference between Japanese and English.\n15. They even learn the languages of other species!\nA study found that Orcas can learn to speak \u201cdolphin\u201d. Orcas which spent time with bottlenose dolphins started to make more clicking sounds, replicating those of the dolphins.\n16. They have culture.\nDifferent groups have specific skills, such as hunting techniques or dialects, which they teach to their young. These skills will stay within specific groups of Orcas for generations.\nOne researcher even said that the only species more \u201ccultural\u201d than Orcas are humans.\n17. They recognise themselves in mirrors.\nThe mirror recognition test is a famous animal behaviour test use to figure out if animals are able to recognise themselves, and therefore if they are self-aware.\nOrcas are one of a very few animals that have passed this test, with other animals including the Great Apes (chimpanzees, orangutans etc), Asian Elephants and Magpies.\n18. Killer whale scare (and eat) Great White Sharks.\nOrcas have been known to hunt Great White Sharks. They even know that great white sharks rely on their livers for buoyancy and will remove a shark\u2019s liver with almost surgical precision.\nGreat White Sharks are so scared of Orcas that when they sense them moving into an area, they run for the hills.\n\ufeff\n19. There are incredible stories of Orcas hunting with humans.\nThere are historic accounts of the indigenous Kamchadel, in now eastern Russia, co-operatively hunting with Orcas.\nThe Orcas would help herd injured whales towards humans who would then share the meat with the Orcas.\nKiller Whale Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification"}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Dusky Dolphin images!\nDusky Dolphin Classification and Evolution\nThe Dusky Dolphin is a small species of dolphin that is found inhabiting the cooler waters along continental shelves throughout the southern hemisphere. This distinctive looking cetacean is closely related to other large marine animals including other dolphins, porpoises and whales but despite their fish-like appearance Dusky Dolphins are true mammals that both breathe air in and out of their lungs and also suckle their young on milk produced by the mother\u2019s mammary glands. Dusky Dolphins are widespread throughout the southern hemisphere with three species being recognised that have been grouped by their geographical range, with one found off the coast of South America, one near South Africa and in the Indian Ocean and another inhabits deeper waters close to New Zealand. Sadly however, despite being locally common in certain areas Dusky Dolphin populations have declined throughout much of their natural range primarily due to threats caused by increasing levels of human activity.\nDusky Dolphin Anatomy and Appearance\nThe Dusky Dolphin is the smallest of the world\u2019s 33 different species of dolphin growing to under two meters in length and generally weighing less than 100kg. Like other species of cetacean, Dusky Dolphins have a smooth and hairless, streamlined body that helps them to glide through the water and is powered by their two tail flukes which lay horizontally rather than vertically like those of fish. The upper-side of their bodies is either dark grey or blue-black in colour and is separated from their light grey to white under-side by a grey line which runs from their beak to the base of their tail. Dusky Dolphins also have two light grey lines which run diagonally from their tail to their dorsal fin which is tall and curved to help them to change direction quickly in the water. The beak of the Dusky Dolphin is black and more rounded in shape than those of other dolphin species and contains between 24 and 36 pairs of sharp, cone-shaped teeth that are ideal for catching slippery and fast-moving prey.\nDusky Dolphin Distribution and Habitat\nDusky Dolphins tend to be found in cool to temperate waters (10 \u2013 18 degrees centigrade) close to continental shelves throughout the southern hemisphere, and seem to prefer shallower rather than deep water regions (although this can vary depending on the location and time of year). Although they are not generally known to participate in seasonal migrations, Dusky Dolphins can travel vast distances across the ocean and at great speed in search of food. The three Dusky Dolphin species have been classified by the regions in which they live with the highest populations found off the coast of South America, South-Western Africa and around New Zealand. There are also populations known to occur in the waters close to Argentina along with around the Falkland Islands further south. Despite their wide range and distribution throughout the southern hemisphere Dusky Dolphin populations have been decreasing mainly due to interaction with humans including being hunted for their meat and getting caught in the nets that are used to catch the shoaling fish which the Dusky Dolphins hunt.\nDusky Dolphin Behaviour and Lifestyle\nThe exact behaviours and habits of Dusky Dolphins depends on the species and where they live however, they generally spend time close to the shore resting during the day in small groups that consist of between ten and twenty individuals. As night falls, these small groups begin to travel further away from land to feed and form pods consisting of up 1,000 individuals that includes both male and female members in order to work together to corner shoals of fish. Dusky Dolphins are incredibly sociable animals and can be seen playing, grooming and leaping together after feeding before breaking up into their smaller groups again to return closer to the coast to rest. Although they are able to dive for up to 90 seconds at a time, like other marine mammals Dusky Dolphins must keep returning to the water\u2019s surface to breathe, and expel old air and water from their lungs via the single blow-hole that is located on the top of their heads. They are highly intelligent animals and are often seen leaping out of the water before diving back in after gliding through the air for a few seconds. This technique is known as porpoising and enables the Dusky Dolphin to breathe but without having to slow down when chasing prey.\nDusky Dolphin Reproduction and Life Cycles\nDespite being relatively wide-spread across the southern hemisphere, the fast moving nature of the Dusky Dolphin has meant that it can often be hard to study these animals in the wild and quite little is therefore known about their lifespans in general. Most Dusky Dolphin calves tend to be born towards the end of the winter and in the early summer months between October and February when the female gives birth to a single offspring after a gestation period that lasts for around 11 months. The Dusky Dolphin calf is fed on the nutritious milk provided by its mother until it is then taught to hunt by her after about a year. Calves tend to remain close their mother until they are around three years old when they leave to join a pod of their own (males with often form bachelor groups), and the female is then able to mate again. Dusky Dolphins are thought to be able to first breed when they are between the ages of four and five and are thought to live for an average of 20 years.\nDusky Dolphin Diet and Prey\nThe Dusky Dolphin is a carnivorous animal that only feeds on other animals in order to gain the nutrients that it needs to survive. By congregating in large groups Dusky Dolphins are able to trap vast schools of fish so that they have the best opportunity to feed, by travelling through the waters in a line and pushing the shoal into an area where it is trapped. Prey depends largely on the area in which the Dusky Dolphins are feeding but they most commonly consume anchovies, sardines and mackerel in shallower waters, squid at mid-depths and larger prey including hake and octopus in deeper ocean. Although Dusky Dolphins have excellent hearing and are able to see remarkably well through the water, it is actually a specially evolved system that these animals use which both helps them to locate prey and to also avoid upcoming obstacles. By producing a rapid series of clicking noises, the Dusky Dolphin\u2019s brain is then able to translate the clicks that bounce off things ahead (such as fish) into a mental sound map of the surrounding area and therefore knows exactly where to find food.\nDusky Dolphin Predators and Threats\nThe relatively large size, sociable nature and sheer speed of the Dusky Dolphin means that it has very few predators that hunt it in its natural environment. Pods of Killer Whales (to which they are related) are the main predators of the Dusky Dolphin along with some large species of shark that venture into the shallower, coastal waters. The biggest threat to the world\u2019s Dusky Dolphin populations though is people encroaching more and more on their natural habitats usually in the form of commercial fishing. As humans are fishing for the same shoaling fish as the Dusky Dolphins it often leads to them being caught up in vast nets where they can quickly become trapped. Other reasons for the decline in Dusky Dolphins include the fact that they are also hunted in some areas (particularly Peru) for their meat and are injured by large boats that hit them.\nDusky Dolphin Interesting Facts and Features\nThe Dusky Dolphin is thought to be one of the most intelligent animal species in the world and even communicates with other individuals using their own language which consists of a series of whistles, clicks and squeaks. The unique body shape of the Dusky Dolphin means that it is incredibly flexible and in fact, the most agile species of dolphin in the world. They are often seen leaping out of the water both when swimming and playing and the noise that is caused by them diving back into the water is able to travel for up to 1km through the water and up to 3km through the air. Dusky Dolphins are known to be incredibly sociable animals with sick or injured individuals helped by others that push them towards the surface so the vulnerable individual is able to breathe. Along with being seen together in their own pods, Dusky Dolphins are also known to interact with other cetaceans including Common Dolphins, which they feed alongside.\nDusky Dolphin Relationship with Humans\nDespite being one of the most intelligent animals in the world, the increasing amount of man-made obstacles such as boats and rigs that litter the sea has led to a decline in Dusky Dolphin populations as they are often hit by them. Populations around South America have also suffered greatly from hunting by people for their flesh which is used both as bait for fish and for human consumption. A study carried out between 1991 and 1993 revealed that 7,000 Dusky Dolphins were captured each year and although the hunting of dolphins has been recently banned, they are still commonly hunted as food. The issue however that most affects all Dusky Dolphin populations is the fact that they are often caught by accident in large fishing nets that are targeting the same fish that the dolphins are. However, in an growing number of places around the world watching the acrobatic Dusky Dolphin is becoming increasingly popular with tourists and bringing awareness to the threats that they face.\nDusky Dolphin Conservation Status and Life Today\nToday, the Dusky Dolphin is listed by the IUCN as being Data Deficient which means that although certain populations in certain areas are well reported, little is really known about those individuals that inhabit unpopulated regions. However, their numbers are known to be drastically declining throughout the southern hemisphere primarily due to the increasing levels of human activity in their native environments. Despite the hunting of them being banned, they are still caught in nets and trawlers in their thousands on a yearly basis.\nView all 58 animals that start with D"}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "What Are the Characteristics of Dolphins? | Sciencing", "url": "https://sciencing.com/characteristics-dolphins-8394898.html", "text": "With a perpetual smile on their faces, dolphins, as members of the carnivorous cetacean family that also includes whales and porpoises, use echolocation \u2013 a type of sonar \u2013 to see while they swim beneath the waves. In December 2015, biologists and researchers in the US and UK captured an image of a submerged researcher using only the echolocation beam from a dolphin. The image clearly details the shape of the man and even depicts the fingers on his hand.\nTL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) Dolphins send out a sonar beam in a series of clicks that bounces off fish in the water. When they listen to the echoes, the amount of time it takes for the sounds to return tells the dolphin the size of the fish and its approximate distance. In the wild dolphins can live from 10 to 50 years or more and they travel in family groups known as pods.\nPhysical Appearance\nDolphins range in color from light gray to dark gray on their backs, which lightens to white on their underbellies and beneath their jaws. Dolphins generally range in size from 6 feet to over 12 feet and can weigh as much as 600 pounds. Smaller dolphins typically live in rivers and along the coasts, while the larger dolphins range far out to sea. The geographical location and the water\u2019s warmth contributes to the dolphin\u2019s size, as colder waters make for bigger dolphins. A dolphin\u2019s powerful fluke tail, moving up and down in the water propels the mammal forward. Pectoral fins on each side of the body help them steer while swimming, but these are also used like hands to touch or stroke other dolphins. The dorsal fin atop the dolphin\u2019s back helps mammal expel heat.\nSocial Behavior\nDolphins form strong bonds with other dolphins, and if one dolphin become injured, the others help it to reach the surface. Most dolphins stay in groups of up to 12 dolphins, but many groups often come together in the ocean wild, at which time, dolphins may exit one group and join another. Like the water they live in, dolphin prefer fluid social groups. When in large groups, they hunt and forage together, with some dolphins taking turns to hunt or stand guard. Like humans, dolphins give live birth and nurse their young. Dolphin babies \u2013 calves \u2013 nurse for up to 18 months and stay with the mother for up to three years. A nanny dolphin, male or female, often accompanies the mother and the baby as it grows. The nanny or auntie dolphin is the only one the mother allows near the calf.\nPlayful Nature\nAlthough the dolphin's playful side is what makes it a big attraction in captivity, Sea World reports that this behavior also has an important purpose for dolphins in the wild. Dolphins often chase one another and throw objects, such as seaweed from one to the other. These natural behaviors allow the dolphin to practice its hunting skills. Play is also a way for dolphins to bond with one another.\nLanguage and Intelligence"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "10 Dolphin Facts That Reveal How Terrifying They Truly Are", "url": "http://eskify.com/10-dolphin-facts-that-reveal-how-terrifying-they-truly-are/", "text": "Most people see dolphins as fun and playful creatures, but there actually vicious killers. These almost unbelievable dolphin facts reveal how depraved, and terrifying these creatures really are. Not just in the way they attack humans but also the way they attack other dolphins. Dolphins are also some of the most intelligent creatures, and they behave like any other highly intelligent species on the planet, horrifically.\nThe Unsolved Dolphin Murder Spree\nThere\u2019s evidence to say that dolphins actually engage in murdering baby porpoises. At first it was believed that the baby dolphins were killed by weapons tests, but evidence found on the body indicates the killer was a dolphin. Dolphins can use echolocation to locate the vital organs of the infants and aim for those spots specifically. They pummel them, throw them into the air, and won\u2019t stop chasing them until they die. Strangely though, baby porpoises believed to have been killed by dolphins have only ever been found in two places. Off the coast of Virginia, and Scotland\u2019s north-east coast. Now that scientists have confirmed these porpoises are being killed by dolphins, they are baffled as to why. The murders were committed for an unknown porpoise.\nThe Strange Reason Why Dolphins Kill Babies\nDolphins don\u2019t just kill baby porpoises but babies of their own species as well. It\u2019s now believed that male dolphins will kill the infants of female dolphins in order to get them to mate with them. Committing infanticide like this causes the females to immediately become ready to have children. This may also explain the undeciphered killing sprees of the Scottish and American dolphins. It\u2019s been theorised that these dolphins are practising to kill ones of their own species, or may have gotten the porpoises mixed up for other baby dolphins. However this doesn\u2019t explain the mystery of why it only happens in those two places.\nDolphins Are Rapists. But Is That Really The Case?\nThere have been a lot of different publications claiming that as opposed to being the clowns of the ocean, dolphins are actually the gang rapists of the ocean. But, is this really true? Let\u2019s look at the evidence. Well dolphins tend to team up, with around 4 to 5 males protecting and capturing female dolphins. And males can act aggressively towards females but there\u2019s no evidence to say they actually rape them. If a female dolphin isn\u2019t into it, they can say no by turning up their belly, and there\u2019s no evidence to say a male will force a female to have sex. This is one of the most commonly cited dolphin facts, and is most likely a myth. Although the possibility being raised still makes dolphins more terrifying creatures.\nWill They Ever Stop!\nDolphins have been shown to have endurance far beyond what a human could hope to achieve. In fact, dolphins have been shown to be able to stay awake for not one, not two, but five whole days without sleep, and another study found they could stay alert for a total of 15 days. To achieve this they use an unusual, and fascinating method. But first, why do they do this? Well, dolphins can\u2019t breathe underwater.\nThey take in oxygen by making trips up to the surface, and then they can stay underwater for a total of 17 minutes. Some then wonder, how do they sleep? Dolphins sleep by resting half of their brains at a time, no really. They even keep one eye open, while the other is closed. Half of their brain is in what\u2019s called slow-wave sleep. Sleeping with one eye open, means they can watch out for predators.\nThey\u2019re Territorial Soldiers\nOne of the lesser known dolphin facts is that they claim territory, and then control them in hierarchical structures. These structures are known as pods. These pods are surprisingly well organised. They\u2019re split into subgroups with different goals. Three dolphins will have the team objective of capturing, and herding female dolphins. Groups of four to fourteen dolphins will be organised to attack other groups of dolphins and steal their females. They also have diplomat dolphins who go to communicate with opposing factions, which can lead to two groups joining forces in order to dominate other groups of dolphins, or form an alliance against a group larger than both of theirs. Sometimes dolphins may become traitors due to the influence of enemy diplomat dolphins.\nSome Dolphins Can Sniff Out Mines And Have Military Training\nThe US and probably some other navies have been giving dolphins military training on how to seek out underwater mines, and mark them. Human divers will then go down and disarm the marked mines. This allows oil tankers to travel through areas that previously would have too dangerous to pass through. These dolphins are highly trained, yet still indistinguishable from ordinary dolphins. This means they can slip past the Iranian, and other armies without them ever noticing. This is one of the most insane dolphin facts; dolphins and military training make a dangerous combination.\nThe Most Dangerous Dolphin Is Not What You Might Expect\nOne of the most shocking, and unknown dolphin facts is that the Killer Whale is actually a dolphin. This insane killing machine, so large millions of people are convinced it\u2019s a whale, is actually a dolphin. This is why they\u2019re so smart, and can be trained. The combination of the size and brute strength of a whale, mixed with the intelligence of a dolphin, makes it one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean. Killer whales will eat any animal including great white sharks, and other mega-predators, and there isn\u2019t a single predator in the ocean above the Killer Whale.\nThey Have Most Unusual Penises\nDolphins don\u2019t have penises that function in the same ways that normal humans do. They have multi-purpose penises capable of doing more than just mating. They also act almost as a hand which allows them to touch and feel things. Which explains why they have been seen doing nasty things to inanimate objects, and may also explain the rumour that dolphins rape humans. Many people have made the claim that dolphins rape humans, but most likely it is just them using their \u201chand\u201d on something they don\u2019t normally interact with.\nDolphins Are Actually Mega-Predators\nMega-predators may be a made up term, but it perfectly describes dolphins when you consider this fact. Dolphins eat an insane amount of fish. They only weigh 260 lbs but eat about 33 lbs of fish a day. What they eat includes a variety ranging from fishes and crustaceans, to squids and shrimp. Dolphins capture fish with a organised attack. The first step to herd a school of fish into a smaller but denser group, and then circling round, taking turns to charge in and attempt to grab a fish. This is known as pinwheeling.\nDolphins Can Speak!\nScientists in Crimea discovered the unbelievable. Dolphins can actually speak to each other in a way that resembles human words. They make a series of noises including pulses, clicks, and whistles. Using these sounds they can create up to five words, which doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but can actually be used to create thousands of sentences. Researches were fascinated watching conversations unfold. One dolphin would emit noises, the other would quietly wait, and then reply with their own noises. Each dolphin sounds a unique way, similar to the way we have our own voices. Researchers are now looking into how to talk to animals."}

Here\u2019s another pearl of wisdom. Dolphins are not vegans or even vegetarians. They are cold-blooded, hungry meat-eaters. They hunt in packs for squid, small fish, and just about anything that moves or swims. They don\u2019t just kill for food, They are creative hunters who like to hunt \u201cin style\u201d. They invent new techniques and even hunt, although rarely, on land!(source)\n8 Dolphins Enjoy Dominating Weaker Creatures\nIf you think sharks are a ferocious, murderous lot, dolphins are no less. They like playing around with weaker animals just for the hell of it. They mess with them, play to their hearts\u2019 content, then throw them away like a worn-out toy. For instance, officers at the Florida Research Centre have found out that when they are bored with real volleyballs, dolphins play shark volleyball. That is literally using a baby shark as a volleyball. Now I will agree that sharks are no saints either. But screwing around with a baby? That\u2019s not nice, is it?(source)\n9 Dolphins Are Storehouses of Sexually Transmitted Diseases\nWhile you will probably never choose a dolphin as a life partner, a British woman of 41 years actually married a dolphin named Cindy in a ceremony in Israel. They shared a kiss and became partners forever after a twelve-year-\u00adlong relationship. Now all that sounds good and cute, but here\u2019s why that was probably not a great idea. Dolphins are bags of sexual disease and are known to transfer a wide array of STDs to their partners. If your little girl is thinking of marrying a dolphin when she grows up, tell her to watch out!(source)\nAdvertisements\n10 Dolphins Engage In Recreational Drug Abuse\nIf you used to think that only humans can get addicted to things they ingest, be prepared to change that view. This one weird video shows a group of dolphins getting high on neurotoxins secreted by puffer fish. As a defense mechanism, the puffer fish release this neurotoxin to deflect its hunters. In high doses, the toxin can kill, but in lower doses, it works as a recreational drug. This is exactly what the dolphins seem to be enjoying below:\nNote that this isn\u2019t just innocent dolphins falling prey to puffer fish secretion. They purposely attack this species to get high on their secretions!(source)\n11 Dolphins Engage in Sick Nasal Sexuality\nApparently, dolphins enjoy inserting their male sexual organ into the blowholes of other dolphins, making this the world\u2019s only instance of \u201cnasal sexuality\u201d. God! I don\u2019t know about you, but I am definitely not sleeping tonight after writing this stuff! Aggressive sexuality is mostly noted in bottlenose dolphins who are famous for being extra horny.(source)\nOkay. So dolphin-lovers are obviously gonna get angry. Also, the behavior of a few misbehaved creatures doesn\u2019t represent an entire species. However, the truth is, it is the increased intelligence in dolphins that has led to them engage in all sorts of strange activity. More intelligence means more complexity. Now good night, and sweet dreams!"}

The back and tail of the Dusky dolphin are dusky bluish-black in color, exhibiting a dark streak, which stretches diagonally across the flanks to the tail. The animal is a close relative of the Pacific White Sided dolphin. Nevertheless, scientific studies have found a number of differences between these two, which allows to classify them as two separate species. One of the most identifying features of the Dusky dolphin is the lack of beak as well as the evenly sloping head from the blowhole to the tip of the snout. Both males and females have a dorsal fin, which is more curved in males. Both sexes are almost the same in size."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphin Teeth: Everything You Need to Know - AZ Animals", "url": "https://a-z-animals.com/blog/dolphin-teeth-everything-you-need-to-know/", "text": "Dolphins live in all the world\u2019s oceans, and even some of the largest freshwater rivers. Like whales, they\u2019re considered cetaceans\u2013marine dwelling mammals. There are four main families of dolphin, with 40 extant (living) species. Of these 40 species, 30 of them are within the Delphinidae family of oceanic dolphins. The other three families (Iniidae, Pontoporiidae, and Platanistidae) comprise the world\u2019s river dwelling dolphins. Dolphins are mammals, eat meat, and have teeth.\nHere, we\u2019ll learn all about dolphin dentition. Each species of dolphin is unique, but they all follow the same general rules when it comes to dentition. We\u2019ll explore just how many teeth are normal for a dolphin, and what it is that makes dolphin teeth special. Then, we\u2019ll go in depth on a couple of unique species with specialized mouths (for dolphins), and discuss how scientists determine dolphin\u2019s ages from their teeth.\nHow Many Teeth Do Dolphins Have?\nDolphins have an incredible amount of teeth that line their jaws. Some dolphins have up to 268 teeth! iStock.com/evanming\nDolphins evolved from land dwelling creatures millions of years ago. As they adapted to life in the ocean, they also grew to have many more teeth than their terrestrial ancestors. Because dolphins have more than 44 teeth per mouth quadrant (think upper, lower, left, and right), they are known as polyodonts. Polyodonty means \u2018many teeth\u2019, and dolphins certainly live up to the name.\nLet\u2019s take a look at the teeth of a few of the most common species of dolphin.\nShort-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus delphis): 160-228\nLong-beaked common dolphin (Delphinus capensis): 188-268\nBottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus): 72-116\nSpinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris): 180-260\nPacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens): 92-144\nWhat Type of Teeth Do Dolphins Have?\nDolphins have up to 265 teeth\nDolphins are odontocetes, meaning toothed cetacean. They share this characteristic with other cetaceans like sperm whales, beaked whales, and porpoises. The largest member of the dolphin family is the orca whale (Orcinus orca). It may be large, but even the orca (also called killer whale) shares the same dentition as the much smaller bottlenose dolphin.\nAlmost all dolphin species are homodonts, meaning they only have one type of tooth. In comparison; humans have four distinct types of tooth\u2013incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. The dolphin\u2019s sole tooth type is small (up to \u00bd inch in length) and conical. Depending on the species of dolphin, these teeth may be blunt or sharp\u2013it all depends on what they like to eat.\nDiet and Teeth\nDolphins mostly eat fish, krill, plankton, and cephalopods (squid). But different species of dolphin may eat more of one than the other; this is where differences in teeth appear. Some species, like the bottlenose dolphin, eat a general diet of fish, squid, and krill, and have very typical, conical, blunt teeth. While other species, like the orca whale, eat mostly large prey like seals, and have sharper teeth for tearing flesh. Still other species of dolphin have even more specialized dentition for their unique diets\u2013more on that later.\nSocial Hierarchy\nDolphins don\u2019t just use their pearly whites to catch fish; they also use them to establish dominance among other dolphins. Dolphins are social creatures, and live in pods of up to dozens of animals. Each pod has a unique social hierarchy, starting with the lowest ranked (often the youngest) individuals, and moving up to the most dominant members of the group.\nOne of the tools dolphins use to establish their dominance is a behavior called \u2018raking\u2019. Raking happens when a dolphin scrapes its anterior (front) teeth against the body or face of another member of the pod. This leaves a series of shallow cuts in the other dolphin\u2019s skin. They\u2019re not life threatening, but the teeth seem to send the message: stay in line, and respect the hierarchy.\nDo All Dolphins Have Teeth?\nAmazon river dolphins are one of the few species of dolphin with molar-like teeth\nAll dolphins have teeth. Most of them have many teeth (upwards of 150), but one species (Risso\u2019s dolphin) has fewer than 20 teeth in its entire mouth. Additionally, both the Risso\u2019s dolphin and the Amazon river dolphin have teeth that are a little more complex than the average cetacean.\nRisso\u2019s Dolphin\nRisso\u2019s dolphins (Grampus griseus) live in temperate and tropical oceans around the world. They have perhaps the most specialized dentition of all in that they have no upper teeth, and only 4-14 teeth in their lower jaw. What teeth they do have are located at the very front of the mouth, and are much sharper than the typical dolphin. Risso\u2019s dolphins have this specialized dentition because they eat almost entirely squid.\nAmazon River Dolphin\nAmazon river dolphins (Inia geoffrensis) live in the freshwaters of the Amazon and Orinoco river basins. They are famously pink colored, and have a varied diet of fish, turtles, and crabs. Because they eat harder foods like crab and turtle, they have developed flatter, molar-like, teeth towards the backs of their mouths. These dolphins are technically considered heterodonts\u2013meaning they have more than one type of tooth.\nTelling a Dolphin\u2019s Age From Its Teeth\nDolphin calves spend the first few months of life living off of their mother\u2019s milk. Once they\u2019re around three months old, their teeth start to erupt. By the time they\u2019re six months old, they have all of their adult teeth. Dolphins are monophyodonts, which means they only have one set of pearly whites for life.\nAs dolphins age, their teeth grow in layers, like a tree. For every year of life, the dolphin gains a layer of dental material. In the case of necropsies (medical examinations of deceased dolphins) scientists can use these layers to determine the dolphin\u2019s precise age.\nDolphins also exhibit dental wear as they age. This is particularly evident in the anterior teeth, which undergo the most use. As teeth wear, they become blunter and more rounded off, and may eventually become even stubby in appearance. Dolphins don\u2019t regrow teeth; once their teeth wear out, they don\u2019t come back."}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "How do dolphins communicate? - Whale & Dolphin Conservation USA", "url": "https://us.whales.org/whales-dolphins/how-do-dolphins-communicate/", "text": "Large whales can communicate over huge distances (across entire ocean basins) using very low frequencies. Dolphins and porpoises however, usually use higher frequencies, which limits the distance their sounds can travel.\nIn general, dolphins make two kinds of sounds, \u201cwhistles\u201d and \u201cclicks\u201d (listen to the false killer whales on this page). Clicks are used to sense their surroundings through echolocation, while they use whistles to communicate with other members of their species and very likely, with other species too. It is also thought that each dolphin has a unique whistle called a \u2018signature whistle\u2019, which is used to identify an individual.\nWhat is echolocation?\nIn general, as well as having extremely good eyesight that allows them to see both above and below the water, toothed whales (including dolphins) use a sense called echolocation to navigate and hunt underwater.\nThis means that they emit sound waves and then detect and interpret the echoes that bounce back off of other creatures and objects in the water around them, allowing them to build up a picture of their surroundings. Dolphins hunt using their highly-developed echolocation, which means they can find food no matter how murky the water might be. Not only that but they can even use it to identify any prey that might be hiding, such as under the sand!\nSperm whales also use echolocation to find their way around the dark depths of the ocean and to help with hunting for squid. Though only very brief, the clicks they make are the loudest sound in the animal kingdom.\nHow do whales and dolphins hear?\nWhales and dolphins do have ears but they don\u2019t have external sticky out ears like ours to funnel sound as they need to be streamlined for life in the water. Their ear canals are not open to the outside. Instead, they generally hear sounds through special structures in their jawbones."}

Maui's dolphin is the smallest, while orca is the largest species of dolphin.\nDolphins have 100 teeth in their mouth. Despite large number of teeth, they don't chew their food - they swallow their prey in one piece.\nAll dolphins are carnivores (meat-eaters). Smaller dolphins eat fish and squids, while large dolphins like orca eat seals, sea lions and other type of dolphins and whales.\nDolphins use echolocation to locate the prey and detect predators. They produce clicks that travel through the water and bounce off from each object in front of them. Sound returns back in the form of echo. Dolphin can identify type and size of the object, its speed and location using echolocation.\nBesides echolocation, dolphins use whistles, squeaks and squawks to communicate with each other.\nDolphins live in large groups called pods. They are social and very playful animals. They often play with other members of the pod, or even with seaweed.\nEven though they like to play, they are very compassionate and they will nurture old or sick members of the pod whenever necessary.\nDolphins breathe atmospheric air using the hole on the top of their head. Some dolphins can't stay longer than 20 seconds under the water, but other can dive up to 30 minutes without returning to the surface of the water to grab some air.\nDolphins need to remain conscious if they want to breathe. Because of that, dolphins can't afford a deep sleep. Instead of deep sleep, dolphins use only one half of their brain when they sleep. Other half keeps them \"half conscious\".\nWhen they are resting, dolphins swim close to the surface, but when they are wide awake they can dive up to 1000 feet under water.\nThey can swim up to 25 miles per hours for a long period of time and leap a distance of up to 20 feet.\nDolphins can be seen in various aquariums around the world. They are able to learn a lot of tricks because they have large brain.\nMale dolphin is called a bull, female - cow and baby is called a calf.\nPregnancy in dolphins lasts between 11 and 17 months. Females give birth of a calf whose tail appears first. Dolphins are only mammals whose babies come to the world by their tails instead of their heads. Baby dolphin stays with its mother 2-3 years."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "The Real Reason Why Dolphins Are Friendly To Humans (And ... - Animal Dome", "url": "https://animaldome.com/why-dolphins-friendly-humans/", "text": "Dolphins are mammals in the ocean that love to jump from the ocean, do some tricks, and love to smile. They are playful, jolly, and love interacting with humans and other animals living in the ocean. We all know that dolphins are friendly to humans, and they are easy to train.\nOne thing that people don\u2019t know about dolphins is that dolphins are wild animals even though they are well known for being friendly. People should handle dolphins with caution and respect because dolphins may attack if they feel disrespected and threatened.\nBut why are dolphins friendly to humans even if they are wild animals?\nDolphins are friendly to humans because dolphins have a very large brain, which is where their emotional intelligence comes from, and sometimes dolphins see us as part of their pod. Dolphins have compassion and empathy for humans like dogs and some other mammals.\nHowever, not all dolphins can be friendly. Dolphins that have not been domesticated are more likely to be wild. But, some footages show undomesticated dolphins still act friendly towards humans.\nThere are a lot more interesting facts about dolphins. Let\u2019s check them out!\nAre Dolphins Naturally Friendly Towards Humans?\nDolphins are naturally friendly to humans because they have large brains, and they also have large intricate limbic systems, which is where their emotional responses towards humans come.\nAlso, the huge limbic system of dolphins is the reason why they are very smart. That is why you will notice that dolphins can effortlessly learn new tricks, and they can remember their owner and the goodness made by humans to them.\nDolphins have compassion toward humans, and they think that humans are part of their pod. Certain species of dolphins are naturally friendly to humans, but other species just hate humans.\nThat is why you will notice that the dolphins you see in the ocean zoo park have the same features as the other dolphins in the other zoo park.\nHowever, as I have said in the introduction, not all dolphins are friendly toward humans, especially dolphins that have not been domesticated.\nBut, some footage shows that undomestic dolphins still act friendly to humans that they don\u2019t know. So it means that dolphins are naturally friendly to humans, but we still have to treat dolphins with respect because they might attack if they feel threatened.\nIt is good to see dolphins being domesticated, but it has dangerous effects on them. What is that effect? The effect of domestication on dolphins is that it changes their behavior, which is considered as dreadful. Why?\nBecause they lose their wariness and dolphins become less cautious, that makes them an easy target for other wild animals like sharks. That is why some activists promote that people should admire dolphins from a distance, and never use dolphins for entertainment.\nCan Dolphins Be Dangerous?\nNow that you know that not all dolphins are not friendly, you may ask yourself if dolphins can be dangerous. Let me answer that.\nDolphins are large and powerful mammals that live in the ocean. They can injure humans and any other animals in the ocean. Even though they look friendly, they can still be as dangerous as sharks.\nThere have been reported cases where dolphins hurt humans when they interact with them. How do dolphins hurt them? By butting the humans using their tails. Even the trainers are at risk of danger every time they interact with dolphins.\nDolphins that live in a tank or an ocean zoo park feel distressed because they are living in a place where they can\u2019t show their real identity and behavior. When dolphins feel distressed and anxious, they can act wild and can hurt people.\nAlso, dolphins will plan an attack if they feel threatened or if they feel danger, and it can be dangerous. Humans that are too aggressive while interacting with dolphins are most likely to get attacked by dolphins. Even the trainers can be attacked by dolphins, especially if they act abusively.\nYes, dolphins can be friendly. But if you act too aggressively and you act as if you will bring danger to them, they can be dangerous. So if you are going to interact with dolphins, you have to make sure that you act friendly, and treat them with respect and cautiousness.\nWhy Do Dolphins Protect Humans?\nLet\u2019s take aside the recorded lists of dolphins attacking humans, and let\u2019s talk about dolphins that protect humans.\nThere are many more reports of dolphins protecting humans than dolphins attacking humans. Dolphins indeed love humans, but they attack if they feel threatened because that\u2019s how animal instincts work. Even we humans go into attack mode if we feel threatened.\nDolphins are animals that also live in a group called pods. They protect each other, play with each other, and sometimes they also argue like humans. It is usual for dolphins to save their fellow dolphins from danger especially if the dolphins are part of their pod.\nThere are many reports of dolphins saving humans from different death disasters. Dolphins are like lifesavers of the ocean. The usual scenario where dolphins save humans is by guiding them to the shore, defending humans from sharks, and helping humans from drowning.\nDolphins protect humans because these mammals have empathy and sympathy toward humans. They are compassionate, and they have good intimacy with humans. Dolphins think that humans are part of their pod. That is why they protect them as they do their fellow dolphins.\nTypes Of Dolphins That Are Friendly To Humans\nDolphins are mammals that are living underwater. They are one of the most intelligent creatures that have been made by God. There are 43 species of dolphins that can be found around the globe.\nBelow are the species of dolphins that are friendly to humans. They are dolphins that you usually see in ocean zoos, and they are the dolphins who are famous for saving people\u2019s lives.\nBottlenose Dolphin\nThe bottlenose dolphin is the most well-known species of dolphin in the world. They are the usual members of the Delphinidae family. Bottlenose dolphins live in warm and temperate seas around the globe. They can be found anywhere except the Arctic and Antarctic regions.\nBottlenose Dolphins are considered one of the smartest species of dolphins because they can remember things, and their intelligence is the reason why they interact with humans with ease.\nBottlenose dolphins became popular because of their astounding talent and skills that have been shown on television and aquarium performance shows. They love to be with humans, and they have other important purposes for humans than entertaining.\nBottlenose dolphins are trained by militaries to locate and detect sea mines. Also, fishermen use them by catching fish that escape their net. Because of their impressive memory, they are indeed a good companion for humans.\nThe bottlenose dolphins can become extinct due to harmful human activities like illegal fishing. It can be also harmful to bottlenose dolphins if they encounter humans, especially if the human they have encountered is rude.\nSome people hunt them for food, and some use to kill them for fun. They can also be accidentally trapped in fishnets or in some plastic wastes of humans.\nBottlenose dolphins are the third creature that has large encephalization. They have close ratios to humans and some other great apes.\nShort-Beaked Common Dolphin\nThe short-beaked common dolphin is a common species of dolphin that are living in warm-temperate and tropical oceans. They can be found in the Indian Ocean, Atlantic, and Pacific oceans. Short-beaked common dolphins can also be found in the Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas.\nShort-beaked common dolphins are medium-sized and smaller than bottlenose dolphins. They can grow up to eight feet, and their mass can range up to 140kg.\nThe short-beaked common dolphin is also a part of the common dolphin genus. There are many short-beaked common dolphins around the world, and they are an abundant species of dolphin.\nThey are friendly and have been in contact with humans since ancient times. They appear in some Roman and Greek paintings and sculptures. Short-beaked common dolphins have many similarities with the bottlenose dolphins, and most people mistakenly classify both of them.\nThe difference between short-beaked common dolphins with bottlenose dolphins is their colors. Short-beaked common dolphins have a more bright and elegant color on their skin. Most short-beaked common dolphins have color patterns on their bodies.\nAtlantic Spotted Dolphin\nThis species of dolphin can be found swimming in the Gulf stream of the North Atlantic ocean. This Atlantic spotted dolphin is the older species of dolphin. They have cute and distinctive spots around their bodies.\nTheir spots around their bodies increase as they get older, and it is the common sign of being old age in an Atlantic spotted dolphin. So it means that the more spots an Atlantic spotted dolphin has on its body, the older they are.\nThe Atlantic spotted dolphins are excellent at communication, and they are good at socializing with other dolphins, other sea creatures, and humans. They use some whistle sounds when talking to each other. Also, they love to swim with a group.\nHow Do Professional Trainers Train Dolphins?\nHave you ever imagined yourself having a pet dolphin and training them? Also, have you ever wondered how professional trainers train dolphins to perform certain tricks? How hard is it to train a dolphin?\nProfessional marine trainers are also having a hard time training a dolphin because even though dolphins are considerably smart, they are not as intelligent as humans. But what is their trick? Why does it look easy?\nProfessional trainers studied lots of information about dolphins which is why it could be easy for them to teach dolphins many behaviors and tricks. What is the system they use?\nOperant Conditioning\nThe system professional marine trainers use is called positive reinforcement through operant conditioning. They teach dolphins different tricks one at a time. When the dolphins do a good job or execute the right trick, their trainers will reward them with food.\nFor example, many dolphins know how to play with balls. Trainers make sure that the dolphins will successfully execute this by giving them rewards and they break down the trick into simpler steps so that it could be easily understood by dolphins.\nTarget Method\nAnother method used by professional trainers to train dolphins is called a target. The target can be any object that can be followed by dolphins. Let me give you an example.\nThe dolphin loves to jump through a hoop, right? How do they do this? Because of the target method. Trainers will first teach dolphins to swim through the hoop and reward them if the dolphins successfully swim through the hoop.\nAfter that, the trainers will raise the target or hoop. Once the dolphins successfully swim or jump through the hoop they will be given awards again.\nHand Signal Training\nAnother tool used by trainers is called the hand signal. Trainers will teach dolphins different hand signals that symbolize different tricks. When trainers want the dolphin to hop into the hoop, they will give a hand signal to the dolphin.\nEvery trick has different hand signals. Trainers will show a hand signal for each trick they wanted a dolphin to perform. When the trainers show the hand signal, the dolphins already know what their trainers want them to do.\nFinal Words\nDolphins have a beneficial use for humans and for our ecosystem that is why they need to be preserved. They are also good friends and good companions to humans.\nWe don\u2019t deserve dolphins because of what we are doing in their habitat. Let us protect the dolphins not because the law said, but because we love them. Dolphins love us, and they often treat us as part of their pods, so let\u2019s do the same with them."}

The animal also suffers from overfishing; particularly in Japan, where Risso's dolphin is fished for its meat. In some parts of its range, this dolphin is often incidentally caught in fishing gears. Other notable threats to the population of this species include anthropogenic sounds, usually produced by navy sonar or seismic exploration: these sounds, which resonate through the ocean, are extremely dangerous for dolphins, causing gas-bubble disease, which, in turn, leads to high number of mortality among this species.\nPopulation number\nAccording to IUCN, the Risso\u2019s dolphin is locally common and widespread throughout its range but no overall population estimate is available. However, there are estimates of this species in specific areas: the California \u2013 Oregon - Washington subpopulation is now estimated at only 16,066 dolphins; Hawaiian waters hold 2,351 dolphins; off Sri Lanka - 5,500-13,000 dolphins; off the eastern Sulu Sea (Dolar) - 1,514 dolphins; off the eastern United States - 20,479 dolphins; in the northern Gulf of Mexico - 2,169 dolphins; in three areas of concentrated occurrence off Japan - 83,300 dolphins; in the eastern tropical Pacific - 175,000 dolphins. Currently, Risso\u2019s dolphins are classified as Least Concern (LC) on the IUCN Red List.\nEcological niche\nDue to their diet, Risso's dolphins likely have a significant influence on the abundance fish and krill."}

They tend to be social and live in groups. Cetaceans may communicate by slapping the water.\nDolphins and porpoises exhibit complex communication and echolocation by making squeaks, buzzes, whistles, and clicks that can be heard from miles away. They are also thought to communicate by slapping the water\u2019s surface with their tails or bodies.\nImage Pair of bottlenose dolphins.

There are three main types of killer whales, or ecotypes, in the North Pacific: Resident, Transient, and Offshore.\nIn fact, they are the largest member of the Delphinidae, or dolphin family. Members of this family include all dolphin species, as well as other larger species such as long-finned pilot whales and false killer whales, whose common names also contain \"whale\" instead of \"dolphin.\"\nEach North Pacific killer whale ecotype differs in appearance, diet, habitat, genetics, and behavior. While all three types share at least part of their habitats, they are not known to interbreed. Resident killer whales usually eat different varieties of fish, primarily salmon. Southern Resident killer whales prefer Chinook salmon, some of which are endangered. Transient (or Bigg\u2019s) killer whales eat other marine mammals, such as seals, and squid. Offshore killer whales primarily eat sharks and scientists have discovered that the whales\u2019 teeth are worn down over time due to sharks' rough skin.\nIn January, 2019, an experienced group of killer whale biologists launched an expedition from the southern tip of Chile into some of the roughest waters in the world, searching for what could be a new species of killer whale.\n3. Blue whales have the biggest hearts on the planet.\nThe heart of a blue whale weighs more than 1,000 pounds, the weight of an average dairy cow.\nLearn more about the blue whale\nImage\n4. Dolphins are some of the most intelligent animals on Earth.\nThe dolphin's brain cortex features the same convoluted folds that are associated with human intelligence. Dolphins and their kin are the only marine mammals that have passed the mirror test of self-awareness.\n5. They can be pretty fast swimmers!\nDall\u2019s porpoises are considered the fastest swimmers among small cetaceans, reaching speeds of 34 miles per hour over short distances. They have 38 to 56 very small, spade-shaped teeth (about the size of a piece of grain or rice) on each jaw that are useful for grasping.\nLearn more about the Dall\u2019s porpoise\nImage Dall's porpoise\nFalse killer whales can also swim at high speeds. The species behaves much more like a smaller dolphin, swimming quickly and leaping completely out of the water, particularly when attacking certain prey species. In Hawai\u02bbi, they are also known to throw fish high into the air before consuming them. False killer whales are so named because the shape of their skulls, not their external appearance, is similar to that of killer whales.\nLearn more about the false killer whale\nImage False killer whale\n6. Dolphins don\u2019t chew the fish they catch, they swallow prey whole.\nInstead of using their teeth to chew, dolphins grip fish with their teeth, then swallow the fish whole\u2014head first\u2014so the spines of the fish don't catch in their throats. Some NOAA Fisheries scientists have observed dolphins precisely biting the heads off of catfish in the Gulf of Mexico, to avoid the catfish spines. Dolphins that eat octopus will thrash them around first so they don\u2019t choke on the clinging tentacles. Rough-toothed dolphins in Hawaii are specifically adapted for eating large fish like adult mahi-mahi.\n7. Bryde\u2019s whales can blow water 10 to 13 feet into the air when at the water\u2019s surface.\nThey sometimes exhale while underwater as well. Additionally, Bryde\u2019s (pronounced \"broodus\") whales can change directions unexpectedly when swimming. They sometimes generate short, powerful sounds that have low frequencies and sound like \"moans.\"\nThey were once considered monotypic (belonging to one species), but two subspecies and a new species have now been discovered. The Bryde\u2019s whale (Balaenoptera edeni brydei) is the larger form, found primarily in pelagic waters. Bryde\u2019s/Eden\u2019s whale (Balaenoptera edeni edeni) is a smaller form found in the Indian and western Pacific oceans, primarily in coastal waters. The Bryde's whale's \"pygmy form\" has only recently been described and is now known as Omura's whale (Balaenoptera omurai). And a new species, known as Rice\u2019s whale, was recently described in the Gulf of Mexico. Scientists believe that there are fewer than 100 Rice\u2019s whales in the Gulf of Mexico.\nLearn more about the new species\nImage A new article in Marine Mammal Science indicates that the whale previously known as the Bryde\u2019s (pronounced \u201cbroodus\u201d) whale is actually a new whale species living in the Gulf of Mexico. The new species is now called the Rice's whale. Credit: NOAA Fisheries\n8. Whales have a role in potentially helping to combat climate change.\nMarine biologists have recently discovered that whales\u2014especially the great whales\u2014play a significant role in capturing carbon from the atmosphere. Whales accumulate carbon in their bodies during their long lives. When they die, they sink to the bottom of the ocean. Each great whale sequesters 33 tons of carbon dioxide on average, taking that carbon out of the atmosphere for centuries. A tree, meanwhile, absorbs only up to 48 pounds of CO 2 a year.\nLearn more about how protecting whales could help combat climate change\nImage Bowhead whale and calf swimming in the ocean close to sea ice. Credit: NOAA Fisheries\n9. Whale poop is powerful!\nIn fact, one study found that whale poop acts as a natural \"nutrient pump\" for enriching rainforests. The whale poop gives nutrients to the plankton, which are microscopic organisms that then become food for smaller fish. These organisms are then eaten by seabirds which deposit their own poop on land or may feed larger migratory birds. The nutrients from this system also reach to the rainforest and land if the animals that contain them are eaten by predators from the land, such as birds or cats. These ocean nutrients are important for massive biomes like the Amazon.\nLearn more about about the power of whale poop\n10. Whales and dolphins were once land mammals before they evolved into the ocean-going mammals we see today.\nJust like humans, some dolphin species have hair, called lanugo, on their bodies shortly after birth. This hair is later shed.\nWhales and dolphins still need to breathe air, so how do they sleep underwater? In what is called unihemispheric sleep, they only rest half of their brain while the other half stays awake to breathe. Also, most whale and dolphin respiratory and digestive tracts are completely separate, so they don't get water in their lungs when feeding underwater.\n11. Whales and dolphins can be very creative hunters and some even use tools!\nKiller whales have been observed using their large size and speed to create waves that can knock seals off ice floes and into the water. Humpback whales use a technique called \"bubble net feeding\" to corral plankton and small fish near the surface of the water where they can easily catch them in one gulp. Bottlenose dolphins use a similar technique called \"mud-ring feeding,\" where they stir up a plume of mud with their tail causing fish to jump out of the water into the mouths of waiting dolphins. One case of cetacean tool use involves a subset (approximately 5 percent) of the population of bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia. These dolphins tear basket sponges from the seabed and wear them over their beaks for protection while foraging along the seafloor."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "5 interesting facts about dolphin - 5 Interesting Facts", "url": "https://5interestingfacts.com/animal/5-interesting-facts-about-dolphin/", "text": "Dolphin is referred to as water mammals in the order called cetacea. The dolphin families include oceanic dolphins(Delphinidae), modern world river dolphins( inside), brackish dolphins ( pontoporiidae), Chinese or baiji dolphins ( Leporidae), and Indian river dolphins(platanistidae). These mammals range from the length of 5.6ft, 110lb like Maui dolphin to 31ft, 11 tons such as killer whale. Additionally, male dolphins have large bodies compared to female ones since they experience sexual dimorphism. Dolphins have a streamlined type of body and two limbs, which are in the form of flippers.\nHowever, they are not more flexible as seals and travel 55km at 34.4mph. Their teeth are shaped in the form of conical for capturing prey. Moreover, they have a great sense of hearing that is adapted to water and air; thus, they can still survive in case they become blind. Most species of dolphins prefer to liv on warm water like tropic zones while others like right whale dolphins love cold climate.\n1. Dolphins stay on the surface while sleeping\nDolphins have a different method to sleep that is different from human beings. Humans have long unconscious sleep of not knowing what is happening in their surroundings. Dolphins have to remain conscious when sleeping. They frequently rest motionless on the water surface when sleeping. Besides, they can swim slowly to the surface or shallow water in order to breathe.\n2. They do not use teeth to eat\nToothed dolphins, including whales, are carnivores. They feed on various fish, octopuses, shrimps, squid, and jellyfish. Dolphins\u2019 species have different types of creatures and fish that they feed. Moreover, the biggest dolphin species known as orcas can feed on mammals and sea birds, including whales, sea lions, and whales. They have 100 teeth but do not use them to eat because they lack chewing muscles. For this reason, they swallow the prey instead of eating.\n3. Dolphin killers were punished\nAncient Greece was a civilization that belonged to the Greek history period from the dark ages of Greece to the end of antiquity. After the period, it was followed by the byzantine era and early middle age. Greek had classical cultures and philosophies that influenced ancient Rome. One of the cultures included the protection of sacred fish like a dolphin. In ancient Greece, people who killed dolphins were punished through death. The Greeks considered dolphins as hieros ichthys.\n4. Breathing is not automatic\nDolphins do not have automatic breathing responses like human beings who continuously breathe even if they are unconscious or asleep. For this reason, dolphins control their breathing consciously. This means that they need to decide actively when to breathe. They can suffocate or drown in case they sleep unconsciously. Therefore, they allow the half brain to sleep while the other part stays alert to check dangers in the water. Dolphins close the right eye when sleeping, the other eye closed after half right brain is asleep and vice vasa. This is known as unihemispheric sleep as part of brain sleep as the other is active.\n5. They have names\nDolphins are one of the interesting animals and fascinate us with super-intelligent behaviors. They are one of the living organisms that live extraordinary lives, and you can compare their lifestyle to humans. For instance, scientific research shows that dolphins have given themselves names. These animals develop self-whistle for recognition. The whistle and dolphin names can still be recognized even if it changes."}

If the dolphin population in a river is thriving, then the overall state of that fresh water system is also likely flourishing. But if that population is on the decline, then it\u2019s considered a red flag for the ecosystem as a whole.\nWWF is the only organization working to safeguard all river dolphin species across the world. Under our River Dolphins Initiative, WWF collaborates with governments, communities, and other partners in countries with river dolphin populations to change policies and practices, address direct threats to the species such as bycatch and infrastructure, protect habitats, and bolster scientific research.\nHere\u2019s a look at river dolphins around the world, the challenges they face, and what WWF is doing to keep them around for the long haul."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphin Reproduction | Dolphins World", "url": "https://www.dolphins-world.com/dolphin-reproduction/", "text": "Dolphin Reproduction\nHOW TO BECOME A DOLPHIN AND NOT DIE IN THE ATTEMPT?\nThe reproductive habits of dolphins are not defined exclusively by the need to perpetuate the species. Like humans, these cetaceans mate for pleasure with individuals of the opposite sex, of the same genus or even a different species to their own, so talking about reproductive habits in strict terms does not apply to dolphins. Some researchers think that their recreational sexuality has social purposes.\nWhen mating with the intention to produce offspring, their habits are varied. The age of sexual maturity depends on the geographical region they inhabit, the genus and the species, but most dolphins reach sexual maturity between five and eight years of age. Males take longer and can be sexually mature at the age of 11. Occasionally they begin to have sexual contact before they can reproduce.\nNow, how do dolphins breed?\nMost dolphins reach sexual maturity between 5 and eight years of age.\n1. CONDITIONS.\nBefore copulation, the necessary conditions must exist to take place. Sometimes sexual maturity is not relevant, but so is the receptivity of females. The mating season of bottlenose dolphins and other species lasts during the whole year although in some areas of the world more sexual contact may occur during the spring and autumn months.\nThe age of maturity for dolphins varies significantly among species. For females, the age can range from 5 to 13 and for males, it is often much later with the range being from 9 to 14 years of age.\nFemales can be receptive during the 365 days fo the year, and like males, they have several partners in the same season. Dolphins are not very direct; this means that before mating they strive to get the attention of the opposite sex by manifesting a well-identified courting process.\nThey can begin the contact by chasing each other and giving very soft bites to the partner. His eyes take on a languid look, and the dominant individual floats softly under the body of the passive dolphin. At the moment before the mating, the male touches the female and after that, they mate joining their bellies. However, other species are aggressive and bite or scratch their partner.\nThe act is brief and lasts for a few seconds although it can be repeated several times in a short time interval.\nMales can be very aggressive towards each other when it comes to the right to mate. They make sounds to warn each other off, and they may collide their bodies against each other. The use of the fluke is very common when it comes to males trying to show their strength.\nThe males can be very aggressive with females that aren\u2019t very responsive to the advances, but if she is receptive to the male, then he seems to be more relaxed. There can be plenty of touching and interacting with a pair of dolphins before mating takes place. The pair will likely engage in mating several times over a period of a few days.\n2. BABY ON BOARD.\nThe pregnant female has a gestation period according to its species. The most usual time is between 11 and 12 months. Incredibly, the gestation of an orca lasts about 17 months, more or less. For all other species, it is in that given range, and even location can play a role in when the offspring will be born. In some regions, the birth period coincides with the nurturing season for the calves.\nIt is very rare for twins to be born, but there are a few cases. Almost all births though are singles, and it is quite an amazing experience.\n3. NEXT TO MOM.\nWhen a female feels she will deliver her calf, she tends to move away from her pod and separates herself to an area near the water surface to facilitate the first breath of her calf.\nThey usually have one offspring, and the first thing that comes out of the mother\u2019s body is the dolphin\u2019s tail. A calf is born measuring between 90 and 120 centimeters and weighing approximately 18 kilograms. Immediately the mother pushes her baby to the surface to obtain oxygen.\nThe newborn has dark skin and lighter bands that run through his torso called fetal bands that disappear after several weeks. Both the dorsal fin and the pectoral flippers are very soft but harden over time; The dorsal fin stiffens a few hours after birth.\nThe young can weigh 23 to 65 pounds at birth. They will consume milk from their mother for one year to 3 years being introduced to fish and squid though when they are around four months of age. The fat in the mother\u2019s milk helps them to grow very quickly.\nThe calves are coordinated to swim, they have their eyes open, and their senses are fully alert.\nAt the same time, other dolphins of the pod keep close to the offspring and the mother. When the pod is in movement, the young are at the center of it, with protection all around to help them have the best chance of survival.\n4.- A LONG LIFE.\nDolphins can stay up to 4-8 years with their mother.\nThe behavior of females with their offspring is different according to each mother. Some are comfortable allowing their calf swimming almost freely, but others are more \u201coverprotective.\u201d Very much like human mothers. If a child is healthy the mother is calm, and her behavior is normal, but if her offspring have health problems, she behaves abnormally.\nDuring the first days of life, a baby is nursed every 20 minutes during the 24 hours and usually follows its mother when swimming. Breastfeeding lasts for 2-3 years, but Dolphins can stay up to 4-8 years with their mother, often helped by some other female.\nAfter being fully weaned, the males will leave the pod and join another one while the females may live in the same pod as their mother for their entire life.\nA mature dolphin will usually only have one calf every 3 to 6 years. This slow rate of reproduction is one of the common problems that makes it hard to increase the numbers of any species of dolphin.\nDolphins can have a long life under natural conditions. According to the species, its longevity is between 20 and 80-90 years.\nReferences\nSlooten, Elisabeth. Age, growth, and reproduction in Hector\u2019s dolphins.

A new study suggests that dolphins may be much more skilled at maths than people ever thought possible.\nThe study was inspired when the lead author watched Discovery channels \u201cBlue Planet\u201d. He noticed that dolphins were blowing tiny bubbles around their prey as they hunted.\nThe author became hooked as he knew that sonar made by man would not operate in the water the dolphins were in.\nHe said that by blowing the bubbles the dolphins were either blinding their most spectacular sensory apparatus or they possess a sonar that can do that what human sonar can\u2019t.\nThe math involved relies upon sending out pulses that vary in amplitude. The first pulse may have a value that is 1 and the second\u2019s amplitude may be 1/3 of the first.\nProvided a dolphin remembers the ratios of the 2 pulses and can then multiply the second by that and add these 2 echoes together the fish will become \u2018visible\u2019 to the sonar.\nIt was then worked out by the author that there must be a second part of this hunt. Bubbles can cause false alarms because they scatter. Dolphins can\u2019t afford to send out false alarms and waste their energy while the real fish escape.\nThe second stage was found to involve subtracting the echoes from one another, ensuring that the second pulse is multiplied by three. This process is short and the fish is visible to sonar via addition.\nQuestions still need to be answered but what the author has shown is that it is not impossible to distinguish a target in bubbly water using pulses like dolphins do.\nIf the sonar model is replicated this may provide large benefits for humans. The sonar may be able to detect covert circuitry and help detect sea mines."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphin Fun Facts for Kids - Animals A to Z for Kids", "url": "https://www.animalsatozforkids.com/dolphin/", "text": "Dolphin Introduction:\nThe term common dolphin tends to refer to the short-beaked common dolphin and the long-beaked common dolphin that are found in warmer seas worldwide. The common dolphin is generally found around the Mediterranean Sea but are also commonly seen in deep offshore waters and to a lesser extent over continental shelves that are preferred to shallower waters.\nSome populations of dolphin may be present all year round, others appear to move in a migratory pattern. Common dolphins travel in groups of around 10-50 in number and frequently gather into schools numbering 100 to 2000 individuals.\nThese schools are generally very active socially with groups often surfacing, jumping and splashing together. Typical dolphin behavior includes breaching, tail-slapping, chin-slapping, bow-riding and proposing.\nCommon dolphins are among the fastest swimming marine mammals, with some possibly reaching speeds of over 40 km/h. Dolphins have been known to use both their speed and large group sizes to develop different ways of hunting prey.\nDolphins range in size from the 1.7 m (5.6 ft) long and 50 kg (110lb) Maui\u2019s dolphin to the 9.5 m (31 ft) and 10 t (11 short tons) Killer Whale. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the males are larger than females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers.\nThough not quite as flexible as seals, some dolphins can travel at 55.5 km/h (34.5 mph). Dolphins use their conical shaped teeth to capture fast moving prey.\nThey have well-developed hearing which is adapted for both air and water and is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water."}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "meet the different species - Whale & Dolphin Conservation USA", "url": "https://us.whales.org/whales-dolphins/dolphins/", "text": "There are four dolphin species and four families that are grouped together as the true river dolphins. The South Asian river-dolphin is known as the Ganges river dolphin or susu in India and Nepal, the shushuk in Bangladesh and the Indus river dolphin or bhulan in Pakistan; the Amazon river dolphin, known in South American countries locally as boto, bufeo or Inia; the franciscana; and the Yangtze river dolphin, known as baiji in China but now extinct (this was announced by scientists in 2007).\nThe ancestors of river dolphins were marine, but river dolphins look quite different from their modern day ocean relatives. This is because river dolphins look like early or primitive marine dolphins; they have slender beaks with numerous teeth, small eyes, flexible necks and bodies, pronounced forehead melons, large flippers and undeveloped dorsal fins.\nDespite sharing many similarities, the river dolphin species live in geographically separate river systems around the world and they are not thought to be closely related to one another. They were separated geographically from one another and have evolved independently for millions of years. Their shared looks are simply down to them all evolving to live in river environments.\nOne species, the franciscana, is considered a river dolphin, although they live in large estuaries and along the coast of Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil. The franciscana is closely related to the Amazon River dolphin and their ancestors are thought to have lived in rivers.\nThe modern river dolphins now only survive in South America and Asia. Botos live in the Amazon and Orinoco river systems and flooded rainforests of South America. Asian river dolphins live in two separate river systems \u2013 the Ganges of Nepal, India and Bangladesh and the Indus of Pakistan. The pink Amazon River dolphin or boto is the best-known river dolphin. In terms of numbers, the boto is the healthiest of the river dolphins mainly because the Amazon has not yet been exploited by humans to the same extreme levels as Asian rivers. However, this situation is rapidly changing as human populations grow and transform rivers for their own needs.\nRiver dolphins are among the most seriously endangered of all dolphins because they live in space-limiting freshwater river systems, amongst millions of people who compete for the same natural resources. Unfortunately the future prospects for river dolphins are likely to worsen as threats to them and destruction of their habitats continue to increase."}

Thus, the dolphins were thought to be monogamous, but recent studies have discovered facts, indicating other types of mating behavior in this species. Males of these dolphins are noticeably larger than females. They display extremely aggressive behavior: because of biting and abrasion, male dolphins often damage their fins, flukes, and blowholes. On the other hand, tooth-raking leads to scarring. The reason of this behavior can be tough competition for mating rights, which brings us to polygynous mating system. In the meantime, they are likely to practice polyandry and polygynandry - a mating system, where both males and females have a number of mates. The breeding period occurs in October - November, while the gestation period lasts approximately 11 months. The female dolphin normally yields a single baby with an interval of up to 5 years. As soon as the baby is born, the mother immediately helps the youngster to come to the water surface for air. The calf is nursed by its mother for about a year after birth, becoming independent within 2 - 3 years. Male dolphins are ready to mate at 7-12 years old, whereas females - earlier - at 6-10 years old."}

Dolphins can be found all over the world and they are closely related to whales. If your children love animals, sea animals, to be precise, they will love to learn about dolphins. In this article, we\u2019ve covered some interesting facts about dolphins. Read these facts and tell them to your kids!\nFun Facts About Dolphins for Children\nDespite the fact that this adorable ocean animal is popular among kids as well as adults, there are many facts that many people may not know about dolphins. Here are some exciting and entertaining dolphin facts for kids that will make your kids love these sea animals even more.\n1. Dolphins are extremely intelligent.\nDolphins are extremely intelligent. Apparently, dolphins are as smart as apes, and the evolution of their brains is very similar to that of humans. Dolphins can recognize themselves in the mirror, and after humans, dolphins are considered the second most intelligent mammals on the planet.\n2. Dolphins are found all around the world.\nThese stunning animals are found in almost all parts of the world, which includes oceans, estuarine, coastal and freshwater, and in temperatures that can range from 0 degrees Celsius to 30 degrees Celsius. Though most species are confined to coastal, temperate and tropical oceans, there are around five species of dolphins that are found in freshwater rivers.\n3. Dolphins are highly social.\nDolphins live and travel in groups knows as pods. They also hunt and play together. Some large groups, also known as \u2018Super pods\u2019, can have as many as 1000 dolphins in them. Scientists have observed that dolphins address each other with names, which is characterized by individual whistles or sounds. They also use various kinds of sounds such as clicks, moans, groans, barks, squawks, etc. to communicate with each other.\n4. There are more than 40 species of dolphins.\nThere are more than 40 species of dolphins found all over the world. Though most of these species survive in salt water, some species of dolphins can also survive in freshwater. Where some of the largest species of dolphins can be 30 feet in length, the smallest ones are just 3 to 4 feet long. The bottlenose is the most common dolphin species found in most parts of the world, except the Arctic and Antarctic oceans. The killer whales are the largest species of dolphins.\n5. Dolphins are great divers.\nWhen it comes to swimming, dolphins are considered fairly slow swimmers and they usually swim at a speed of 2 mph; however, they can swim up to 30 mph for brief durations. But dolphins are great divers and can dive more than 1000 feet deep underwater.\n6. Dolphins stick with their mothers for a long time.\nBaby dolphins or calves stick with their mothers for 4 to 8 years after birth. Mama dolphins also sing to their unborn babies according to research. The research further supports that these songs are whistles that dolphins teach to their unborn babies. Whistles hold a great significance in the dolphin world as the individual whistle is associated with each dolphin\u2019s identity.\n7. Bottlenose dolphins can live up to 40 years.\nAlthough a dolphin\u2019s lifespan depends on its individual species, however, most species of dolphins live between 15 to 16 years of age. But bottlenose dolphins can live up to 40 years of age.\n8. Dolphins are carnivores.\nDolphins are carnivores, which makes them active predators. They eat wide varieties of food that can vary from their geographic location, and they also have preferences for certain kinds of foods. However, majorly dolphins prefer eating fish, squids, shrimps, and other such water animals. Dolphins also have two stomachs; one is used for storing the food consumed and the other stomach is used for digesting the food. They have an array of teeth, but dolphins only use them for catching their prey. They do not chew their food but swallow it whole.\n9. Dolphins sleep with one eye open.\nOne of the interesting facts about dolphins is that these sea mammals sleep with their one eye open. This happens because their brain sleeps in shifts, which means their eight hours of sleep is covered in two shifts of four hours each that is covered by both sides of the brain simultaneously. The awake side of the brain stays active and helps the dolphin from drowning and being aware of predators and that side of the eye also stays open.\n10. A dolphin\u2019s skin can regenerate every two hours.\nA dolphin\u2019s skin plays a crucial part in its underwater movement. The rubbery and smooth skin of bottlenose dolphins regenerates every two hours. The old cells get flaked and peeled by giving room to new skin cells. This happens to keep the dolphin\u2019s skin smooth, which proves to be helpful in swimming and diving underwater. This skin regeneration in dolphins is almost nine times faster than in the human body.\n11. Dolphins have an amazing memory.\nAnother piece of great information about dolphins for children is that when it comes to having a long-lasting memory, dolphins lead, hands down. Chimpanzees and elephants have been reported to have great memories too, however, when it comes to dolphins, both these mammals do not even come close.\n12. Dolphins are conscious breathers.\nBreathing in and out is something that comes naturally to most mammals. However, that is not the case with dolphins. Dolphins have to make conscious efforts when it comes to breathing. They make active decisions about inhalation and exhalation and they have to be fully aware of the blowhole, which needs to be above the surface of the water for inhalation to happen. Dolphins can inhale as much as eight gallons of air in a single second and exhale around 34 gallons of air, which is approximately three times faster as compared to humans. This inhalation speed allows the dolphins to replace 95 per cent of the air in their lungs in just one breath.\nDolphins are one of the most adorable animals on our planet, and they are loved by both kids and adults. We hope that the facts listed above will get your kids excited and in awe of these splendid creatures. Do share them with your children and encourage them to learn more about dolphins and other animals!\nAlso Read:\nStarfish Facts for Children\nBlue Whale Facts for Children\nJellyfish Facts for Children"}

The dorsal fin of the baiji is low and triangular and the flippers are broad and rounded. The dorsal portion of the body is gray with whitish streaks from the ventral area extending into the face and head region.\nFemale: Females are slightly larger than males. Size Male: maximum 2.29 m (7 ft. 6 in.)\nFemale: maximum 2.53 m (8 ft. 4 in.) Weight Male: 130 kg (290 lbs.)\nFemale: 170 kg (370 lbs.) larger individuals may weigh up to 227 kg (500 lbs.). Diet Small fish;will feed on fish at surface and along bottom. Gestation 10 to 11 months. The interbirth interval is 2 years. There is a single young at birth. Sexual Maturity More than 6 years in females; approximately 4 years in males Life Span Based on dentition, a wild individual was estimated to have lived 24 years. Range Currently only found in the Yangtze River of China. Historically, the Baiji was also found in Dongting and Poyang Lakes. Habitat Freshwater riverine habitat Population Before 1900, there was a population around 3,000 to 5,000 individuals. Now there may be less than 10 and possibly extinct. Status IUCN: Critically Endangered (possibly extinct)\nCITES: Appendix I\nUSFWS: Endangered\nFun Facts\nScientists have placed the baiji in the family Platanistidae, the river dolphin family. Four other species of river dolphins also are in this family. They are:\n- boto (Amazon river dolphin) Inia geoffrensis, South America\n- franciscana (La Plata river dolphin) Pontoporia blainvillei, South America\n- Ganges susu (Ganges river dolphin) Platanista gangetica, India\n- Indus susu (Indus river dolphin) Platanista minor, Pakistan Baiji is a Chinese word meaning \"a white dolphin.\" This species is one of the most endangered cetaceans in the world, with a population numbering in the tens or fewer. Females are slightly larger than males.\nEcology and Conservation\nLittle is known about a river dolphin's natural history. However, several species are in danger of extinction. Threats to river dolphin populations include pollution, subsistence hunting, industrial development, dam construction, riverbank deforestation, over fishing, and incidental capture in commercial fisheries.\nWhy is the baiji endangered? Varying water levels in the Yangtze River due to industrial development have limited available habitat. Over fishing has decreased the baiji's food supply. Pollution harms both the dolphins and their prey. Baiji may be injured or killed by explosions during construction, and by boat propellers.\nBaiji may also be caught and killed by illegal fishing devices called rolling hooks. These long, braided lines with numerous sharp hooks are meant to catch fishes. However, baiji also may become ensnared in the mass of hooks. Others become entangled in stake net traps.\nThe baiji has been protected by China since 1975. Chinese biologists began devising a protection strategy in 1986.By establishing reserve sites along the Yangtze River, scientists are hopeful that the species can be saved. The Baiji has been listed as Critically Endangered since 2006 and the population is still declining and may be extinct.\nBibliography\nJefferson, T.J. Leatherwood, S. and M.A. Webber.

Why are they so special? We have recently visited the Amazon regions where we spent a week in the rainforest near Manaus. Another week traveling upstream by a freight ferry, and a couple of days in Tabatinga and Leticia near the three-country border. During these times, we have the opportunity to see pink dolphins several times. On one occasion we went swimming with them too (something we wouldn\u2019t have done if we know the program in more detail).\nWe have read a lot about these freshwater dolphins (they are also called Amazon River dolphins), so we collected the most interesting facts about the pink dolphins for you!\n12 Pink Dolphin Facts\nThe largest sweetwater dolphins\nThe Amazon River Dolphins are the largest and most widespread freshwater dolphins in the World.\nThe pink dolphins live in Amazonia\nThat\u2019s why they are also callee Amazon River dolphins. They live in several countries where the Amazon basin and Orinoco basin spreads. Although the most significant part is in Brazil, it\u2019s not the only country where these pink dolphins live. You can see them in Bolivia, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, as well.\nThey are heavy and long\nThe adult river dolphins can easily reach 185 kilograms (408 pounds) and 2.5 m (8.2 ft) in length.\nThe biggest brain of all dolphins\nNot only their body is large, their brain as well.\nThey are pink-grey colored\nAlthough they are called pink river dolphins, their color varies between the shades of pink and grey in reality.\nTheir head turns upside down\nThe Sweetwater dolphins can turn their heads 180 degrees. It is a tremendous evolutionary benefit as this way, and they maneuver better in the water.\n30-year long lifespan (when they are free)\nIn nature, they live up to 30 years, but in captivity, unfortunately, their average lifespan doesn\u2019t reach two years. This difference is massive and a strong reason for letting them live in their natural habitat.\nCalves are born between July and September\nThe baby dolphins are born during the dry season of the Amazon rainforest.\nThey have 130 teeth\nThe Amazon Dolphins have 130 teeth. They are rather small and sharp.\nThey are slow swimmers\nThe Amazon pink dolphins swim slowly. Their average is only 1.5 to 3.2 km/h (0.93 to 1.99 mph), which means you walk faster during a leisure stroll.\nThey love serenity\nThe pink dolphins often live alone or in small groups of 2 to 4. Most of the time, we saw them swimming in pairs.\nTheir skin is valuable leather\nUnfortunately, their skin is used for clothing and other leisure purposes. It is a valuable and unique leather.\nWhere to see pink dolphins?\nAs we discussed in the quick dolphin\u2019s facts part, they live in numerous countries, but it doesn\u2019t mean you have the same opportunity to observe them in all locations. Let\u2019s see the three countries where you have the most significant chance to see pink dolphins in nature.\nPink dolphins Brazil\nMost of the pink river dolphins live in Brazil, but they are in the less inhabited areas. You have the best chance to see them around Manaus or near Tabatinga, close to the Peruvian and Colombian border. Still, you can find them everywhere in the Amazon and Orinoco river basins. We saw them near Manaus several times and from the freight ship while going from Manaus to Tabatinga.\nPink dolphins Peru\nIn Peru, The Pink dolphins also live in the Amazon River basin. Some of the best places to see them are Iquitos, the Pacaya-Samiria Reserve, and the Upper Amazon River (for example, near Santa Rosa).\nPink dolphins in Colombia\nThe Colombian Amazon is the area you should head to see the pink dolphins in nature. Leticia is one of the more significant settlements there; they even had a pink river dolphin statue!\nThe pink dolphins are also popular here, not only around Manaus.\nThese animals are particular unique creatures \u2013 similar to everything else that lives in the Amazon region. If you want to visit the area and see them with your own eyes, make sure you do your research before so that you don\u2019t end up on a disappointing swim with pink dolphins tour, as we did. There are millions of amazing adventures that you can have in the rainforest, so be smart and observe these creatures when they are free.\nTravel Resources There is nothing better than a relaxed holiday.

It inhabits South America, mainly in the Amazon river, but also in the Orinoco basin and Madeira river.\nSo, what actually is a Pink Dolphin?\nPink dolphins (Inia geoffrensis) are a species of Toothed whales classified in the family Iniidae and it contains three sub-species: Amazon river dolphin (I. g. geoffrensis), Bolivian river dolphin (I. g. boliviensis) and Orinoco river dolphin (I. g. humboldtiana).\nThey seem to have some relationship with their South Asian counterparts, the Ganges river dolphin (P. g. gangetica), predominant in India, and Indus river dolphin (P. g. minor), predominant in Pakistan. The pink dolphin is the biggest of all river dolphins.\nHow does a Pink Dolphin look? Can you show me one?\nWith the adult males reaching an average length of 2.3 metres (7.6 ft) and an average weight of 150 kilograms (340 lb), and the females reaching a length and weight of 2 metres (6.6 ft) and average 100 kilograms (220 lb), they will not pass unseen by your side if you are navigating in their habitat. In contrast with other cetaceans, in this case, the male is bigger than the female.\nTheir cervical vertebrae are not fused, allowing the head to turn 90 degrees to each side. This, in conjunction with large pectoral fins, gives them very good maneuverability to swim through the flooded forest searching for their prey. You can see the way they swim and move in this video put up by National Geographic.\nIn his head we found quite a few interesting things, so for the ones of you digging this article for your homework, keep reading!\nThey have small eyes, but good eyesight, in and out of the water. Between 25-28 pairs of teeth to each side of both jaws helps them capture fish, tortoises or crabs. It is curious tho, that they are the only toothed whales to have different types of teeth in their jaw. And finally, the melon on their heads, which they can modify by muscular control for using it as a Biosonar (or Animal echolocator)\nAre Pink Dolphins really Pink?\nDepends. The color of their bodies varies with age. Young dolphins have a dark gray color, which in adolescence transforms into light gray. Adults can display a range of colors from light gray to pink (varying from solid to mottled) and even brownish.\nIt is not entirely clear why they have this color but one of the strongest hypothesis says it\u2019s due to the repeated abrasion of the skin surface. Some observations correlate with this theory, for example, that males tend to be pinker than females (they fight more between them, displaying intra-species aggression). Another hypothesis, like the one of Tim Caro, mammal coloration expert from the University of California at Davis, says that this coloration could be to match the particulate red mud that follows heavy rains in some rivers.\nAll in all, no one knows for sure why.\nWhat do Pink Dolphins eat?\nBasically, pink dolphins eat almost anything small that swims. They eat around 50 species of Amazon fishes, including piranhas. Turtles and crabs are also on the daily diet which consists of around 2.5% of its body weight every day.\nPink dolphins have a powerful jaw. The front row of teeth helps to puncture and to hold fishes (or other preys). The back row is for crushing and smashing.\nAfter they catch their food pink dolphins swallow their food without chewing. All indigestible parts (like bones or spines) are regurgitated after.\nAre Pink Dolphins smart?\nWe might have heard that dolphins are very smart animals, but what kind of intelligence do they have?\nThe answer is Cetacean intelligence.\nThey are aware of themselves and their different body parts, are able to experience basic emotions, engage themselves in some degree of abstract thought and understand the structure of their environment. They learn by observing and even mimicking, solve problems and choose their own actions, even remembering their own recent behavior.\nWhen interacting with humans, they appear to recognize the difference between children and adults and tend to be more gentle and patient with children. Some researchers suggest that dolphins are \u201cnon-human persons\u201d who qualify for moral understanding as individuals.\nThere are no specific studies related to Pink dolphins and their intelligence, but being part of the same family we can suppose that they share most of their cognitive system.\nFor more in-depth information about the brain power of dolphins (and whales) click here\nAre Pink Dolphins threatened or endangered now?\nYes, they are threatened by many factors such as the contamination of the river (with mercury, for example, by the illegal mining operations) and the increased deforestation of the Amazon jungle that affects many different ecosystems changing the migration patterns of some fish species that they eat.\nBut the main threat to them is the hunting and deliberate killing along with their incidental capture in fishing gears. A big part of the income of riverside families that live in the Amazon is the fishing activity, and dolphins are prone to damage fishing equipment when they get entangled in it or when they want to eat the fish from the nets. They are also used in the Catfish or Piracatinga, (Calophysus macropterus) fishery as bait, and the increasing demand for the piracatinga has created a market for distribution of dolphin carcasses.\nSome efforts in favor of their protection are being made. Precautionary measures are one of those efforts, through good fishing practices taken together by fisheries managers and fishermen to start developing multiple-species management and ensure sustainable practices.\nAnother measure is law enforcement, as the one put by IBAMA that prohibits killing the Amazon river dolphin (but fails to compensate the fishermen for the damage done to their equipment and catch), or the one made in year 2012 by the President of Bolivia, Evo Morales putting up a law that bans fishing freshwater pink dolphins and declares the species a National Treasure.\nAnd what about their Conservation Status?\nThe species is listed in Appendix II of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora).\nIt means that pink dolphins (along with other 21.000 species) are not necessarily threatened with extinction, but may become so unless a strict regulation is enforced in order to protect the survival of the species in the wild.\nIt is also listed in Appendix II of CMS meaning that they would significantly benefit from international co-operation regarding their conservation.\nThe Conservation Status is a classification system that shows if a species still exists or how likely it is to become extinct in the near future.\nThe Pink dolphin is classified as Threatened (between Endangered and Vulnerable, due to lack of actual data)\nAll in all, the current situation for the Pink Dolphin is worrying, with a high to very-high risk of extinction, more coordinated efforts are still needed for their preservation.\nOther facts about Pink Dolphins\nThe Boto or pink dolphin is subject to a particular Amazon mythology . It is said that this freshwater dolphin turns itself into a handsome man when the sun goes down . Some say it morphs itself fully clothed in white, some say with a straw hat, and some other people say it takes the form of some other man from nearby villages. What for? To hypnotize and seduce unsuspecting your woman , impregnate them, and return to the river before the sun goes up to turn back into pink dolphins. This is one of the most widespread Amazon rainforest myths, and some Amazon villagers attribute many of the single mom kids to this Amazon river dolphin. They even tell young girls to be careful about strangers and keep away from the river at night.\n. It is said that this freshwater dolphin .

After birth, it takes between 2-3 years for young pink dolphins to be considered independent and adults .\n. Last, but not least, pink dolphins are real.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphin Anatomy | Dolphins World", "url": "https://www.dolphins-world.com/dolphin-anatomy/", "text": "Dolphin Physical Characteristics\nThe overall anatomy of the dolphin is designed to survive in the water. All dolphins have similar anatomical and morphological characteristics; this means that all species have some features that do not differ widely between species.\nObviously, there are differences in skin color, shape, size and weight but it is relatively easy to recognize that a particular animal observed is a dolphin. However, it is common to confuse porpoises with dolphins, and this is because their external appearance is very similar and both are cetaceans closely related. The difference is that porpoises are smaller animals and have rounder snouts than dolphins.\nTheir size can range from one extreme to the next. Some of the smaller ones are about 4 feet in length, and others measure as long as 30 feet. Some of them weigh about 90 pounds while others tip the scale around 11 tons.\nThe coloring of dolphins is mainly grayish blue, brownish or black and white. They have a very sensitive skin, which can get easily harmed if hit by rough surfaces. However, they can recover pretty fast from severe injuries, including shark bites because they have a rapid healing process even for deep wounds.\nTheir skin feels like rubber, and they don\u2019t have any sweat glands. Part of this though could be due to the thickness of the skin of a dolphin. The epidermis, which is the outer layer of skin, is from 10 to 20 times thicker than that of other terrestrial mammals. The skin will peel and flake off for new skin cells to replace the older ones.\nDolphins have a streamlined body designed to swim very fast, even for extended periods of time. The tail of a dolphin has two parts called flukes, and they use them to propel their body through the water, using their pectoral flippers to swim in a given direction.\nDolphins have a blowhole at the top of their head, and they must come to the surface for air. Some of them need to breathe several times a minute, and some species only have to get air twice per hour. They also have a large brain, the second largest for mammals in comparison to their body size, only after humans. Their brain is very complex, and research shows it to be more advanced than that of other animals.\nWhat anatomical features characterize a dolphin? Let\u2019s see:\nGENERAL FEATURES\n\u2013 Weight and size.\nDolphins vary in weight and size. There are small species as the Maui dolphin, which measures on average 1.7 meters in length and weighs about 50 kilograms, and there are large species that reach 5 to 8 meters in length like the Orca (Orcinus orca) which, by the way, is the largest and heaviest extant dolphin.\n\u2013 Skin color.\nThe skin of dolphins feels soft to the touch although it has a thick epidermis covered with a thin layer of cornified cells. Despite this, it is extremely sensitive due to a large number of nerve endings it has on the exterior. Given this fragility, it damages very easy with any contact of a rough surface and even human fingernails, but if this happens, the healing process is fast and develops a dark scar in the tissue, which later turns white.\nBeneath the skin, there is a thick layer of fat that dolphins use as an energy reserve in periods of food shortage, as an insulation to prevent heat loss in cold environments and as a resource that helps maintain the hydrodynamic shape of their body.\nMost species have a gray or bluish color on the dorsal area and white or light gray in the ventral area. This coloration is particularly useful for camouflage because if you see a dolphin from above, its dark skin is confused with the ocean floor while when seeing it from below, the color of its belly is similar to the ocean surface, brightened by the sunlight.\nHowever, not all species have the same color pattern described above. The Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis) has a pink color on its skin, therefore is known as the \u201cpink dolphin.\u201d Also, some species have stripes or spots of different sizes, colors, and shapes.\nSkeleton.\nThe bone structure of dolphins is lighter than that of terrestrial mammals as it has to withstand less weight in the water. Dolphins have an adjustable rib cage, thanks to which they can swim in low-pressure environments without suffering damage. The neck is rather short because the seven cervical vertebrae are fused together.\nThe skeleton still retains vestiges of a terrestrial life, like a pair of floating bones under the backbone that should have been a pelvis.\nOn the other hand, the body of the dolphins is fusiform and hydrodynamic, perfectly adapted to life in the water. It has three main parts, head, trunk and tail, which include other elements.\nHead\nBrain.\nThe brain of these cetaceans is large, and its mass is slightly greater than that of humans. It is 15-60 times bigger than the brain of a shark of similar size.\nEyes.\nLocated on each side of the head, they provide a broad field of view and are very sensitive despite the inability to identify colors. They can move independently of one another, but they are not able to look directly up or down.\nEars.\nDolphins do not have external ears, but they have small openings behind the eyes, which lead to an ear canal.\nBlowhole.\nIt is the orifice located at the top of the head that serves to breathe and to make sounds. It has a kind of muscular membrane that prevents water from entering the body when the dolphin is submerged.\nMelon.\nIt is a spherical organ located in front of the skull, used for echolocation. The rounded shape of this mass of adipose tissue is what gives dolphins the shape of their forehead.\nMouth.\nLocated in the front area of \u200b\u200bthe head, it has several teeth whose number varies according to the species, but they are around 80-100. The jaws are elongated and play a significant role in the sensory system of the dolphin.\nTrunk\nDorsal fin.\nIt is on the top of the dolphin; they only have one dorsal fin that gives them stability when swimming, preventing them from spinning involuntarily in the water. There are a couple of species that lack this dorsal fin.\nFlippers.\nIn the lower part of their body, dolphins have two pectoral flippers which are curved, useful for directing and controlling movements and speed when swimming.\nLungs.\nLike all mammals, dolphins have lungs and breathe air. They are the organ of the respiratory system which process the air inhaled through the spiracle. Unlike humans that do it instinctively, dolphins breathe conscientiously.\nThe orca is the largest and heaviest dolphin.\nStomach.\nIt is just in the middle part of the body, and it has several sections.\nIntestines.\nJust as in other mammals, they serve to absorb nutrients from the food and remove the unused material from it.\nBladder.\nIt is nearly at the end of the trunk, and it is tiny.\nPost-anal hump.\nIt is a protuberance in the lower part of the body only found in adult males.\nGenitals.\nAlso in the inferior part of the body, the genitals of dolphins are hidden in slits. Males have two slits that conceal the penis and anus, while the females have only one that contains the vagina and anus, and two mammary slits on both sides of this one.\nTail\nPeduncle.\nIt is the narrow section that connects the flukes with the rest of the body.\nCaudal fin.\nThey function as a propellant when swimming. It moves from top to bottom and not from side to side as in the case of fish.\nFlukes.\nThey are the two sections of the caudal fin.\nOTHER ANATOMICAL ADAPTATIONS.\nSleeping.\nDolphins do sleep, but it may not appear that way when you observe them; This is because only one hemisphere of the brain will rest at a time. The other allows them to be alert for dangers and to reach the surface for breathing at regular intervals.\nAnother unique characteristic of the dolphin anatomy is that they don\u2019t have hair covering their body; They may be born with a few hairs, but they lose them soon after being born.\nReferences\nhttps://dolphins.org/anatomy\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0361923080902725\nCozzi, Huggenberger, Oelschl\u00e4ger.

As we celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day, we\u2019re shining a spotlight on one of the most unique and rarely seen dolphin species: the Amazon pink river dolphin. Yes, they are actually pink!\nIf you\u2019re looking to show the underwater world some more love for Valentine\u2019s Day this year, we invite you to join our global community of PADI Torchbearers working together to seek adventure and save the ocean. We care deeply about exploring and protecting the planet, above and below the surface. Join us in celebrating the incredible marine life that call this blue planet home \u2013 like the Amazon pink river dolphin.\nThey come in many shades of pink (and gray).\nThe Amazon pink river dolphin is obviously famous for its pink color. But, many don\u2019t know that it also comes in a variety of other shades. The dolphins actually start off gray when they are young, and slowly turn pink as they get older. Their final color can be influenced by their behavior, diet, capillary placement, and exposure to sunlight. They can be anywhere from mostly gray with some pink spots, to almost flamingo pink. The best part is, when this species of dolphin gets excited, they can flush bright pink, similar to humans blushing.\nThey have the largest bodies and brains of any freshwater dolphin.\nOut of the five freshwater species of dolphins, the Amazon pink river dolphin comes out on top. Measuring up to 9 feet (2.7 meters), and weighing up to 400 pounds (181 kilograms) \u2013 they are certainly massive. Living up to 30 years, they also have unusually large brains, with roughly 40% more brain capacity than humans.\nThey are more solitary than most other dolphins.\nThe Amazon pink river dolphin is often seen alone or in small groups of 2 \u2013 4 individuals. In some food-rich areas, or at the mouths of Amazonian rivers, they can sometimes be found in larger groups, but it\u2019s less common. Nevertheless, these dolphins are still incredibly curious and outgoing animals. They have even been known to be fairly interactive with humans in this region.\nThey are incredibly agile.\nUnlike other dolphins, these remarkably pink marine mammals have unfused vertebrae in their necks. This means that they have the ability to turn their heads 180 degrees. That way, they can maneuver around sunken tree trunks, rocks, and other obstacles found in their murky river environments. Pink river dolphins can also swim forward using one flipper while simultaneously paddling backwards with the other \u2013 allowing them to turn with incredible precision. They are also frequently seen swimming upside down, which possibly helps them see the bottom of the river better.\nThere\u2019s tons of mythology surrounding them.\nThese unique dolphins, often called Botos, are the subject of many South American legends. One story claims that during the night, pink river dolphins morph into handsome men to seduce the women of the village. Another claims that if you go swimming alone, the dolphins may whisk you away to a magical underwater city. Locals frequently considered it to be bad luck to harm them, and even worse luck to eat them. Their status as a semi-magical being may have helped to protect the species by encouraging humans to treat them with respect. You can learn more about Amazon pink river dolphin conservation via non-profits like Whale and Dolphin Conservation and the Amazon River Dolphin Conservation Foundation.\nLove learning about unique underwater animals?

In Chile, People commonly call these dolphins tonina, and commonly confuse these small dolphins with porpoises. This is because they have rather blunt, rounded heads and bodies.\nBlack dolphins are unique in that they only live along the Chilean coast, and nowhere else in the world! Read on to learn about the black dolphin.\nDescription of the Black Dolphin\nThese little marine mammals measure just 5.5 feet long, and weigh in at around 100 pounds or so. They are thick little animals, with girthy bodies and rounded heads. Compared to their plump bodies, these dolphins have relatively small dorsal and pectoral fins. Despite having the name \u201cblack dolphin,\u201d these creatures are actually gray, with white undersides and under-flippers.\nInteresting Facts About the Black Dolphin\nThese little dolphins truly are unique creatures. Many other dolphin species, like bottlenose dolphins or common dolphins, are widespread across the oceans. These marine mammals, however, are located only in one small area, much like the Critically Endangered vaquita.\nCephalorhynchus \u2013 These dolphins are closely related to three other species. They actually share the same taxonomic genus, Cephalorhynchus. Its closest relatives are Commerson\u2019s dolphins, Heaviside\u2019s dolphin, and Hector\u2019s dolphin.\n\u2013 These dolphins are closely related to three other species.

Not Neighbors \u2013 While the four species in Cephalorhynchus are closely related, they are definitely not close geographically. Their ranges vary anywhere from the coasts of Africa, New Zealand, South America, and more.\n\u2013 While the four species in Cephalorhynchus are closely related, they are definitely not close geographically. Their ranges vary anywhere from the coasts of Africa, New Zealand, South America, and more. \u201cBlack\u201d Dolphin \u2013 Nowadays, these dolphins more commonly have the name \u201cChilean dolphins.\u201d Scientists studied animals that had washed up and dried, or animals spotted from a distance. These factors made the dolphins appear darker in color than they actually were. In reality, they are not black at all, but gray!\nHabitat of the Black Dolphin\nThese marine mammals are coastal inhabitants. They like to live just offshore, or in river deltas. Remaining, for the most part, in waters shallower than 650 feet deep. These dolphins seem to prefer areas with fast-moving water, like tidal areas and river mouths. They live nowhere else in the world, and do not migrate or leave their native habitats.\nDistribution of the Black Dolphin\nThis dolphin has a very small distribution and range. The population is quite small, and debated by scientists. As with any animal that has minimal populations, they are not particularly widespread. You can find these dolphins from Valparaiso, Chile to Cape Horn, Chile. They simply do not exist anywhere else in the world.\nDiet of the Black Dolphin\nScientists know very little about black dolphins, and they are one of the least studied marine mammals in the world. There is literally no scientific study about the diet of these creatures. However, there are anecdotal accounts describing feeding behavior. Based on this information, researchers believe they feed on rock cod, anchovies, crustaceans, squid, and sardines.\nBlack Dolphin and Human Interaction\nWe honestly do not know how extensively humans have threatened (or otherwise interacted with) black dolphins. Scientists know that humans have hunted these dolphins for decades, but do not know the extent of their population decline.\nFishermen capture the dolphins for food and as bait, both intentionally and accidentally. Accidental captures, called incidental mortality, still occur in a number of fishing operations. The IUCN Red List classifies them as Near Threatened.\nDomestication\nHumans have not domesticated these dolphins in any way.\nDoes the Black Dolphin Make a Good Pet\nNo, black dolphins do not make good pets. It is illegal to keep any marine mammal as a pet, because they are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\nBlack Dolphin Care\nNo aquariums have kept these dolphins. Though we do not know very much about these creatures, we can assume that their care would be similar to those of close relatives. Even their close relatives rarely reside in zoos or aquariums. Their care would likely be similar to that of other dolphin species, and their diet similar as well.\nBehavior of the Black Dolphin\nScientists know very little about this dolphin, and even less about their behavior. Like most marine mammals, they are social, and will live in small groups. Most groups of this species, called pods, range from two to ten animals. They do not know how these social structures change or how mate choice occurs.\nReproduction of the Black Dolphin\nResearchers have conducted almost no research about the reproduction of these dolphins. Scientists do not have any definitive information about how long their gestation period runs, nor how long the offspring nurse before weaning. However, closely related dolphins likely have similar gestation periods, so one might assume that black dolphins give birth after 10 \u2013 12 months."}

There are more than 10,000 mature individuals of the Southern Right Whale Dolphins in the world.\nThe population of the Southern Right Whale Dolphin hasn't been estimated, but the population of the Northern Right Whale Dolphin has been estimated to be around 68,000 in the Pacific Ocean.\nWhere does a southern right whale dolphin live?\nThe Southern Right Whale Dolphin (Lissodelphis peronii) lives in the ocean. You can find it in the waters around Antarctica, South America, Australia, New Zealand, and Southern Africa. The geographic range for the Southern Right Whale Dolphins is said to include the sub-Antarctic waters. More precisely, they harbor the sub-antarctic waters amid 30\u00b0S and 65\u00b0S. Southern Right Whale Dolphins exist in the cool temperate waters of the Southern Hemisphere.

It is not on their list of threatened species.\nSouthern Right Whale Dolphin Fun Facts\nWhat do southern right whale dolphins look like?\nThe Southern Right Whale Dolphin is a truly beautiful dolphin. Its length ranges from 70-117 in (1.8 \u2013 2.9 m) and two colors dominate its appearance - black and white. The lower side of their body is white and the upper side is black. The two colors meet on its sides with the black dominating the curve that runs around its head. The anterior melon, the beak, and the flippers are white, and its tail or fluke is gray. They have a blowhole and 39-50 teeth in a row, or 78-100 teeth in total. Variations are also seen, with there being white spots on a dolphin's head and the amount of black and white on its body. The Southern Right Whale Dolphins are known to not have any dorsal fins, which is specified by its genus name 'Lissodelphis'. Also, its skin is very smooth.\n*Please note this is a northern right whale dolphin. If you have an image of a southern right whale dolphin, let us know at [email protected]\nHow cute are they?\nSouthern Right Whale Dolphins are very cute animals. They have strikingly beautiful black and white bodies in perfectly drawn curves. They dice gracefully in and out of the water and produce beautiful vocalizations. They have smooth skins and the sight of their big herds swimming in the ocean is a sight to behold.\nHow do they communicate?\nSouthern Right Whale Dolphins are known to use echolocation to locate another of their species. They may also use clicks and whistles.\nHow big is a southern right whale dolphin?\nA Southern Right Whale Dolphin is about 70-117 in (1.8\u20132.9 m) long. This makes them four times bigger than the grass carp.\nHow fast can a southern right whale dolphin swim?\nSouthern Right Whale Dolphins are known to be fast swimmers. They have been reported to have swimming speeds close to 14 mph (22 kmph).\nHow much does a southern right whale dolphin weigh?\nA Southern Right Whale Dolphin weighs about 132-221 lb (60\u2013100 kg).\nWhat are their male and female names of the species?\nAs with other dolphins and mammals, the males of the Souther Whale Dolphin species are called bulls, and the females are called cows.\nWhat would you call a baby southern right whale dolphin?\nA baby Southern Right Whale Dolphin is called a calf.\nWhat do they eat?\nSouthern Right Whale Dolphins eat mesopelagic fish, i.e. fish live at depths 200-1000 m. They eat squid, lanternfish, bigeye tuna, and mollusks.\nConversely, there have been no records of Southern Right Whale Dolphin predators, but the most likely can be assumed to be killer whales, sleeper sharks, and Patagonian toothfish.\nAre they dangerous?\nHuman interaction with Southern Right Whale Dolphins has been limited, but they are creatures of the wild, so they may display aggression.\nWould they make a good pet?\nThey would not make a good pet. They are free-roaming mammals that live at great offshore lengths. They are sizeable creatures and like living with their herd of whale dolphins.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nDid you know...\nSouthern Right Whales belong to the big family of marine mammals. Seals, manatees, whales, sea otters, and polar bears are all marine mammals as well. The marine mammal family is a rather informal group. Around 23% of the marine mammal species are considered to be under threat of extinction.\nNo confirmed records of the species in the Eastern South Pacific exist. There are few records of this species from the Eastern South Pacific Ocean, but the existence of Lissodelphis peronii off Namibia has been documented. And as for Lissodelphis borealis, Peale was the first explorer to describe it. Titian Peale described the species in 1848.\nThe waters off the coast of South Africa have witnessed a single sighting of the Southern Right Whale Dolphin. Also, the west coast of South Africa has not had any occurrences of 'bycatching' of these dolphins.\nOne of the first records of the Southern Right Whale Dolphin was in New Zealand. The species is occasionally seen in Kaikoura, a town on South Island, New Zealand.\nThe most recent observations of dolphin sightings were in Mahia Beach on the North Island of New Zealand.\nThe Northern and the Southern Right Whale Dolphins don't feature on the IUCN red list of threatened species. Before being declared as a species of Least Concern, they were listed as Data Deficient.\nSouthern Right Whale Dolphins are known to indulge in belly-flopping and side-slapping. The belly-flopping, much like other whales, has been known to be loud.\nWhy are they called southern right whale dolphins?\nThe Southern Right Whales got their name from the whalers of old that used to hunt them. According to them, they were the 'right whales' to pursue and hunt, since they moved slow, floated after being killed, and were closer to the shores. The 'Southern' was used for the 'right whales' that lived in the waters of the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe Southern Right Whale Dolphins, in turn, get their name from the Southern Right Whales, who also don't have a dorsal fin.\nDo the southern right whale dolphins have teeth?\nThe Southern Right Whales Dolphins have 78-100 teeth in total (39-50 teeth in each row). The Northern Right Whale Dolphin (Lissodelphis borealis) is the other species of the Right Whale Dolphins family. Northern Right Whale Dolphins are found in the North Pacific Ocean waters of the North. One difference between Southern Right Whale Dolphins (Lissodelphis peronii) and the Northern Right Whale Dolphins (Lissodelphis borealis) is the number of teeth they have. The Northern Right Whale has 37-54 per row and the Southern Right Whale has 39-50 per row. Both of them are marine mammals though, and both don't have a dorsal fin.\nThe Southern Right Whales, from whom these dolphins get their name, do not have teeth, they instead possess something called baleen, a comb-like tissue to filter their food.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly animal facts for everyone to discover!

Dolphin swims the vast seas and rivers as the fish do but he's a mammal.\nNow as simply saying that dolphins are mammals probably won't be enough as the kids will want to know how come it is a mammal especially since they are used for mammals to be land animals.\nThe simplest answer to this question is because dolphins are warm-blooded as mammals while fish are cold blooded. They might keep on asking though as what does warm blooded and cold blooded mean so you better read up on warm and cold blooded animals\nDolphin Books For Kids\nCan dolphins kill sharks?\nAnd do they eat sharks\nIf kids have watched a movie about a dolphin they probably have seen how a shark tries to attack someone and the dolphin comes to the rescue. The question if they eat sharks can be a bit of a surprise thoug.\nDolphins can kill sharks but in generally they do not. Dolphins won't go after a shark for no reason and most dolphin attack happen when a member of their pod is at danger of being attacked by a shark. They will protect the member of their group and will send the shark running. You can read more about this at Animalquestions.org.\nAs for dolphins eating sharks, well this was without a doubt a question that I couldn't answer with confidence as you know a shark is a fish, and dolphins do eat fish... Now to answer it, killer whales and fake killer whales are the only ones known to hunt and eat sharks from time to time (only in groups)... Learn more...\nWhere do dolphins sleep?\nTricky, tricky\nThis is the sort of question that can catch you of guard and something adults don't usually think of asking - but kids do.\nIf you think about it, it actually is a great question. Dolphins have to get to the surface to breathe so sleeping as we know it is not an option.\nBut they do get their 8 hours of sleep daily. It's just a bit odd. In that time they are half awake and half asleep. Literally. Half of their brains shut off and go to sleep and the other half is active and after a certain period of time the half that was asleep goes to active mode while the other shuts down.\nWhen they are getting their nap they;\n-have only one eye open (I imagine the one with the active brain half)\n-are more calm - they are either close to surface or rest on the bottom\n-they are moving more slowly\nKids will have a hard time believing you but it's just the way it is.\nMore about dolphins sleep\nAs I imagine dolphins sleep patterns have impressed you here are some articles that will give you a more in-depth information about this subject.\n\"Do whales and dolphins sleep?\"\nWhale sleep patterns are different from land mammals in that they are never really unconscious when they sleep.

Almost all adult dolphins don't have hair however when they are born they do have some hair around their beak which they loose shortly after.\nThere is one species that has constant hair around their beak and it's the Boto River Dolphin\nHow many teeth do dolphins have?\nThis can't be answered with a single number. There are over 40 species and each (well most) have their unique teeth count.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphin Echolocation | Dolphins World", "url": "https://www.dolphins-world.com/dolphin-echolocation/", "text": "WHAT IS ECHOLOCATION?\nEcholocation is a process that permits dolphins to send out sound waves that when they hit an object, are bounced back, allowing them to identify the location, shape, and size of such object.\nThe amount of time it takes for the sound waves to come back help them to determine the distance, as it takes longer the sound waves to return when there is more distance between the dolphin and that given object.\nThe first person to look at echolocation thoroughly and to document the findings was Jacque-Yves Cousteau. He wrote about it in a book published in 1953 called The Silent World.\nEcholocation or biosonar is the ability of some animals to locate objects through sound waves, that is, sounds. Many animals, including odontocete cetaceans and some bats, make use of echolocation to orient themselves and detect prey.\nThe process of evolution of dolphins gave them this ability that allowed them to survive in the aquatic environment. In water, the sound waves travel 4.5 times faster than in the air, so echolocation is the perfect resource that facilitates their survival.\nWHY DOLPHINS USE ECHOLOCATION?\nDolphins need echolocation to navigate, locate prey, hunt, protect themselves from predators in murky waters or where there is no sunlight and to communicate. In fact, in deep dark waters, their sense of sight is almost nil, but they do not need it because they can detect and chase fast prey through the emission of sounds.\nMost odontocete cetaceans can emit very high-frequency sounds. In this sense, the frequencies vary according to the species, but there are general characteristics in all dolphins. For example, they always communicate with low-frequency signals, which include whistling or chirping; But they emit high frequencies when using echolocation. The sounds vary according to the circumstances and the purpose.\nDolphins need echolocation to navigate, locate prey, hunt, and protect themselves.\nHOW DO ECHOLOCATION WORKS?\nFirst, is necessary to know that dolphins are devoid of vocal cords, so they do not have a \u201cvoice\u201d like that of humans. Instead, they generate sounds through other internal structures.\nStep number 1: Generate sounds.\nDolphins produce sounds from the nasal air sacs, the blowhole, the larynx, the lungs, and the melon; This latter is an organ located in the upper inner area of \u200b\u200bthe head filled with low-density lipids.\nFirst, the dolphin opens the blowhole to make an inhalation and the nasal air sacs swell as the air enters the lungs. Then the dolphin exhales: the air resonates in the nasal sacs and comes out with pressure through the blowhole. Vibrations occur in the larynx, and the nasal air sacs deflate.\nFor echolocation, dolphins emit ultrasounds called \u201cclicks\u201d by pushing air between the phonic lips of the nasal passages. When these lips open and close, the surrounding tissues vibrate and produce sound waves.\nThe passage of air through the respiratory cavities generates the sounds.\nStep number 2: Amplify sounds.\nThe Dolphins have an organ in the head, called melon, that allows the transmission of the sound waves.\nThe melon concentrates the pulsations that the dolphin emits and sends them forward. The primary \u201cfunction\u201d of this organ is to group sounds into beams and produce and amplify the resonance.\nOnce the emission is released forward, the sound waves bounce back in the objects that are in the water.\nStep number 3: Reception and interpretation of sounds.\nA part of the signal bounces back in the objects and returns as an echo to the dolphin. Their brain receives the sound waves in the form of nerve impulses, and the dolphin can interpret this echo.\nThe receiver of the returning sound waves is in the lower jaw, and the teeth of dolphins work like antennas to receive the signals. It is a very complex adaptation vital for their survival.\nThe intensity, pitch, and time that it takes the echo to return to the dolphin provide information about the target, such as its size, shape, composition, position, distance, and direction. Based on this, the dolphin builds an image of its environment and the object.\nEcholocation has been studied in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), although there are still underlying aspects that are not entirely understood. For now, scientists see echolocation as a learning opportunity to create new communication technologies in some areas of human life.\nDOLPHIN ECHOLOCATION\nWhat is known is that dolphins have the ability through echolocation to emit sounds with a frequency of 120 kHz and humans, with excellent hearing, can hear sounds with frequencies ranging from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. Even dogs and cats that have amazing hearing capabilities do not compare to dolphins. Dogs hear up to 45 kHz, and cats up to 65 kHz.\nHowever, high-frequency sounds don\u2019t travel very far in the water while Low-frequency sounds have more energy and can reach greater distances. Most of the time, dolphins will get the best results with echolocation when the object is from 16 to 656 feet from them.\nExcessive noise in the environment should be upsetting for dolphins and can cause them to lose their hearing over time. It can also disorient them and disrupt their navigation systems.\nReferences\nKathleen Dudzinski, Toni Frohoff. Dolphin Mysteries: Unlocking the Secrets of Communication.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Atlantic Spotted Dolphin | NOAA Fisheries", "url": "https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/atlantic-spotted-dolphin", "text": "Atlantic spotted dolphin swimming in the ocean. Credit: NOAA Fisheries\nAbout the Species\nAtlantic spotted dolphins are found in warm temperate and tropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean. They usually form groups of five to 50 individuals but sometimes travel in groups of up to 200. They are fast swimmers and often \u201csurf\u201d in the waves created by vessels. Young Atlantic spotted dolphins do not have spots. As a result, they can look like slender bottlenose dolphins. Their distinctive spotted pattern starts to appear all over their bodies as they get older. Atlantic spotted dolphins, like all marine mammals, are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. NOAA Fisheries and its partners are working to conserve Atlantic spotted dolphins and further our understanding of this species through research and conservation activities.\nPopulation Status\nNOAA Fisheries estimates population size in our stock assessment reports.\nThe worldwide population of Atlantic spotted dolphins is unknown. Scientists estimate that there are over 77,000 Atlantic spotted dolphins in U.S. waters.\nTo manage Atlantic spotted dolphins in U.S. waters, we have divided them into three stocks:\nNorthern Gulf of Mexico stock\nPuerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands stock\nWestern North Atlantic stock\nBased on the most recent surveys, our scientists estimate that there are about 37,000 dolphins in the northern Gulf of Mexico stock and about 40,000 dolphins in the western North Atlantic stock. The number of dolphins in the Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands stock is unknown.\nProtected Status\nCITES Appendix II Throughout Its Range MMPA Protected Throughout Its Range\nAppearance\nAtlantic spotted dolphins are about 5 to 7.5 feet long and weigh about 220 to 315 pounds. They have a robust body with a tall, curved dorsal fin located midway down their back. Their beaks are moderately long. Like other cetaceans, their head has a distinctive melon, a rounded forehead that collects sounds from the environment. They have 30 to 42 pairs of small, cone-shaped teeth in each jaw. Atlantic spotted dolphins\u2019 color patterns vary with age and location. Young dolphins do not have any spots. Instead, they have a dark gray back with a pale white underside. This lack of spots can make young Atlantic spotted dolphins look like slender bottlenose dolphins. An Atlantic spotted dolphin starts to develop spots after its first birthday. As the dolphin matures, the spots become darker and more widespread, especially on its back.\nBehavior and Diet\nAtlantic spotted dolphins are usually found in groups of less than 50 individuals but sometimes travel in groups of up to 200. In coastal waters, groups usually consist of five to 15 individuals. Within these groups, the dolphins are sometimes organized by age or sex. Atlantic spotted dolphins blow bubbles through their blowholes as one way to communicate with members of their group. They also communicate with sound. Atlantic spotted dolphins are often described as \u201cacrobatic\u201d swimmers, frequently leaping out of the water or jumping at the water\u2019s surface. They can also swim very quickly and often \u201csurf\u201d in the waves created by vessels. They sometimes interact with other cetacean species, such as bottlenose dolphins. Atlantic spotted dolphins can dive up to 200 feet and have been recorded holding their breath for up to ten minutes. Most of their dives are less than 30 feet and last for 2 to 6 minutes. These dolphins eat small fish, invertebrates, and cephalopods, such as squid and octopi. They have 30 to 42 pairs of small, cone-shaped teeth in each jaw. Groups of dolphins often coordinate their movements to catch prey together. Individuals sometimes use their beaks to dig into the sand on the ocean bottom to catch hidden fish.\nWhere They Live\nAtlantic spotted dolphins are found in warm temperate, subtropical, and tropical waters throughout the Atlantic Ocean. Their range includes the waters of the U.S. East Coast (Gulf of Mexico to Massachusetts), the Bahamas, Brazil, the Azores and Canary Islands, and Gabon. Warm currents such as the Gulf Stream may affect their distribution. Atlantic spotted dolphins prefer the waters along the continental shelf (the edge of a continent below the ocean\u2019s surface). They usually live in coastal or continental shelf waters that are 65 to 820 feet deep, but are found in deeper oceanic waters in the northern part of their range.\nLifespan & Reproduction\nThe estimated lifespan of Atlantic spotted dolphins is unknown. They reach sexual maturity when they are 8 to 15 years old. Females give birth to a single calf every 1 to 5 years. Mothers nurse their calves for 1 to 5 years.\nThreats\nEntanglement One of the main threats to Atlantic spotted dolphins is getting caught in fishing gear. Dolphins can become entangled or captured in commercial fishing gear such as gillnets and purse seines. These interactions can cause dolphins to be injured or killed by entanglement in the gear. Ocean Noise Underwater noise pollution interrupts the normal behavior of Atlantic spotted dolphins that rely on sound to communicate and echolocate. If loud enough, noise can cause permanent or temporary hearing loss. Noise interference from vessels, as well as industrial and military activities, disturbs Atlantic spotted dolphins\u2019 feeding, communication, and orientation. Illegal Feeding and Harassment Atlantic spotted dolphins sometimes interact with different types of fishing vessels, often following them and eating discarded catch. A few Atlantic spotted dolphins have been hunted and killed in the Caribbean, South America, West Africa, and other offshore islands for food and bait.\nScientific Classification"}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Porpoise images!\nA porpoise can swim as fast as 34 mph!\nThere are seven species of porpoise and they are often mistaken for dolphins. These mammals live in rivers, estuaries, and bays in many areas of the world. A porpoise can dive more than 600 feet into the depths of the ocean. Porpoises communicate with one another in a series of whistles and clicks.\n5 Unique Porpoise Facts\n\u2022 Porpoises can live to be 23 years old, dependent on its health and potential predators in its area.\n\u2022 While social, these mammals can usually be seen traveling in pairs or groups (shoals) of three. However, harbor porpoises are known to travel in a shoal of up to 100!\n\u2022 They are carnivores that eat mostly fish and crustaceans. It swallows its prey whole and often alerts other porpoises once it finds a food source.\n\u2022 Porpoises are related to both dolphins and whales. To tell the difference between a porpoise and dolphin, look at the animal\u2019s nose. A dolphin has a beak-like nose while a porpoise has a more rounded head and shorter nose.\n\u2022 These animals have a layer of blubber that helps them to stay warm in cold ocean waters.\nPorpoise Scientific Name\nPorpoises belong to the Phocoenidae family and the class Mammalia. There are seven subspecies of porpoises. These include the harbor porpoise, Burmeister\u2019s porpoise, Dall\u2019s porpoise, the narrow-ridged finless porpoise, the spectacled porpoise, the Indo-Pacific finless porpoise, and the vaquita \u2013 thought to be the most endangered marine mammal in the world.\nThe scientific name of a harbor porpoise is Phocoena phocoena. The word \u2018Phocoena\u2019 is Latin for \u2018pig fish\u2019. A porpoise is sometimes called a puffin\u2019 pig because of the exhaling sound it makes when it reaches the surface of the water after a dive. Some scientists think the noise sounds like a sneeze!\nPorpoise Appearance and Behavior\nPorpoises vary in color but all have smooth, sleek skin and their backs are darker in color than their stomachs (known as countershading). Most porpoises are a shade of gray on their back and a lighter gray or white on their stomach, however, the Burmeister\u2019s porpoise is mostly dark gray or black in color and the Dall\u2019s porpoise has a black and white coloring.\nPorpoises have strong flippers and teeth with spade-shaped tips \u2013 their dentition is actually a way they differ from dolphins. A porpoise has a rounded head and a triangular-shaped dorsal fin. However, as their name suggests, the finless species of porpoise do not have fins.\nPorpoises range from 4.7 to 7.7 feet in length and can weigh between 110 to 490 pounds. Females are usually larger than males. Picture a full-size mattress and you are looking at an item equal in length to an average porpoise. A porpoise of around 200 pounds is equal in weight to half of an adult reindeer. The longest of the seven species is the Dall\u2019s porpoise \u2013 at 7.5 feet.\nLike other mammals, porpoises have defensive features that help them escape predators. For one, the back of a porpoise is darker than its stomach. This helps them to blend into their watery environment. Porpoises are some of the fastest swimmers in the ocean, clocking in at 34 mph. This can help them get away from some predators as well.\nA porpoise doesn\u2019t use its spade-shaped teeth to chew up its prey. Instead, the shape of their teeth helps them to grab fish, squid, octopus, and crustaceans, so they can swallow them whole! These amazing creatures have what are called gum teeth between their spade-shaped teeth. The gum teeth are there to help a porpoise grasp and hold on to a slippery food source like a squid or an octopus. No wonder they call them gum teeth!\nPorpoises use echolocation to find prey. Echolocation happens when a porpoise makes a sound that bounces off its prey and echoes back to them. This allows a porpoise to detect the location of prey even when it\u2019s swimming in the dark depths of the sea!\nPorpoises are social animals with one another and can travel in groups of 20. However, most porpoises are seen traveling with just two or three others. A group of porpoises is called a shoal. A shoal of Dall\u2019s porpoises can include as many as 20 members while a shoal of harbor porpoises can contain as many as 100.\nPorpoise Habitat\nThe seven species of porpoise have a range of habitats across the globe. In the region of the North Atlantic Ocean, they are found near West Greenland to Cape Hatteras. In the North Pacific Ocean, their range goes from near Japan to the Chukchi Sea. They also swim in the Barents Sea toward the coast of western Africa and live in the Beaufort Sea as well.\nPorpoises live in estuaries, rivers, bays, and fjords. Though they do usually go out into the ocean to dive and hunt for prey, porpoises usually stay in water that is 500 feet deep or less. In short, they are known for swimming near coastlines.\nPorpoises migrate to different parts of coastal regions. For instance, they may move to a different area of a river or bay to find another source of food.\nIn addition, some porpoises migrate at the change of the season. As an example, some Harbor porpoises spend the summer in the Gulf of Maine and migrate to the North Carolina coastline for the winter months.\nPorpoise Diet\nWhat does a porpoise eat? Porpoises are carnivores, eating fish such as cod, herring, and pollack. They also eat squid, octopus, and sometimes crabs.\nSince a porpoise swallows its food whole, there are some items that are bad for them to eat. For example, when a porpoise tries to swallow a flatfish it can choke to death. This fish is large, wide, and not easily swallowed, unlike many other types of fish hunted by porpoises. Most porpoises know by instinct that they shouldn\u2019t eat a flatfish because of the danger it presents to them.\nPorpoises eat around 7 to 30 pounds of food per day, depending on the species and size. The harbor porpoise eats about 10 pounds of food each day, equal to close to 10 percent of its body weight. Ten pounds of fish weighs about the same as a large can of paint! While the Dall porpoise usually eats about 28-30 pounds of food daily. Eating this much food helps them to have the energy they need to swim through the ocean at top speeds.\nScientists believe that when a member of a shoal of porpoises finds prey it lets the other members of the group know about it. This method makes hunting for a meal a lot easier for these incredible creatures.\nPorpoise Predators and Threats\nGreat White shark, orcas, and dolphins are predators of the porpoise. Orcas and sharks have strong jaws and are easily able to subdue a porpoise. Dolphins are fast swimmers and are known to attack porpoises on occassion, although the reason for the aggression is unclear.\nPorpoises can also become tangled in commercial fisherman\u2019s nets where they can be injured or die. They may swim into them while chasing prey or simply swim into one accidentally. Another human-based threat to porpoises is water pollution. Chemicals and plastics are harmful if ingested by porpoises, making them very ill or resulting in death.\nSince porpoises live in coastal areas, they hear a lot of noise from ships, boats, and other watercraft. The noise echoing underwater can interfere with the communications of porpoises and harm this animal\u2019s hearing. So, noise pollution is counted as a threat to the existence of these animals.\nThe official conservation status of most porpoises is least concern. The Burmeister\u2019s porpoise has a conservation status of near threatened and the narrow-ridged finless porpoise has a conservation status of endangered. However, the vaquita porpoise is categorized as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species and is considered the most endangered marine mammal in the world!\nPorpoise Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nPorpoises mate throughout the year, but scientists have found more mating activity occurs in the spring and fall seasons. This holds true for dolphins as well.\nMale porpoises mate with several females each year. However, a female only has young every two to three years. The gestation period of a female porpoise is 10 to 11 months.\nA female porpoise gives live birth to one baby also known as a calf or pup. She gives birth as she swims through the water and sometimes the birth can take two hours. The porpoise calf comes out tail first. After it is born, the calf stays with its mother and nurses as they both swim along. The father is not involved in caring for the baby.\nA porpoise calf is nursed for about eight months and slowly learns how to capture fish during this time. It is fully weaned by about 24 months of age.\nThere is a special relationship between a mother porpoise and her calf. The calf may stay with her from three to six years as it learns how to become a strong swimmer and survive on its own.

Although these two species are marine animals, the dolphin is more of a warm-blooded mammal while the shark is a cold-blooded fish.\nIn today's world, there exists a great debate between the various characteristics of sharks and dolphins among marine specialists and researchers. When we first think of dolphins and sharks, we see dolphins as water animals that are totally cute, social, and also quite friendly with humans. On the other hand, when we hear about sharks, an image of their deadly appearance and menacing teeth is created and we feel a slight level of discomfort. There exists not just one difference but many between dolphins and sharks. First and foremost, dolphins and sharks come from completely different families. The dolphin comes from the Cetacean family just like whales while the shark belongs to the Elasmobranch family. Secondly, dolphins are mammals that give birth to live young while sharks are fish that reproduce by laying eggs. Thirdly, dolphins have a blowhole on the top of the head to breathe air so they have to come up above the ocean surface at times while sharks have gills on the sides of the body that makes it easy to breathe underwater.\nNonetheless, they can be quite different but they share a few similarities too. For instance, both sharks and dolphins have dorsal fins that are located on the back, their sides have two pectoral fins, and both of them have tail fins too. Shark fins, like the dorsal fin, tend to be triangular in shape whereas the dorsal fin that a dolphin has tends to be more rounded. Northern right whale dolphins are the only dolphin species without a dorsal fin. Even the bodies of both these marine species are quite streamlined and torpedo-shaped. The tails of these two water species prove to be advantageous but with a difference. The vertical glide of the tail present in sharks makes it easy for them to have mobility sideways. This is why they are quite swift, straight swimmers. In dolphins, the tail fin tends to be more horizontal, allowing them to make quick sharp movements in the water to help in swimming away fast during attacks.\nSharks and dolphins don't really have a good relationship and they do not get along well. In the world of oceans and seas, dolphins are prey animals to sharks. But dolphins perform well in defending themselves from their predators. Dolphins, which are vocal mammals, tend to move in 'pods' so if one member of a pod is in danger of being attacked by an aggressive shark, the whole pod will rush to its defense. These water mammals have also been recorded to protect and save humans from sharks!\nIt might be surprising to learn this but even though a shark's body can be slightly bigger than the body of a dolphin, the dolphin can easily defend itself against a shark by going to the extent of even killing it. The way they defend themselves has astounded many marine experts and scientists. There is a joke that cold-blooded sharks have dolphin phobia! As a result, a shark will mostly attack young dolphins, dolphins that are by themselves, or even injured dolphins.\nIf you've seen a dolphin head before, you will be well aware of the unique long snout it has. Although this adds to them being adorable animals, it proves to be a very powerful weapon against sharks. When they ram this long snout into the soft underside of the shark, it can be quite painful even going to the extent of causing severe internal injuries. A well-aimed hit can take out a shark! It is important to understand that this animal will attack a shark not for predatory purposes but only for the reason of protecting itself, its young, and other members of the pod. So, these water mammals attack only out of defense or if they are threatened.\nIf you enjoyed this article on the differences between dolphins and sharks, make sure to check out our shark amazing facts for kids and eagle vs hawk fun facts that are sure to amaze you!\nHow are dolphins and sharks different?\nNothing can evoke more panic than noticing a shark fin swimming towards you as you play in the water or at a beach. Again, nothing can make you happier than watching an adorable warm-blooded dolphin swim towards you seeking your affection. A debate still continues whether sharks and dolphins do get along well or not, but the life of a dolphin has been studied much more in depth than the life of a shark. In general, a wide range of differences exists between a dolphin and a shark in terms of their appearance as well as behavior.\nDolphins are social creatures that live and move together in what are called pods. Sharks, on the other hand, tend to be solitary marine animals that swim in the ocean water all by themselves. Secondly, dolphins are mammals that breathe air through the blowhole on their heads by coming above the water surface while sharks are fish that have both the capacity and the capability to breathe oxygen underwater with the help of the gills present in the sides of the shark's body. Both these animals also have two pectoral fins on their side, dorsal fins on their backs, and tails.\nThere is a difference in the dorsal fins too. When you look at the dorsal fin of a dolphin, it is more rounded while the dorsal fin present in a shark has a straight edge to it. The main difference between the tails of these two marine species is that the tail fin that is present in dolphins is more horizontal, aiding in up and down movements in the ocean or sea and is similar to the tail of a whale. In sharks, the tail fin is more on the vertical side, allowing them to make agile side-to-side motions. With this information, you should then be able to detect to which animal the dorsal fin belongs to when you locate one in the water.\nThe fins in dolphins prove to be a great defense tool as they surround the shark in almost every direction and then begin slapping their fins away. This confuses the shark, sending a warning not to approach the dolphin pod ever again. After this shaking experience, the shark will not get too close to dolphins again!\nDo sharks and dolphins belong to the same family?\nSharks and dolphins do not come from the same family. Dolphins are known to come from the Cetacean family while the shark comes from the Elasmobranch group of water animals.\nThe dolphin is an intelligent animal that is bright, slow, and also has great connection with humans. Just like us, they're also capable of portraying emotions like sadness, depression, and happiness! These dolphins usually swim near the water surface while sharks tend to frequent the deeper parts of the sea. Sharks are more lethal sea creatures that have no predators. You could say almost say that sharks are efficient dominators of the sea!\nWho has more teeth-shark or dolphin?\nDolphins are believed to have just a single set of teeth that lasts an entire lifetime. The teeth in dolphins are conical shaped, making it easy to catch smaller fish, certain cretaceans, and squid.\nThe teeth of a dolphin are well structured to tear into flesh but they mostly use their to secure their food and provide a good grip. Sharks, on the other hand, have sharper teeth that help them to easily cut into the carcasses of other sea animals. The teeth and width of the mouth is the most deadly and menacing part of their bodies. Dolphins have more teeth than sharks. Sharks are also capable of losing some of their teeth when they bite into certain hard structures or substances.\nWho would win a shark or a dolphin?\nWhen it comes to a fight between a shark and a dolphin, it is for sure that the dolphin will win. This is because even though the shark might seem like a more fierce and aggressive animal, the dolphin can easily counterattack given the various abilities that they possess.\nFirstly, dolphins have long snouts that they use for jamming into the soft stomach of a shark if it comes to attack them in any way. Secondly, since dolphins live and move in pods, the pod will come to the rescue of a dolphin that is being harassed by a shark. Hence, it is very easy for a dolphin to overpower a shark!\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly facts for everyone to enjoy!

Wild dolphins don\u2019t live in tanks, where their movement, diet, social structure, behavior and entire way of life is manipulated, controlled and restricted.\nOne of the most concerning aspects of dolphin captivity, is that it teaches the public that it\u2019s okay to mock and disrespect one of nature\u2019s most fascinating ambassadors. The entertainment industry profits from twisting a beautiful and sentient species into a parody of itself. After performances, or swim-with-dolphins programs, most captive dolphins languish in their cages or tanks and wait until the next show, or next feeding."}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "8 Shocking Facts About Dolphins and Whales in Captivity", "url": "https://www.idausa.org/campaign/cetacean-advocacy/facts-dolphins-whales-captivity/", "text": "Around the world, dolphins and whales in captivity are a popular form of entertainment. Collectively known as cetaceans, these animals can be forced to perform tricks in circus-like environments, including in dolphinariums or aquariums. Globally, dolphins and whales in captivity form a multi-billion dollar industry.\nBut the dark side of this industry is kept well-hidden. The unfortunate reality is that dolphins and whales in captivity suffer greatly behind the glitz and glamor of these businesses.\nBelow are five facts about the conditions cetaceans endure within captive environments. For a more in-depth look at specific facilities, and other issues affecting wild cetaceans, check out our Cetacean Project page.\n1. Types of dolphins kept in captivity\nBottlenose dolphins are the most common species of cetacean used in the dolphin and whale captivity industry. The next most popular species are orca whales, also known as killer whales. The name is a bit of a misnomer, however, since orcas are actually a species of dolphin, not a species of whale.\nWhales are also kept in captivity, such as the pure-white beluga whales. However, larger species of whales, such as humpbacks and right whales, are too large for any captive display facility to handle.\n2. Number of Dolphins Held Dolphins in Captivity\nSince captivity businesses aren\u2019t always required to report births and deaths, it is difficult to quantify exactly how many dolphins and whales are held captivity. One analysis in 2015 pegged the number at close to 3,000 individuals being held in tanks around the world, with the United States accounting for over 500 individuals.\n3. Lifespan of Dolphins and Whales in Captivity\nThere isn\u2019t a broad consensus on how long dolphins live in the wild versus captivity. One study pegged dolphin life expectancy in captivity at around 30 years of age, while another produced the figure of around 12 years. Yet dolphins have been known to live well into their 60s.\nEven if the median life expectancy for dolphins in captivity is similar to those in the wild, this isn\u2019t saying much to benefit the captivity industry. Captivity facilities often tout their medical care, the fact that dolphins are shielded from predators, and that they do not have to forage for food as being some of the benefits of a life in captivity, making dolphin's lives \u201ceasy.\u201d However, if these factors were actually contributing to a dolphins\u2019 wellbeing, captives should be far outliving wild dolphins. This is absolutely not the case - and thus forms more evidence for how dolphins suffer impoverished lives in captivity.\n4. Dolphin Depression Syndrome\nThere is plenty of evidence suggesting that dolphins show symptoms of being depressed in captivity. Dolphins can engage in stereotypic behaviors, ranging from repetitive motions or unnatural behaviors that are only seen in captive individuals.\nIt is believed that stereotypic behaviors are a direct effect of captivity on dolphins. They arise due to chronic impairment of mental and emotional welfare and can result from boredom, lack of stimulation, stress, depression, or any number of other psychological states.\nWhen you know what to look for regarding stereotypic behaviors, you will begin seeing them pretty much anywhere dolphins and whales are held captive.\nIn the wild, cetaceans travel many miles each day and are not often found drifting lethargically at the surface of the water. Yet this behavior, known as logging, is considered stereotypic in captivity given the unusually prolonged periods cetaceans have been observed engaging in this behavior. Other stereotypies include chewing endlessly on bars or grates; swimming in the same pattern around the tank for hours; bobbing their heads or popping their jaws repetitively; and the list goes on.\nCaptivity businesses are known to give cetaceans drugs that treat depression in humans. A bombshell discovery uncovered by Buzzfeed in 2014 revealed that SeaWorld, the global industry leader in the captivity industry, administers benzodiazepine to killer whales.\nBenzodiazepine is a psychoactive drug included in common human medications such as Xanax and Valium.\nDocuments show that SeaWorld uses benzodiazepine to prevent aggressive behaviors in killer whales. However, experts believe this aggression is the result of chronic stress rather than the sort that can be attributed to this species\u2019 natural tendencies.\n5. Captivity Deforms Dolphins\u2019 Bodies\nThere are many ways that the bodies of dolphins and whales in captivity become deformed due to captivity.\nOrcas can suffer from dorsal fin collapse, where their iconic tall fin - which can reach heights of six feet in the wild - flops over into a hump. It is believed that the constant movement of water due to wild orcas' movement and traveling is what helps keep these fins upright in the wild. The stagnant lifestyle in captivity cannot provide the necessary hydrodynamic resistance needed.\nIn aquariums where dolphins are forced to perform circus-style shows, trainers and performers often stand on the backs and even the faces of dolphins, using their bodies as surfboards to entertain crowds. These shows are performed so often that dolphins begin to develop open sores on their bodies, for example on the tips of their rostrums, or their \u201cbeaks.\u201d\nAs the skin of dolphins is extremely sensitive, these wounds likely cause dolphins constant pain.\nStereotypic behaviors can cause severe damage to the bodies of dolphins and whales.\nDolphins and orcas sometimes chew the grates to their tanks so frequently that they break down their teeth. This requires veterinarians to drill and flush their damaged jaws to prevent infection.\n6. Dolphins and Whales Are Trained through Food Deprivation\nIf you\u2019ve ever watched a dolphin show, you will notice that after many tricks the dolphins will swim over to the trainers, who will toss them fish or treats.\nWhat you are witnessing is essentially the bribing of dolphins in order to force them to perform as desired. Though some venues like to say that they showcase \u201cnatural behaviors\u201d of cetaceans during these shows, the truth is that dolphins wouldn\u2019t repeat these same tricks over and over, day in and day out, in the wild.\nThere is nothing natural about a dolphin or whale performance.\nFurthermore, in many cases, food is actively withheld from cetaceans throughout the day. Leaving cetaceans on the verge of extreme hunger compels them into obedience all the more effectively. So, it is highly likely that dolphins and whales in captivity not only endure the poor conditions of barren tanks, but they are also chronically hungry.\n7. They Remember Their Way Home After Being Freed\nDolphins and whales are frequently captured from the wild in order to restock tanks around the world. Yet the captivity industry regularly claims that returning them to the sea is impossible.\nThe story of two dolphins captured and held illegally in South Korea illustrates an important example of how releasing cetaceans from captivity can, in fact, be successful. After four long years in captivity, bottlenose dolphins Sampal and Chunsam were placed in a temporary sea pen to recalibrate them to life in the ocean. Ahead of their release date, Sampal discovered a hole in the netting and escaped.\nOnly five days later, she was seen back with her family from which she\u2019d been taken all those years ago. Chunsam was released shortly thereafter and was soon seen swimming with individuals of his old pod as well.\nNot only did these dolphins adjust back to life in the wild, but after four years, they knew exactly where to go to find their families and friends. This is no coincidence.\nIt has been proven that dolphins have sophisticated cognitive and emotional abilities, and as this case suggests, long memories as well. This also means that dolphins and whales captured from the wild who remain in tanks to this day are likely haunted with memories of the life and families they\u2019ve lost.\n8. Captivity Teaches Domination Rather Than Respect\nThere\u2019s no conclusive evidence that viewing dolphins and whales in captivity promotes attitude change or spurs an interest in conservation within visitors.\nZoos and aquariums alike tend to promote their facilities to children, who are impressionable and still learning about the world. These companies overtly encourage children to develop emotional bonds with animals who are in permanent confinement.\nThe resulting education conflates love with domination, and pushes the notion that it is morally acceptable for wild animals to be utterly dominated by humans. Additionally, it sends the clear, yet misguided and unproven messages that animals do not notice their poor living conditions or that they appreciate the \u201ccare\u201d they receive at these facilities.\nUltimately, the captivity industry normalizes animals in cages, enabling these businesses to continue to profit at animals\u2019 expense.\nHow Can We Help Dolphins In Captivity?\nDolphins and whales suffer greatly in captivity, regardless of the size of the tanks. Chronic stress, physical injuries, and food deprivation paint an image of the kind of lives these animals are forced to endure, all for the sake of human entertainment and profit.\nThere are many things you can do to help dolphins and whales in captivity. Here are a few suggestions"}

The special call was made in an aquarium in Hawaii, where the mother and her two-year-old calf swam in separate tanks connected by a special underwater audio link. The two dolphins began squawking and chirping to each other\u2014distinctive dolphin chatter.\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\nCracking the Code\n\"It seemed clear that they knew who they were talking with,\" says Don White, whose Project Delphis ran the experiment. \"Information was passing back and forth pretty quickly.\" But what were they saying? That's what scientists are trying to find out by studying wild and captive dolphins all over the world to decipher their secret language. They haven't completely cracked the code yet, but they're listening \u2026 and learning.\nChatty Mammals\nIn many ways, you are just like the more than 30 species of dolphins that swim in the world's oceans and rivers. Dolphins are mammals, like you are, and must swim to the surface to breathe air. Just as you might, they team up in pods, or groups, to accomplish tasks. And they're smart.\nThey also talk to each other. Starting from birth, dolphins squawk, whistle, click, and squeak. \"Sometimes one dolphin will vocalize and then another will seem to answer,\" says Sara Waller, who studies bottlenose dolphins off the California coast. \"And sometimes members of a pod vocalize in different patterns at the same time, much like many people chattering at a party.\" And just as you gesture and change facial expressions as you talk, dolphins communicate nonverbally through body postures, jaw claps, bubble blowing, and fin caresses.\nThinking Dolphin\nScientists think dolphins \"talk\" about everything from basic facts like their age to their emotional state. \"I speculate that they say things like 'there are some good fish over here,' or 'watch out for that shark because he's hunting,'\" says Denise Herzing, who studies dolphins in the Bahamas.\nWhen the going gets tough, for instance, some dolphins call for backup. After being bullied by a duo of bottlenose dolphins, one spotted dolphin returned to the scene the next day with a few pals to chase and harass one of the bully bottlenose dolphins. \"It's as if the spotted dolphin communicated to his buddies that he needed their help, then led them in search of this guy,\" says Herzing, who watched the scuffle.\nLanguage Lessons\nKathleen Dudzinski, director of the Dolphin Communication Project, has listened to dolphins for more than 17 years, using high-tech gear to record and analyze every nuance of their language. But she says she's far from speaking \"dolphin\" yet. Part of the reason is the elusiveness of the animals. Dolphins are fast swimmers who can stay underwater for up to ten minutes between breaths. \"It's like studying an iceberg because they spend most of their lives underwater,\" Dudzinski says.\nDeciphering \"dolphin speak\" is also tricky because their language is so dependent on what they're doing, whether they're playing, fighting, or going after tasty fish. It's no different for humans. Think about when you raise a hand to say hello. Under other circumstances, the same gesture can mean good-bye, stop, or that something costs five bucks. It's the same for dolphins. During fights, for example, dolphins clap their jaws to say \"back off!\" But they jaw clap while playing, too, as if to show who's king of the underwater playground.\n\"I have not found one particular dolphin behavior that means the same thing every time you see it,\" says Dudzinski. \"If you like mysteries and detective work, then this is the job for you.\" And who knows\u2014maybe someday you'll get a phone call from a dolphin.\nText by Crispin Boyer"}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphin Spirit Animal \u2013 Meaning and Interpretation", "url": "https://www.spiritanimals.org/dolphin/", "text": "Ever since the beginning of time, we have focused on solving life\u2019s divine questions. Some of us have preferred a more intuitive approach, while others that are rational thinkers need hard proof. Regardless of which kind you are, in the beginning, we all need to gather information. In this beginner state, we read the general knowledge that has been collected throughout the centuries on the subject that we are interested in. Whether it is about animal symbolism, dreams, visions, intuitive truth, or spiritual guides \u2013 we need to get informed before we decide how to proceed.\nThis article focuses on the Spirit Animal Dolphin, its symbolism, personality traits, ways to reconnect with it, and more.\nDolphins are commonly associated with being playful, joyful, and ready to help. These animals get along with most species. Presumably, that is because of their high intelligence. We are amazed and intrigued by the nature of this animal. It represents divine love. With its communication skills, playfulness, ability to solve complex tasks, and willingness to help and guide other species, this animal is by far one of a kind. Dolphins have a strong individuality and play a unique role in a group setting. There isn\u2019t one single pattern of behavior that we can relate them to, as they are all different from each other.\nIf you relate to the Spirit Guide Dolphin, you are most likely playful, curious, intelligent, kind, cooperative, gentle, and communicative. You feel an almost altruistic love towards humanity and all of earth\u2019s creatures. Being gentle and kind comes naturally to you \u2013 as you are probably spiritually awakened, you understand that everything plays a divine part in the universe\u2019s play.\nMeaning and Symbolism of Dolphin as Spirit Animal\nIt is believed that dolphins have psychic abilities. They seem to understand the higher truths in life and apply them daily. When you can see the whole picture, the only thing that\u2019s left is enjoying the part you play in it. Dolphins have effortlessly accepted their fate and have decided to get the most out of every experience life has to offer. They are considered the most intelligent animals on earth -some proof of that is: the ability to use different objects to achieve their goals, having complex emotions, like grieving the death of loved ones, mimicking and teasing others as a form of entertainment, and being gentle to other species.\nCharacteristics and Personality\nDolphins are the connection between humanity and nature. They embody the elements of water and air. Their higher intelligence is represented by the element Air, while Water is a sign of emotional depth. They embody joyful energy, filled with curiosity and intuitiveness. However, their playfulness comes from their ability to see the bigger picture and to care about other animals.\nDolphins can be seen as humans\u2019 best friends in the ocean. For centuries they have been guiding us, swimming with us, helping us through different experiences in our life, including the miracle of giving birth. They are a symbol of protection \u2013 there are various tales of them saving sailors from drowning. In Greek mythology, they are guides who have helped people go through different realms. In this sense, dolphins are not only associated with intelligence and playfulness but with protection and spiritual awakening.\nThey are thought to have metaphysical qualities. They can sense different animals and because of their highly developed brains, they know how to appropriately react to any situation. A sign of their high emotional intelligence is their ability to play with each other and other species. This is one of the few animals that experience such a colorful palette of feelings and is entitled to having an authentic personality. This means that there is no universal knowledge of how dolphins behave. Whether they\u2019re introverted or extroverted differs from one animal to another. However, the personality trait that they all share this kindness and curiosity.\nThese animals represent:\nProtection and guidance\nFreedom\nCuriosity\nPlayfulness and joy\nPsychic Abilities\nTeamwork\nHigher Intelligence\nKindness\nDolphin Spirit Animal Positive Powers\nProtection and guidance: There are countless stories of dolphins helping people \u2013 some of them were far from shore, some lost their way at sea, and some were in a life-or-death situation, close to drowning. Whatever the case, it is proven over and over there often will come to you in times of need. It will guide you to safety. Moreover, studies are showing that when women give birth near dolphins \u2013 they experience less pain and discomfort. However, this Is an old practice that no longer takes place.\nBecause of their higher intelligence, they appreciate the part that every organism plays in our ecosystem. It seems they can sense the universe\u2019s divine plan, and they are making sure we are all on the right path. This guide can help you on your spiritual journey. It will share the higher knowledge with you, which will become the foundation of your altruistic love towards all living beings.\nHigher Intelligence: Scientists consider dolphins to be among the most intelligent animals. They have large brains second only to ours by body size proportions. Like crows and gorillas, they use tools such as sharp pieces of coral for digging. Dolphins have complex emotional interactions. For example, they can playfully pass on a pufferfish to each other as a game. They can form attachments to different species. If a human regularly visits them and suddenly stops, they will grieve and leave little gifts on the shore, with the hope that they will return.\nHigher intelligence correlates to kindness. Only after you know the secrets of life can you begin to love every part of it. This level of acceptance and care for other beings is a quality commonly seen in gods but rarely in the animal kingdom.\nThe Spirit Guide Dolphin will help you on your journey of becoming more altruistic. We all must reach the destination \u2013 therefore we need to help each other on the way. The ability to care about others, share with them, guide them on their way, assist them, and protect them, comes from love. This raw form of emotion can only be achieved through intelligence.\nPlayfulness and joy: Because of their higher understanding of life, dolphins are prone to enjoying it to the fullest. Are you having enough fun? Are you in touch with your inner child and its desires? It can be hard to be goofy and joyful. We tend to take life too seriously \u2013 we get anxious and overwork ourselves. This Spirit Guide will remind you that we are on this planet only for a short time. Therefore, we must make sure the time spent is enjoyable and memorable. Ask yourself daily: \u201cWhat fun thing can I do?\u201d and start making time for it. Pick up a new hobby, join a class, catch up with some friends or just get creative. Whatever you choose, make sure you are enjoying yourself all the way through! After all, our memories come from times of great emotion, and you will most likely not get them if you stick to a tight schedule all the time. Be spontaneous and brave! If it doesn\u2019t sound like you at all, try planning time slots for it.\nFreedom: By accepting ourselves fully, we can begin to express our personality authentically. Experiencing freedom is about having healthy attachments to things and people. If you know that you are on your right path no change could ever scare you \u2013 because it is bringing you closer to your goal! The Spirit Guide Dolphin will show you how to be joyful and free by believing in the divine plan the universe has for you. Try to remember a time you felt this way. A light and happy memory. What were you doing? What started this emotion? Take mental notes of your feelings and use the information you have collected to alter your life. Dolphins can easily enjoy life because they don\u2019t overcomplicate situations. People tend to worry about the present, past, future, and if that isn\u2019t enough \u2013 some probable scenarios too! Well, if we learn how to take it one thing at a time and worry only about the present if it needs more attention \u2013 we will live a much simpler and free life.\nDolphin Spirit Animal Negative Powers\nNaive: Having endless optimism is a sure sign that they need some balance in that area. Optimally, we should all have a realistic approach to life with optimistic expectations. Therefore, when you are working with this spirit guide, keep in mind that life can\u2019t always be fun and games, we need to take responsibility too! Not to forget that a lot of accidents can happen if we are all constantly optimistic. All actions have consequences \u2013 therefore, don\u2019t expect yours to be an exception. As the saying goes: \u201cYou reap what you plant.\u201d.\nInsensitive: Dolphins can be cruel to other animals and their species as well. They bully their food before they eat it, sometimes eat their babies, attack humans, and play around with other fish like they are objects. However, this isn\u2019t done out of hate \u2013 this is merely their way of exploring life and having fun. We should keep in mind that if we are happy at the expense of others, that\u2019s an insensitive decision. Dolphins can let their curiosity and playfulness get the best of them. Higher Intelligence does need more entertainment, but not at the expense of others.\nDolphin as an Animal Totem\nIf you are looking for a reminder to live authentically, that transformation is natural, to love and experience life deeply, to have fun and enjoy yourself \u2013 you should carry a dolphin animal totem. To call upon any of the personality traits that this animal possesses keep a symbol of it around you. It doesn\u2019t need to be anything special \u2013 it can be jewelry, art, symbols, written words, or anything you associate with this animal.\nKeeping a dolphin totem in your home will bring transformation, guidance, higher intelligence, fun, freedom, and empathy to you.\nHow to Call the Animal Spirit of Dolphin for Help?\nBecause this animal embodies both the elements of air and water, you could visit a place with a water source and swim in it. However, if you don\u2019t have any planned vacations and you want to do it from the comfort of your home, you can find a simple guided meditation written below. The most effective way to communicate with your spirit guide is through visualization and listening to your intuition. Your emotions will show you what the dolphin is trying to communicate.\nSimple ways to reconnect with the Animal Spirit Dolphin\nImagine that you are swimming in the ocean. Feel the water surrounding your body, acknowledge every spot it touches and the sensations it creates. Feel the waves, the strong pull of the ocean. The wind is going through your hair, you breathe in the salty air and enjoy the sun above you. When you have fully appreciated this sight of endless water, you decide to be adventurous.\nYou are diving deep into this underwater world. Imagine that you can breathe so you have all the time in the world to explore. There are thousands of different species around you, notice how they\u2019re all connected, how they work together, and how everything looks divinely perfect. Being a part of this world full of wonders and possibilities fills you with excitement and joy. Explore everything that you find interesting \u2013 roam around, you have all the time in the world. In this way, you can experience true freedom and lightness.\nIn this visualization, you can imagine yourself in any way you want. It can be you, but with the ability to breathe underwater, or you as a mermaid, a fish, or simply have no form at all and observe what\u2019s happening. Whatever you choose, make sure you feel safe, protected, marvelous, and free. Once you are ready, you can emerge from the water and enjoy a beautiful sunset.\nGoing through this visualization will enable you to reconnect to the Animal Spirit Dolphin and its knowledge. Now, through this exciting experience, try to find the answers you came for. Ask your guide openly a question. It will make itself known through your intuition or as a symbol in your visualization. Pay close attention to how you feel after you have asked your question. By understanding your emotions, you will find the right answer. If something makes you feel anxious, sad, or worried, try to examine it deeper to find its origin. On the other side, if something makes you happy, it\u2019s a clear sign you are moving in the right direction!\nHow Does an Animal Spirit Make Itself Known?\nSpirit animals come from other realms to bring unique energy into your life. They communicate in a unique language that few of us know. That is why some of their messages go by us unnoticed. We are not adjusted to receive information before we are ready to process it. However, as with any other language, we can learn how to spot it and decode it.\nThere are multiple ways of how your guide can make itself known: in your dreams, visions, and real-life situations. Pay attention to what the setting is when it appears. Anything that you associate with this animal will be used as means of communication. Seeing it in art, literature, social media, products, or being encountered by it in the wild. There are various possibilities, but if we are mindful of our lives, we will notice the important ones.\nHow to Understand Your Spirit Animal\u2019s Message\nOnly you, through your intuition, can decipher the message! You can read the universal symbolism, but you should always rely on your associations. People are universes filled with thoughts and ideas and every part of them is personalized. Keep in mind the qualities this animal embodies and how you feel about them. In what state does it leave you when you receive it?\nWhat were the surroundings, the colors, and the feeling it leaves behind? A single detail can change the meaning of the whole message. Most important of all \u2013 trust your intuition and your gut feeling!\nMeaning of Dolphin in Dreams\nDecoding the messages a guide sends in dreams is no different than the ones in real life. Again. They are highly personal and only you can know for sure what their true meaning is. You can use universal symbolism to guide you, however, it is highly recommended to meditate on it and listen to your higher self.\nHere are some examples of what a dream might mean:\nHowever, here are some examples of what a dolphin\u2019s message might mean:\nIn a social setting \u2013 it may mean that you should work on communication and lightness.\nIf it is at work, that would be an indicator that you need more fun and freedom in your life.\nSwimming with dolphins represents the need for freedom.\nMultiple dolphins swimming together is an omen of happiness through the collective.\nRegardless of the situation, this spirit guide will always relate to freedom, joy, transformation, guidance, intelligence, playfulness, and altruism. Whether it is a problem regarding those qualities or a promise for them, only you can know.\nMeaning of Dolphin in Various Mythologies\nIn Greek mythology, several myths associated with dolphins, portray them as the helpers of humankind. They were also the messengers of Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea, and sometimes did errands for him. They were sacred to both Aphrodite and Apollo.\nIn ancient Rome, the dolphins were bringing the souls of the dead to the Islands of the Blessed; They related these animals to the mystical processes of life, death, and resurrection.\nIt is said that the god Bacchus was captured by pirates. He managed to remove his chains and escape. Then the god turned into a panther, forgave the pirates, and transformed them into dolphins so that from then on, they would help men. This explains why these animals are attracted to humans, boats, and music.\nFor the M\u0101ori People and the Ng\u0101ti Wai of New Zealand, dolphins are viewed as water spirits.\nIn many sculptures from the East, the dolphin is associated with Atargatis, the mother goddess, goddess of vegetation, nourisher of life, and receiver of the dead who would be born again.\nChristianity has adopted several of the Greek myths. The most famous of them is undoubtedly about St. Martinian \u2013 the Hermit. He, to avoid being tempted by a woman, could find no other escape other than to throw himself into the sea. Luckily, a dolphin carried him on its back to the shore."}

Please try again.\nDid You Know That Greece\u2019s National Animal Is The Dolphin?\nOffering Table with dolphins | \u00a9 Klearchos Kapoutsis/Flickr\nEthel Dilouambaka 27 December 2016 View\nThat\u2019s right: the dolphin, a friendly marine creature, is the symbol used to represent Greece \u2013 a fact unknown to many. And while it is unclear as to how the dolphin was chosen, a look at mythological and ancient beliefs may help in understanding why.\nBefore diving head-first into the subject, a small clarification needs to be made. Many people believe Greece\u2019s national animal is the phoenix, which is partially true; the phoenix is Greece\u2019s national bird. And while it may be surprising to have a mythical creature as a national symbol, the country is not the only one; Scotland\u2019s national animal, for example, is the unicorn, but we digress.\nEtymologically speaking, the word \u2018dolphin\u2019 comes from the ancient Greek delphis, itself related to the Greek delphus, or womb, so the animal\u2019s name more or less means \u2018a \u2018fish\u2019 with a womb.\u2019 As such, the dolphin\u2019s role in human culture can be traced back to ancient times, where they appear in many myths.\nIndeed, the Minoan civilization has left proof of the importance of the dolphin through the many murals adorning their palaces, and it seems they were still strongly referenced in mythology by the later Greeks, who had a myth to explain the origin of the dolphin.\nDolphin Frescoe in the Queen\u2019s Megaron, Palace of Knossos, Crete, Greece | \u00a9 H. Zell/WikiCommons\nLegend has it that Dionysus, god of wine and pleasure, had taken on the appearance of a young mortal upon sailing to the island of Naxos in order to not attract attention to himself. But on the way, he overheard the crew conspiring to sell him as a slave. Full of anger, he turned the oars into serpents, and the sailors had no choice but to jump overboard. Poseidon, the god of the sea, took pity on them and transformed them into dolphins, welcoming them into his kingdom while giving them the mission to help seamen in danger.\nBlack figure Kylix (drinking cup) depicting Dionysus crossing the sea, ca. 530 BC | \u00a9 Carole Raddato/Flickr\nThis story demonstrates how Greeks explained the dolphin\u2019s intelligence and altruistic behavior. And in ancient Greece, killing a dolphin was punishable by death, which shows that dolphins were highly revered.\nFurthermore, Homer, in his Hymn to Apollo, depicts how the god turned into a dolphin to explore Greece and find himself a site for his temple. The myth goes on to say he ended up jumping aboard a Cretan ship sailing to Mount Parnassus, on the site where Delphi was located. Historians have actually suggested that dolphins might have been a part of certain rituals in Delphi, as there is archaeological evidence that the site contains what seems to be man-made ponds.\nPlutarch, a Greek philosopher and priest of Apollo at Delphi, also tells the story of Korianos, who pleaded for the life of a dolphin caught in a fishing net. While the dolphin was saved, Plutarch further cites that one day when Korianos was shipwrecked, his life was saved by a dolphin.\nDolphins spotted off the coast of Skiathos | \u00a9 Diego/Flickr\nWhile all these stories may not explain why the dolphin is Greece\u2019s national animal, it clearly shows the mammal\u2019s cultural significance. Today, the country is home to four dolphin species which can sometimes be spotted while on a ferry ride to a Greek island, so take a look the next time you get a chance."}

The new discovery, reported in the journal PLOS ONE by a team led by marine biologist Ana Amaral of Portugal's University of Lisbon, adds to increasing evidence of such cross-breeding commonly leading to new species, even in the wide-open oceans.\nClymene dolphins feed mostly at night when squid and fish come to the surface of the water. The short-snouted dolphin gets its name from the ocean nymph Clymene of Greek mythology. (See \"Dolphins Have 'Names,' Respond When Called.\")\nResearchers initially thought the clymene dolphin was a subspecies of the spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris). However, in 1981, a closer look at the clymene's anatomy revealed it was a distinct species.\nBut experts remained uncertain about the clymene's relationship with its close relatives. Although its outward appearance and behavior are more similar to those of the spinner dolphin, its skull features closely resemble those of the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba).\nDNA Analysis\nTo help solve this mystery, the study scientists analyzed skin samples from 15 clymene dolphins, as well as from 21 spinner and 36 striped dolphins. They collected the DNA from free-ranging dolphins\u2014using special tissue-collecting darts\u2014and from dead, stranded dolphins.\nThe investigators looked at nuclear DNA, which is found in the cell's nucleus and comes from both the mother and father, as well as DNA from their mitochondria\u2014the cell's powerhouse\u2014which possesses its own genes and is passed down solely from the mother.\n\"When I was first analyzing the data I collected, it was very confusing,\" said Amaral.\nThat's because Amaral and colleagues discovered that while the nuclear DNA of the clymene dolphin most resembled that of the spinner dolphin, the mitochondrial DNA was most similar to that of the striped dolphin. (See pictures of other hybrid animals.)\nThis is strong evidence that the clymene dolphin is a naturally occurring hybrid of the spinner and striped dolphins, said Amaral. Continued hybridization may still occur between the clymene dolphin's parent species, although at low levels, the study authors added.\nThe birth of a new species, known as speciation, is often thought to happen when one species splits into two or more isolated populations that diverge as they amass differences over time due to a lack of interbreeding.\nHybrids are usually infertile, with the mule\u2014a cross between a male donkey and a female horse\u2014being the most familiar example of this.\nHybrid Species: How Rare?\nPast studies have shown that hybridization could occasionally lead to fertile offspring and even new species in plants, fishes, insects, and birds.\nTo get a hybrid species, two things need to occur, said evolutionary ecologist Pamela Willis at the University of Victoria in Canada, who did not take part in the study.\n\"You need to have hybrids be as fit as the parental species, able to carve out their own ecological space,\" she explained.\nThen they somehow have to mate with only each other, rather than with either parental species, \"hence allowing them to spin off onto their own, independent evolutionary trajectory and become a species of their own,\" Willis added. \"Both of these conditions are hard to meet.\"\nScientists had thought hybrid speciation was exceptionally rare in mammals. \"Mammals generally are less capable than other types of animals to produce healthy, fertile hybrids,\" Willis said.\nStill, hybrids were not unheard of in cetaceans such as whales and dolphins\u2014both in captivity and in the wild. Since cetaceans have very similar numbers of chromosomes across species, researchers had speculated they could produce viable hybrids more easily than other mammals.\n\"Ironically, one translation of clymene can mean notorious or infamous, and now this dolphin turns out it's living up to its name by being the first marine mammal known to arise through hybrid speciation,\" said study co-author Howard Rosenbaum, a marine biologist at the Wildlife Conservation Society and American Museum of Natural History in New York.\nFuture research will analyze the DNA of these dolphins in greater detail to help deduce how long ago the clymene dolphin arose, Amaral says.\nThis study \"adds to an ever-increasing amount of recent research that indicates that hybridization is a common and important part of animal evolution, facilitating the formation of new species,\" Willis said.\n\"Traditionally, biologists have viewed hybridization as rare and either insignificant, evolution-wise, or serving only to meld species together into one,\" she said. \"We're undergoing a paradigm shift in recognizing the creative role hybridization plays in contributing to animal evolution and diversity.\"\n\"Dolphins could help us better understand this rare form of speciation,\" added Rosenbaum. \"We hope this work highlights the importance of conserving dolphins.\"\nFollow Charles Q.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Orcas (Killer Whales): Facts and Information - Animals", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/orca/", "text": "Common Name : Orca (Killer Whale) Scientific Name : Orcinus orca Type : Mammals Diet : Carnivore Group Name : Pod Average Life Span In The Wild : 50 to 80 years Size : 23 to 32 feet Weight : Up to 6 tons Size relative to a bus : IUCN Red List Status : ? Data deficient LC NT VU EN CR EW EX Least Concern Extinct Current Population Trend : Unknown\nOrcas, or killer whales, are the largest of the dolphins and one of the world's most powerful predators. They're immediately recognizable by their distinctive black-and-white coloring. Smart and social, orcas make a wide variety of communicative sounds, and each pod has distinctive noises that its members will recognize even at a distance. They use echolocation to communicate and hunt, making sounds that travel underwater until they encounter objects, then bounce back, revealing their location, size, and shape.\nHunting and Diet\nThough they often frequent cold, coastal waters, orcas can be found from the polar regions to the Equator. They're at the top of the food chain and have very diverse diets, feasting on fish, penguins, and marine mammals such as seals, sea lions, and even whales, employing teeth that can be four inches long. They are known to grab seals right off the ice. They also eat fish, squid, and seabirds.\nOrcas hunt in deadly pods, family groups of up to 40 individuals. There appear to be both resident and transient pod populations of orcas. These different groups may prey on different animals and use different techniques to catch them. Resident pods tend to prefer fish, while transient pods target marine mammals. All pods use effective, cooperative hunting techniques that some liken to the behavior of wolf packs.\nReproduction\nOrcas are protective of their young, and other adolescent females often assist the mother in caring for them. Mothers give birth every three to ten years, after a 17-month pregnancy. They give birth to one baby at a time, which may nurse for up to two years. In most cases, the bond between juvenile and mother will eventually weaken, and the young orca will go its own way, but in some pods, the juvenile may stay with the pod it was born into its entire life.\nOrcas in Captivity\nOrcas are highly intelligent, social mammals that have long been a part of marine park entertainment, performing shows for audiences. However, it's become increasingly clear that orcas do not thrive in captivity.\nThey have evolved to swim up to 40 miles a day, foraging for food and exercising. They dive 100 to 500 feet, several times a day, every day. Whether they're born in the wild or in captivity, all orcas born have the same innate drive to swim far and dive deep. Artificial enclosures in captivity cannon offer that kind of range to orcas, contributing to boredom and stress. Orcas have been seen to develop stereotypies, also known as zoochosis\u2014repetitive patterns of activity that have no obvious function, which range from self-mutilation to rocking and swaying. Usually related to stress and inappropriate habitats, stereotypic behavior has been documented in orcas in scientific research since the late 1980s.\nIn the wild, orcas live in tight-knit family groups that share a sophisticated, unique culture that is passed down through generations, research has shown. In captivity, orcas are kept in artificial social groups. Captive-born orcas are often transferred between facilities, breaking up social relationships. The stress of social disruption is compounded by the fact that orcas in captivity don\u2019t have the ability to escape conflict with other orcas, or to engage in natural swimming behaviors in pools.\nIn 2013, the documentary film Blackfish laid bare the psychological toll of captivity, through the story of a wild-caught orca named Tilikum who had killed two trainers at SeaWorld Orlando. The film included testimony from former SeaWorld trainers and cetacean specialists, who argued that Tilikum\u2019s stress directly led to his aggression towards humans.\n4:33"}

Some scientists believe that dolphins are able to enjoy the benefits of sleep even while they\u2019re in the water by having one half of their brains alert and the other shut down.\nAs with other whales, the ancestors of dolphins were terrestrial animals that returned to the sea for good. They are entirely pelagic, but they are still mammals. This means they are warm-blooded, need to breathe air and nurse their young with milk from mammary organs.\nTo help the animals move through the water, their bodies became streamlined. Their forelimbs evolved into flippers and their tails evolved into flukes. They lost their hind limbs.\nThe unique shape of a dolphin\u2019s pupils allow it to see well in both air and water.\nThe dolphin\u2019s nostrils moved up to the top of its head and became blowholes.

The smallest, the Dwarf Crocodile, grows to an average 4.9 feet (1.5 meters) in length, and weighs 40 \u2013 71 pounds (18 to 32 kg, or 3 to 5 stone).\nThe largest crocodile is the Saltwater Crocodile, which can grow up to 23.0 ft (7.0 m) in length, weighing 2,200 \u2013 2,600 lb (1,000 to 1,200 kg, or 150 to 190 stone).\nSome species are active during the day, while other species are only nocturnal. Crocodiles mostly hunt at night, are carnivorous animals and very efficient hunters, with excellent hearing and eyesight.\nThey are aggressive, ambush predators, waiting for their prey to venture close to their hiding position, before rushing to attack. A crocs diet mostly includes other animals, reptiles, birds and fish.\nInteresting Crocodile Facts\n1. Crocodiles are carnivores, which generally means they eat only meat. However, a recent study proved they also enjoy an occasional taste of fruit.\nThe 2013 study concluled \u201cthere is little doubt that on occasion, fruit is deliberately consumed, often in large quantities\u201c, along with their normal meat-heavy diets of mammals, birds, and fish.\n2. Crocodiles can go through 4,000 teeth over a lifetime.\nCrocodiles have between 60-110 teeth. When a crocodile loses a tooth, there is a small replacement already on standby. They are able to replace each of their 80 teeth up to 50 times over their lifespan.\n3. A crocodile\u2019s jaws can apply 5,000 pounds of pressure per square inch \u2013 the strongest bite of any animal in the world.\nA human\u2019s jaw only produces 100 pounds of pressure per square inch in comparison. A crocodiles bite is 10 times more powerful than a great white shark.\n4. Crocodiles have relatively weak jaw opening muscles, which can be held shut with just a rubber band, or your bare hands.\nAlthough, that\u2019s not advisable! However, it has enabled scientists to study them closer!\n5. An easy way to tell the difference between a crocodile and an alligator, is when a crocodile closes it\u2019s mouth, all teeth are visible \u2013 as the upper and lower jaw are the same width.\nWhereas an alligator possesses small depressions in the upper jaw for the lower teeth, meaning they are not visible when their mouth is shut.\n6. Another key difference to an alligator is snout shape. Alligators have wider, U-shaped snouts, while crocodiles are more pointed and V-shaped.\nCrocodiles are generally a little more aggressive, and often larger and stronger, too.\n7. The longest crocodile captured alive measured 6.17 m (20.2 ft) and weighed at 1,075 kg (2,370 lb) by a National Geographic team in Agusan del Sur Province, Philippines.\n\u2018Lolong\u2019 was a saltwater crocodile and the largest ever in captivity.\n8. Crocodiles don\u2019t sweat. To keep cool, they open their mouths which is known as \u201cmouth gaping,\u201d very similar to panting.\nThey are not displaying aggression when you see them with their mouths wide open! They often sleep with their mouths wide open to release heat.\n9. Crocodiles are extremely fast in the water, swimming up to speeds of 35 kilometers per hour (22 mph).\nThey use their powerful tails to propel themselves through water, and their feet as rudders to steer.\n10. It\u2019s a common myth that crocodiles can run fast on land. They can \u2018belly run\u2019 up to 17 kilometers per hour (11 mph) for short distances.\nCrocs tire easily on land and prefer to stay in water, coming ashore only to bask in the sun, or to lay eggs.\n11. Crocs can hold their breath underwater for more than an hour.\nCambridge researchers have shown that this ability depends on a tiny fragment of the animal\u2019s haemoglobin, which is the protein that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.\n12. Crocodiles swallow small stones to improve digestion. These stones help grind up the food in their stomachs.\nSwallowing stones (known as \u2018gastroliths\u2019) is especially beneficial for crocodiles that eat their prey whole, or for tougher animals with shells and bones. A gastrolith can remain inside the stomach for years.\n13. The expression to cry \u2018crocodile tears\u2019 (to display insincere or a false display of emotion), derives from crocodiles shedding tears, while they eat their prey.\nWhile this was originally an ancient belief, studies have shown that crocodiles eyes do water while they eat, but not with remorse \u2013 for biological reasons, due to the hisses and huffs during feeding.\n14. Crocodiles have acute senses, an evolutionary advantage that makes them highly successful predators.\nCrocodiles are mainly nocturnal hunters and have excellent night vision. Their sense of smell and hearing are also extremely well developed.\n15. Crocodiles have been known to occasionally cannibalize smaller crocodiles.\nThere have been recorded cases of larger crocodiles eating smaller, or younger crocs.\n16. Crocodiles are ambush and opportunistic predators, capable of preying upon large mammals, such as smaller elephants, hippos, sharks or big cats.\nSome species like the freshwater crocodile will mostly eat fish, while larger species like the saltwater crocodile or the Nile crocodile, will consume buffalo, zebra, deer and wild boar.\n17. Crocodiles have the most acidic stomach of any vertebrate.\nThis allows them to dissolve and digest bones, hooves and horns or shells from their prey.\n18. Crocodiles perform a \u2018death roll\u2019 to overcome prey, clamping on using their jaws, and spinning around powerfully.\nThe spinning motion of the roll disorientates the prey, dragging them under the water and helps separate limbs from the body of larger animals to easily ingest.\n19. Crocodiles vocalize to communicate. The young of some species squeak and grunt, while adult crocs can growl, hiss or roar at each other.\nMany species will also respond to other noises, such as engine noise, gun shots or even people mimicking crocodiles.\n20. Crocodiles can sleep with one eye wide open.\nOnly some other reptiles, birds and dolphins can do the same. They generally sleep with two eyes closed, though.\n21. Larger crocodiles can go for over a year without eating a meal.\nA croc\u2019s metabolism is super efficient, using and storing nearly the entirety of the food it consumes. In extreme circumstances, they are able to shut down and live off their own tissue for a long period of time.\n22. Worldwide, crocodiles are estimated to kill about 1,000 humans per year.\nHundreds of those crocodile attacks occur in Africa, often in small commuinities where they not widely reported.\nCrocodile Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification\nKingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Reptilia Order: Crocodilia Family: Crocodylidae Subfamily: Crocodylinae\nSpecies List & Habitat"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Ten fun facts about beluga whales - Whale & Dolphin Conservation USA", "url": "https://us.whales.org/2016/12/02/ten-fun-facts-about-beluga-whales/", "text": "In another of our guests blogs as part of #whaleweek, Natalie Kyriacou founder and CEO WDC partner, \u2018My Green World\u2019, highlights a few fascinating facts about beluga whales.\nThe beluga whale, or white whale, is an Arctic and sub-Arctic cetacean. Belugas have long been a source of fascination for many, due to their unique white colouring and lack of a dorsal fin. Unfortunately, belugas are one of the most commonly kept cetaceans (whale/dolphin) in captivity and classifed as \u201cnear threatened\u201d on the IUCN red list.\nHere are our top ten facts on the wonderful beluga:\nDespite being a \u2018toothed whale\u2019, beluga whales do not chew their food; instead they swallow their prey whole.\nThe average gestation period (the period between conception and birth) for beluga whales lasts between 14 -15 months. Females whales give birth to a single calf once every three years on average and their newborns are around five ft. long, usually nursing from their mothers for up to two years.\nThe word beluga comes from the Russian word \u201cbielo\u201d meaning white. However, these white whales are born dark gray. It can take up to eight years before they turn completely white.\nThe beluga is able to swim backwards.\nIn 2009, a captive beluga whale rescued a distressed participant of a free diving competition by pushing her to the surface.\nThreats to beluga whales include captivity, climate change, hunting, oil and gas development, and industrial and urban pollution. Polar bears and orcas are known predators of belugas throughout their Arctic range.\nBelugas are sometimes referred to as \u201cmelonheads\u201d due to the bulbous structure that occupies the whale\u2019s forehead. The fatty organ is believed to aid in echolocation (a process in which animals use echoes of their calls to locate and identify objects), and it can be observed changing shape during whale vocalizations. Another nickname belugas have earned for themselves is \u201csea canary\u201d due to the rich and varied vocal range of the beluga. Scientists have documented at least 11 distinct beluga whale sounds, including high-pitched whistles, clicks, mews, bleats, chirps, and bell-like tones.\nThe vertebrae in a beluga\u2019s neck is not fused together, giving them the unusual ability to turn its head up, down and side-to-side. The adaptation is thought to help them target their prey in areas that are full of ice or silt.\nBeluga whales living in captivity have been reported to mimic the speech of their human handlers. Noc, a beluga whale who lived at the National Marine Mammal Foundation in San Diego for 30 years, was one of the first belugas observed to exhibit this type of behavior. Noc managed to convince a human diver to climb out of the whale\u2019s tank when he heard what he thought was another person instructing him to leave. It turned out that the sound had actually been Noc mimicking the word \u201cout\u201d.\nBelugas are highly social creatures and generally live together in small groups known as pods. These vocal communicators are often found in the Arctic Ocean\u2019s coastal waters travelling, foraging and socializing in both small and large pods.\nBelugas and all whales are negatively affected by human activity, including increased development, shipping, oil and gas production and transport, indirect and direct adverse effects from commercial fishing gear and operations, pollution, and habitat destruction and alteration. An increasing concern in marine habitats is noise, which can cause damage to a whale\u2019s hearing and damage its ability to communicate, navigate, and locate prey.\nWDC is grateful to our guest bloggers and value their contributions to whale conservation.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "10 Fun Facts About Bottlenose Dolphins - Dolphin Seafari", "url": "https://snorkelshellisland.com/bottlenose-dolphins-fun-facts/", "text": "Everything You Want to Know About Bottlenose Dolphins\nBottlenose dolphins are incredibly recognizable sea creatures, known for their gentleness and approachability. Part of our ability to recognize them comes from their friendliness towards human beings and the ways that we have learned to interact with them. Our natural curiosity motivates us to learn as many interesting facts about bottlenose dolphins that we can.\nIf you\u2019ve ever wanted to know more about this amazing breed, the fun facts below will serve as a starting point. Once you know more about what makes bottlenose dolphins so special, you may even want to swim alongside them on your next beach vacation!\nWhy Are They Called Bottlenose?\nBottlenose dolphins get their name from the shape of their short and stubby snout, which is also known as the rostrum. Even though this is the primary way that you can recognize and spot a bottlenose dolphin from a distance or out in the wild, there are many other defining characteristics that make them so special.\nThe classic bottlenose shape is one of the first things you might see when you join a tour with Dolphin Seafari. Our expert tour guides not only teach you where to look for bottlenose dolphins in the wild, but they\u2019ll even prepare you to safely swim alongside these incredible animals! You\u2019ll get much more than just a picture from the shore when you join our excursions!\nFun Facts About Bottlenose Dolphins\nAre you eager for more trivia about these awesome mammals? We\u2019ve picked out 10 of our favorite fun facts about bottlenose dolphins in the list below. You\u2019ll be a dolphin expert in no time!\n1. Bottlenose dolphins are one of the most studied marine species in the world.\nDolphins are highly intelligent, friendly, and charismatic. As a result of their natural curiosity, dolphins readily approach humans and other creatures to investigate their surroundings. This personality trait has allowed marine biologists and scientists to get up close and personal to the species.\nBottlenose dolphins also inhabit many coastal areas, and they swim into places like bays and estuaries. Their behavior makes them more accessible than other types of sea creatures. This means marine experts can easily observe, track, and protect them.\n2. They\u2019re protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\nEven though bottlenose dolphins aren\u2019t considered an endangered species in the United States, they do benefit from protection under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. As is true for any wild animal, dolphins can be susceptible to environmental stressors, pollution, sickness, and boating or fishing incidents.\nAdditionally, the Marine Mammal Protection Act prohibits harassment from humans and outlaws behavior that interrupts their natural feeding behaviors. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to book a dolphin tour from a trusted provider like Dolphin Seafari. We always prioritize the safety, health, and wellbeing of animals in their natural habitat.\n3. Bottlenose dolphins must come to the surface to breathe.\nUnlike human beings, dolphins aren\u2019t involuntary breathers. This means that they don\u2019t breathe in oxygen automatically. Instead, they must consciously swim to the surface in order to inhale and get the oxygen that they need.\nFor bottlenose dolphins, this practice happens about once every seven minutes. When they do surface, a muscular flap that protects their blowhole uncovers so that they can take deep, long breaths. Dolphins\u2019 lungs are much more efficient than humans at exchanging the air in their lungs for fresh and breathable air.\nJust imagine if you had to think and act every time you need a simple breath! Dolphins are constantly at work, even while swimming and resting.\n4. Because of their breathing patterns, dolphins never fully sleep.\nPerhaps one of the most shocking facts about dolphins is that they\u2019re never totally asleep! This is a direct result of their breathing behavior, which is not a reflex like it is in human beings. One portion of a dolphin\u2019s brain must maintain consciousness at all times so that they can continue to receive air.\nIn addition to their need to stay semi-alert, dolphins only close one eye during their sleep. Not only does this activate a portion of their brains for breathing, but it also allows them to be mindful of dangerous predators in their environment.\n5. Dolphins are most readily found in tropical or warm waters which means that they may need to occasionally migrate or change locations.\nIn particular, dolphins that usually live in higher latitudes display common migration behaviors to seek out warmer water. Dolphins may also migrate due to other fish or feeding activities.\nWhen dolphins stay close to one coastal area, they are said to be \u201clocal residents\u201d of that particular coastline. Local dolphins can be spotted in places like Georgia, Florida, Texas, and California. Occasionally, local groups of dolphins may overlap with one another, creating a larger population of dolphins in a given area.\n6. Bottlenose dolphins are extremely social creatures.\nOne of the things that makes bottlenose dolphins so unique is how social they are. Dolphins engage with one another in a variety of ways, including making specific sounds, squeaks, and high-pitched noises. They also regularly bump and swim into one another as a form of communication.\nDolphins continue this social activity throughout their lives, which means that both young and old dolphins can be observed chasing each other and using their food sources (mostly fish) as a means of play.\nIn terms of human behavior, dolphins\u2019 natural curiosity makes them eager to follow boats, ride in wakes, and jump or swim alongside humans. This is one of the characteristics that make dolphin-watching so memorable!\n7. Dolphins can identify one another with certain sounds.\nBecause sound is such an important form of communication for dolphins, it\u2019s vital that they have certain signals to know who is who. Not only does this allow them to recognize family members or others in their pod, but it\u2019s also helpful when recognizing danger.\nEvery dolphin is born with a one-of-a-kind whistle that serves as their primary identification system. Fortunately, bottlenose dolphins have a keen sense of hearing. This means that they can quickly pick up on these identifying whistles.\nEcholocation (the bouncing of sound waves against certain objects) is also vital to a dolphin\u2019s sense of community as they maintain awareness of their surroundings.\n8. Bottlenose dolphins are serious eaters!\nWhen it comes to a dolphin\u2019s diet\u2013they\u2019re not picky! Dolphins will feast on anything from a variety of fish species, shrimp, and squid. What is available in a given area may affect what they choose, but dolphins consume a wide variety every day at the seafood buffet.\nIn fact, bottlenose dolphins regularly consume about 13-15 pounds of food per day! Pregnant dolphins eat considerably more and consume as much as 8% of their body weight in food sources per day. Fortunately, dolphins\u2019 stomachs are compartmentalized so that whatever they eat can be digested rapidly as a way to make room for the next snack.\n9. Pregnancy in bottlenose dolphins lasts about 12 months.\nFrom what marine scientists and researchers can gather from observation, the gestation period for bottlenose dolphins is up to one year. After a calf is born, a female dolphin may become pregnant again in roughly 3-5 years. During the time a mother dolphin is pregnant, she eats for two (quite literally) by doubling her food intake.\nOnce a calf is born, the mother and baby swim in \u201cbaby position.\u201d This means that the calf follows closely behind the mother during swimming and travel. The mother dolphin always surfaces first, with the calf following closely behind.\n10. Bottlenose dolphins can jump more than 15 feet high.\nAs a form of play, dolphins are often seen jumping energetically out of the water. Amazingly, many bottlenose dolphins can propel themselves up to 16 feet in the air! Depending on the dolphin\u2019s size and strength, this distance may be even higher.\nWhen they\u2019re in captivity, dolphins love to put on a show! Much of this is in the form of jumping in high arcs out of the water.. This behavior is one that humans love to capture in pictures and videos.\nBottlenose Dolphins in Florida\nWhile there are a few different types of dolphins in Florida waters, bottlenose dolphins are by far the most common. When you\u2019re oceanspotting, you can recognize the bottlenose species by their classic snout shape and their coloring. Bottlenose dolphins have blue-gray skin on top with lighter coloring on their bellies and sides.\nThe average size for bottlenose dolphins near the Florida coast is about 6-12 feet in length. No matter if they\u2019re male or female, young or old, you can count on bottlenose dolphins to play, squeak, and put on an amazing show!\nThe Best Way to See Bottlenose Dolphins in Panama City Beach\nAre you planning an upcoming trip to Panama City Beach, Florida?

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphin facts and information - Whale & Dolphin Conservation Australia", "url": "https://au.whales.org/whales-dolphins/facts-about-dolphins/", "text": "How many species of dolphins are there?\nCurrently there are 49 dolphin and porpoise species which are grouped into six families: the oceanic dolphin family is by far the largest with 38 members; the porpoise family has seven members; and there are four river dolphin families, each containing just one species. However, classification is not an exact science and as more information and discoveries come to light, deliberations will continue and some dolphin species are likely to be further split into more than one species and/or subspecies.\nNames and nick names can certainly be confusing; there are eight dolphin names that feature the word \u2018whale\u2019, including pilot whales, killer whales, false killer whales and melon-headed whales. Two species have whale and dolphin in their name; the northern right whale dolphin and the southern right whale dolphin \u2013 no wonder both the public and scientists get confused!\nWhere do dolphins live?\nDolphins live in the world\u2019s seas and oceans and in some rivers too. Some dolphin species prefer to live in coastal areas, others like shallow water but prefer to live away from the coast close to patches of shallower water which are located further out to sea.\nOrcas are the only dolphins which live in the Arctic and Antarctic. Their large size means that they have more protection against the harsh cold of the freezing seas. Most dolphins prefer tropical and temperate waters as they are warm-blooded mammals and so it is easier for them to regulate their body temperature in these environments.\nCan dolphins live in fresh water?\nRiver dolphins such as the Amazon River dolphin (boto) and South Asian river dolphins live their lives only in fresh water rivers and lakes, a long way from the ocean; they are sometimes known as the \u2018true river dolphins\u2019. There is another group of so-called river dolphins; these are fresh water populations of marine dolphin species some of whom permanently live in fresh water rivers, these include the tucuxi (or sotalia), the Guiana dolphin, Irrawaddy dolphin and the finless porpoise."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Interesting Facts About the Adaptation of a Bottlenose Dolphin - Animal ...", "url": "https://animalsake.com/bottlenose-dolphin-adaptations", "text": "This AnimalSake write-up will help in evaluating how bottlenose dolphins have been able to survive in the depths of marine biome with a number of predators, including humans, constantly on the look for them. Continue to read for some interesting details about this water mammal.\nBottlenose dolphins belong to the genus Tursiops, and are the most well-known members of the Delphinidae family. They are the most famous species of dolphins. According to the recent study, there are two species of bottlenose dolphins; the common bottlenose dolphin and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin. They are known to inhabit warm and temperate waters.\nContrary to popular belief, dolphin is not a fish, but is a mammal. Like other mammals, they are warm blooded. They feed themselves on fish and crustaceans. Various physical features of these dolphins help them survive in the ocean environment. The behavioral features also have an important role to play in bottlenose dolphin adaptations.\nPhysical Adaptations of Bottlenose Dolphins\nThe bottlenose dolphins have a spindle shaped body, due to which they are able to move quickly through water. As a matter of fact, in case of danger, they are known to be able to swim as fast as 20 miles per hour. Their sleek and streamlined bodies help them in being agile.\nIt is the skin color of these dolphins, which protects them in their habitat. They have gray to dark gray color on their backs which fades to white color on the underside (on lower jaws and bellies). This dual type of color enables them to camouflage themselves in the environment and protect from the predators. They can catch the prey easily. If one has to look at the dolphins from the surface of the water, then the gray color of the dolphin merges with the dark black surface. On the other hand, the lighter color merges with the bright sea surface, which again helps in keeping the dolphins safe from its predators.\nThe dolphins have to come out of water for breathing. They use the single blowhole to breathe. After they breathe, they go underwater. Once they are underwater they hold their breath. When they are about to come back to the surface, they slowly start to exhale. There is a flap which covers the blowhole and makes it watertight, which ensures water does not go in through the blowhole.\nThe dolphins are known to have a hypodermis, a layer of fat and fibrous connective tissue, under the layer of the dermis. It is this layer which gives them the shape they have, and helps in swimming efficiently. The extra calories are stored in this layer, which in turn help, when there is shortage of food. The hypodermis is also helpful in preventing heat loss from the body, which is necessary for thermoregulation. The thickness of this layer depends on the season of the year, and on the size and health of the dolphin.\nLike all marine mammals, the bottlenose dolphins are also known to have a physiology, which helps them in adapting themselves well, while diving. When they are diving, the heart rate slows down, which helps in conserving oxygen. At the same time, the blood supply to the heart and brain is increased, and the supply is reduced to muscle tissues, which can stand low supply of oxygen. They have the protein molecules, that can store oxygen in the tissues.\nTheir elongated upper and lower jaw helps them in catching their prey. Also the bottlenose helps them in protecting themselves from sharks.\nBehavioral Adaptations of Bottlenose Dolphins\nWhen they are looking for food, they are known to use the echolocation method. Using this method they make the sound, and listen to the echo, and catch their prey. They continue to make the sound, till they are in proximity to the prey, and hear the echo to get hold of the prey. They are known to live on squids, octopus, small fish, and small crabs. Although they use the echolocation method to catch their prey, they are known to have very good eyesight both above water as well as under water, which protects them from predators and enemies.\nLike all mammals, these dolphins also give birth to live young ones. Normally a female dolphin gives birth to baby dolphins once every three years. The birth of the calves often coincides with the months of May through July, when the temperature reaches about 85 degrees Fahrenheit. You will be surprised to know that other than the mother dolphin, there is another dolphin, which helps in taking care of the dolphin. It can either be a male or a female dolphin, and is the only other dolphin allowed near the young calf. The young ones are often seen closer to their mothers. Another interesting trait of these dolphins is that they never lose touch with their mothers, as they come visit them at regular intervals, after separating from their mothers.\nAlthough nature has aided dolphin adaptations, their population is dwindling due to their predators, especially humans. Along with humans, the climatic changes along with pollution are taking their toll, and the adaptations of these species cannot be helpful for long. Therefore, measures will have to be taken to protect these water mammals."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "What\u2019s the Difference Between a Dolphin and Shark?", "url": "https://www.americanoceans.org/facts/dolphin-vs-shark/", "text": "Dolphins and sharks are pretty similar looking sea creatures. From the surface of the water, you may even have a hard time determining which is which.\nSo what\u2019s the difference between a dolphin and a shark? And how can you tell them apart? Keep reading to learn more!\nSimilarities and Differences\nThough their similar color and shape may confuse you upon first glance, there are many characteristics you can use to help distinguish a dolphin from a shark.\nFirst and foremost, one of the biggest differences between these animals is that they are different kinds of animals.\nSpecifically, sharks are fish, meaning they have gills, breathe underwater and are cold-blooded. On the other hand, dolphins are mammals, much like humans, meaning they breathe air, are warm-blooded, and nurse their offspring.\nYou may know that another defining characteristic of mammals is their ability to give birth to live young. However, interestingly, most sharks give birth to their young as well.\nAlthough, this does not mean that they are mammals, seeing as they lack the other necessary characteristics to match this description.\nAnother difference between these two animals is their behavioral traits. Dolphins are very social animals and travel, live, and hunt in pods.\nAdditionally, they are quite vocal and use sound to communicate and navigate. Contrastingly, sharks are not very social and are typically alone.\nOn top of this, they are not capable of making noise in the same way dolphins do. Lastly, there are a few physical differences between dolphins and sharks.\nPerhaps the most well-known difference is that sharks have gills, as mentioned above, while dolphins have blowholes.\nBoth of these features allow the animals to breathe, however, they look quite different and are located on different parts of the body.\nSpecifically, gills are located on the side of the shark\u2019s body, near the head, while blowholes are located on the top of the dolphin\u2019s head.\nAdditionally, the tail fins of these animals are different. Sharks have vertical tail fins, which move side-to-side, while dolphins have horizontal fins, which move up and down.\nNow that we\u2019ve addressed the differences between these animals, let\u2019s talk about a few similarities.\nOf course, sharks and dolphins are both greyish in color. However, other physical similarities they have include a lighter underside, dorsal fins (located on the back), and pectoral fins (located on their sides).\nAlso, as mentioned above, both dolphins and (most) sharks give birth to live young.\nSharks and dolphins also have similar lifespans, usually living about 20-30 years. However, some species of dolphins can live to be up to 40 or older!\nHow to Tell Dolphins and Sharks Apart\nThough there are many differences we\u2019ve covered, you may be wondering how you can tell dolphins and sharks apart quickly\nDespite both sea creatures having dorsal fins, it is possible to distinguish between them if you see a fin above the surface of the water.\nSpecifically, the dorsal fins of dolphins are sharp at the tip and arc backwards. On the other hand, the dorsal fins on sharks angle backward slightly and stand up straight in the back.\nSimilarly, though both animals have pectoral fins, it is possible for sharks to have as many as four. In other words, sharks may have a second fin on the side of their bodies.\nLastly, as mentioned previously, sharks and dolphins swim differently. Watching the way the animal swims can help you identify which one it is.\nIf the tail of the animal seems to be moving up and down, it is likely a dolphin. However, if it is moving back and forth, it is probably a shark.\nFinal Thoughts\nOverall, it is clear to see how different sharks and dolphins are from each other. However, it is understandable why they may be confused from time to time.\nSo, the next time you see a grey fin peak out of the water, don\u2019t panic, use your marine animal knowledge to identify if it belongs to a dolphin or a shark!"}

Its coloring varies enormously as it grows, and is usually classified into age-dependent phases known as two-tone, speckled, mottled, and fused. Calves are a fairly uniform gray-white, with one or no spots. Despite the name, not all individuals of this species exhibit spots on their bodies, though many of them do. However, some dolphins are so densely spotted, that may seem to be completely white from afar. As a general rule, calf dolphins normally lack these spots, developing them as they grow up. On the other hand, those living in the far-offshore waters of the Gulf Stream are often smaller and without spots on their body."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the False Killer Whale images!\nThe false killer whale is a fast and agile swimmer, a peak predator, and a highly intelligent and social animal.\nThe name obviously arises from the similarities between orcas and false killer whales. Until 1862, early taxonomists classified both species within the same genus. Despite the name, this species is sometimes mistaken for the bottle-nosed dolphin or short-finned pilot whale. It is now under threat in certain parts of its range.\n5 Incredible False Killer Whale Facts!\nThe false killer whale is a highly social species that forms pods of up to 500 members, some of which can include oceanic dolphins. These pods sometimes break up into smaller groups of around 10 to 30 while hunting.\nThe false killer whale has a diverse range of vocalizations that include whistles, squeals, and a pulsating noise. Although it is not entirely clear what they\u2019re saying, this species has so many different sounds at its disposal that experts have suggested it must be a complex form of communication. It is far more diverse, say, than human sounds.\nOne of the more amazing facts of its intelligence is that the false killer whale will ride in the wake of a ship for extra speed and actually leap out over the wake. Very few other animals make this leaping motion in a ship\u2019s wake.\nLarge numbers of false killer whales will sometimes become accidentally stranded on beaches, possibly while hunting for food. This can make for a very grim spectacle.\nThe false killer whale will sometimes snatch food right out of fishing lines. However, it has also been known to offer food to divers.\nFalse Killer Whale Scientific Name\nThe scientific name of these animals is Pseudorca crassidens. Pseudorca obviously means pseudo (or false) orca, while crassidens means thick toothed in Latin. The false killer whale is the only currently living member of its genus (although two more species are known from the fossil record). It belongs to the family of Delphinidae, making it closely related to oceanic dolphins and orcas.\nObviously, as a cetacean, this is a type of mammal to its core, because it gives birth to live young and produces milk. The cetaceans actually evolved from hoofed mammals some 50 million years ago. An early cetacean ancestor probably looked like the modern deer-like chevrotain, but the hippos are the closest living relative.\nFalse Killer Whale Appearance\nThese animals actually looks a bit like a cross between a dolphin (with its rather sleek, ergonomic body) and a killer whale (because of the rounded head with no beak). Nevertheless, you probably wouldn\u2019t mistake them for an orca. The false killer whale has a much smaller dorsal fin and a distinct curved hump on the flippers. And instead of the black and white coloration of the orca, the false killer whale has a black or dark gray coloration with a streak of white along the side. This makes it look more like an oceanic dolphin.\nThe male of this species measures up to 20 feet long and 3,000 or 4,000 pounds in weight, while the female measures a slightly less formidable 16 feet. This is around the size of a pickup truck.\nFalse killer whales swimming together stefan seiden/Shutterstock.com\nFalse Killer Whale Distribution, Population, and Habitat\nThese animals have a truly massive territory that graces every continent except for Antarctica. Due to its preference for temperate and warm tropical waters, this species has a natural range that extends around the coasts of Africa, India, the Pacific Asia region (including Australia and New Zealand), the American Pacific Coast as far as Hawaii, the Caribbean Sea, and the Mediterranean. It has also been found as far north as the North Sea around Britain and Norway, China and Japan, Pacific Canada, and Alaska. They typically dive to around 2,000 feet in search of food, but as a mammal it must come up occasionally for air.\nExact population figures are unknown, but local populations in the low tens of thousands have been observed in certain regions such as China and Japan. Despite its wide range, this species is actually near threatened. The biggest threats to its survival are the depletion of prey, injury or death from net entanglements, and environmental pollution. Even though the United States has banned many harmful chemicals, pollution can still travel the world\u2019s currents from other regions. Since this species occupies the top of the food chain, it is exposed to toxins that accumulate at lower levels.\nFalse Killer Whale Predators and Prey\nLike many dolphins, these animals feed almost exclusively on fish, squid, and to a lesser extent marine mammals like seals and sea lions. Some of the most common fish prey include yellowfin tuna, perch, salmon, and yellowtail. The false killer whale will attack prey by catching them in its mouth as it swims around at high speeds. It will then shake the prey to death and peel off the skin with its sharp teeth.\nThe false killer whale has few natural predators in the wild apart from maybe sharks and other killer whales, but calves are mostly defenseless and much more prone to attack. They rely on the protection of their mother and the entire group. Humans do sometimes hunt false killer whales but not in particularly large numbers or on an industrial scale.\nFalse Killer Whale Reproduction and Lifespan\nLike many other cetaceans, the false killer whale has a rather complex reproductive cycle that involves long maturation and development times. The breeding season lasts all year long but seems to peak in later winter or early spring, during which time both males and females will have multiple mating partners. After copulation, the female undertakes a long and difficult pregnancy that lasts up to 16 months. It\u2019s no surprise then that she only produces a single calf at a time and does not conceive again for around seven years.\nThe young calf emerges from the womb with the ability to swim on its own. However, it will stay with its mother for up to two years while it receives protection, tutelage, nutrients from the milk, and valuable survival skills. It takes around eight to 11 years for females to mature and eight to 10 years for males. This development time sets them up for a long and successful life, usually lasting around 60 years in the wild. Females begin to experience menopause between 44 and 55 years of age.\nFalse Killer Whales in Fishing and Cooking\nThe false killer whale is rarely hunted for food or other resources with a few notable exceptions. In some Japanese villages, people herd them with boats into a bay or on a beach to prevent their escape. People in the eastern tropical Pacific region may also consume their meat.\nView all 62 animals that start with F"}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Pink Amazon River Dolphin | Animal Pictures and Facts | FactZoo.com", "url": "https://www.factzoo.com/mammals/pink-amazon-river-dolphin.html", "text": "The pink or Amazon river dolphin is a rare species of aquatic mammal, obviously characterized by its pink skin. They are between 8.25 ft (2.5 m) and 9.75 ft (3 m) long and usually weigh around 200 lbs (90 kg). They have long beaks and tiny eyes. Vision is limited in the muddy waters of the rivers and they probably rely more on echolocation (sonar) than their vision. Instead of a dorsal fin, this species has more of a simple ridge on their backs. As with many species the male is usually larger than the female.\nThe pink river dolphin is usually found in the tributaries and main river flow of the Orinoco and the Amazon in South America. The reason for the characteristically pink skin is not thoroughly understood. Some scientists believe that the presence of capillaries near to their skin gives them the pinkish tone that they\u2019re known for. Other factors which could contribute to the skin color include the animal\u2019s age, temperature of the water and even the chemical make-up of the water especially in relation to the iron levels. Individuals have varying shades of color, with some being mostly light gray, and some mottled with gray and pink patches or spots.\nThe pink river dolphins\u2019 diet consists mainly of crustaceans, catfish and small fish. They have a unique characteristic in the shape of their unfused vertebrae in their neck which allows them to turn their heads 180 degrees. This characteristic gives them greater flexibility when looking for food and swimming in shallow waters.\nDolphins are well known for their intelligence but the intelligence level of the pink river dolphin is not well known. Physically, the ratio of brain mass to body weight compares in such a way which would suggest that they\u2019re very similar to the bottlenose dolphin, which is known for its intelligence. This species is especially known for its almost friendly, curious nature and the dolphins are able to quickly learn to associate man with fun, danger or other traits.\nCalves are born between June and July usually. When born they\u2019re approximately 30 inches (75 cm) long and weigh just over 22 lbs (1 kg). The gestation period prior to their both is somewhere between nine and twelve months although we don\u2019t have an exact figure. The dolphins sexual maturity is determined by size rather than age, when females are around 5.5 ft (1.7 m) long and the males are around 7 ft (2 m) long they are said to be sexually mature."}

Evolving from a four-legged land animal that developed an affinity with water some 50 million years ago, these amazingly friendly beasts are extremely fast swimmers that glide into our lives bearing extraordinary messages. A highly respected marine individual that at times behaves like a human, let\u2019s delve deeper at the wonderful dolphin spirit animal.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question dolphins are smarter than humans as they play more.\u201d \u2013 Albert Einstein\nDo you have a Dolphin Spirit Animal? If so, what does this mean for you? Dolphins are one of the most beloved animals on the planet, and it\u2019s no surprise that they are often considered spirit animals. They are intelligent, playful, and compassionate creatures that can teach us a lot about ourselves. In this blog post, we will explore the meaning and symbolism of Dolphin Spirit Animals, as well as the messages they may be sending us.\nDolphin spirit animal meaning\nAlong with an endearing carefree nature, dolphins are known to get along with other species with ease. Admired and well-liked by many, their serene and playful personality easily draws humans toward them for they are believed to be powerful spirit animals that help us navigate the varying phases of life.\nStaying Connected with Loved Ones\nA popular attraction at water parks where they are commonly seen cheerfully performing to their trainer\u2019s prompts, these awesome aquatic creatures use particular sounds to communicate with each other with great proficiency. Regarded as one of the most important tools in any relationship, the dolphin would present itself into our lives to remind us of the value of communication and how our lives would be so much different if only we\u2019ll learn how to take advantage of it effectively.\nRecognition and Acceptance\nFound in all the waters of the planet except in the frigid Arctic and Antarctic oceans, these extremely smart animals are believed to possess a deep level of understanding of the environment. Swimming endlessly in the vast deep, the dolphin teaches us the importance of being compassionate to others and how living harmoniously with a range of species makes life more gratifying and fun.\nFacing Our Fears\nKnown to stand its ground in the presence of predators, this highly tolerant sea creature would wade into our lives in times when we require courage and inner strength. They tell us that while there is nothing wrong with avoiding confrontation, there are times when facing challenges and provocations head-on are called for.\nTogether We Are Stronger\nInstinctively good-natured and is welcoming towards a range of species, it doesn\u2019t come as a surprise that the dolphin is seen as a peaceful spirit guide in many cultures. Regarded as a symbol of peace and harmony, these gentle creatures serve as our reminder about the beauty of leading a life of grace by treating the people around us with affection and care. Gifted with sonar which they use to identify and send warnings about a predator that\u2019s nearby, they have been observed to work together to protect their pods which represent our need to keep those who are most dear to us from harm. Not only does this strengthen the level of trust within our social group but also enhances our sense of intimacy and friendship.\nPerception and Knowledge\nKnown for their incredible ability to recognize themselves in the mirror and to assign each other a name, dolphins are no doubt among the most intelligent creatures on the planet. They represent our potential for high levels of intelligence that we often use to communicate proficiently with others, create lasting relationships, and generate success.\nA Jolly Good Fellow\nHighly sociable and intensely curious, the dolphin\u2019s playful nature has driven our fondness for them as they rarely hesitate to approach and share lighthearted moments with us. Often appearing in times of great stress and hardship, dolphins remind us that we should never let go of our curious and childlike nature as it will lead us towards the path of lifelong happiness.\nPower animal\nKnown for being remarkably social, dolphins live in large groups that can, at times, consist of up to 1,000 members. Teaching us about the importance of living in tune with our environment, this power animal speedily swims into our lives to remind us that proper communication resonates with positivity, better understanding, and goodwill.\nGiven an amazing ability to hold their breath underwater for up to 15 minutes, these lovable mammals still need to come to the surface to breathe. Deeply connected with the power of breath that leads to emotional release and ultimately spiritual growth, the dolphin directs us to the path of letting go of our suppressed negative emotions. Although it is most of the time painful to completely experience the feelings of sadness, anger, and grief, this caring creature would come into our consciousness to remind us to breathe deeply and breathe out with force and allow ourselves to let go of those unwanted feelings and emotions.\nDolphin Totem Animal\nInherently lovable, curious, and friendly, dolphins are all about having fun and enjoying life. By having this affectionate creature as your totem animal, you are gifted with the capacity to share endless amounts of tenderness and warmth with your loved ones, particularly with your family. You are more likely to feel empathy for the weak and it drives you to be a selfless person who\u2019s willing to sacrifice your happiness and comfort for the good of others. The dolphin\u2019s courage helps inspire us to be confident in our abilities and provides us with the strength to always lend a hand to those in need of emotional sustenance.\nGraceful and ever pleasant, the dolphin totem allows you to capture everyone\u2019s attention with your smooth and elegant presence, all while providing you with kindness and compassion to use your gifts for helping others. Lovely yet absolutely fearless, the dolphin totem encourages us to remain strong-willed and to never cease reaching for our dreams with kindness, beauty, and love.\n\u201cAmong the sea-fishes many stories are told about the dolphin, indicative of his gentle and kindly nature\u2026. It appears to be the fleetest of all animals, marine and terrestrial, and it can leap over the masts of large vessels.\u201d \u2013Aristotle\nWhat does it mean to dream of dolphins?\nDolphins are often considered messengers of joy, love, and happiness. If you dream of dolphins, it may be a sign that you need to let go of some negative emotions and embrace the lighter side of life. Dolphins can also symbolize freedom, playfulness, and innocence. They remind us to enjoy life\u2019s simple pleasures and to not take ourselves too seriously.\nDolphins are also known for their compassionate nature. They are often seen as a symbol of healing and helping others. If you have Dolphin as your spirit animal, it may be a sign that you are meant to help others in some way. You may have the ability to heal emotional wounds or to spread joy and happiness to those around you.\nA dolphin dream is an indication of the dreamer\u2019s emotional nature and the need for more light-heartedness. Dolphin dreams are also a sign of healing and helping others. If you have Dolphin as your spirit animal, it may mean that you have the ability to heal emotional wounds or spread joy and happiness to those around you. Dolphin dreams may also mean that the dreamer is in need of more joy and happiness in their life.\nThe spiritual meaning in different cultures\nIn some cultures, dolphins are seen as spiritual messengers. They are often associated with water spirits and can be thought of as intermediaries between the human and spirit worlds.\nNative Americans see the dolphin as a symbol of strength, power, and grace. They believe that dolphins can help us connect with the spirit world and teach us about our own spiritual nature.\nFor the Christian culture, the dolphin means the freedom of the spirit. Dolphin dreams can be a sign that you are meant to break free from any chains holding you back and spread joy in life. Dolphins also represent kindness, compassion, playfulness, and innocence.\nIn Japanese culture, dolphins mean good luck and protection against evil spirits or demons because they are seen as spiritual guardians who protect us from harm by helping us find our way back home when we get lost at sea.\nIn Celtic culture, the dolphin stands for love, loyalty, and friendship. Dolphin dreams may represent a strong bond between friends or family members who have been separated by distance but still remain close at heart because they share their feelings openly with one another through song, dance, and other forms of artistic expression.\nIn Chinese culture, the dolphin means peace, tranquility, and harmony. Dolphin dreams are often associated with happiness, joyfulness, and carefree living as well as compassion for others in need or distress.\nThe Dolphin\u2019s spiritual meaning can also be found in many different cultures throughout history including Ancient Rome where it was seen as an animal that could bring good luck to those who saw it swimming near shorelines during storms; Greece where dolphins were considered sacred creatures from Poseidon (the god of water) himself and Egypt where Dolphin dreams were said to be a sign of good fortune and prosperity coming your way. Dolphin symbolism also appears in Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, and Islam.\nConclusion\nSecond only to humans in terms of intelligence, dolphins are truly wonderful creatures. While having them as your spirit guide easily awakens your fun-loving, childlike nature, these charming and adorable mammals can also grant you the courage to face your fears as well as the strength to keep your loved ones away from danger. Not only will it impart intelligence at tremendous levels and enhance your ability to communicate well, but the mere presence of the dolphin spirit animal would often come out of the deep waters to simply bring us a breath of fresh air."}

Although they live in the ocean, dolphins aren't fish. Like whales, they are mammals. They are warm-blooded, breathe air through their lungs, and give birth to live young, which drinks its mother's milk, just like mammals that live on land.\nDolphins breathe through a blowhole located on the top of their heads. They must come to the water's surface to breathe air out and take in fresh air. How often they do this depends on how active they are. Dolphins can stay underwater up to 15 minutes without coming to the surface for air!\nMost dolphins give birth to one (sometimes two) babies about every three years. The dolphin baby, who is born after a 12-month gestation period, is called a calf. Female dolphins are cows and males are bulls. The calf drinks its mother's milk for up to 18 months.\nSometimes another dolphin stays nearby to help with the birth. Although it is occasionally a male dolphin, it is most often a female and either gender is referred to as the \"auntie.\"\nThe auntie is the only other dolphin the mother will allow around her baby for awhile.\nDolphins are often confused with porpoises. Although they are similar in appearance, they are not the same animal. Porpoises are smaller with smaller heads and shorter snouts. They are also more shy than dolphins and typically don't swim as close to the surface of the water.\nThere are over 30 species of dolphin. The bottlenose dolphin is probably the most popular and easily-recognizable species. The killer whale, or orca, is also a member of the dolphin family.\nDolphins are highly intelligent, social creatures who swim in groups called pods. They communicate with each other through a series of clicks, whistles, and squeaks, along with body language. Each dolphin has its own unique sound that it develops shortly after birth.\nThe average lifespan of a dolphin varies based on the species. Bottlenose dolphins live about 40 years. Orcas live about 70.\nLearning About Dolphins\nDolphins are probably one of the best known sea mammals. Their popularity may be due to their smiling appearance and friendliness toward humans. Whatever it is, there are hundreds of books about dolphins.\nTry some of these to begin learning about these gentle giants:\nDolphin's First Day by Kathleen Weidner Zoehfeld tells the delightful story of a young bottlenose dolphin. Reviewed by the Smithsonian Institute for accuracy, this beautifully-illustrated book provides wonderful insight about the life of a dolphin calf.\nDolphins by Seymour Simon in partnership with the Smithsonian Institute features gorgeous, full-color photographs along with text that describes the behavior and physical characteristics of dolphins.\nThe Magic Tree House: Dolphins at Daybreak by Mary Pope Osborne is the perfect fiction book to accompany a study of dolphins for children in the 6- to 9-years-old age range. The ninth book in this wildly popular series features an underwater adventure sure to capture your student's attention.\nDolphins and Sharks (Magic Tree House Research Guide) by Mary Pope Osborne is the non-fiction companion to Dolphins at Daybreak. It's geared toward kids who read at a 2nd or 3rd grade level and is filled with interesting facts and photos about dolphins.\nIsland of the Blue Dolphins by Scott O'Dell is a Newbery medal winner that makes a fun fiction accompaniment to a unit study about dolphins. The book tells a story of survival about Karana, a young Indian girl who finds herself alone on a deserted island.\nNational Geographic Kids Everything Dolphins by Elizabeth Carney features beautiful, full-color photos and is packed with facts about dolphins, including the different species and conservation efforts.\nMore Resources for Learning About Dolphins\nSeek out other opportunities to learn about dolphins. Try some of the following suggestions:\nDownload a set of free dolphin printables to begin learning the terminology associated with dolphins. The set includes coloring pages, vocabulary worksheets, and word puzzles.\nVisit an aquarium or a park like Sea World.\nVisit the ocean. If you go out on the ocean in a boat, you may be able to see dolphins swimming in the wild. We've even been able to observe them from the beach before.\nDolphins are beautiful, fascinating creatures. Have fun learning about them!\nUpdated by Kris Bales"}

Unlike fish, who breathe through gills, dolphins breathe air using lungs. Dolphins must make frequent trips to the surface of the water to catch a breath. The blowhole on top of a dolphin's head acts as a \"nose,\" making it easy for the dolphin to surface for air.\nOther characteristics of dolphins that make them mammals rather than fish are that they give birth to live young rather than laying eggs and they feed their young with milk. Also, like all mammals, dolphins even have a tiny amount of hair, right around the blowhole, which is a little different than the scales of a fish.\nWhales and porpoises are also mammals. There are 75 species of dolphins, whales, and porpoises living in the ocean. They are the only mammals, other than manatees, that spend their entire lives in the water."}

The Ganges river dolphin was officially discovered in 1801. Ganges river dolphins once lived in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems of Nepal, India, and Bangladesh. But the species is extinct from most of its early distribution ranges.\nThe Ganges river dolphin can only live in freshwater and is essentially blind. They hunt by emitting ultrasonic sounds, which bounces off of fish and other prey, enabling them to \u201csee\u201d an image in their mind. They are frequently found alone or in small groups, and generally a mother and calf travel together. Calves are chocolate brown at birth and then have grey-brown smooth, hairless skin as adults. Females are larger than males and give birth once every two to three years to only one calf."}

Pods of dolphins leap, tumble, back flip and spin together; and there is often no explicable reason for their behaviour other than pure social enjoyment. Dolphins will race towards boats to surf in the bow wave or play in the wake performing amazing acrobatics. Why? Well, wouldn't you if you could? Some dolphins seek out big waves breaking close to shore and ride the waves alongside surfers, other dolphins prefer to play with plants or shells or other make-shift toys.\nIn fact, when it comes to creating games, dolphins know few rivals. Many of them enjoy a game of catch, perhaps with a fish or even a turtle, throwing the animal back and forth to each other. Then there are activities that remind us of our games of tag. One dolphin will nudge another a few times to indicate its willingness for a game, then high-speed pursuit will take place through the sea, as they take turns chasing each other.\nSome dolphins have teamed up with other animals in the process of play. Amazing games between bottlenose dolphins and humpback whales have been filmed off the coast of Hawaii. The dolphins swim onto the nose of the whales, which then raise themselves out of the water to a great height, so that the dolphins slide down their heads with a great splash. As the game is repeated over and again, it seems clear that both individuals are enjoying it.\nIn the wild, whale and dolphin play seems to be infectious, revealing an intelligent brain that needs, from time to time, to relax and let off a little steam."}

In males, the more prominent tooth grows into a swordlike, spiral tusk up to 10 feet long. The ivory tusk tooth grows right through the narwhal's upper lip. Scientists are not certain of the tusk's purpose, but some believe it is prominent in mating rituals, perhaps used to impress females or to battle rival suitors. Females sometimes grow a small tusk of their own, but it does not become as prominent as the male's.\nGroup travel\nNarwhals are related to bottlenose dolphins, belugas, harbor porpoises, and orcas. Like some other porpoises, they travel in groups and feed on fish, shrimp, squid, and other aquatic fare. They are often sighted swimming in groups of 15 to 20, but gatherings of hundreds\u2014or even several thousands\u2014of narwhals have been reported. Sometimes these groups become trapped by shifting pack ice and fall victim to Inuit hunters, polar bears, or walruses.\nInuit people hunt the narwhal for their long tusks and their skin, an important source of vitamin C in the traditional Arctic diet."}

It\u2019s a fact that usually doesn\u2019t make it into all those nature documentaries, but animals are alive\u2014and being alive is pretty disgusting.\nAnimals have all the filthy habits we humans enjoy, but they work in a few more that we\u2019d never even imagine. Some of your favorite animals are genetically built to do some absolutely retch-inducing things that we usually don\u2019t talk about. Once you\u2019ve read this article, you\u2019ll never look at an animal the same way again.\n10 Fruit Fly Swarms Are Really Just Massive Orgies\nIf you\u2019ve ever swatted your hand through a throng of fruit flies swarming over a random point in your house, we\u2019ve got news for you. To those fruit flies, you were a bigger buzzkill than you realized. You broke up their orgy.\nThose big, chaotic fruit fly swarms are basically swinger parties, and they\u2019re crazy. The fruit flies pair off and start building up the mood with what animal experts describe as\u2014and we apologize in advance for this mental image\u2014\u201coral sexual foreplay.\u201d Once they\u2019ve built up a little romance, they get right into it. Two fruit flies, who only live for 40 days, will make love for an impressive 20 minutes.\nBut it doesn\u2019t end there. After they\u2019re done with their first partner, the female fruit flies will try out a few of the other males there. With their biology, the last male she sleeps with is going to be the one who gets her pregnant, so they actually have these orgies to test out different lovers before settling on a baby daddy.\nSo, if you\u2019ve ever swatted your hand through a fruit fly orgy, you might want to wash it.\n9 Petting Birds Turns Them On\nHave you ever petted a bird? Have you ever stroked your finger down its back and had it cuddle up to you? It might\u2019ve seemed like a cute moment between an owner and a pet to you, but to your bird, that was a wildly different experience. That was foreplay.\nMost birds treat a stroke from the head down to the back as the start of a mating ritual. They don\u2019t take it as some cute scratches; they take it as a sign that you\u2019re game for anything. They get sexually aroused, and they\u2019ll often start heavily panting with excitement.\nIf they\u2019re really into it, they\u2019ll let you know\u2014by vomiting on you. If you really get a bird going, it\u2019ll want to offer you regurgitated food, so it\u2019ll throw up all over you and hope you get the signal. If you treat them right, they\u2019re telling you, there\u2019s more vomited-up food where that came from.\nThey\u2019ll even get violent when they realize that you aren\u2019t living up to your end of the bargain. When the bird realizes you\u2019re not going to put out, they can lash out, and you\u2019ll have an angry, horny, sexually frustrated bird pecking at you.\n8 You\u2019ve Probably Eaten Beaver Anal Secretions\nThere\u2019s a decent chance you\u2019ve taken a big bite of beaver anal secretions\u2014or at least sprayed some on your face. You probably didn\u2019t realize it because on the ingredient list, it comes up as \u201ccastoreum\u201d\u2014or, even more often, just as \u201cnatural flavors\u201d\u2014but that\u2019s exactly what castoreum is: beaver anal secretions. And it\u2019s what gives ice cream and perfume that extra kick.\nCastoreum is the yellowish secretion of a beaver\u2019s castor sac, which is basically the bladder they use to mark their territory. It\u2019s full of anal liquids and urine, all mixed together, and it\u2019s been used for years to bring out the flavor in vanilla ice cream, add a musky aftertaste to cigarettes, and add a fruity note to perfumes.\nIt isn\u2019t as common of an ingredient as it used to be, but that\u2019s not because it\u2019s gross. It\u2019s because adding a drip of beaver anal secretions to ice cream is costly. Today, a sprinkle of beaver anus is a delicacy reserved for the finest of luxury brands.\n7 Some Frogs Will Make Homes Out Of Elephant Dung\nThe ornate narrow-mouthed frog is a tiny animal, only 2.5 centimeters (1 in) long. It can be found in the forests and savannas of Southeast Asia, often making a home under a bed of fallen leaves\u2014or if there aren\u2019t any leaves handy, inside a giant, stinking mound of elephant dung.\nElephant dung, as it turns out, makes a great home so long as you can handle the smell. Not only does the frog get shelter from the Sun\u2019s beating rays, but they also get a smorgasbord of foods. They can pick away at the insects crawling through it, and when there aren\u2019t enough bugs to eat, they munch away at the leftover chunks of food the elephant didn\u2019t fully digest.\nThese amphibians aren\u2019t the only animals living in the dung. As respected biologist Ahimsa Campos-Arceiz wrote in his scientific report, \u201cShit Happens (to be Useful),\u201d \u201cA dung pile can become a small ecosystem on its own,\u201d because so many animals are eager to move right into a pile of elephant poop and make it a home they can call their own.\n6 Proboscis Monkeys Taunt Each Other With Rage-Ons\nWhen male proboscis monkeys are mad at you, they let you know. They\u2019ll jump up and down, shake branches, and bare their teeth\u2014and they\u2019ll sprout a boner of pure hatred.\nProboscis monkeys don\u2019t get turned on by being mad; they\u2019re permanently erect. Every moment of every day, proboscis monkeys are sporting a stiffy. When they get angry, though, they make sure you see it. They\u2019ll spread their legs apart as wide as they can and thrust it at you.\nThis isn\u2019t even one of those things that only happens some of the time. It\u2019s the proboscis monkey\u2019s go-to answer to every threat. When they think a fight is about to go down, they might hold off on snarling until things get really dangerous. But they\u2019ll immediately engage in\u2014to use the scientific term\u2014\u201cerect penis displays.\u201d\n5 Falcon Breeders Let Birds Copulate With Their Heads\nJet coppulating on hat\nWatch this video on YouTube\nIf a falcon was bred in captivity, there\u2019s a good chance its life didn\u2019t start with a mommy and daddy falcon who loved each other very much. Falcon breeders tend to take a slightly stranger approach to getting a new brood of babies in their home.\nIt starts with the falcon breeder \u201cimprinting\u201d a male falcon\u2014or, to drop the euphemism, trying to get it sexually aroused. The breeder will do mating dances and make calls at the falcon to get him in the mood, and if all goes well, that falcon will fly onto the breeder\u2019s head and get busy.\nThe breeders wear special hats that lets them catch the falcon\u2019s semen, which they can then inject into a female falcon\u2019s eggs. That sounds pretty clinical, but it\u2019s every bit as weird. Before the breeder can inject the female\u2019s eggs, he has to flirt with the female falcon, too. She won\u2019t let him inject the eggs unless she is, as one guide puts it, sexually aroused enough to \u201cpresent herself for copulation.\u201d\n4 The Greater Short-Horned Lizard Squirts Blood Out Of Its Eyes\nBlood Squirting Lizard | National Geographic\nWatch this video on YouTube\nWhen it feels threatened, the greater short-horned lizard has a defense mechanism straight out of a horror story. It fights back by shooting blood out of its eye sockets\u2014and the blood goes a good distance, too. These things can splatter their enemies with gore from 1.2 meters (4 ft) away.\nThe reptiles have muscles that can cut off the blood flow in the veins around their eyes and redirect it so that the blood goes shooting out like a water gun. This sounds like a suicide move, but for reasons nobody fully understands, they can pretty much shoot blood out of their eyes all day without getting tired.\nThey squirt blood out for everything, too. This isn\u2019t just something they do as an absolute last resort. If one of these lizards so much as gets a speck of dust in his eye, he\u2019ll get it out by weeping blood.\n3 Several Species Of Birds Keep Cool By Defecating On Themselves\nThere\u2019s a trick called urohidrosis (not \u201curohydrosis\u201d) that some birds\u2014including storks, condors, flamingos, and vultures\u2014use to keep themselves cool. Here\u2019s how it works, in case you want to try it at home: First, you defecate on your own feet. Then, you just kind of spend the rest of the day going around with poop on your feet and not doing anything about it.\nIt\u2019s a strange way of dealing with a sunny day, but it\u2019s so common that it\u2019s believed to be more or less the bird equivalent to sweating. Except that, instead of water, these birds sweat a mixture of feces and urine onto their own legs.\nThe white fecal powder left over helps protect them from the Sun\u2014but it\u2019s still a pretty terrible way to keep cool. If they don\u2019t clean it off in time, the birds can end up getting bruises on their legs from having too much poop on them.\nSo, next time you feel gross because you\u2019re all sweaty, just remember that it could be a whole lot worse.\n2 Bored Ducks Become Cannibals\nDucks don\u2019t like being bored. In nature, that\u2019s not a big problem. Ducks aren\u2019t addicted to iPads; if they\u2019re bored, they\u2019ll go out and find some interesting new part of a river to splash in. But when they\u2019re in captivity, it gets a lot harder for a duck to find a constructive way to use all that energy, so they find their own ways to keep themselves entertained\u2014by visiting their friends, murdering them, and cannibalizing their bodies.\nIn a firsthand account of a duck-on-duck massacre, one witness described a Muscovy grabbing another duck\u2019s soon-to-hatch egg: \u201cThe male Muscovy cracked the egg open and bit down on the fully formed chick within,\u201d he said. \u201cWith a snapping upturn of his head, he then swallowed the duckling whole.\u201d And all this while the parents were watching. Brutal.\nThe only way to stop a bloodthirsty duck on a cannibalistic killing spree is to trim his beak so that he can\u2019t use it anymore. And this is actually a common enough problem that you can buy beak-trimming machines, custom-made for the specific purpose of stopping the all-duck Donner Party reenactment from going on in your backyard.\n1 After Scorpions Shed Their Tails, They Die Of Constipation\nPLoS ONE : Scorpion Sheds \u2018Tail\u2019 to Escape: Consequences and Implications of Autotomy\u2026\nWatch this video on YouTube\nWhen scorpions get caught by their stingers, they can still get away. They will writhe and wiggle until their tails fall off. The severed stinger will keep trying to pierce the attacker, keeping it busy while the scorpion gets away. That all sounds like a supercool and practical defense mechanism\u2014as long as you stop reading right here.\nThe problem is that a scorpion\u2019s tail has more than just a stinger. It\u2019s where they keep their anuses, too, and the tail doesn\u2019t grow back. The scorpions are constipated for the rest of their lives. They\u2019re physically incapable of relieving themselves, so their insides gradually fill up with poop until they explode.\nBut even that doesn\u2019t happen quickly. The scorpions can spend eight months in agony before they finally get to die. When they get clogged up, the raw pressure of the excreta in their bodies gets so intense that another part of their tail blows off, and then they start filling up again.\nWhen every section of their tails have exploded in a disgusting mess, the scorpion will clog up one last time and explode, experiencing one of the most painful deaths imaginable. Finally, after eight months of agonizing pain, the scorpion will die\u2014because it is literally too full of crap to live.\nfact checked by Jamie Frater"}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "10 Facts About Dolphins - WorldAtlas", "url": "https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/fun-facts-about-dolphins.html", "text": "Dolphins are some of the most spectacular animals on the planet. Scientists agree that they are extremely intelligent and complex. Their social skills with individuals within their species but also with humans is simply extraordinary. Dolphins seem to share many emotional components with humans, which may be one of the main reasons why we are so fascinated with them. Given the number of different dolphin species around the world, it is no wonder that there are so many interesting facts about them. Here is the ten we found most impressive.\nAre Dolphins Mammals or Just Large Fish?\nDolphins are not fish, and they differ from them in a myriad of ways. Even though they look similar in their physical appearance and their habitat, dolphins cannot survive underwater without frequently coming up for air. If they were not able to come to the surface to get air, they would drown as easily as a human would. Fish do not need to surface as they can extract the required oxygen directly from the water. Dolphins have tails as fish do, however, since they have evolved from mammals that lived on land and had legs, their tails move in an upward-downward motion.\nAre Dolphins The Same As Porpoises?\nNot really, no. Dolphins are typically larger than porpoises who are usually less than 8 feet long. Dolphins also tend to be more slender, have a bigger head, and a larger beak (some porpoises have no beak or fin). Another significant difference between these two species is the shape of their teeth: dolphins have cone-shaped teeth while porpoises have teeth that resemble a spade.\nWhat Are Dolphin\u2019s Preferred Habitats?\nDolphins can be found in pretty much any ocean or sea in the world. Some of them can be seen in specific rivers also. Their preference for a particular habitat varies as some like to occupy the waters near the coast, while others will often come into shallow waters but will live further from the coast. The only species of dolphins that live in Antarctic and Arctic oceans are orcas that have enough protection to withstand the freezing waters. Considering that they are warm-blooded animals, the majority of dolphins are partial to tropical, warm waters that allow them to regulate their body temperature efficiently.\nHas Any Dolphin Species Gone Extinct?\nSadly, yes. The Yangtze River dolphin (in China), also known as the baiji, is considered extinct. These dolphins are the first species of either whales or dolphins to go extinct, and the sole reason, as it is most of the time, is us: humans. The galloping rise in population density and China\u2019s industrialization has resulted in this sad fact. In 2006, there was an international expedition in search of the Yangtze River dolphins, which lasted for six weeks. It was their goal to track down any remaining individual, but unfortunately, the search was futile.\nWhich Dolphin Is The Most Endangered?\nThe Spanish \u2018vaquita\u2019 (little cow) is currently the most endangered porpoise. It is also the smallest variety in the world. They only live in the waters near the Mexican coast, right of the Gulf of California. The reports say that there are only 30 of these animals left, which means that they could become extinct at any moment. The leading cause of their endangerment and such a low count are the fishing nets in which they get tangled and die.\nHow Do Dolphins Raise Their Young?\nBeing warm-blooded animals, dolphins nurse their young as other mammals do. They are polygamous, which means that they typically have more than one mating partner but will only produce one offspring per mating. While it varies among the dolphin species, the young can stay with its mother for up to six years before she stops caring for it.\nWhat Are The Biggest Threats To Dolphins Today?\nEven though people have hunted dolphins in the past for a variety of reasons (usually for their meat), their biggest modern threat is getting caught in fishing nets, in which they drown. This happens due to their need to surface for air during which they get tangled in the nets and are unable to get air. Aside from that, climate change consequences have also affected dolphins negatively, hindering their numbers and survival abilities.\nHow Do Dolphins Communicate?\nWhen dolphins are swimming and navigating the open waters, they will use clicking sounds that also help them with locating their prey. Dolphins speak to one another by producing different vocalizations. When communicating with other dolphins they will use whistling, but also loud bursting sounds when they need to chase off a predator like a shark. They will use similar sounds when they feel excited too!\nHow Exactly Do They Navigate The Open Waters?\nDolphins use their biological sonar to estimate their location in reference to other animals or objects under the water. It is also called echolocation, as they emit high-pitch clicks, which in turn bounce of the surfaces in the environment and inform the dolphins of the object\u2019s shape, size, distance, and other parameters. Echolocation also allows dolphins to trap and catch their prey.\nWhat Is A Superpod?\nA pod is a name for a group of dolphins living together. There can be anywhere from a couple dozen to couple hundred of dolphins in one pod. It allows them to catch prey more efficiently, escape from predators (power in numbers, right?) but also to care for the individuals that might be hurt or ill. Sometimes different pods merge and form a superpod that contains over 1000 dolphins. These enormous pods are usually only short-term as they occur when they come across areas that contain copious amounts of food, so there is no competition."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Common dolphin - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_dolphin", "text": "Species of mammal\nFor the ray-finned fish known as common dolphin, see Mahi-mahi\nThe common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) is the most abundant cetacean in the world, with a global population of about six million. Despite this fact and its vernacular name, the common dolphin is not thought of as the archetypal dolphin, with that distinction belonging to the bottlenose dolphin due to its popular appearances in aquaria and the media. However, the common dolphin is often depicted in Ancient Greek and Roman art and culture, most notably in a mural painted by the Greek Minoan civilization.\nIt is presently the only member of the genus Delphinus. The common dolphin belongs to the subfamily Delphininae, making this dolphin closely related to the three different species of bottlenose dolphins, humpback dolphins, striped dolphins, spinner dolphins, clymene dolphin, spotted dolphins, fraser's dolphin and the tucuxi and guiana dolphin. The common dolphin was originally categorized into two different species (now thought to be ecotypes), the short-beaked common dolphin and the long-beaked common dolphin. However, recent evidence has shown that many populations of long-beaked common dolphins around the world are not closely related to one another and are often derived from a short-beaked ancestor and do not always share common derived characteristics. For this reason, they are no longer considered different species.\nPhysical characteristics [ edit ]\nCommon dolphin are medium-sized dolphins; adults range between 1.9 and 2.5 m (6.2 and 8.2 ft) long, and can weigh between 80\u2013235 kg (176\u2013518 lb), although the range between 80\u2013150 kg (180\u2013330 lb) is more common. Males are generally longer and heavier. The color pattern on the body is unusual. The back is dark and the belly is white, while on each side is an hourglass pattern colored light grey, yellow, or gold in front and dirty grey in back. They have long, thin rostra with up to 50\u201360 small, sharp, interlocking teeth on each side of each jaw.\nTaxonomy [ edit ]\n\"Short-beaked\" common dolphin, Ireland\nDespite the historic practice of lumping the entire genus Delphinus into a single species, these widely distributed dolphins exhibit a wide variety of sizes, shapes and colors. Indeed, over the past few decades, over 20 distinct species in the genus have been proposed. Scientists in California in the 1960s concluded there were two species \u2014 the long-beaked and short-beaked. The long-beaked common dolphin was thought to have a disjointed range in coastal areas in tropical and warmer temperate oceans. The range included parts of western and southern Africa, much of western South America, central California to central Mexico, coastal Peru, areas around Japan, Korea and Taiwan, and possibly near Oman. Vagrants have been recorded as far north as Vancouver Island.\n\"Long-beaked\" common dolphin, California\nThis analysis was seemingly confirmed by a more in-depth genetic study in the 1990s. This study also suggested a third species (D. tropicalis, common name usually Arabian common dolphin or Indo-Pacific common dolphin), characterized by an extremely long and thin beak and found in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, might be distinguished from the long-beaked species. The current standard taxonomic works recognize this as a subspecies of D. delphis rather than a separate species.\nRecent evidence has demonstrated that different populations of long-beaked common dolphins around the world are not closely related to one another and are often derived from a short-beaked ancestor (as well as not sharing common derived characters). Therefore, long-beaked and short-beaked common dolphins are now listed as the same species under the scientific name of Delphinus delphis. Currently, the common dolphin is divided into four subspecies:\nD. d. delphis , the nominate subspecies\n, the nominate subspecies D. d. bairdii , the Eastern North Pacific long-beaked common dolphin\n, the Eastern North Pacific long-beaked common dolphin D. d. ponticus , the Black Sea common dolphin\n, the Black Sea common dolphin D. d. tropicalis, the Indo-Pacific common dolphin\nFossil record [ edit ]\nMany extinct cetacean species were once lumped into Delphinus, but have since been placed in other genera. In the late 19th century several fossil species were described, including taxa: Delphinus baltringii, Delphinus delannoy and Delphinus domeykoi. However, these species are no longer considered valid. Another species known as Delphinus brevidens was reassigned to the genus Stereodelphis which is now generally considered synonymous with Squalodon.\nNatural history [ edit ]\nCommon dolphin, Ireland\nCommon dolphins live in both warm-temperate and tropical waters ranging from 40\u201360\u00b0N to 50\u00b0S. Long-beaked common dolphins mostly inhabit shallow, warm coastal water. Short-beaked common dolphins are common \"along shelf edges and in areas with sharp bottom relief such as seamounts and escarpments\". Common dolphins have a varied diet consisting of many species of fish and squid. This includes both mesopelagic species and epipelagic schooling species. They have been recorded to make dives up to 200 metres (660 ft) deep.\nCommon dolphins are a widely distributed species. They can be found around the world in both offshore and coastal waters. In the Northwest Atlantic, they can be found from Cape Hatteras North Carolina, to Newfoundland and are strongly associated with the Gulf Stream. Dolphins in this region can often be found in areas that have certain geological factors like underwater canyons and ridges because this is where up-welling occurs which result in greater nutrients. In the Eastern Pacific, common dolphins are found along the coast of California and are associated with the California current. Short-beaked Common dolphins can also be found in Europe, particularly the Scotian shelf, the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. In the Southern Hemisphere, they are abundant in the southwestern Pacific, around New Zealand and southern Australia. They are generally a pelagic species that are often found in waters 650-6,500 feet deep, with the short-beaked type preferring deeper waters than the long-beaked type Temperature also plays a large role in the congregation of dolphins. For example, in the Western North Atlantic, almost all sightings of Common dolphins took place in waters from 16-20 \u00b0C. However, there were common dolphin sightings in waters as low as 5 \u00b0C.\nCommon dolphins can live in aggregations of hundreds or even thousands of dolphins. Common dolphins are often seen in groups numbering several hundred individuals (with subgroups consisting of 20-30 individuals). Occasionally, different groups will come together to form mega-pods which can consist of over 10,000 dolphins. Genetic studies in the Northeast Atlantic suggest that common dolphin pods generally do not consist of close kin, but rather of members that are not closely related. Unlike many delphinids, common dolphins do not live in a matriarchal society. That being said, closely related individuals are usually found in similar geographical locations fairly consistently, providing evidence that this species displays site fidelity (at least in the Northeastern Atlantic). Male common dolphins display greater site fidelity in relation to their kin than females. Common dolphin pod structure often consists of nursery pods (which includes females and calves), bachelor pods (consisting of all males) and mixed groups of males and females, including sub-adults and calves. Genetic evidence seems to indicate that common dolphins live in fission-fusion societies, where dolphins form pods that are not necessarily stable and do not necessarily consist of related individuals. It is not known if common dolphins form life long bonds with other individuals like the long-term male alliances seen in bottlenose dolphins.\nThere is some evidence that common dolphins use signature whistles, similar to that of the bottlenose dolphin. These whistles are believed to serve as an acoustic label, and provide identification information similar to that of a name. It takes approximately 1 year for a calf to learn its signature whistle after which it remains stable for the rest of a dolphin\u2019s life. In South Africa, as many as 29 common dolphin signature whistle types were detected. However, it was difficult to determine if each dolphin had its own signature whistle due to the vast number of dolphins present (over 1,000) and anthropogenic background noise. Additionally, considering the vast number of dolphins present and taking into account their feeding and diving behavior, it appears that common dolphin signature whistles are also used for group cohesion. Another hypothesis for the function of signature whistles, is that they serve as a beacon for lost individuals.\nCommon dolphins sometimes associate with other dolphin species, such as pilot whales. In the Gulf of Corinth, common dolphins frequently display mixed species association, especially with striped and Rissos\u2019 dolphins. Over one third of all dolphin sightings in the gulf consisted of mixed species associations that partially consisted of common dolphins. In mixed species associations, the ratio of striped to common dolphins ranged from 6-11:1. When Rissos\u2019 dolphins were present (there would usually be only one or two individuals), it appeared that much of their scars were the result of interactions between striped and spinner dolphins. In much of the interactions, the Rissos\u2019 dolphins would chase and herd the common dolphins toward the boat, while the common dolphins would try and swim under the Rissos\u2019 dolphin. When groups of common and striped dolphins would charge at each other, the Rissos\u2019 dolphin would chase the striped dolphins. Sometimes these interactions appeared to be playful, and at other times aggressive. Synchronized swimming and surfacing was commonly observed. These interactions take place in the deepest part of the Gulf, furthest from shore and usually consist of a total of 60 dolphins from all three species.\nThere have been confirmed cases of hybridization between striped and common dolphins in this region. There have been 15 cases of common dolphin and striped dolphin hybrids. Genetic and observational evidence has demonstrated that the hybrids are fertile and are capable of not only reproducing with other hybrids, but are capable of reproducing with each of the parent species. Striped dolphins have been known to mate with other dolphins, as the Clymene dolphin is the result of hybrid speciation between striped and spinner dolphins. However, this is unlikely to happen with common dolphins, as their population in the Gulf of Corinth is too low. Common dolphins and bottlenose dolphins have been known to interbreed in captivity. There is one confirmed case of a hybrid between a bottlenose and common dolphin in Southern Spain, an important feeding ground for both species. The mother was a female bottlenose dolphin (dubbed as Billie) who has spent 10 years within a common dolphin pod. Billie was observed assisting common calves reach the surface at three different intervals and would babysit the calves after the mother went through labor. The length of the calf was similar to a bottlenose dolphin calf, with the lateral stripes and coloration of a common dolphin. The calf was spotted with its mother, almost daily on dolphin watching tours among a nursery pod of common dolphins which also contained some immature striped dolphins. Sightings of the calf took place when temperatures were between 14-26 \u00b0C. The calf was mainly observed swimming in the echelon position (swimming alongside the mother). The calf was found rubbing its head on its mother, jumping backwards over its mother and flipper-to flipper, belly-to flipper and belly-to belly contact was observed. They have also been observed bow riding on baleen whales, and they also bow ride on boats. They are fast swimmers and breaching behavior and aerial acrobatics are common with this species. They are also known to display altruistic behaviors to support injured members.\nThe short-beaked common dolphin has a gestation period of 10 to 11 months. The newborn calf has a length of 70 to 100 centimetres (2.3 to 3.3 ft) and weighs about 10 kilograms (22 lb). For the Black Sea population, weaning occurs at between five and six months, but occurs later (up to about 19 months) in other areas. Typical interbirth interval ranges from one year for the Black Sea population to three years for eastern Pacific Ocean populations. Age of sexual maturity also varies by location, but can range between two and seven years for females and three and 12 years for males. No evidence exists of any major reproductive differences between the two species. In captivity, the long-beaked common dolphin has hybridized with the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). One of the hybrids has been bred back to a bottlenose dolphin, demonstrating such hybrids are fertile.\nHuman interactions [ edit ]\nConservation [ edit ]\nThe common dolphin is probably the most abundant cetacean species on the planet, and the overall species is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, indicating that it is in no danger of extinction. Abundance has been estimated for most major portions of the species range in the Northern Hemisphere, but only for a few places in the Southern Hemisphere. In the Pacific Ocean, there are an estimated 1,428,000 off Japan and in the temperate central Pacific Ocean, 969,000 off the U.S. west coast (Carretta et al. 2019); and 2,963,000 in the eastern tropical Pacific. In the Atlantic Ocean, 70,000 are estimated for the western Atlantic Ocean (Waring et al. 2019); 467,000 for European waters; more than 19,400 for the Mediterranean Sea; and several tens of thousands for the Black Sea. In the southern part of the Indo-Pacific Ocean, there are an estimated 20,000-22,000 common dolphins in a small portion of southern Australia (Bilgmann et al. 2017), and 15,000-20,000 off southern Africa. There are no estimates for the population of dolphins in the northern Indian Ocean. Taken together, these estimates suggest that well over six million common dolphins inhabit the World\u2019s oceans.\nCommon dolphins face a mixture of threats due to human influence. Moderate levels of metal pollutants, which are thought to negatively impact dolphin health, have been measured in some populations. Populations have been hunted off the coast of Peru for use as food and shark bait. In most other areas, the dolphins have not been hunted directly. Several thousand individuals have been caught in industrial trawler nets throughout their range.\nBycatch is the main threat that common dolphins face today. Short-beaked common dolphins are taken as cetacean bycatch the most in all of Europe, given that they are the most abundant dolphin in the Eastern Atlantic. About 1000 short-beaked common dolphins are bycaught in the North Atlantic each year by either tuna drift, trawling and gillnetting. The regulation is that only cetacean bycatch can not be longer than 15 meters  and this can lead to be a problem because short-beaked common dolphins are only about 2.7 meters. Common dolphin bycatch is a particularly important issue in Galicia Spain, via trawler fishing. The bycatch of short beaked dolphins in Galicia from May to September from 2001-2002, consisted of 394 individuals annually. Depth was an important factor in bycatch, as incidental capture mostly took place along the continental shelf in water less than 300 m deep. Very few entrapments took place when the depth exceeded 300 m. Time of day was also important as most dolphins became trapped in trawling nets at night (most active feeding takes place at night). Most of the dolphins captured were males and had a mean age of 13+- 4.4 years. It is believed that the reason why the vast majority of bycatch consisted of males is because bachelor pods appear to be particularly abundant in Galicia from the May\u2013October season. This fact reinforces the hypothesis that common dolphins may be sexually segregated in the Northeast Atlantic. If there was a ban on fishing in Galicia in waters than less than 250 m deep, and if there were seasonal closures, it is estimated that 78% of the dolphins would not have been caught. In the Western North Atlantic, dolphins are vulnerable to swordfish driftnet fishing, with the number of males being caught as bycatch, doubling the number of females. It was also found from stranding samples that males tend to strand more. This provides evidence of sex-based habitat partitioning or pod congregation.\nCommon dolphins were abundant in the western Mediterranean Sea until the 1960s but occurrences there have tailed off rapidly. The reasons are not well understood, but are believed to be due to extensive human activity in the area. In the US, they are a protected species and sometimes are caught by accident in some trawler nets as by-catch, though despite this they are still quite common throughout their range. Despite these potential threats, the short-beaked common dolphin is considered to be Least Concern by the IUCN Red List, and the long-beaked common dolphin is listed as Data Deficient.\nThe short-beaked common dolphin Delphinus delphis is listed globally on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). As amended by the Conference of the Parties in 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008. Effective: 5 March 2009 of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements. The Mediterranean population of the short-beaked common dolphin is also listed on Appendix I, as this population has been categorized as being in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of their range and CMS Parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals, conserving or restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles to migration and controlling other factors that might endanger them. In addition, the species is also covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS) and the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS).\nMass stranding events [ edit ]\nOn June 8, 2009, a mass-stranding event (MSE) occurred in Falmouth Bay, Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is believed the MSE was likely caused by naval involvement, as all other factors which cause MSEs in cetaceans currently appear unlikely to have influenced the event. During the event, twenty-six common dolphins washed ashore, and about the same amount floated back out to sea. There were three other MSEs in the UK before this event, all of unknown cause, from the years 1915 to 1938, but with arguably lower counts of stranded dolphins.\nCaptivity [ edit ]\nCommon dolphins are not common in captivity. But on at least three occasions, a beached common dolphin in California was nursed back to health at SeaWorld San Diego, but deemed unfit to release back to the ocean. These common dolphins remained at SeaWorld with the bottlenose dolphin exhibit. On one occasion, a male common dolphin managed to impregnate one of the female bottlenose dolphins in the exhibit, leading to four hybrid births. One of the resulting common dolphin/bottlenose dolphin hybrids remained at SeaWorld, San Diego (alternately under the name Cindy or Bullet) while the other (named CJ) was kept at Discovery Cove, and was moved to SeaWorld Orlando in 2016.\nOther than at SeaWorld, at least 90 common dolphins are known to have been captured from the wild and kept in captivity. Captured common dolphins are said to be difficult to keep in captivity.\nThe behavior of captive common dolphins is not very well studied. However, a study was conducted in New Zealand of common dolphin reacting to swimmers at Marineland, Unlike, the bottlenose dolphins, (which demonstrated antagonistic or sexual behaviors), the common dolphins retreated to the refuge center of the pool, where swimmers were not allowed. They did not leave the refuge section until the swimmers left. The dolphins also surfaced much more frequently, which is a possible indicator of stress. Aggressive and playful behavior among the dolphins decreased when swimmers were present. This behavior is consistent with wild common dolphins off of New Zealand, as they actively avoid swimmers.\nSee also [ edit ]\nReferences [ edit ]\nFurther reading [ edit ]"}

Additionally, tanks are often heavily chlorinated, which leads to burning the eyes and causing permanent damage to eyesight.\nLabeled as \u201cpositive reinforcement\u201d or \u201coperant conditioning\u201d, dolphins are kept hungry enough so that they will comply with instructions from trainers, whether to learn new behaviors or to execute them during a performance or swim-with-dolphin encounter."}

This is because their breathing is not automatic, it is consciously controlled. In other words dolphins have to actively decide when to breathe, and so they must be continually conscious to breathe. If like us, dolphins went into a deep unconscious sleep, they would stop breathing and suffocate or drown.\nTo get around this, dolphins only allow one half of their brains to sleep at a time; the other half stays alert to enable the dolphin to continue breathing and look out for dangers in the environment. Dolphins only close one eye when they sleep; the left eye will be closed when the right half of the brain sleeps, and vice versa. This type of sleep is known as unihemispheric sleep as only one brain hemisphere sleeps at a time. Dolphins alternate which half of the brain is sleeping periodically so that they can get the rest they need without ever losing consciousness.\nWhen sleeping, dolphins often rest motionless at the surface of the water, breathing regularly or they may swim very slowly and steadily, close to the surface. In shallow water, dolphins sometimes sleep on the seabed rising regularly to the surface to breath."}

While most whales spend their lives offshore in the ocean's pelagic zone , some inhabit coastal areas and even spend part of their lives in freshwater.\u200b\nWhales Are Mammals Whit Welles Wwelles14/Wikimedia Commons/CC BY 3.0 Whales are endothermic (commonly called warm-blooded). Their body temperature is about the same as ours, even though they often live in cold water. Whales also breathe air, give birth to live young, and nurse their young. They even have hair! These characteristics are common to all mammals, including humans.\nThere Are Over 80 Whale Species Betty Wiley/Getty Images Actually, 86 species of whales are currently recognized, from the tiny Hector's dolphin (at about 39 inches long) to the gigantic blue whale, the biggest animal on Earth.\nThere Are Two Groups of Whales Jayanarayanan Vijayan/EyeEm/Getty Images Out of the 80-plus species of whales, about a dozen of them feed use a filtering system called baleen. The rest have teeth, but they're not teeth like we have \u2014 they are cone-shaped or spade-shaped and are used to catch prey, rather than for chewing. Since they are included in the group of toothed whales, dolphins and porpoises are also considered whales.\nThey're the Biggest Animals in the World Franco Banfi/Getty Images The order Cetacea contains the two largest animals in the world: the blue whale, which can grow to about 100 feet in length, and the fin whale, which can grow to about 88 feet. Both feed on relatively tiny animals, such as krill (euphausiids) and small fish.\nThey Rest Half Their Brains While Asleep Gabriel Barathieu/Wikimedia Commons/CC BY 2.0 The way whales \"sleep\" may sound strange to us, but makes sense when you think of it like this: whales cannot breathe underwater, which means they need to be awake just about all the time to come up to the surface when they need to breathe. So, whales \"sleep\" by resting one half of their brain at a time. While one half of the brain stays awake to make sure the whale breathes and alerts the whale to any danger in its environment, the other half of the brain sleeps.\nThey Have Excellent Hearing Salvatore Cerchio et al. / Royal Society Open Science/Wikimedia Commons/CC BY 4.0 When it comes to senses, hearing is the most important to whales. The sense of smell isn't well-developed in whales, and there is a debate about their sense of taste. But in the underwater world where visibility is highly variable and sound travels far, good hearing is a necessity. Toothed whales use echolocation to find their food, which involves emitting sounds that bounce off whatever is in front of them and interpreting those sounds to determine the object's distance, size, shape, and texture. Baleen whales probably don't use echolocation, but use sound to communicate over long distances and may also use sound to develop a sonic \"map\" of the ocean's features.\nThey Live a Long Time Bering Land Bridge National Preserve/Wikimedia Commons/CC BY 2.0 It is nearly impossible to tell the age of a whale just by looking at it, but there are other methods of aging whales. These include looking at earplugs in baleen whales, which form growth layers (kind of like the rings in a tree), or the growth layers in the teeth of toothed whales. There is a newer technique that involves studying aspartic acid in the whale's eye, and is also related to growth layers formed in a whale's eye lens. The longest-living whale species is thought to be the bowhead whale, which may live to over 200 years old!\nWhales Give Birth to One Calf at a Time NOAA Photo Library/Flickr/CC BY 2.0 Whales reproduce sexually, meaning it takes a male and a female to mate, which they do belly-to-belly. Other than that, there's not much known about the reproduction of many whale species. Despite all our studies of whales, reproduction in some species has never been observed. After mating, the female is generally pregnant for about a year, after which she gives birth to one calf. There have been records of females with more than one fetus but usually, only one is born. Females nurse their calves. A baby blue whale may drink over 100 gallons of milk a day! Whales need to protect their calves from predators. Having only one calf allows the mother to focus all her energy on keeping her calf safe.\nThey're Still Hunted Hulton Archive/Stringer/Getty Images While the heyday of whaling ended long ago, whales are still hunted. The International Whaling Commission, which regulates whaling, allows whaling for aboriginal subsistence purposes or scientific research.

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Dusky Dolphin images!\nDusky Dolphin Classification and Evolution\nThe Dusky Dolphin is a small species of dolphin that is found inhabiting the cooler waters along continental shelves throughout the southern hemisphere. This distinctive looking cetacean is closely related to other large marine animals including other dolphins, porpoises and whales but despite their fish-like appearance Dusky Dolphins are true mammals that both breathe air in and out of their lungs and also suckle their young on milk produced by the mother\u2019s mammary glands. Dusky Dolphins are widespread throughout the southern hemisphere with three species being recognised that have been grouped by their geographical range, with one found off the coast of South America, one near South Africa and in the Indian Ocean and another inhabits deeper waters close to New Zealand. Sadly however, despite being locally common in certain areas Dusky Dolphin populations have declined throughout much of their natural range primarily due to threats caused by increasing levels of human activity.\nDusky Dolphin Anatomy and Appearance\nThe Dusky Dolphin is the smallest of the world\u2019s 33 different species of dolphin growing to under two meters in length and generally weighing less than 100kg. Like other species of cetacean, Dusky Dolphins have a smooth and hairless, streamlined body that helps them to glide through the water and is powered by their two tail flukes which lay horizontally rather than vertically like those of fish. The upper-side of their bodies is either dark grey or blue-black in colour and is separated from their light grey to white under-side by a grey line which runs from their beak to the base of their tail. Dusky Dolphins also have two light grey lines which run diagonally from their tail to their dorsal fin which is tall and curved to help them to change direction quickly in the water. The beak of the Dusky Dolphin is black and more rounded in shape than those of other dolphin species and contains between 24 and 36 pairs of sharp, cone-shaped teeth that are ideal for catching slippery and fast-moving prey.\nDusky Dolphin Distribution and Habitat\nDusky Dolphins tend to be found in cool to temperate waters (10 \u2013 18 degrees centigrade) close to continental shelves throughout the southern hemisphere, and seem to prefer shallower rather than deep water regions (although this can vary depending on the location and time of year). Although they are not generally known to participate in seasonal migrations, Dusky Dolphins can travel vast distances across the ocean and at great speed in search of food. The three Dusky Dolphin species have been classified by the regions in which they live with the highest populations found off the coast of South America, South-Western Africa and around New Zealand. There are also populations known to occur in the waters close to Argentina along with around the Falkland Islands further south. Despite their wide range and distribution throughout the southern hemisphere Dusky Dolphin populations have been decreasing mainly due to interaction with humans including being hunted for their meat and getting caught in the nets that are used to catch the shoaling fish which the Dusky Dolphins hunt.\nDusky Dolphin Behaviour and Lifestyle\nThe exact behaviours and habits of Dusky Dolphins depends on the species and where they live however, they generally spend time close to the shore resting during the day in small groups that consist of between ten and twenty individuals. As night falls, these small groups begin to travel further away from land to feed and form pods consisting of up 1,000 individuals that includes both male and female members in order to work together to corner shoals of fish. Dusky Dolphins are incredibly sociable animals and can be seen playing, grooming and leaping together after feeding before breaking up into their smaller groups again to return closer to the coast to rest. Although they are able to dive for up to 90 seconds at a time, like other marine mammals Dusky Dolphins must keep returning to the water\u2019s surface to breathe, and expel old air and water from their lungs via the single blow-hole that is located on the top of their heads. They are highly intelligent animals and are often seen leaping out of the water before diving back in after gliding through the air for a few seconds. This technique is known as porpoising and enables the Dusky Dolphin to breathe but without having to slow down when chasing prey.\nDusky Dolphin Reproduction and Life Cycles\nDespite being relatively wide-spread across the southern hemisphere, the fast moving nature of the Dusky Dolphin has meant that it can often be hard to study these animals in the wild and quite little is therefore known about their lifespans in general. Most Dusky Dolphin calves tend to be born towards the end of the winter and in the early summer months between October and February when the female gives birth to a single offspring after a gestation period that lasts for around 11 months. The Dusky Dolphin calf is fed on the nutritious milk provided by its mother until it is then taught to hunt by her after about a year. Calves tend to remain close their mother until they are around three years old when they leave to join a pod of their own (males with often form bachelor groups), and the female is then able to mate again. Dusky Dolphins are thought to be able to first breed when they are between the ages of four and five and are thought to live for an average of 20 years.\nDusky Dolphin Diet and Prey\nThe Dusky Dolphin is a carnivorous animal that only feeds on other animals in order to gain the nutrients that it needs to survive. By congregating in large groups Dusky Dolphins are able to trap vast schools of fish so that they have the best opportunity to feed, by travelling through the waters in a line and pushing the shoal into an area where it is trapped. Prey depends largely on the area in which the Dusky Dolphins are feeding but they most commonly consume anchovies, sardines and mackerel in shallower waters, squid at mid-depths and larger prey including hake and octopus in deeper ocean. Although Dusky Dolphins have excellent hearing and are able to see remarkably well through the water, it is actually a specially evolved system that these animals use which both helps them to locate prey and to also avoid upcoming obstacles. By producing a rapid series of clicking noises, the Dusky Dolphin\u2019s brain is then able to translate the clicks that bounce off things ahead (such as fish) into a mental sound map of the surrounding area and therefore knows exactly where to find food.\nDusky Dolphin Predators and Threats\nThe relatively large size, sociable nature and sheer speed of the Dusky Dolphin means that it has very few predators that hunt it in its natural environment. Pods of Killer Whales (to which they are related) are the main predators of the Dusky Dolphin along with some large species of shark that venture into the shallower, coastal waters. The biggest threat to the world\u2019s Dusky Dolphin populations though is people encroaching more and more on their natural habitats usually in the form of commercial fishing. As humans are fishing for the same shoaling fish as the Dusky Dolphins it often leads to them being caught up in vast nets where they can quickly become trapped. Other reasons for the decline in Dusky Dolphins include the fact that they are also hunted in some areas (particularly Peru) for their meat and are injured by large boats that hit them.\nDusky Dolphin Interesting Facts and Features\nThe Dusky Dolphin is thought to be one of the most intelligent animal species in the world and even communicates with other individuals using their own language which consists of a series of whistles, clicks and squeaks. The unique body shape of the Dusky Dolphin means that it is incredibly flexible and in fact, the most agile species of dolphin in the world. They are often seen leaping out of the water both when swimming and playing and the noise that is caused by them diving back into the water is able to travel for up to 1km through the water and up to 3km through the air. Dusky Dolphins are known to be incredibly sociable animals with sick or injured individuals helped by others that push them towards the surface so the vulnerable individual is able to breathe. Along with being seen together in their own pods, Dusky Dolphins are also known to interact with other cetaceans including Common Dolphins, which they feed alongside.\nDusky Dolphin Relationship with Humans\nDespite being one of the most intelligent animals in the world, the increasing amount of man-made obstacles such as boats and rigs that litter the sea has led to a decline in Dusky Dolphin populations as they are often hit by them. Populations around South America have also suffered greatly from hunting by people for their flesh which is used both as bait for fish and for human consumption. A study carried out between 1991 and 1993 revealed that 7,000 Dusky Dolphins were captured each year and although the hunting of dolphins has been recently banned, they are still commonly hunted as food. The issue however that most affects all Dusky Dolphin populations is the fact that they are often caught by accident in large fishing nets that are targeting the same fish that the dolphins are. However, in an growing number of places around the world watching the acrobatic Dusky Dolphin is becoming increasingly popular with tourists and bringing awareness to the threats that they face.\nDusky Dolphin Conservation Status and Life Today\nToday, the Dusky Dolphin is listed by the IUCN as being Data Deficient which means that although certain populations in certain areas are well reported, little is really known about those individuals that inhabit unpopulated regions. However, their numbers are known to be drastically declining throughout the southern hemisphere primarily due to the increasing levels of human activity in their native environments. Despite the hunting of them being banned, they are still caught in nets and trawlers in their thousands on a yearly basis.\nView all 58 animals that start with D"}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Amazon river dolphin - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_river_dolphin", "text": "Species of toothed whale\nThe Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), also known as the boto, bufeo or pink river dolphin, is a species of toothed whale classified in the family Iniidae. Three subspecies are currently recognized: I. g. geoffrensis (Amazon river dolphin), I. g. boliviensis (Bolivian river dolphin) and I. g. humboldtiana (Orinoco river dolphin) while position of Araguaian river dolphin (I. araguaiaensis) within the clade is still unclear. The three subspecies are distributed in the Amazon basin, the upper Madeira River in Bolivia, and the Orinoco basin, respectively.\nThe Amazon river dolphin is the largest species of river dolphin, with adult males reaching 185 kilograms (408 lb) in weight, and 2.5 metres (8.2 ft) in length. Adults acquire a pink color, more prominent in males, giving it its nickname \"pink river dolphin\". Sexual dimorphism is very evident, with males measuring 16% longer and weighing 55% more than females. Like other toothed whales, they have a melon, an organ that is used for bio sonar. The dorsal fin, although short in height, is regarded as long, and the pectoral fins are also large. The fin size, unfused vertebrae, and its relative size allow for improved manoeuvrability when navigating flooded forests and capturing prey.\nThey have one of the widest ranging diets among toothed whales, and feed on up to 53 different species of fish, such as croakers, catfish, tetras and piranhas. They also consume other animals such as river turtles and freshwater crabs.\nIn 2008, this species was ranked by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as being data deficient, due to the uncertainty regarding its population trends and the impact of threats. While hunting is a major threat, in recent decades greater impacts on population have been due to the loss of habitat and inadvertent entanglement in fishing lines.\nIt is the only species of river dolphin kept in captivity, mainly in Venezuela and Europe. It is difficult to train and a high mortality rate is seen among captive individuals.\nTaxonomy [ edit ]\nBrehms Tierleben, 1860s An Amazon river dolphin as depicted in, 1860s\nThe species Inia geoffrensis was described by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1817. Originally, the Amazon river dolphin belonged to the superfamily Platanistoidea, which constituted all river dolphins, making them a paraphyletic group. Today, however, the Amazon river dolphin has been reclassified into the superfamily Inioidea. There is no consensus on when and how they penetrated the Amazon basin; they may have done so during the Miocene from the Pacific Ocean, before the formation of the Andes, or from the Atlantic Ocean.\nThere is ongoing debate about the classification of species and subspecies. The IUCN and Committee on Taxonomy of the Society for Marine Mammalogy recognize two subspecies: I. g. geoffrensis (Amazon river dolphin) and I. g. boliviensis (Bolivian river dolphin). A third proposed subspecies, I. g. humboldtiana (Orinoco river dolphin), was first described in 1977. Molecular analysis suggests that the Orinoco dolphins are derived from the Amazon population and are not genetically distinct. Comparative morphological research also indicates that I. g. humboldtiana is not distinguishable from I. g. geoffrensis. However, Ca\u00f1izales (2020) found that I. g. humboldtiana skulls were morphologically distinct and recommended that it be elevated to species status.\nIn 1994, it was proposed that I. g. boliviensis was a different species based on skull morphology. In 2002, following the analysis of mitochondrial DNA specimens from the Orinoco basin, the Putumayo River (tributary of the Amazon) and the Tijamuchy and Ipurupuru rivers, geneticists proposed that genus Inia be divided into at least two evolutionary lineages: one restricted to the river basins of Bolivia and the other widely distributed in the Orinoco and Amazon. A recent study, with more comprehensive sampling of the Madeira system, including above and below the Teotonio Rapids (which were thought to obstruct gene flow), found that the Inia above the rapids did not possess unique mtDNA. As such the species level distinction once held is not supported by current results. Therefore, the Bolivian river dolphin is currently recognized as a subspecies. In addition, a 2014 study identifies a third species in the Araguaia-Tocantins basin, but this designation is not recognized by any international organization and the Committee on Taxonomy of the Society for Marine Mammalogy suggests this analysis is not persuasive.\nSubspecies [ edit ]\nInia geoffrensis geoffrensis inhabits most of the Amazon River, including rivers Tocantins, Araguaia, low Xingu and Tapajos, the Madeira to the rapids of Porto Velho, and rivers Purus, Yurua, Ica, Caqueta, Branco, and the Rio Negro through the channel of Casiquiare to San Fernando de Atabapo in the Orinoco river, including its tributary: the Guaviare.\nInia geoffrensis boliviensis has populations in the upper reaches of the Madeira River, upstream of the rapids of Teotonio, in Bolivia. It is confined to the Mamore River and its main tributary, the It\u00e9nez.\nInia geoffrensis humboldtiana are located in the Orinoco River basin, including the Apure and Meta rivers. This subspecies is restricted, at least during the dry season, to the waterfalls of Rio Negro rapids in the Orinoco between Samariapo and Puerto Ayacucho, and the Casiquiare canal. This subspecies is not recognized by the Committee on Taxonomy of the Society for Marine Mammalogy, or the IUCN.\nBiology and ecology [ edit ]\nDescription [ edit ]\nMale Amazon river dolphins are either solid pink or mottled grey/pink.\nThe Amazon river dolphin is the largest river dolphin. Adult males reach a maximum length and weight of 2.55 metres (8.4 ft) (average 2.32 metres (7.6 ft)) and 185 kilograms (408 lb) (average 154 kilograms (340 lb)), while females reach a length and weight of 2.15 metres (7.1 ft) (mean 2 metres (6.6 ft)) and 150 kilograms (330 lb) (average 100 kilograms (220 lb)). It has very evident sexual dimorphism, with males measuring and weighing between 16% and 55% more than females, making it unique among river dolphins, where females are generally larger than males.\nThe texture of the body is robust and strong but flexible. Unlike in oceanic dolphins, the cervical vertebrae are not fused, allowing the head to turn 90 degrees. The flukes are broad and triangular, and the dorsal fin, which is keel-shaped, is short in height but very long, extending from the middle of the body to the caudal region. The pectoral fins are large and paddle-shaped. The length of its fins allows the animal to perform a circular movement, allowing for exceptional maneuverability to swim through the flooded forest but decreasing its speed.\nThe body color varies with age. Newborns and the young have a dark grey tint, which in adolescence transforms into light grey, and in adults turns pink as a result of repeated abrasion of the skin surface. Males tend to be pinker than females due to more frequent trauma from intra-species aggression. The color of adults varies between solid and mottled pink and in some adults the dorsal surface is darker. It is believed that the difference in color depends on the temperature, water transparency, and geographical location. There is one albino on record, kept in an aquarium in Germany.\nAmazon river dolphins have a heterodont dentition\nThe skull of the species is slightly asymmetrical compared to the other toothed whales. It has a long, thin snout, with 25 to 28 pairs of long and slender teeth to each side of both jaws. Dentition is heterodont, meaning that the teeth differ in shape and length, with differing functions for both grabbing and crushing prey. Anterior teeth are conical and later have ridges on the inside of the crown. Despite small eyes, the species seems to have good eyesight in and out of the water. It has a melon on the head, the shape of which can be modified by muscular control when used for biosonar. Breathing takes place every 30 to 110 seconds.\nLongevity [ edit ]\nApure the dolphin lived for more than 40 years at the Duisburg Zoo\nLife expectancy of the Amazon river dolphin in the wild is unknown, but in captivity, the longevity of healthy individuals has been recorded at between 10 and 30 years. However, a 1986 study of the average longevity in captive animals in the United States is only 33 months. An individual named Baby at the Duisburg Zoo, Germany, lived at least 46 years, spending 45 years, 9 months at the zoo.\nBehavior [ edit ]\nThe Amazon river dolphin are commonly seen singly or in twos, but may also occur in pods that rarely contain more than eight individuals. Pods as large as 37 individuals have been seen in the Amazon, but average is three. In the Orinoco, the largest observed groups number 30, but average is just above five. During prey time, as many as 35 pink dolphins work together to obtain their prey. Typically, social bonds occur between mother and child, but may also been seen in heterogeneous groups or bachelor groups. The largest congregations are seen in areas with abundant food, and at the mouths of rivers. There is significant segregation during the rainy season, with males occupying the river channels, while females and their offspring are located in flooded areas. However, in the dry season, there is no such separation. Due to the high level of prey fish, larger group-sizes are seen in large sections that are directly influenced by whitewater (such as main rivers and lakes, especially during low water season) than in smaller sections influenced by blackwater (such as channels and smaller tributaries). In their freshwater habitat they are apex predators and gatherings depend more on food sources and habitat availability than in oceanic dolphins where protection from larger predators is necessary.\nCaptive studies have shown that the Amazon river dolphin is less shy than the bottlenose dolphin, but also less sociable. It is very curious and has a remarkable lack of fear of foreign objects. However, dolphins in captivity may not show the same behavior that they do in their natural environment, where they have been reported to hold the oars of the fishermen, rub against the boat, pluck underwater plants, and play with sticks, logs, clay, turtles, snakes, and fish.\nThey are slow swimmers; they commonly travel at speeds of 1.5 to 3.2 kilometres per hour (0.93 to 1.99 mph) but have been recorded to swim at speeds up to 14 to 22 kilometres per hour (8.7 to 13.7 mph). When they surface, the tips of the snout, melon and dorsal fins appear simultaneously, the tail rarely showing before diving. They can also shake their fins, and pull their tail fin and head above the water to observe the environment. They occasionally jump out of the water, sometimes as high as a meter (3.14 ft). They are harder to train than most other species of dolphin.\nCourtship [ edit ]\nAdult males have been observed carrying objects in their mouths such as branches or other floating vegetation, or balls of hardened clay. The males appear to carry these objects as a socio-sexual display which is part of their mating system. The behavior is \"triggered by an unusually large number of adult males and/or adult females in a group, or perhaps it attracts such into the group. A plausible explanation of the results is that object-carrying is aimed at females and is stimulated by the number of females in the group, while aggression is aimed at other adult males and is stimulated by object-carrying in the group.\" Before determining that the species had an evident sexual dimorphism, it was postulated that the river dolphins were monogamous. Later, it was shown that males were larger than females and are documented wielding an aggressive sexual behavior in the wild and in captivity. Males often have a significant degree of damage in the dorsal, caudal, and pectoral fins, as well as the blowhole, due to bites and abrasions. They also commonly have numerous secondary teeth-raking scars. This suggests fierce competition for access to females, with a polygynous mating system, though polyandry and promiscuity cannot be excluded.\nIn captivity, courtship and mating foreplay have been documented. The male takes the initiative by nibbling the fins of the female, but reacts aggressively if the female is not receptive. A high frequency of copulations in a couple was observed; they used three different positions: contacting the womb at right angles, lying head to head, or head to tail.\nReproduction [ edit ]\nBreeding is seasonal, and births occur between May and June. The period of birthing coincides with the flood season, and this may provide an advantage because the females and their offspring remain in flooded areas longer than males. As the water level begins to decrease, the density of food sources in flooded areas increases due to loss of space, providing enough energy for infants to meet the high demands required for growth. Gestation is estimated to be around eleven months and captive births take 4 to 5 hours. At birth, calves are 80 centimetres (31 in) long and in captivity have registered a growth of 0.21 metres (0.69 ft) per year. Lactation takes about a year. The interval between births is estimated between 15 and 36 months, and the young dolphins are thought to become independent within two to three years.\nThe relatively long duration of breastfeeding and parenting suggests a strong mother-child bond. Most couples observed in their natural environment consist of a female and her calf. This suggests that long periods of parental care contribute to learning and development of the young.\nDiet [ edit ]\nAmazon river dolphin feeding\nThe diet of the Amazon river dolphin is the most diverse of the toothed whales. It consists of at least 53 different species of fish, grouped in 19 families. The prey size is between 5 and 80 centimetres (2.0 and 31.5 in), with an average of 20 centimetres (7.9 in). The most frequently consumed fish belong to the families Sciaenidae (croakers), Cichlidae, and Characidae (tetras and piranhas). The dolphin's dentition allows it to access shells of river turtles and freshwater crabs. The diet is more diverse during the wet season, when fish are spread in flooded areas outside riverbeds, thus becoming more difficult to catch. The diet becomes more selective during the dry season when prey density is greater.\nUsually, these dolphins are active and feeding throughout the day and night. However, they are predominantly crepuscular. They consume about 5.5% of their body weight per day. They sometimes take advantage of the disturbances made by boats to catch disoriented prey. Sometimes, they associate with the distantly-related tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis), and giant otters (Pteronura brasiliensis) to hunt in a coordinated manner, by gathering and attacking fish stocks at the same time. Apparently, there is little competition for food between these species, as each prefers different prey. It has also been observed that captive dolphins share food.\nEcholocation [ edit ]\nAmazonian rivers are often very murky, and the Amazon river dolphin is therefore likely to depend much more on its sense of echolocation than vision when navigating and finding prey. However, echolocation in shallow waters and flooded forests may result in many echoes to keep track of. For each click produced a multitude of echoes are likely to return to the echolocating animal almost on top of each other which makes object discrimination difficult. This may be why the Amazon river dolphin produces less powerful clicks compared to other similar sized toothed whales. By sending out clicks of lower amplitude only nearby objects will cast back detectable echoes, and hence fewer echoes need to be sorted out, but the cost is a reduced biosonar range. Toothed whales generally do not produce a new echolocation click until all relevant echoes from the previous click have been received, so if detectable echoes are only reflected back from nearby objects, the echoes will quickly return, and the Amazon river dolphin is then able to click at a high rate. This in turn allow these animals to have a high acoustic update rate on their surroundings which may aid prey tracking when echolocating in shallow rivers and flooded forests with plenty of hiding places for the prey. While preying in murky water, they emit series of clicking noises, 30 to 80 per second, which they use by listening to the bouncing sonar which bounces off their prey.\nCommunication [ edit ]\nLike other dolphins, river dolphins use whistling tones to communicate. The issuance of these sounds is related to the time they return to the surface before diving, suggesting a link to food. Acoustic analysis revealed that the vocalisations are different in structure from the typical whistles of other species of dolphins.\nDistribution and population [ edit ]\nThe main branch of the Amazon River near Fonte Boa , Brazil, with multiple floodplains, lakes and smaller channels. The Amazon river dolphin is observed here throughout the year\nAmazon river dolphins are the most widespread river dolphins. They are present in six countries in South America: Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, in an area covering about 7,000,000 square kilometres (2,700,000 sq mi). The boundaries are set by waterfalls, such as the Xingu and Tapaj\u00f3s rivers in Brazil, as well as very shallow water. A series of rapids and waterfalls in the Madeira River have isolated one population, recognized as the subspecies I. g. boliviensis, in the southern part of the Amazon basin in Bolivia.\nThey are also distributed in the basin of the Orinoco River, except the Caroni River and the upper Caura River in Venezuela. The only connection between the Orinoco and the Amazon is through the Casiquiare canal. The distribution of dolphins in the rivers and surrounding areas depends on the time of year; in the dry season they are located in the river beds, but in the rainy season, when the rivers overflow, they disperse to the flooded areas, both the forests and the plains.\nStudies to estimate the population are difficult to analyze due to the difference in the methodology used. In a study conducted in the stretch of the Amazon called Solim\u00f5es River, with a length of 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) between the cities of Manaus and Tabatinga, a total of 332 individuals was sighted \u00b1 55 per inspection. Density was estimated at 0.08\u20130.33 animals per square kilometer in the main channels, and 0.49 to 0.93 animals per square kilometer in the branches. In another study, on a stretch of 120 kilometres (75 mi) at the confluence of Colombia, Brazil and Peru, 345 individuals with a density of 4.8 per square km in the tributaries around the islands. 2.7 and 2.0 were observed along the banks. Additionally, another study was conducted in the Amazon at the height of the mouth of the Caqueta River for six days. As a result of the studies conducted, it was found that the density is higher in the riverbanks, 3.7 per km, decreasing towards the center of the river. In studies conducted during the rainy season, the density observed in the flood plain was 18 animals per square km, while on the banks of rivers and lakes ranged from 1.8 to 5.8 individuals per square km. These observations suggest that the Amazon river dolphin is found in higher density than any other cetacean.\nHabitat and migration [ edit ]\nThe Amazon river dolphin is located in most of the area's aquatic habitats, including; river basins, major courses of rivers, canals, river tributaries, lakes, and at the ends of rapids and waterfalls. Cyclical changes in the water levels of rivers take place throughout the year. During the dry season, dolphins occupy the main river channels, and during the rainy season, they can move easily to smaller tributaries, to the forest, and to floodplains.\nMales and females appear to have selective habitat preferences, with the males returning to the main river channels when water levels are still high, while the females and their offspring remain in the flooded areas as long as possible; probably because it decreases the risk of aggression by males toward the young and predation by other species.\nIn the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve, Peru, photo-identification is used to recognize individuals based on pigmentation patterns, scars and abnormalities in the beak. 72 individuals were recognized, of which 25 were again observed between 1991 and 2000. The intervals between sightings ranged from one day to 7.5 years. The maximum range of motion was 220 kilometres (140 mi), with an average of 60.8 kilometres (37.8 mi). The longest distance in one day was 120 kilometres (75 mi), with an average of 14.5 kilometres (9.0 mi). In a previous study conducted at the center of the Amazon River, a dolphin was observed that moved only a few dozen kilometers from the dry season and wet season. However, three of the reviewed 160 animals were observed over 100 kilometres (62 mi) from where they were first registered. Research in 2011 concluded that photo-identification by skilled operatives using high-quality digital equipment could be a useful tool in monitoring population size, movements and social patterns.\nInteractions with humans [ edit ]\nIn captivity [ edit ]\nThe Amazon river dolphin has historically been kept in dolphinariums. Today, only one exists in captivity, at Zoologico de Guistochoca in Peru. Several hundred were captured between the 1950s and 1970s, and were distributed in dolphinariums throughout the US, Europe, and Japan. Around 100 went to US dolphinariums, and of that, only 20 survived; the last died at the Pittsburgh Zoo in 2002.\nThreats [ edit ]\nThe region of the Amazon in Brazil has an extension of 5,000,000 km2 (1,900,000 sq mi) containing diverse fundamental ecosystems. One of these ecosystems is a floodplain, or a v\u00e1rzea forest, and is home to a large number of fish species which are an essential resource for human consumption. The v\u00e1rzea is also a major source of income through excessive local commercialized fishing. V\u00e1rzea consists of muddy river waters containing a vast number and diversity of nutrient rich species. The abundance of distinct fish species lures the Amazon River dolphin into the v\u00e1rzea areas of high water occurrences during the seasonal flooding.\nIn addition to attracting predators such as the Amazon river dolphin, these high-water occurrences are an ideal location to draw in the local fisheries. Human fishing activities directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species, the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) and the pirapitinga (Piaractus brachypomus), resulting in deliberate or unintentional catches of the Amazon river dolphin. The local fishermen overfish and when the Amazon River dolphins remove the commercial catch from the nets and lines, it causes damages to the equipment and the capture, as well as generating ill will from the local fishermen. The negative reactions of the local fishermen are also attributed to the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources prohibition on killing the Amazon river dolphin, yet not compensating the fishermen for the damage done to their equipment and catch.\nDuring the process of catching the commercialized fish, the Amazon river dolphins get caught in the nets and exhaust themselves until they die, or the local fishermen deliberately kill the entangled dolphins. The carcasses are discarded, consumed, or used as bait to attract a scavenger catfish, the piracatinga (Calophysus macropterus). The use of the Amazon river dolphin carcass as bait for the piracatinga dates back to 2000. Increasing demand for the piracatinga has created a market for distribution of the Amazon river dolphin carcasses to be used as bait throughout these regions.\nOf the 15 dolphin carcasses found in the Japur\u00e1 River in 2010\u20132011 surveys, 73% of the dolphins were killed for bait, disposed of, or abandoned in entangled gillnets. The data do not fully represent the actual overall number of deaths of the Amazon river dolphins, whether accidental or intentional, because a variety of factors make it extremely complicated to record and medically examine all the carcasses. Scavenger species feed upon the carcasses, and the complexity of the river currents make it nearly impossible to locate all of the dead animals. More importantly, the local fishermen do not report these deaths out of fear that a legal course of action will be taken against them, as the Amazon river dolphin and other cetaceans are protected under a Brazilian federal law prohibiting any takes, harassments, and kills of the species.\nThe Amazon river is also threatened by the dumping of mercury into its waters from industrial mining, along with other harsh chemicals. Just like deforestation and burning, mercury in the water of the Amazon river is very dangerous for the fauna of the river. In 2019, F. Mosquera-Guerra at al, published a study that showed the presence of mercury in the Amazon river dolphins. They analyzed the dolphin's muscle tissue of different taxa of the Amazon basin and found high concentrations of mercury in the Tapajos River (Brazil) from an adult male of I. g. geoffrensis (pink dolphin).\nConservation [ edit ]\nIn 2008, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) expressed concern for captured botos for use as bait in the Central Amazon, which is an emerging problem that has spread on a large scale. The species is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species Fauna and Flora (CITES), and Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, because it has an unfavorable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organized by tailored agreements.\nAccording to a previous assessment by the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission in 2000, the population of botos appears great and there is little or no evidence of population decline in numbers and range. However, increased human intervention on their habitat is expected to, in the future, be the most likely cause of the decline of its range and population. A series of recommendations were issued to ensure proper follow-up to the species, among which is the implementation and publication of studies on the structure of populations, making a record of the distribution of the species, information about potential threats as the magnitude of fishing operations and location of pipelines.\nIn September 2012, Bolivian President Evo Morales enacted a law to protect the dolphin and declared it a national treasure.\nIn 2018, the species was listed on the Red list of endangered species.\nIncreasing pollution and gradual destruction of the Amazon rainforest add to the vulnerability of the species. The biggest threats are deforestation and other human activities that contribute to disrupt and alter their environment. Another source of concern is the difficulty in keeping these animals alive in captivity, due to intra-species aggression and low longevity. Captive breeding is not considered a conservation option for this species.\nIn mythology [ edit ]\nIn traditional Amazon River folklore, at night, an Amazon river dolphin becomes a handsome young man who seduces girls, impregnates them, and then returns to the river in the morning to become a dolphin again. Similarly, the female becomes a beautiful, well-dressed, wealthy-looking young woman. She goes to the house of a married man, places him under a spell to keep him quiet, and takes him to a thatched hut and visits him every year on the same night she seduced him. On the 7th night of visiting, she changes the man into a female \u2013 baby or male, and soon transfers it into his own wife's womb. The mythology is said to be the cycle of a baby. This dolphin shapeshifter is called an encantado. The myth has been suggested to have arisen partly because dolphin genitalia bear a resemblance to those of humans. Others believe the myth served (and still serves) as a way of hiding the incestuous relations which are quite common in some small, isolated communities along the river. In the area, tales relate it is bad luck to kill a dolphin. Legend also states that if a person makes eye contact with an Amazon river dolphin, they will have lifelong nightmares. According to the pink Amazon river dolphin myth, it is said that this creature takes form of a human and seduces men and women to the Underworld of Encante. This underworld place is said to be 'Atlantis-like Paradise', yet no one has come back from it alive. Myths say that whoever kills the amazon dolphin will have bad luck, but it's worse for whoever eats it. Local legends also state that the dolphin is the guardian of the Amazonian manatee, and that if one should wish to find a manatee, one must first make peace with the dolphin.\nAssociated with these legends is the use of various fetishes, such as dried eyeballs and genitalia. These may or may not be accompanied by the intervention of a shaman. A recent study has shown, despite the claim of the seller and the belief of the buyers, none of these fetishes is derived from the boto. They are derived from Sotalia guianensis, are most likely harvested along the coast and the Amazon River delta, and then are traded up the Amazon River. In inland cities far from the coast, many, if not most, of the fetishes are derived from domestic animals such as sheep and pigs.\nGallery [ edit ]\nAmazon river dolphin skull ( Inia geoffrensis )\nHeart of the Amazon river dolphin\nAmazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis)\nSee also [ edit ]\nReferences [ edit ]"}

They habitat the Antarctic Ocean, the North Atlantic, North & South Pacific and Indian Oceans.\nThey are members of the order Artiodactyla and family Balaenopteridae (or \u2018Rorquals\u2019), the largest group of Baleen whales, which includes the Humpback Whale.\nBlue Whale Facts Overview\nHabitat: Antarctic Ocean, North Atlantic Ocean, North & South Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean Location: Virtually all oceans. Lifespan: 80 \u2013 110 Years Size: 80 \u2013 108 ft (24 \u2013 30 m) Weight: 330,000 \u2013 441,000 pounds (150 \u2013 200 tonnes) Color: Deep Blue-Grey Diet: Krill (Shrimp-like crustaceans) Predators: No Natural Predators. However, there have been some Killer Whale attacks. Top Speed: 50 Kph (31 Mph) No. of Species:\n1 Conservation Status:\nEndangered\nThe Blue Whale (Balaenoptera musculus) prefer the deep ocean, rather than coastal waters or bays, and can be found living in any of the oceans located around the globe.\nThey tend to spend the warmer months feeding in the polar regions, and will participate in extensively long migrations to the Equator as winter approaches.\nBlue Whales live typically between 80 and 90 years, with some reaching up to 110 years of age.\nThey have a carnivore diet, but despite their size, these massive sea creatures prefer to eat some of the tiniest marine life. Blue Whales feast on plankton called krill, which is a small animal that resembles shrimp. Due to the relative sizes of both the blue whale and krill, they can consume as many as 40 million krill, or 8,000 pounds (3,600 kg) of it daily.\nBlue Whales can grow to over 30-metres in length, but are extremely graceful swimmers. They typically have a cruising speed of around 8-kilometres per hour, and can hit top speeds of up to 50 kph. They are also great divers, plunging down to depths of 500-metres, to seek krill to snack on.\nBecause the blue whale is the largest animal to live on the planet, it has few predators. However, shark attacks and killer whales can injure or kill a blue whale. More commonly, they succumb to injuries sustained with collisions with large sea vessels.\nThe global population of blue whales is uncertain, but based on research from the IUCN, the global total for the species is estimated to be between 10,000-25,000 and classed as endangered.\nInteresting Blue Whale Facts\n1. The mouth of the blue whale contains a row of plates that are fringed with \u2018baleen\u2019, which are similar to bristles.\nThe bristles are used to filter food from the water that the whale takes in its mouth when feeding. A mouthful of water for the Blue Whale is about 5,000-kilograms of liquid and plankton. As the whale forces the water out of its mouth, the bristles act to capture and trap the food. The whale then licks the bristles clean with its massive tongue, which allows it to swallow the plankton.\n2. The tongue of the blue whale is as big as an elephant.\nAside from cleaning krill from the plates in its mouth, the blue whale tongue weighs about as much as an elephant, or a daily car.\n3. The blue whale was once hunted for whale oil.\nIn the 1900\u2019s blue whales were extensively hunted, which severely impacted their population. Hundreds of thousands of them were massacred for their oil, which is obtained from their blubber. Historically whale oil was widely used in oil lamps, and to make soap and margarine.\n4. Blue whales were hunted almost to extinction, until they were protected in 1966.\nThe hunting for whale oil was so excessive that records suggest approx. 380,000 whales had been caught. The International Whaling Commission deemed the blue whale as a protected animal which has allowed it to breed safely.\n5. The blue whale population size is slowly increasing.\nHowever, their population has not grown back to previous levels. Pre whaling, there were estimated to be around 240,000 blue whales globally. The numbers today are estimated to be between 3-11% of the pre-1911 population size.\n6. A blue whale weighs as much as 200 tonnes. Or, 150 Honda Civics.\nThey are the heaviest animals known to ever live on the planet.\n7. Blue whales make few friends in the water.\nAlthough it is common for them to just swim around the many oceans on the planet alone or in a pair, the blue whale will from time to time swim in a small group. Where food is readily available, as many as 60 blue whales may come together.\n8. The blue whale is not only the world\u2019s largest animal, but also the loudest.\nThe human ear can\u2019t pick them up underwater, but the blue whale happens to make the loudest noise of any animal, up to 188 decibels, which is louder than a jet engine. The blue whale talks with low frequency moans, groans and pulses.\n9. The blue whale has incredible hearing.\nBecause the Blue Whale communicates with sounds that are such a low frequency, under the correct conditions, one can communicate with others and be heard as far as 1,600-kilometres away.\n10. Although a mostly solitary animal, the blue whale forms bonds.\nProbably due to the long lifespan of the blue whale, it has the ability to form an attachment to another living creature that spends time with one.\n11. Actions displayed by blue whales appear that they have feelings.\nThis belief is backed up by how whales that wash ashore will show affection towards those who rescue them as if so say thank you.\n12. The reproductive cycle for the blue whale is rather slow.\nBreeding occurs just once every three years. Pregnancy is usually between 11 and 12 months.\n13. Following such a slow reproductive cycle, blue whale families are small.\nUsually females will give birth to just one calf.\n14. A Blue whale calf is anything but a little baby.\nThe newborn calf will weigh as much as 2,700-kilograms and measure 8-metres or more in length.\n15. A Blue whale calf grows fast.\nThe calf will gain roughly 90-kilograms of weight per day in its first year of life.\n16. The Blue whale calf has a huge appetite.\nAs it is suckled in the water, a calf will consume over 600 liters of mother\u2019s milk per day in its first year.\n17. Blue whale mothers nurture their young.\nA female will lift her newborn calf to the water surface in order for it to take its first breath of air. Other females that may be nearby will help by nudging the newborn in an effort to encourage it to break the surface and breathe.\n18. Blue whales have a blowhole to breathe, similar to our nose!\nWhen one surfaces, it exhales through the blowhole at the top of its body. A cloud of pressurized air is sent as much as 9-metres in the air due to the force of exhalation. They tend to come up for air between every 5-15 mins \u2013 but can go for longer without breathing.\n19. Blue whales have a huge heart.\nAside from having feelings and showing affection, the average blue whale heart is as big as a mid-sized car. The beating of this massive heart can be heard as far as 2-mile away. Their blood vessels are so wide you could swim through them. What we are saying is, they are big. Very big.\n20. The blue whale resembles a well-known sea craft.\nWhen viewed from above, aside from having fins and a fluke, the Blue Whale can easily be mistaken for a submarine \u2013 as it has the same basic aerodynamic shape.\n21. The steering equipment is relatively small on a blue whale.\nThey use their flippers for maneuvering around under water, but the blue whale flipper is just 12-percent of the overall size of the mammal.\n22. Killer whale (Orcas) rarely attack adult blue whales, but may prey on young calves occasionally.\nTypically, killer whales pick on prey smaller than them. While blue whale are quite passive, due to their sheer size, it usually deters groups of killer whales.\n23. Research suggests ship strikes are a threat to blue whales, although relatively minor.\nWhale-ship collisions might be partly behind the low blue whale population counts, despite international protections since 1966. Howeber, studies suggest the risk is still fairly low, and that reducing the speed limit of vessels in shipping lanes helped reduce strikes by 80%.\nBlue Whale Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification\nKingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Artiodactyla Infraorder: Cetacea Family: Balaenopteridae Subfamily: Balaenoptera Species Name: Balaenoptera musculus\nSubspecies List"}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Striped Dolphin | NOAA Fisheries", "url": "https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/striped-dolphin", "text": "Striped dolphin. Credit: NOAA Fisheries\nAbout the Species\nStriped dolphins are among the most abundant and widespread dolphins in the world. They prefer deep tropical to warm temperate oceanic waters, and are attracted to upwelling areas, where deep, cold, nutrient-rich water rises toward the surface, and convergence zones, where ocean currents meet. Striped dolphins are usually found in tight, cohesive groups of about 25 to 100 individuals and have been observed breaching, jumping, and leaping over 20 feet above the surface of the water. They display a unique behavior called roto-tailing, when the animal leaps high out of the water and vigorously rotates its tail while airborne. Striped dolphins in the United States are not endangered or threatened. Like all marine mammals, they are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). NOAA Fisheries is committed to conserving striped dolphins, and our scientists and partners use a variety of innovative techniques to study and protect this species.\nPopulation Status\nStriped dolphins are abundant and widespread in offshore U.S. waters and throughout the world. NOAA Fisheries estimates population size for striped dolphin stocks in its stock assessment reports.\nProtected Status\nCITES Appendix II Throughout Its Range SPAW Annex II Throughout the Wider Caribbean Region MMPA Protected Throughout Its Range\nAppearance\nMale striped dolphins can reach lengths of about 9 feet and weigh up to 350 pounds, while females can reach up to 8 feet and 330 pounds. They have a small to medium-sized, robust, sleek body with a long, defined rostum and round forehead (known as a melon). This species has 43 to 50 pairs of small, sharp, conical teeth in the upper and lower jaws. Their dorsal fin is hooked, tall, and located mid-back. Striped dolphins are known for their distinct and striking coloration pattern, which includes bold, thin stripes that extend from the eye to the flipper and another set of stripes down the side of the body to the anal region. This unique coloration distinguishes the striped dolphin from other cetacean species and is the origin of its common name. The striped dolphin\u2019s rostrum, tapered pectoral fins or flippers, tail, and back (or cape) are dark blue/gray. The area just above the side stripe is bluish or light gray and creates a contrasting shoulder blaze that curves back and up toward the animal's dorsal fin. The underside of the body is white to pinkish and much lighter than the rest of the body. The markings and coloration of this species may vary by individual and geographic location. Calves and juveniles may have more muted colorations and patterns than adults.\nBehavior and Diet\nStriped dolphins are usually found in tight, cohesive groups averaging between 25 and 100 individuals, but they have occasionally been seen in larger groups of up to several hundred and even thousands of animals. Within these groups, there is a complex system of individuals that may be organized by age, sex, and breeding status. Striped dolphins rarely associate with other species of whales, dolphins, and seabirds. Their surface behavior is often characterized as sociable, athletic, energetic, active, and nimble with rapid swimming. They can often be observed breaching, roto-tailing (a circular motion using the tail while jumping out of the water), jumping, and leaping 20 feet above the surface. In the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, field biologists and fishermen call striped dolphins \"streakers\" because they avoid vessels by rapidly swimming away. Striped dolphins feed throughout the water column on a diverse diet of fish and cephalopods (e.g., squid and octopus). They are capable of diving to at least 2,300 feet.\nWhere They Live\nStriped dolphins prefer tropical to warm temperate waters (52 to 84\u00b0 F) that are oceanic and deep. They are mainly found in waters seaward of the continental shelf from 50\u00b0 North to 40\u00b0 South and are often linked to upwelling areas and convergence zones. Striped dolphins are found worldwide. Their range includes waters off Greenland, northern Europe (United Kingdom, Denmark), the Mediterranean Sea, Japan, Argentina, South Africa, western Australia, and New Zealand. In the United States, they can be found off the west coast, in the northwestern Atlantic, and in the Gulf of Mexico. They also live in the waters off Hawai\u2018i, but do not live in the colder temperate and boreal waters of Alaska. This species has been documented outside its normal range in areas such as the Faroe Islands, Denmark\u2019 southern Greenland; the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia; and Prince Edward Island, Canada.\nLifespan & Reproduction\nThe estimated lifespan of striped dolphins is up to 58 years. They become sexually mature when they reach about 7 feet in length\u2014between the ages of 5 and 13 years for females and 7 and 15 years for males. Their mating system is generally unknown, but is thought to be polygynous, meaning one male mates with more than one female. Every 3 to 4 years, females give birth to a single 3-foot-long calf during the summer or autumn after a gestation period of about 1 year. Lactation lasts 12 to 18 months.\nThreats\nEntanglement in Fishing Gear One of the main threats to striped dolphins is becoming entangled or captured in commercial fishing gear such as trawls, gillnets, purse-seine nets, and hand-harpoons. Disease In the early 1990s, more than 1,000 striped dolphins died in the Mediterranean Sea from a morbillivirus epizootic\u2014a temporary, highly contagious, widespread, and lethal disease outbreak\u2014that may have been triggered by pollution (e.g., organochlorines) and fewer available prey. Environmental toxins and contaminants lower their disease immunity. Hunting Striped dolphins have been subjected to drive hunts in Japan and taken in Sri Lanka and the Caribbean. During the mid-20th century, as many as 21,000 animals were caught and killed each year.\nScientific Classification"}

Manatees live in shallow, calm rivers, estuaries, bays, canals and coastal areas. Manatees can travel from fresh to salt water without any problems. The Florida manatee is found most of its time in Florida but can travel as far north as Virginia.\nWhat do manatees eat? Manatees are herbivores, which means they eat only plants. This means that they do not eat any fish or crustaceans. Manatees eat mainly sea grass found on the ocean floor. To get down to the bottom easier, manatees have solid bones that help make them heavier."}

A bottlenose dolphin's back is a light to slate gray color, which fades to a pale gray or pink belly. This species' dorsal fin is tall and curves backward. The fluke, or tail fin, is curved with a deep notch in the middle, and their pectoral, or side, fins are pointed.\nBecause they are mammals, they come to the surface to breathe, usually about twice a minute. Bottlenose dolphins have 86 to 100 sharp, cone-shaped teeth, which they use to catch slippery fish.\nGuests can visit Dolphin Discovery as often and for as long as they like.

(And Other Cool Dolphin Facts)", "url": "https://www.grunge.com/79770/dolphins-really-smart-cool-dolphin-facts/", "text": "Dolphins can famously be trained to respond to a baffling array of commands. According to The Guardian, one particularly interesting example of this occurred at the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Mississippi where resident dolphins were trained to collect any trash that fell into their tanks and give it to trainers in return for fish. Soon, a dolphin named Kelly learned that she could collect and hide pieces of paper and then tear the paper into smaller pieces to get multiple fish. This showed dolphins are capable of forward planning and can understand the concept of delayed gratification, basically holding off on a small reward now for a possibly much larger reward later.\nKelly though wasn't done flexing her intellect, though. One day, the dolphin caught a seagull that landed in her tank. When she gave it to a researcher, she was rewarded with a big ol' handful of fish. Underwater lightbulb moment! Kelly then began leaving fish out in the open to lure in more seagulls, which she quickly killed and traded in for even more fish. Kelly also taught this seagull murder trap to her offspring, who in turn taught it to other dolphins.\nSo yeah, if dolphins ever begin systematically taking out humans one by one, know that they won't be doing it because of climate change or because we flush sewage into the ocean. They'll be doing it for the fishies."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Mahi Mahi (Dolphin Fish) images!\nMahi mahi, also called common dolphinfish, is a surface-dwelling ray-finned fish species that lives in temperate, tropical, and subtropical waters around the world.\nIt is considered one of the most beautiful ocean fish because of its shimmery, vivid colors. The fish is very popular for sport and commercial fishing and has white meat with a firm, moist texture, a sweet, mild flavor, a variety of recipes and several health benefits. Its name is sometimes confused for Ahi, the Hawaiian word for yellowfin tuna.\n5 Mahi Mahi Facts\nThe name mahi mahi is preferred over dolphinfish so as to not confuse it with the marine mammal. It was called dolphinfish because of its tendency to swim ahead of sailing ships, like dolphins do. The fish was first a bycatch of tuna and swordfish fisheries, but now has a longline fishery just for its species. The term \u201cclipper\u201d means the highest-quality mahi mahi, which is frozen at sea for freshness. It can swim up to 60mph.\nClassification and Scientific Name\nThe name mahi mahi is a Hawaiian word meaning \u201cvery strong,\u201d but it\u2019s also called mahi mahi lapa, mahi mahi oma, and mahihi. In Spanish, it is called dorado, referring to its muted golden color upon coming out of the water. Its scientific name is Coryphaena hippurus. The genus Coryphaena refers to dolphinfishes and is the only genus of the family Coryphaenidae.\nCarl Linnaeus named the genus from the Greek word koryphe, which means top or apex in 1758. Synonymous scientific names for the species are Coryphaena argyrurus, Coryphaena chrysurus, and Coryphaena dolfyn. Its closest relatives are the remora, jack, and cobia.\nSpecies\nAlthough there is one mahi mahi, it is divided into Atlantic and Pacific. There is one other species in the genus Coryphaena, the pompano dolphinfish (Coryphaena equiselis). Like its close relative, it is a surface-dwelling fish and is often a substitute for swordfish. It overlaps with it in its habitat of tropical and subtropical waters around the world. Sometimes, it\u2019s mistaken for juvenile mahi mahi, and it is smaller than the adult mahi mahi.\nAppearance\nThese fish have flattened bodies with a long-based dorsal fin that extends nearly all the way from the head to the tail. Males have large, protruding foreheads, while females have rounded heads. Both of their caudal and anal fins are very concave. However, what strikes people the most is their beautiful colors of shimmery golden sides, blue and green sides and back, and a golden flank with shimmery blue pectoral fins.\nThe fish have features that help them to avoid predators. For one thing, their coloring is believed to help them camouflage themselves by changing the way light reflects off their skin while they roam the open ocean at surface levels. Also, their body shape and their long-based dorsal fin help them swim up to 60mph.\nOn average, these fish measure 39.3in long and weigh 15-29lbs, but rarely exceed 33lbs. Females are smaller than males.\nDistribution, Population, and Habitat\nThis fish species lives in saltwater and makes its habitat in temperate, tropical, and subtropical waters of the Indian, Atlantic, and Pacific oceans. It is most common around Hawaii, the Gulf of Mexico, Costa Rica, and the Indian Ocean. As a surface-dwelling fish, it can be found at depth levels of 5-10m on the open sea but also near the coast.\nThis species is highly migratory and travels in schools. Spawning on the open sea, it moves closer to the coast when the temperature rises.\nWild-caught mahi mahi is sustainably managed and its numbers are considered to be stable for both Alantic and Pacific populations, although population numbers are not known. The IUCN Red List lists the common dolphinfish as Least Concern.\nWhere to Find Mahi Mahi and How to Catch Them\nYou can find these fish in waters with a temperature of 83 degrees F, and more of them during spring and fall. Fishermen in French Polynesia use harpoons to catch them, but because the fish are also attracted to floating objects, you can easily catch them by throwing bait out next to floating seaweed.\nPredators and Prey\nThese fish are really omnivorous, although its diet is mainly carnivorous. Its speed allows it to quickly catch its prey. To minimize detection by predators, its coloring serves as camouflage on the open ocean, while its body shape allows it to swim quickly. Because it grows so fast, it can quickly replenish its numbers.\nWhat do mahi mahi eat?\nIt eats flying fish, mackerel and other forage fish, crabs, and squid. It also eats zooplankton and sargassum weed.\nWhat eats mahi mahi?\nSharks, billfishes, large tuna, marlin, sailfish, swordfish, and marine mammals eat mahi mahi. Humans also eat mahi mahi.\nReproduction and Lifespan\nBoth males and females become sexually mature in 3-5 months and for this reason are known as the rabbits of the ocean. They spawn at when they reach 7.9-22in. Females spawn up to 2-3 times a year and can release anywhere between 80,000 and 1,000,000 eggs each time. The mahi mahi\u2019s lifespan can be up to 5 years, although it usually doesn\u2019t live longer than 4.\nMahi Mahi in Fishing and Cooking\nThese fish are caught in both recreational and commercial fishing. Locations that are its largest consumers are Hawaii, the United States, the Caribbean, Australia, and Japan, although it is becoming more commonly eaten in European countries. Global supply locations for the fish are Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, and United States.\nThis fish has a meat that turns white when cooked. It has a firm, moist texture, and a sweet, mild flavor. Out of four levels of mercury, it is a moderate-mercury fish. The benefits of mahi mahi are lean protein, iron, selenium, potassium, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin B.\nView all 111 animals that start with M"}

They are known as \u2018cetaceans\u2019.\nWhat are mammals?\nHumans are mammals, and together with other animals, like whales, dolphins, and land-based animals like elephants, bears, lions etc, we all form a group of animals known as mammals. Mammals have hair, lungs, are warm blooded, can live on land or in water, and give birth to live young (apart from the duck-billed platypus and the echidna who lay eggs).\nHow are whales & dolphins similar to other mammals, and how do they differ?\nWhales are warm blooded animals (they keep a high body temperature that doesn\u2019t change in the cold water), they breathe air, have some hair (albeit sparse) and \u200bgive birth to live young, feeding them with milk frommammary glands. Unlike most other mammals, however, whales do not have external hind limbs, their forelimbs are modified into flippers, they have extra vertebrae in their trunk and back, and flukes on their tails for locomotion, and their nostrils are situated at or near the top of the head rather than the tip of the snout.\nWhat\u2019s in a name?\nWhale comes from the Anglo Saxon hwael meaning \u2018a large fish\u2019\nmeaning \u2018a large fish\u2019 Dolphin comes from the Greek delphin and in fact the common dolphin\u2019s latin name is Delphinus delphis.\nand in fact the common dolphin\u2019s latin name is Delphinus delphis. Porpoise derives from the Latin phrase porcus, which means hog and piscis meaning fish, literally meaning sea pig. The porpoise\u2019s relationship to a pig is found in many names, for example, in South America it is known as chancho mariono which means sea pig and in Germany it is called meerschwein also meaning sea pig.\nWhat are Cetaceans?\nWhales, dolphins and porpoises are known as cetaceans. There are 14 baleen whale species, 3 sperm whales, 22 beaked whales, 2 monodontids (narwhal and beluga), 38 oceanic dolphins, 4 river dolphins and 7 porpoises. The number of species recorded in the world has increased as modern genetic techniques reveal differences that previously we could not easily detect.\nHow many species of whales, dolphins and porpoises exist today?\nThere are 90 species of whales, dolphins and porpoises (cetaceans). The number of species recorded in the world has increased in recent years as modern genetic techniques reveal differences that previously we could not readily detect.\nAre seals in the same category as cetaceans?\nNo, marine mammals are classified into four different taxonomic groups: cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses), sirenians (manatees and dugongs), and marine fissipeds (polar bears and sea otters).\nWhat is the difference between a dolphin and a porpoise?\nDolphins tend to have more prominent, long shaped \u201cbeaks\u201d and they have cone-shaped teeth with a hooked/ curved dorsal fin. Porpoises have smaller jaws and spade-shaped teeth with a triangular dorsal fin.\nHow variable in size are different species (which is the largest and which is the smallest)?\nThe \u200bworld\u2019s smallest cetacean is the vaquita porpoise Phocoena sinus, which means \u2018little cow\u2019. These small whales grow to around 1.5 metres (4.5 feet) long and weigh c. 55 kg (120 pounds).The vaquita now only exists in a small area in the northernmost part of the Upper Gulf of California in Mexico. They are the smallest marine cetacean in the world and sadly the most endangered. Other small species include the harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena (adult length 1.4-1.9 m length), and Burmeister\u2019s porpoise Phocoena spinipinnis (1.5-1.9 m length). The smallest species called a whale is the dwarf pygmy sperm whale Kogia simus (2.5-2.7 m length).The largest cetacean is the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus). It is also the largest animal on Earth! Adult length in the northern hemisphere can be: female: 25 m; male: 24 m. Adult weight: 50,000 \u2013 150,000 kg. Blue whales in the southern hemisphere are generally larger, with the largest specimen ever measured having been over 33 m long.The killer whale or orca (Orcinusorca) grows up to 31 feet (9.4 metres) making it the largest dolphin on earth. So, there are many different shapes and sizes in between.\nLiving in Water\nWhy do some whales and dolphins have a dorsal fin?\nThe dorsal or back fin stabilises the mammal in the same way as a keel on a sailboat stabilises a boat. Most whales and dolphins have a dorsal fin, but in some it has been reduced to just a series of bumps, such as in the sperm whale. In some it has been lost altogether such as in the beluga, narwhal and right whales.\nHow well do whales and dolphins see?\nWhales and dolphins have excellent vision, both in the water and in the air. The only species of dolphins with reduced vision are the river dolphins found in the Amazon, Ganges and Indus rivers. Here the eye is simply a slit 2-3 mm in diameter.\nWhat is Sounding?\nSounding is a word used when whales and dolphins dive down deeply into the water, usually to look for food.\nWhat is Breaching?\nBreaching is when whales and dolphins launch their bodies out of the water almost vertically. They then descend onto their backs with a huge crash. Humpbacks will breach during courtship, in the winter months.\nHow deep can whales and dolphins dive?\nMost whales and dolphins spend most of their time swimming in 100 metres of water because this is where food is most plentiful. Scientific studies have shown, however, that sperm whales can dive as deeply as 1,185 metres, whilst a bottlenose whale dived to an incredible depth of 1,453 metres off the coast of Nova Scotia. Bottlenose whales can hold their breath for up to 2 hours!\nA captive bottlenose dolphin was trained by the US Navy to dive as deeply as 535 meters.\nWhat is a Blow?\nA blow is an outward breath of a whale or dolphin and is explosive! Sometimes the species can be identified by their blows. Often the blows are 5-6 metres high and are visible for several miles. An experienced observer can estimate the size of the individual by the height of the blow. Baleen whales produces a double blow, because they have two nostrils instead of one, although the double blow often merges into one single plume, as in the humpback whale.\nWhen a blue whale exhales, the spray from its blowhole can reach nearly 30 ft (9m) into the air.\nMale or Female?\nThe underside of a dolphin tells us if it is male or female. Males have their genital slit much higher up compared to the females which is nearer the fluke area, where the anus is.\nDo whales and dolphins sleep?\nWhales and dolphins do not sleep in the same way that we do and the reason for this is that when they sleep they stop breathing. So they can only sleep or doze for short periods. Some whales doze just under the surface of the water, rising up just enough to take a breath. Sometimes ships run over whales \u2018sleeping\u2019 in the shipping lanes.\nHowever, they can also go into a semi-sleep mode where one half of the brain switches off but they continue to surface for breaths.\nHow do whales and dolphins make sounds?\nThis isn\u2019t an easy question to answer, because whales and dolphins don\u2019t have vocal cords like humans do. In dolphins the low frequency whistle sounds they make are thought to be produced by their larynges, and the high-pitched clicks by the complex structure in their foreheads.\nThe sounds that humpback whales make are known as whale songs. Whale songs like bird song serve as a means of communication. Only male humpbacks actually sing and it is one of the best ways to advertise for a mate!\nRecent studies carried out with the bottlenose dolphins in Cardigan Bay in West Wales have shown that they have their own accent and that their whistle is slightly different from other dolphins from western Ireland, for example!\nDolphin Facts\nHow do dolphins keep warm?\nDolphins have a layer of blubber under their skin which keeps them warm. They also have less of their body mass exposed to the outside, which means they cool more slowly. They are also able to \u2018pump out\u2019 metabolic body heat faster than we can. Their bodies are very clever because they can change the flow of blood, so that it stays within the body, and not flowing into their outer body parts e.g. tail (fluke) and fins.\nWhat is a blackfish?\nBlackfish, is the slang term for small, dark-coloured toothed whales. Some examples of these whales are the false killer whale, pygmy killer whale, and long-finned pilot whale.\nWhale Facts\nWhat are the differences between Baleen and Toothed Whales?\nBaleen whales don\u2019t have teeth (mysticetes) and toothed whales (odontocetes) do, and the difference reflects a fundamental difference in feeding habits. Baleen whales, like the blue whale, are the largest in size. There are 14 baleen whales in total and they feed on plankton, krill (little shrimps) and small fish, from the sea water.\nToothed whales account for all the remaining 76 species of whales, dolphins and porpoises and they all have varying numbers of teeth. They hunt and feed on individual prey, for example, larger fish, squid, octopus and sometimes other small mammals. Another difference is that toothed whales use echolocation, mentioned in your \u201cAll about Dolphins\u201d booklet, emitting high frequency bursts of sound that reflect back from their prey. There is no evidence of baleen whales using echolocation.\nIf Baleen whales don\u2019t have teeth, what do they have instead?\nThey have lines of bristles called baleen, formed from the same substance that makes fingernails and hair. These bristles are continuously worn away and then\nregenerated. The bristles enable the whale to trap the prey it takes into its mouth whilst releasing the sea water at the same time!\nWhat are rorquals?\nRorquals are the largest group of baleen whales. This group of whales include the blue whale, the fin whale and the northern minke whale.\nWhat are beaked whales?\nBeaked whales are not easily seen by humans due to the fact that they are deep-diving animals that forage on deep sea squids, found offshore in waters \u200bsometimes as deep at 3,000 metres! They catch their squid or octopus prey by sucking them into their mouths. They have no teeth showing other than one to two pairs in the lower jaw. These teeth usually show only in adult males where they are used to establish dominance and as tools for fighting. Their dorsal fins are usually small, triangular and far back on the animal\u2019s body. Sadly, these beaked whales can be affected by noise pollution from navy sonar and seismic exploration. \u200bThey may try to avoid such loud noises by interrupting their dive rising rapidly towards the surface and swimming quickly away without a full recovery dive. \u200bLosing the ability to manage gases under pressure, the result of that can be the build-up of nitrogen in tissues causing gas bubbles (termed emboli) to form, leading to disorientation and ultimately stranding.\nDo whales have tusks?\nThe male narwhal does! A tusk is simply a long pointed tooth, which sticks out from a whale\u2019s mouth even when it is closed. The male narwhal has one upper tusk which can be as long as 3 metres.\nDo all whales migrate?\nAll whales move around a lot but only some species undergo long migrations, and even within a species or population, not every whale may migrate. \u200bFor example, the smaller juvenile humpback whales may not travel as far as adults \u200bto tropical regions as they are not mature enough to reproduce. These younger whales often stay in cooler waters and exploit the prey that occurs there even in the winter. \u200bMature sperm whales, particularly females, on the other hand may remain year-round in the tropics.\nWhy do whales migrate?\nA number of whales migrate \u200blong distances annually because \u200bthe conditions favouring breeding and feeding are in widely separated regions. \u200bSome species of whales undertake migrations amounting to thousands of kilometres, between \u200bfeeding grounds in polar regions and safe breeding areas in the tropics.\nHow far can whales travel?\nWhales can travel a few thousand miles during a single migration. In fact, humpback whales can migrate further than any other mammal on Earth. They can travel around 3,000 miles (5,000 kilometres) each way between their breeding and feeding grounds on a regular basis.\nDo whales feed on migration?\nThe adult whales feed on swarms of plankton in polar regions during the summer, but do not eat \u200b(or only a small amount) throughout the winter when they are migrating \u200bor breeding due to lack of food available, Whilst they are having calves, they rely on their fat stores, known as blubber. Migrating whales can travel 6,000 miles or 10,000 kilometres (there and back).\nHow do scientists track whales?\nScientists use \u200beither GPS or satellite technology. By using images taken from space (385 miles above the Earth\u2019s surface), researchers \u200bhave been able to plot migratory patterns of different species of \u200bbaleen whales. They hope that this information will give us a better understanding of how these amazing mammals survive through the different seasons and with the challenging environmental changes they face each year.\nHow are whales adapted to life in water?\nBody Surface\nThe hair that covers most mammals is massively reduced in cetaceans. Hair is a poor insulator when wet and would also increase drag when the whales are swimming. Some hairs are still found on the head of some whales, with isolated follicles on the lower jaw and snout area \u2013 thought to be the remnants of vibrissae (sensory whiskers). Skin pigmentation on cetaceans can help one identify individuals in a species. Without the hair coverage, the epidermis may produce markings \u2013 most commonly in black and white although small wounds can be affected by various growths and organisms that live on the cetacean\u2019s skin, such as yellow algae and whitish organisms that live on the lower surface of some cetaceans. Some cetaceans also play host to barnacles (see photo of the grey whale).\nAdaptations for locomotion\nHow cetaceans move around is the most noticeable adaptation to life in the water. Instead of horizontal planes of movement as in crocodiles \u200bfor example, cetaceans use vertical strokes to swim. They have evolved from four legged terrestrial mammals to almost limbless aquatic mammals where their back muscles are most important. Cetaceans still do have forelimbs; however, they have become reduced to fins/flippers such as shortened arm bones with all individual fingers inside the one fin/flipper. The hind legs are totally gone, leaving only vestigial elements. Pelvic similarities are found in all cetaceans apart from the dwarf and pygmy sperm whales. The flippers allow the cetacean to steer, whilst back muscles drive the tail to propel forwards. Horizontal flukes have developed to increase the propulsion area created by the back muscles.\nRespiration\nCetaceans normally breathe whilst moving through the water and spend short periods of time on the surface to exhale in a quick hard ventilation (blow). This blow can be compared to our coughs. However, they use up to 80% of their lung volume in this single breath compared to the small amount that humans do (20%). When terrestrial mammals lose consciousness, they still automatically breathe. However, cetaceans cannot do this. So, if a whale becomes unconscious, it cannot breathe and will quickly die if not helped.\nCirculation and thermoregulation\nCetaceans, have a four-chambered heart with paired ventricles and auricles just like all mammals. However, the only difference is that they have a larger series of well-developed reservoirs for oxygenated blood. These provide bypasses that enable cetaceans to isolate skeletal muscle circulation during diving while using the oxygen stored in the remaining blood to maintain the heart and brain\u2014these organs depend on the supply of oxygen to survive. \u200bWhales have a particularly high concentration of oxygen in the blood, stored in their myoglobin. To stop the cetaceans from losing body heat so easily their bodies have evolved \u200bcertain adaptations: reduced external appendages for less heat loss and better locomotion, a layer of blubber, and also a counter-current blood circulation, with fine capillary blood vessels at the extremities which can shut off blood flow. In whales, a layer of the skin (dermis) has evolved into a blanket of blubber, which is extremely rich in fats and oils, and therefore conducts heat poorly. This blanket covers the entire body, making up a significant portion of the animal\u2019s weight.\nDo killer whales deserve their name?\nThe name killer whale implies a deadly animal\nwhose predatory behaviour is unique amongst the animal kingdom and should send fear tingling down one\u2019s spine. It is true that they are extremely efficient hunters and are able to take down a wide variety of other marine animals \u2013 not just fishes but also birds and mammals \u2013 sea lions, seals, porpoises and even large whales. However, it is very rare for them to attack humans (cases of this almost always involve captive animals). When capturing such prey, they use a mix of guile, speed and agility along with a lot of stamina and some massive teeth (which can grow up to 4 inches or 10 cm). Although unusual for cetaceans, many other species will feed on other mammals, and so we may prefer to call the killer whale by its alternative name of orca.\nClimate Change\nWhat is climate change?\nClimate is the average weather that occurs in a place over many years. For example, here in the UK we have a \u2018temperate\u2019 climate which generally means we get cool, dry winters, and warm, wet summers. BUT, the climate is changing all over the world and this is called climate change.\nHow is the climate changing?\nTemperatures are rising, which means that Planet Earth is becoming warmer both on land and in the sea. This has been happening particularly over the last 50 years.\nWhy are temperatures increasing?\nThe planet is warming up due to a number of reasons \u2013 we burn fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) so that we can run businesses and factories, drive our cars, and heat our homes. Fossil fuels are non-renewable (once they are gone they are gone), and they are bad for the environment because they release carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas).\nWhat is carbon dioxide?\nCarbon dioxide is an important gas that makes up the Earth\u2019s atmosphere along with oxygen and nitrogen. It helps to trap heat in our atmosphere and, without it, life would be very cold! However, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing to levels that is making the Earth\u2019s temperature rise too much. Humans are relying on fossil fuels far too much for their daily lives.\nWhat else is releasing carbon dioxide?\nHuman activities such as deforestation (cutting down forests), burning fossil fuels, and burning fires all release carbon dioxide into the environment, but natural events such as volcanic eruptions also release it. In addition, the emissions of various manufactured chemicals (such as those used in paints, spray cans, glue, fridge chemicals, foams etc) can deplete the ozone layer in the atmosphere which otherwise protects the earth from overheating.\nWhat can we do to stop carbon levels from going up?\nIf we stopped cutting down trees (deforestation) that would really help because trees actually reduce the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere during the process of photosynthesis (when green plants and other organisms capture energy from sunlight to produce oxygen and chemical energy).\nof photosynthesis (when green plants and other organisms capture energy from sunlight to produce oxygen and chemical energy). If we stopped relying on energy from burning fossil fuels and we used renewable energy more often, for example, solar, wind, tidal, geothermal, or biomass energies.\nWhat can I do?\nThere are many things that you can do to limit your carbon footprint. Some are:\nEat less meat. Animals (cattle) create greenhouse gas emissions, and looking after them and making sure they are fed properly takes up valuable land, which we could be using to grow more crops, or even more trees!\nEat locally grown and seasonal fruit and vegetables\nDon\u2019t waste food\nRe-use plastic bags or even better, bring your own!\nRecycle more \u2013 donate clothes you no longer need to second hand shops, and try buying clothes from second hand shops.\nUse public transport more often, or jump on your bike!\nTry turning down the thermostat in the house by just 1 degree. It\u2019ll make a BIG difference.\nDon\u2019t waste water by leaving the tap running, and try jumping in a quick shower, instead of always having a bath.\nUnplug equipment when not in use.\nDo whales really help with carbon levels?\nYes! They absolutely do. Whales build up large amounts of carbon in their bodies over their lifetime. For example, one humpback whale can carry 30,000 tonnes of carbon which will go to the bottom of the ocean when its body sinks after death. When carbon is stored in this way, scientists call it \u2018blue carbon\u2019.\nWhat are the threats facing cetaceans?\nWhales and dolphins have to face five main threats every day of their lives. These are:\nBycatch (being accidentally caught in fishing nets)\nShip strikes (when boats or ships accidentally hit cetaceans)\nOverfishing (when humans take too much fish from the oceans for themselves and don\u2019t think about the other species who also need to eat!)\nPollution (when cetaceans are affected by our rubbish and waste)\nDisturbance (this is usually when human activity causes noise that affects cetaceans in different ways)\nThere are other threats such as hunting and climate change. Hunting only occurs in some countries, certainly not in the UK, and climate change affects all creatures on the planet, not just cetaceans.\nLet\u2019s look at the threats in more detail..\nBycatch\nBycatch is when something is caught in a net (or other fishing equipment/gear) that the fishermen didn\u2019t intend to catch. For example, if a fishing boat goes out to catch fish such as mackerel or cod (target prey), and accidentally catch haddock or even worse, a dolphin (bycatch)! This happens because fishing equipment is very efficient (designed well for catching fish), and it doesn\u2019t allow for fish or animals to escape. All sorts of animals can get bycaught, for example, turtles, sharks, sea birds, fish, and marine mammals (whales, dolphins, porpoise & seals).\nThere are many different types of fishing equipment (fishing gear) available, and each is carefully designed to catch different types of fish. You may have heard of trawlers, gill nets, long lines, purse seines, pole and line and pots and traps. A lobster pot is an easy example, it\u2019s designed to catch lobsters! Trawlers, such as bottom trawlers are designed to catch flat fish (plaice, sole, dab and flounder for example) and other animals that live on the seabed, like shrimp. Gill nets are designed to catch larger fish such as, salmon, tuna and cod.\nGill nets and trawlers are the worst fishing gear for catching dolphins. Gill nets are set up far out at sea, and hang like enormous curtains in the water. The problem is that the net itself is virtually invisible to animals because it\u2019s made from very thin, transparent (see through) material that a dolphin only picks up with its sonar (echolocation) sometimes too late! When dolphins swim they are constantly echolocating (looking) ahead and around themselves (just like we do when we walk down the street), and if they comes across lots of tasty look fish in the water, it can be too tempting to miss! They get caught up (entangled) in the fine mesh and drown because they can\u2019t get to the surface to breathe.\nTrawlers work in a different way. They are huge, cone-shaped nets with a closed end, that are dragged behind one or two boats along the seabed and are designed to scoop up anything in their path. They can be very damaging to the seabed because nothing really survives behind them, and curious, hungry dolphins who see the tasty fish inside the net, can get themselves into trouble by getting caught. Once inside a trawl net, there\u2019s no getting out, and of course we know that mammals need air to breathe, so sadly they drown.\nPots, traps, nets and lines are the main fishing gear that is a problem for whales. Whales can get caught up (entangled) in long lines and ropes that are attached to pots or traps at the end. As the whale continues to swim it pulls along the trap/pot behind it, sometimes for hundreds of miles. It can continue to get entangled in more and more lines as it swims until it becomes completely weighed down and tangled up, and eventually drowns.\nShip strikes\nA ship or vessel strike is when a boat and an ocean-dwelling animal collide (accidentally hit each other). This can happen to sea birds, turtles, sharks, fish, seals and cetaceans.\nStrikes can happen with any type or size of boat/vessel and are more common in busy stretches of water, for example where oil tankers or container ships travel or passenger ferries cross regularly. It\u2019s important to remember that ship strikes are accidental, the skipper of the vessel just won\u2019t see the animal in time because, whales for example travel mainly under the water. Whales are most affected by being hit by vessels and this is because fast- travelling vessels often cross their habitats (places where they live), and annual migration routes (when a whale travels to northern and southern oceans to feed, mate, and have their young). Just like we love tasty food, so do whales, and they follow their food (fish or krill) to make sure they have enough to eat.\nOverfishing\nJust like cetaceans love fish, so do we humans! The problem is that we (humans) take far too much fish from the oceans and are not slowing down! Even though we know that the number of fish is decreasing (becoming smaller), we don\u2019t seem to change the quantity that we take. Over the years our fishing boats have become much larger, more efficient, and our fishing gear has also become much better at catching fish. Nowadays, we take salt and ice aboard with us so that we can store and keep the fish fresh, whilst we continue to fish, for sometimes weeks at a time, whereas years ago we would go out fishing for a day at a time, giving the fish a chance to have their young and therefore grow in numbers again. We also tend to fish every day of the year but used not to. We used to fish in season, allowing fish stocks to replenish by not fishing all year around.\nPollution\nSadly, pollution of our planet comes in all shapes and forms. Pollution of our seas can be from oil (oil leaks from tankers), plastic, chemicals,"}

Dolphin illustrates the emotion of water and the intellect of air in harmony.\nBecause of the Dolphin\u2019s history of saving people from drowning or shark attacks, Dolphin represents protection. Sailors considered sighting Dolphins as a positive omen. Reports from wherever Dolphin dwell recount stories of this creature helping stranded fish too.\nGreek mythology tells us that Dolphin Spirit carries the spirits of the dead to the next reality. From a symbolic standpoint this gives Dolphin the additional meaning of rebirth and renewal. Many people who work with Dolphin energy find their lives transforming (where one door closes, another opens). Throughout the process of change, Dolphin provides courage, self-confidence, virtue and strength to endure tumultuous waters.\nDolphin Spirit Animal\nAs a Spirit Animal and guide Dolphin comes to those who need to reclaim their voice, communicating in effective, honest ways. This creature also mentors those out of touch with nature\u2019s rhythms and messages.\nSome lightworkers feel that Dolphin may, in fact, have higher intelligence and instincts than humankind.

Trust Dolphin\u2019s instincts.\nDolphin Native American Symbolism\nWhat do Dolphins symbolize in Native American culture?\nThe answer to this can depend to some degree on the specific culture or tribe.\nDolphin stories appear among Native American tribes that had a presence near the ocean.\nOn the West coast, the Natives tell us that Dolphins were once people who were changed and now act as guardians of the tribe, up to and including being willing to give their life. Others believed that Dolphins would save people who had fallen overboard or who were at risk of drowning.\nDolphins are often associated with reincarnation and rebirth.\nWhat do Dolphins represent in Native legends? It\u2019s worth noting that white settlers who interpreted Native stories often used references to Porpoise and Dolphin interchangeably. We have come to associate the meaning of Dolphin Spirit Animal with the stories of Dall\u2019s Porpoises off the coast of Alaska. These sea mammals featured prominently in the Tinglit tribe, whose clan and totem names referred to Porpoise specifically, not what the majority culture refers to as \u201cDolphin.\u201d\nThough Porpoise and Dolphin are closely related to each other and in some cultures on the West Coast, especially in the California area, the two share the same name.\nMany tribes forbade the consumption of Dolphin\u2019s meat because Dolphin was considered a sacred guardian of those traveling by sea. The Chumash people believed that Dolphin would martyr themselves as a sacrifice to feed humans. This belief allows some tribes to make an exception and sustain themselves by eating Dolphin. As a tribute, people in these cultures hold ceremonial Dolphin Dances to pay homage to the creature\u2019s sacrifices.\nThe Chumash also tell a story of Hutash. Hutash is the Earth Mother and through her creation of a Rainbow Bridge connecting land across the ocean. As the people crossed this bridge over the ocean, some became mesmerized by the sea below and fell to their deaths. But Hutash doesn\u2019t want to see them perish, so she transforms them into Dolphins. Thus, Dolphin is seen as an extension of the human society.\nThis is easy to understand since Dolphins are very human like in their intelligence and sensitivity.\nNative people in some tribes in South America hold the Boto or Pink Dolphin in reverence. This creature is both admired and feared. People in some indigenous tribes in South America saw Dolphin as tricksters who are sorcerers with the ability to change shape.\nVarious tribes also have specific origin and creation myths that feature stories of the origin of the Dolphin, tying this creature to the primordial origins of the world.\nIn Brazil, a prominent Goddess Ina is the Goddess of the Amazon River who takes the shape of a Dolphin.\nBesides acting as protectors, Dolphin represents our \u201ctribes\u201d, our spiritual nature and the ability to act intuitively while reclaiming our happiness.\nDolphin Celtic Symbolism\nWhat do Dolphins symbolize in Celtic culture?\nIn Celtic tradition Dolphin acts as the guardian of the world\u2019s waters and all the creatures therein. The water element with the Dolphin also represents healing and a new beginning.\nDolphin is associated with rebirth and reincarnation in Celtic culture as well. Dolphin represents a person who is friendly, good natured and can even be a symbol of good luck and compassion.\nThe people of Ireland were no strangers to the dangers of the sea. Dolphins were no doubt a symbol of a seafaring ally who could lend luck and protection on journeys out into the ocean. As a symbol of friendship, the Dolphin serves as a protective \u201cneighbor\u201d who keeps watch over people during sea travel.\nFor Celtic people encountering Dolphins, it must have seemed as if they had made contact with an ambassador who could lead them into the depths of the waters safely. It is no wonder Dolphin came to represent good luck and safety, protection and playfulness.\nDolphin is associated with dreams, with magic and mysticism and the charming world of Spirit. Though primarily seen as benevolent and helpful guides, Dolphins are also associated with tricksters in some stories.\nEven in modern times, the Irish government has declared coastal waters to be a sanctuary for Whales and Dolphins. Since then, a number of \u201ccelebrity\u201d Dolphins have lured people from around the world in several of the coastal towns around Ireland.\nIn Celtic tattoos the Dolphin represents the end of one \u201clife\u201d and rebirth to something better.\nThe connection between Dolphins rescuing people and the legend of the Mermaid has led the cultures of Wales to associate Dolphin with Mermaid legends or perhaps to even form some of the early stories of Mermaids from the rescues by Dolphin.\nDolphin\u2019s song and elaborate style of communication is also part of their symbolism. In some Celtic cultures, the song of the Dolphin is relevant and symbolizes our ability to communicate and articulate our needs.\nDolphin African Symbolism\nWhat does a Dolphin symbolize in African culture?\nDolphin takes on significant meaning and symbolism. According to the Zulu people, a mystical race of beings helped humans populate the world before retreating into the sea. These beings were then transformed into Dolphins. Therefore, in this light we owe our protection and establishment in this world to these mentor-like beings who guided our earliest Ancestors.\nDolphins are considered the original teachers who helped humans connect with higher wisdom and express creativity.\nSome believe Dolphin accompanied the souls of the departed to their final resting place, known as the Island of the Blessed.\nThe idea that Dolphins are sacred protectors of humans who travel by sea is reiterated in African legends. This is true as well in the myth of Pirates whose ship is hijacked and who flee by jumping into the ocean. They are transformed into Dolphins and as their lives were spared by this transformation, they then continue to watch over the waters and rescue humans in need.\nIn Egypt, art has been found containing the images of both Dolphin and also Birds, this can be seen as a representation of Dolphin being associated with freedom.\nDolphin Christianity Symbolism\nWhat do Dolphins represent in Christian symbolism?\nMany people attribute Dolphin\u2019s meaning to someone who is Christlike. A person who embodies Dolphin energy may also be seen as compassionate, gentle and caring, protective and loving in the same way that Christ embodies these traits.\nDolphin symbolism is often found in art in prominent settings associated with the Christian church, such as the candelabra at St. Peter\u2019s Church. Some people also associate Dolphin with Christ because of depictions of Dolphin helping Souls transition to the afterlife in the same way Christ is said to do.\nThus Dolphin symbolism and meaning is associated with life, rebirth and reincarnation and even Christ\u2019s own process of being reborn and resurrected. Dolphin symbolism is often associated with vitality and purity in Christian culture.\nIn some variations on the story of St. Martin, when this Saint was being tempted by a woman, he threw himself into the sea and was carried to a remote island on the back of a Dolphin.\nInterestingly, there are also a number of stories we\u2019ll examine in which women escape unwanted advances in the same manner and are turned into Dolphins as a matter of protection and Divine intervention.\nDolphin Dreams\nDreaming of Dolphins represents the emotional self, sometimes at war with your intellect. You need to reign in those feelings and keep them on an even keel with logic and clear thinking.\nDolphin is considered a protective symbol and may caution about what lies ahead or things which we must prepare for.\nPay attention to the setting in your dream as well. Are you encountering Dolphin on the surface of the water or in the depths? To dream of a dead Dolphin may represent an opportunity lost or fear of losing someone. Dolphin symbols in dreams can represent guidance along your voyage and protection as you delve into uncharted waters.\nYou may need to be mindful of communication patterns when you dream of Dolphin. When a Dolphin appears in your dreams, it can also portend love or challenges that will lead you to transform yourself in some powerful way.\nWhat lies in store for you may require you to extend your feelings of love and compassion beyond boundaries and practice unconditional love and mercy. Dolphin\u2019s association with being a protector and savior may indicate the need to intervene on behalf of others or the need for others to intervene to lend a hand, or fin, in your near future.\nAre you making your song heard? Dolphin may dive into a dream to help you express yourself or convey your love, mercy and compassion in ways that others will clearly understand.\nLearn more about Dolphin Spirit by reading Dolphin Dreams Interpretation on WhatIsMySpiritAnimal.com!\nDolphin Far Eastern Symbolism\nWhat do Dolphins represent in the cultures of the East?\nAs with other parts of the world, Chinese myths tell of Dolphins who rescue ships or sailors in times of peril. Seeing Dolphins portended fair weather and safe harbors. It was considered very bad luck to harm a Dolphin in any way.\nThe Chinese believe the White Dolphin is an omen that you are following your intuition and are on the right path. Often, it is believed Dolphin is a positive message from your Ancestors and loved ones in the spiritual realms.\nDolphins are honorable and a sign of purity and protection, as they are seen as saviors of those who may have otherwise drowned.\nThere is a legend of a man who tries to sell his step-daughter at a market. He puts her into a boat and sails on the Yangtze River. But she jumps overboard to escape and as a matter of Divine Intervention, his boat is sunk in a storm.\nFurther down river, a beautiful Dolphin appears, assumed to the girl, transformed. This Dolphin continues to be regarded as a protective spirit who watches over the river.\nThis theme of girls or women escaping danger by turning to the sea or to water is also found in a story in Cambodia. In this story, a woman is supposed to marry against her will, a creature that is part python. To escape, she jumps into the sea and is transformed into a Dolphin.\nDolphin Tattoo Meaning\nAs mentioned above, a Celtic Dolphin tattoo is a sign associated with rebirth. But what else can a Dolphin tattoo connote?\nSomeone who bears a Dolphin symbol on their skin may feel quite at home in the water. They may be naturally connected to the sea by culture or intuition or both.\nThis person may also have a high intelligence level but also great compassion for others and a gigantic heart. If you are considering a Dolphin Tattoo, you may be drawn to this symbol because of your intuitive nature.\nDolphins never really sleep. They keep one eye open and one part of their brain alert, alternating with other spheres. This way, they can rise to the surface for air without drowning.\nThus, a Dolphin tattoo can also be a reminder that you need to exist on more than one plane at the same time. You may need balance and harmony, alternating your attention between the logical and emotional aspects of your nature.\nDolphin tattoo can represent the importance of balance, harmony and communication. Dolphins are frequently portrayed in pairs on a tattoo representing love, commitment and partnership as well.\nOften a symbol used in weddings or in other romantic settings, Dolphin\u2019s loyalty, playfulness and ability to cross barriers and connect with humans and other species represents the power of love to conquer any obstacles.\nDolphin Spiritual Meaning\nDolphin\u2019s spiritual meaning implies the need to balance between the emotional and rational, the intuitive and practical. Dolphin symbolizes the aspect of our nature that is pure, unconditional love.\nDolphin reminds us to be playful and friendly and to not keep our guard up but to use our skills to be protective of those who need it.\nThough Dolphin can be associated with symbols of luck, their spiritual meaning implies so much more than this alone.\nDolphin represents communication and the ability to advance to supernatural levels. Dolphin is often seen as a mystical creature that was either of an ancient and incredibly advanced group of beings or even a messenger of the Gods and spiritual realms. Some considered Dolphin to be the messengers of Poseidon and therefore reinforce the idea of Dolphin as Divine Messengers.\nIn this regard, Dolphin bears a similar role as that of the Angels and other forms of Divine Messengers. Dolphin can remind us of our need to recreate ourselves and to not take life too seriously.\nAs Shapeshifters and tricksters, Dolphin can help us remember to be resourceful and flexible, shifting to meet our needs no matter what emerges on our path.\nIs Dolphin really a sign of luck? Or does Dolphin remind us to create our own luck by making the most of circumstances we are in?\nAs messengers, Dolphin can correspond to the suit of Swords in the Tarot or to the Tarot Knights who are all Messengers to some degree. As beings of the Water Element, Dolphin correlates to the suit of Cups and realms of emotions.\nDolphin also corresponds to the Throat Chakra, for communication and vision, and also to the Third Eye Chakra for intuition and spiritual connection.\nTheir grace, beauty and symbolism associated with harmony also makes Dolphin correspond to love, romance and even unconditional, spiritual love in the broader sense. In this way, Dolphin can also relate to the Tarot card The Lovers. In addition, as Dolphin brings harmony between two worlds, the connection to the Lovers and the need to blend opposing forces to create harmony is also represented.\nDo you need to remember that your Ancestors and Spirit Guides are always working with you? Could your communication both with other people and with the Higher Realms use some fine tuning?\nDolphin may splash into your life to lead you back to the sea and to the deep, emotional and healing aspects of yourself so that you can find transformation and rebirth.\nThe power of love is represented by Dolphin who is often portrayed as compassionate and kind toward humans with no regard for whether humans will return their kindness. By drawing on Dolphin symbolism, we can relax our own defense mechanisms and strive to see others as connected to us and not our adversaries."}

It is estimated there are between 30 to 40 species of dolphins.1\nAlthough they live in water, dolphins are mammals and breath air through their blowhole, which is located at the top of their head. Some types of dolphins must rise to the surface to breathe every 20 to 30 seconds while others can hold their breath as long as 30 minutes.2\nDolphins are highly social, playful, curious and intelligent. They live in groups or families called Pods.\nDolphins sleep by resting one half of their brain at a time so that one eye is always open.3 This allows them to rise to the surface to breathe and to protect themselves from predators.\nMale dolphins are called Bulls and female dolphins are called Cows.\nA baby dolphin is called a calf. Baby dolphins are born tail first and suckle from their mother for up to 4 years. Mother dolphins produce milk that is extremely rich in fat, often up to 50 percent.4\nEach dolphin has its own signature whistle to identify itself.5\nDolphins have excellent vision and well-developed eyes.\nDolphins are carnivores eating mostly fish and squid and sometimes crustaceans.\nDolphins have a thick layer of fat under their skin called blubber, which helps them to keep warm.\nSee the word dolphin in other languages!\nEcholocation\nDolphins use a type of sonar called echolocation, locating objects by producing frequencies with clicking sounds and listening for the echo. From this they can gather precise information about the size, distance and location of objects around them. During echolocation, dolphins emit up to 700 clicking sounds per second.4\nClick here to view an example of dolphin echolocation.\nMore Dolphin Facts"}

There are lots of different species of dolphin which all have distinctive and identifiable visual differences but they are all roughly the same shape. Dolphins are relatively large fur-less mammals. They do not have scales like other marine animals but instead have smooth skin which is stretched taut over their bodies.\nThey have long bodies which are slightly curved and narrow down as they get closer towards the tail. They all have a dorsal fin in the center of their back. Their tails culminate in a tail flake at the end which is used to help them swim and to stun prey. Most have quite round heads with protruding beaks or nose which sticks out from their faces. They all have between 40 and 90 teeth on both the top and bottom jaw and they have a small black eye on either side of their face. The exact color and size of a dolphin will depend on the particular species of dolphin. They are usually grey-ish blue in color but can be seen in a variety of different colors and patterns.\nThe smallest dolphins are just over 5 foot long, whereas the largest ones can measure up to 32 feet in length. They are a similar size and shape to sharks, but sharks have sharper teeth, do not have a protruding beak and have gills instead of a blowhole. Sharks also tend to have a much straighter dorsal fin, where dolphins have one with softer, curved edges. Dolphins come in many different colors and patterns. The Amazon River dolphin is a pale pink color; the Atlantic spotted dolphin is black with small white spots all over its body; bottlenose dolphins are blue-ish grey all over; common dolphins have an hourglass pattern down one side; striped dolphins are stripy; killer whales are black with distinctive white patches and Chinese white dolphins are white all over. For many species of dolphin, the young are born a different color to the adults and they will then grow to develop their own patterns or markings.\nRiver dolphins look slightly different to marine dolphins. They tend to have much longer beaks which can make up anything up to 15% of their overall body length. They also have flippers on their sides instead of fins.\nDolphin Facts | Dolphin Information | Dolphin Species | Dolphins FAQ"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Bottlenose Dolphin - Animals Network", "url": "https://animals.net/bottlenose-dolphin/", "text": "Bottlenose dolphins are one of the most easily recognized marine mammals across the world. The vast majority of dolphins seen in zoos and aquariums are bottlenose dolphins. They are an incredibly intelligent mammal, and are capable of learning the meaning of many different hand signals! Read on to learn about the Bottlenose Dolphin.\nDescription of the Bottlenose Dolphin\nBottlenose dolphins are large, gray marine mammals. A bottlenose dolphin can be between ten and twelve feet long, and can weigh up to 1,100 pounds! Bottlenose dolphins get their name from their distinctive bottle shaped mouth, which is known as a \u201crostrum.\u201d Dolphins are torpedo shaped to help them move through the water more smoothly. This trait is known as being \u201chydrodynamic.\u201d\nA dolphin\u2019s skin is extremely smooth, and has a rubbery texture similar to a wet hotdog. They have two triangular pectoral flippers, which are similar to a short version of our arms. These are used to steer them through the water.\nTheir muscular tail, which is known as a \u201cfluke,\u201d is moved in an up-down motion to propel them through the water. Finally, a dolphin has a curved dorsal fin on its back. This dorsal fin is used to keep the animal upright in the water, and is occasionally mistaken for a shark\u2019s fin!\nInteresting Facts About the Bottlenose Dolphin\nThe bottlenose dolphin has many different traits that make it an extremely interesting animal. Read some fun facts you may not know about bottlenose dolphins below.\nDolphins are Mammals, Not Fish \u2013 Even though they live in the ocean, dolphins are not fish. Bottlenose dolphins are marine mammals. They give live birth, feed their babies milk, breathe air, are warm blooded, and even have hair. Baby dolphins are born with soft hair, called \u201clanugo,\u201d on their rostrums. This hair falls off soon after birth.\n\u2013 Even though they live in the ocean, dolphins are not fish.

Dolphins Can Navigate Using Sound \u2013 Dolphins have good eyesight, but they can also \u201csee\u201d using sound, in a process called \u201cecholocation.\u201d Dolphins emit clicking sounds, and listen for the sound to bounce back off of objects. They use the \u201cecho\u201d from these clicks, to \u201clocate\u201d objects around them, or \u201cecholocate.\u201d\n\u2013 Dolphins have good eyesight, but they can also \u201csee\u201d using sound, in a process called \u201cecholocation.\u201d Dolphins emit clicking sounds, and listen for the sound to bounce back off of objects.

Dolphins have been seen using another dolphin\u2019s signature whistle to find them. This is exactly how you would call a friend\u2019s name to find out where they are.\nHabitat of the Bottlenose Dolphin\nBottlenose dolphins are found in tropical and temperate oceans worldwide. The only habitat they are not found in is polar waters.\nDistribution of the Bottlenose Dolphin\nIn the Pacific Ocean, they are found as far north as Japan, and as far south as Australia. They are also found from southern California to Chile. In the Atlantic Ocean, dolphins are found as far north as Nova Scotia, and as far south as Patagonia. They are also found from Norway to South Africa, and in the Indian Ocean, from South Africa to Australia.\nDiet of the Bottlenose Dolphin\nBottlenose dolphins eat a wide variety of fish, crustaceans, squid, and eels. These include herring, capelin, and smelt, to name a few.\nBottlenose Dolphin and Animal Training\nThe bottlenose dolphin started the movement of positive reinforcement training. Positive reinforcement means giving the animal a reward when they have done the right behavior, rather than punishing them when they do the wrong behavior. Nowadays, positive reinforcement is the only type of training used in zoos and aquariums. Positive reinforcement is also becoming more popular in dog training.\nZoos and aquariums have begun using positive reinforcement training to teach animals how to help in their own care. Dolphins are taught to allow trainers to draw a blood sample, while remaining calm and comfortable. Most adult humans can\u2019t even do that!\nOther things they are taught to do include: sliding out of the water onto a scale to be weighed, holding still for physical examinations, and even providing a urine sample (yuck!). All of these behaviors can help the trainers make sure the animal is not getting sick. It can also help them treat the animal if they do.\nBottlenose Dolphin and Human Interaction\nBottlenose Dolphins and humans interact both in the wild and in zoos and aquariums. Some interactions in the wild can be harmful to dolphins. Dolphins fed by boaters can become sick from the food (bait that has been sitting out all day can be covered in bacteria), or begin following boats. A dolphin that interacts with boats frequently is much more likely to get injured by a propeller.\nDolphins and whales can also be disrupted by whale-watching tours. Studies of orcas (a larger species of dolphin) have shown that individuals swim farther when whale-watching boats are out. They swim more to avoid the boats, expending more energy. The more energy an animal uses, the more they need to eat.\nDomestication\nBottlenose dolphins have not been domesticated in any way. They are wild animals.\nDoes Bottlenose Dolphin Make a Good Pet\nUnless you are opening your own aquarium, dolphins are virtually impossible to own as a pet.\nBottlenose Dolphin Care\nIn zoos and aquariums, dolphins are provided with all the food and enrichment (toys and games) they need. The largest dolphins can eat up to 70 lbs. of fish per day! Trainers provide the dolphins with multiple training sessions throughout the day, if the dolphin doesn\u2019t want to participate it simply swims away.\nDolphins also enjoy playing with toys, some toys they get include: buoys, basketballs, footballs, floating toys (big rubber ducky!), and sinking toys.\nBehavior of the Bottlenose Dolphin\nThe bottlenose dolphin loves to engage in play, both in human care and in the wild. In the wild they have been seen riding the waves produced by boats, and interacting with other species. Dolphins have also been known to toss pieces of seaweed in the air, and play keep-away with one another.\nReproduction of the Bottlenose Dolphin\nDolphins begin to reproduce between 5-13 years old, and carry their babies for approximately 12 months. Baby dolphins nurse from their mothers for up to 18 months.\nBeliefs, Superstitions, and Phobias About the Bottlenose Dolphin\nIn Greek mythology, a dolphin swimming near a boat was seen as a good omen. Stories from many cultures recount times when dolphins saved the lives of shipwrecked sailors. These stories sometimes even told of the dolphins protecting the sailors from sharks."}

The Pacific White-sided Dolphin has a short, rounded, thick beak containing 23 to 32 small, rounded slightly curved teeth in each side of the upper and lower jaws. The Pacific white-sided dolphin is attractively marked with gray, black and white. Its back is dark gray and its sides are light gray with thin, white stripes that extend from above the eye along the sides, widening towards the tail; its belly is white. It has a black beak and lips and a black ring around each eye. The dorsal fin, at the center of the back, is tall and sharply hooked. The leading edge of the fin is black and the cresent-shaped rear section is light gray. Its small rounded flippers are rounded at the tips. They are energetic and quite active and frequently seen leaping, belly flopping, and somersaulting in the ocean. This dolphin is a strong, fast swimmer and enthusiastic bow rider, often staying with moving vessels for extended periods of time. Size: These dolphins reach a length of 7 to 8 feet (2.1 to 2.4 m) and weigh 300 pounds (150 kg). See drawing showing the relative size of the dolphin to a human diver. Often referred to as \"lag\" because of its long scientific name - Lagenorhynchus. Where they live: The Pacific White-sided Dolphin inhabits temperate, coastal waters in the North Pacific, avoiding both tropical or Arctic waters. Its range extends from Amchitka Island in the Aleutians, to the Gulf of Alaska south along the coast of North America to the tip of Baja California. What they eat: Pacific White-sided Dolphins eat squid and small schooling fish such as anchovies, herring, sardines, hake, salmon, rockfish, and pollock. Behavior: Pacific White-sided Dolphins are often found in large herds of 90 to 100. The herds are made up of animals of both sexes and all ages. Since they share the same range, they are most commonly seen with northern right-whale dolphins and are often seen accompanying other dolphins and large whales. Reproduction: Pacific White-sided Dolphin females have their first calf when they are 7-9 years old. The length of pregnancy (gestation period) is around 12 months. When the calves are first born they are approximately one meter (3ft) long and weigh roughly 15 kg. Females will nurse their calves for 8-10 months. Females, give birth approximately every 4.5 to 5 years. Life span: The maximum age recorded for a female Pacific white-sided dolphin is 46. The oldest male recorded is 42.

With their cute smiles, incredible acrobatic skills, and likeness to humans, dolphins have caught the attention of people for millennia. Despite their popularity, there\u2019s a lot that people don\u2019t know about these marine mammals. That\u2019s why we\u2019re serving up some of the most fascinating dolphin facts around.\nAny scuba diver or freediver that\u2019s ever had the opportunity to share the underwater world with a dolphin (or pod of dolphins) will certainly tell you that is was one of the best experiences they\u2019ve ever had. Warning: these dolphin facts will most likely make you love dolphins even more than you already do.\nHere are 10 Fun Facts About Dolphins:\n1. Nearly 40 different dolphin species inhabit the waters of the world. While most species of dolphins live in coastal areas of tropical and temperate oceans, there are five species that live in freshwater rivers (including the Amazon pink river dolphin).\n2. Dolphins are carnivores with a variety of fish, squid, and crustaceans included in their list of prey. A dolphin that weighs 260 pounds (118 kilograms) eats approximately 33 pounds (15 kilograms) of fish per day.\n3. Known for their playful behavior, dolphins are highly intelligent. They are as smart as apes, and the evolution of their larger brains is surprisingly similar to humans. In fact, they are said to be the second-most intelligent mammals after humans. Dolphins can recognize themselves in a mirror, and call each other unique names.\n4. Dolphins belong to the scientific order called Cetaceans, which also includes whales \u2013 their closest relatives. In the Delphinidae (dolphin) family, orcas are the largest species of dolphin.\n5. They are highly social animals, primarily living in groups that hunt and even play together. Large pods of dolphins, called \u2018superpods\u2019 can be made up of 1,000 members or more!\nFascinating Dolphin Facts Continued\u2026\n6. These marine mammals give live birth, similar to humans \u2013 except the baby is born tail first! Depending on the species, dolphin gestation takes somewhere between 9 and 17 months. After giving birth, dolphins are incredibly maternal. The mother helps the calf to the surface for its first breath, and they\u2019ve even been observed nestling and cuddling with their young.\n7. Depending on the species, dolphin calves (babies) nurse for up to 2 years. A calf may stay with its mother for anywhere from 3 to 8 years.\n8. While dolphins have no sense of smell, they make up for this with their other extraordinary senses. They have acute eyesight both in and out of the water. Dolphins have a well-developed sense of touch. They hear frequencies 10 times the upper limit of adult humans, and they expertly use dolphin echolocation to locate far away or hidden things using sound waves and echos.\n9. Dolphins have few natural enemies. Unfortunately, humans are their main threat. Polluted habitats, being caught as bycatch in commercial fisheries, and targeted hunting are the main threats that face dolphins worldwide. Sadly, in just 2006, the Yangtze River dolphin became functionally extinct.\n10. Because dolphins are mammals, they need to come to the surface to breathe. Unlike land mammals that breathe and eat through their mouths, dolphins have separate holes for each task. Dolphins eat through their mouths and breathe through their blowholes. This prevents dolphins from sucking up water into their lungs when eating, reducing the risk of drowning.\nReady to Dive In?\nIf you love these dolphin facts and are inspired to observe them in their natural environment, here\u2019s what we recommend:\nBonus Dolphin Fact!\nDolphins and humpback whales are both known to be extremely playful with each other. In fact, many scientists believe that the \u2018surfing\u2019 or bow riding that dolphins exhibit in front of boats, may have been inspired by their riding in front of or in the wake of big whales.

There is much more to them than just being smart and great swimmers!\nThe only known mammal to have their young born tail first, is the dolphin. The tail is referred to as the fluke.\nDolphins have very poor sense of smell.\nMothers will take care of their offspring for a period of 2 or 3 years.\nMost dolphins have two stomachs, similar to a cow. One allows them to store food and the other allows them to digest it. Those that only have one stomach have a divider of three parts.\nSome dolphins dive 1,000 feet.\nEver dorsal fin on a dolphin is unique in shape and size. In observations, that has been used to help identify them from each other.\nThey can swim well, up to 25 miles per hour. This means they swim about 3 times faster than humans.\nThe average life of a dolphin in the wild is 17 years. Some though have been able to live for 50 years.\nThe majority of dolphins live in saltwater, only 4 species of River Dolphins are able to live in freshwater.\nare able to live in freshwater. Dolphins get air from the surface through their blowhole. Some need to get air several times a minute but others only need to get air twice per hour.\nThey develop very strong bonds in their pods and they care for each other\u2019s needs. They help with the young, the old, and the injured.\nDolphins can be aggressive and some have even killed humans before. Most of the time though they are very timid.\nThey have very good vision that enables them to see well under the water.\nWhen compared to body size, the dolphin has a very large brain. The only comparison that is better is that of humans.\nUp to 30 pounds of food can be consumed daily by an adult dolphin.\nMost dolphins have teeth, up to 100 of them, but they don\u2019t chew with them. They only use them to hold food and to help them fight when necessary.\nSome dolphin species are able to leap up at 20 feet in the air.\nThe largest member of the dolphin family is the Killer Whale, and they can be up to 30 feet long.\nDolphins have skin that is quite sensitive and it can easily be damaged by their environment or when humans touch them.\nThe largest of all freshwater dolphins is the Boto Dolphin which can be up to 10 feet in length.\nPlenty of different hunting strategies are known to be used by dolphins to gather food. They hunt in groups and they often circle their prey to create a tight ball out of it. Then they can take turns going into it and getting food.\nDolphins do sleep, but only one side of the brain at a time. This ensures they can be alert to possible risks and that they can surface for air when they need to.\nThey are very social and spend lots of time playing and teasing. They have been seen playing with seaweed and with various forms of aquatic life.\nReduced food supplies due to global warming is a huge risk to all of the dolphin populations.\nMigration often occurs for dolphins to ensure they can find food and to make sure they are in bodies of water that are warm enough. Not all dolphins migrate though as if they are can get their basis needs met where they happen to be there is no need for them to move.\nIt is very seldom that you will see dolphins hunting along, but some species do so. Being in sync, cooperating, and using echolocation allows them to find enough food without using lots of energy to do so.\nDolphins vary in size with the smallest about 4 feet and 90 pounds. The largest can be 30 feet long and weigh 11 tons.\nThe melon in the head along with the lower jaw and the teeth are primary elements of the echolocation for dolphins. Most dolphins feature a crease in the head due to the melon but there are exceptions.\nDolphins can be born with small hairs on their body but they will fall out shortly afterwards. The only known dolphin species to keep those small hairs as adults is the Boto River Dolphin .\n. Most dolphins have the ability to heal their bodies fast after injuries including bites from sharks. It isn\u2019t understood how they can do that when other mammals would die from hemorrhaging. Some dolphins have scars from such bite that turn white over time. This can give the appearance of white spots on the body when someone sees them from a distance.\n(Visited 3,590 times, 6 visits today)"}

Michael Hunt, the Georgia Aquarium\u2019s director of animal training, sees the survival of the dolphin as a sign of the health of our open waters. \u201cAs a species, dolphins are a great barometer for what's going on in our oceans,\" Hunt says. \"When you look at the number of ill and dying dolphins that have washed ashore this year alone, it drives home the point that our seas aren't in very good shape.\"\nLisa Takaki, senior director of marine mammals at Chicago's Shedd Aquarium, agrees. \u201cWe want to keep these species on the planet and make sure they\u2019re here for future generations,\" she says.\nHow can we do that? Hunt suggests that \"the best way to help dolphins is to learn as much as you can about the challenges they face and better appreciate and protect their habitat.\u201d\n7 Things You Probably Didn't Know About Dolphins\nTo get you started appreciating \u2014 and supporting \u2014 dolphins, we've collected seven little-known facts about these fascinating creatures.\n1. Dolphins are born with a mustache. Dolphins may look smooth, but they do have hair at one point in their lives. \u201cWhen first born, they have little remnants of hair almost like a little mustache right along the top of where our upper lip would be,\u201d Takaki says. \u201cBecause of swimming, it falls out pretty quickly.\u201d\n2. Dolphins lack vocal cords. According to Hunt, it\u2019s inaccurate when dolphins are portrayed as making noises with their mouths because they do not have vocal cords. \u201cAll of the above-water vocalizations made by dolphins are generated exclusively via the blowhole,\u201d he says.\n3. Dolphins have \u201cnames.\u201d Those vocalizations you hear might not just be general communication and echolocation, either. Takaki says dolphins identify themselves with a distinct, signature whistle. Each dolphin has a signature whistle that acts like a name.\n4. Dolphins travel with different species. According to Takaki, some dolphins will travel to other \u201cneighborhoods,\u201d which often results in mixed-species pods. \u201cThe Pacific white-sided dolphin is known as being one of those species seen in the company of other dolphins and whales,\" she says. \"It doesn\u2019t surprise me because dolphins are friendly, gregarious and curious.\"\n5. Dolphins don\u2019t travel as families. When dolphins do travel together, they don\u2019t travel as whole families. Takaki says that males break away and travel with each other while the females stick together.\n6. Dolphins may be essentially colorblind. What exactly dolphins see when it comes to colors is unclear to researchers. \u201cPhysiological studies suggest that they cannot see colors in the green spectrum based on the absence of certain cones in their eyes,\u201d Hunt explains.\u201cOn the other hand, behavioral studies indicate that dolphins might have color vision, but scientists debate whether the animal is responding to brightness versus color.\u201d\n7. Dolphins don\u2019t have a sense of smell. According to Hunt, dolphins also can\u2019t smell. Their brain lacks an olfactory system that would give them this ability.\nLearn more about dolphins on the websites for the Shedd Aquarium and Georgia Aquarium.\nMore on Vetstreet.com:"}

Dolphins can see sound\nNo, it's not a superpower. But dolphins use echolocation to see the world around them.\nA dolphin's \"clicks\" travel long distances and bounce off of objects, allowing them to calculate the distance, shape, density, movement, and texture of an object.\nDolphin sonar is the best within the animal kingdom, and is also superior to bat and man-made sonar technology. They have the incredible ability to emit sounds with a frequency of 120 kHz. To put that in perspective, humans with excellent hearing can only hear sounds with frequencies ranging from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. However, dolphins generally receive optimal results when the object is at a distance no greater than 656 feet from them.\n2. Dolphins name themselves\nScientists have discovered that dolphins develop their own individual whistles (names) to identify themselves and other members of their pods.\nSince visibility is often poor in the ocean, dolphins rely on sound to convey messages and communicate. What wasn't known for quite some time, however, was the complexity of their communication, and the awareness that these animals possess.\nIdentity is very important to dolphins because they're social animals that thrive in groups.\n3. Dolphins can shut off their brains\nSince they are mammals, dolphins must stay at the surface of the ocean in order to breathe. To sleep, dolphins rise to the surface, leaving their blowholes exposed, and switch off one side of their brain while keeping the other half active to continue breathing and staying alert.\nEver heard the phrase \"Sleep with one eye open?\" Dolphins literally sleep with one eye open, as their conscious brains remain active while the other half rests.\n4. Dolphins like to have fun\nDolphins are social and playful animals, creating lifelong friendships and living in pods with dozens of dolphins.\nAs part of their social and playful nature, they are known to swim through self-made bubble rings and surf in the waves!\nBut there is also a deeper purpose to these types of behaviors: dolphins play because it is an important factor in the cognitive development of dolphin calves, and key to them familiarizing themselves with other members of the group.\nClick here to learn about the plight of dolphins in entertainment, whose natural behaviors are suppressed in captivity."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "How Smart Are Dolphins Really? A Ranking of Dolphins Against Other Animals", "url": "https://bestlifeonline.com/dolphin-intelligence/", "text": "After humans, dolphins are often regarded as the second-most intelligent animal on the planet. They have a relatively high brain-to-body-size ratio, advanced language and comprehension skills, the capacity to show emotion, and are highly sociable. They've also shown excellent cognitive abilities\u2014including individual differentiation and behavior control\u2014and are one of the few creatures known to have passed the benchmark Mirror Self-Recognition Test.\nYes, the dolphin is a one highly sophisticated, razor-sharp creature. But, while they're undeniably smart, they aren't the only smart animals out there. So, how do dolphins stack up compared to the world's other animals?\nFirst, a caveat: \"You can't really rank animals by intelligence because they're all designed to do different things,\" says Justin Gregg, Ph.D., a senior research associate at the Dolphin Communication Project and the author of Are Dolphins Really Smart?. Gregg has deeply researched these deep sea creatures, and seen plenty of ways in which they excel cognitively\u2014and some of the ways the lag behind. Still, he notes, \"when we talk about an animal 'being smart,' it's usually when animals are doing things that look like what humans do.\"\nBut, while animal IQ tests aren't exactly reliable, we can take a look at the full spectrum of available research to come up with some rough comparisons. Here, you'll get a deep look at the intellectual prowess of 15 other creatures that also have high animal intelligence\u2014defined as the combination of skills and abilities that allow animals to thrive in their respective environments\u2014and see which creature really is the most clever of them all. Besides us, of course. And for a look at these amazing cetaceans in their natural environment, check out these 13 Gorgeous Photos of Dolphins in the Wild.\n1 Chimpanzees have sharper memories than dolphins.\nGregg points out that dolphins are actually distantly related to primates. \"A lot of things they do are very primate-like,\" he says, \"which is unexpected, given how different they are.\" But when it comes to behaving and responding to the world in human-like ways\u2014one of the chief ways we can compare the intelligence of animals to one another\u2014dolphins aren't on the same level as chimps.\nOne 2007 study found that chimpanzees share about 98 percent of the same DNA as humans. Observations and experiments indicate that chimps are capable of empathy, altruism, and self-awareness, which is where their intelligence is similar to dolphins.\nBut where they really excel is in cognitive function. Chimps have a profound memory\u2014according to research published in Current Biology, their memory may be even greater than humans\u2014and a relatively advanced knowledge of tools. They're known to use sticks to catch ants and termites, as a kind of rudimentary form of a fishing (or, rather, bug-catching) pole. And for more whip-smart creatures, check out the 25 Amazing Ways Animals Communicate That You Never Knew About.\n2 Dolphins have stronger memories than elephants.\nThe sheer size of an elephant's brain suggests their intelligence must be pretty high. Like dolphins, they've been seen consoling and helping others, and there's even been a recorded instance of one passing the Mirror Test. But the elephant lags behind the dolphin in one crucial area: despite what a familiar saying might have you believe, the elephant forgets\u2014or at least doesn't remember\u2014quite as well as the dolphin.\nResearchers, writing in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, have declared that dolphins have the longest-lasting memory in the animal kingdom. Reportedly, dolphins can remember whistles of other dolphins for up to 20 years. For comparison, a 2011 test of elephant intelligence and cooperative abilities found them merely \"in league with chimpanzees and dolphins as being among the world's most cognitively advanced animals.\"\nStill, elephants truly shine when it comes to perception. According to one 2013 study, they have the ability to decipher \"ethnicity, gender, and age\" in humans, all by listening to acoustic cues from voices.\nSo, why does this signify intelligence? Well, recognizing predators and judging their threat level is an essential skill for many wild animals. And since, over the millennia, different types of human subgroups have posed various threat levels\u2014a male in his prime might signify higher danger, for instance\u2014this is a highly advanced skill that's been honed and passed down over generations.

More recently, research has shown that raccoons have an impeccable memory, and are able to recall solutions to puzzles for up to three years.\nAnd, in 2017, researchers at the University of Wyoming put raccoons up to the puzzle found in one of Aesop's Fables, \"The Crow and the Pitcher,\" where a bird drops rocks into a deep pitcher, to raise the water level to a point where it's drinkable. Like most of Aesop's Fables, it's pure mythos; nothing in scientific literature suggests crows have a robust understanding of water displacement.\nThe raccoons figured it out in no time.\n4 Octopuses manipulate objects better than dolphins do.\nThe octopus has the largest brain of any invertebrate, and a whopping three-fifths of its neurons are located in its tentacles. As dolphins have no arms, this really gives octopuses a major leg up. \"They're great at problem-solving tasks and object-manipulation tasks and infamously can escape out of places in impressive ways through problem solving,\" says Gregg. A quick venture down the YouTube rabbit hole will turn up videos of octopuses compressing their bulky bodies through a small slit holes, popping the lids off screw-top jars, and even climbing out of tanks to their freedom.\nOh, and then there's the German aquarium octopus, Otto, who was known to throw rocks at the glass and spray water at overhead lamps to short-circuit bright lights that were bothering him, to the amazement of the aquarium's staff. And for more fascinating creatures from the depths, meet these 20 Bizarre Sea Creatures That Look Like They're Not Real.\n5 Dogs understand human language better than dolphins.\nDogs are man's best friend because they can relate to humans by understanding emotion and showing empathy. But are they as intelligent as dolphins? In some areas, no; in others, yes. Dogs did not make the grade on the self-awareness Mirror Test\u2014something dolphins have mastered\u2014and dolphins appear to be better problem solvers.\nHowever, dogs and dolphins can both use human pointing and eye-direction cues to locate objects in the distance. And one area where dogs outshine every other animal is in language skills. \"The most famous case of an animal that learned the largest number of symbols\u2014a thing standing in for another things or word\u2014was dogs,\" says Gregg. Chaser, a Border Collie trained by psychologists \"came out on top with knowing four or five times more symbols than dolphins or even gorillas.\" And for some truly adorable puppers, meet these 50 Dogs So Ugly They're Actually Cute.\n6 Squirrels are more deceptive than dolphins (but certainly not more intelligent).\nSquirrels have a phenomenal memory, and, like dolphins, they can even be deceptive. For starters, they thrive in big urban cities, giving them major street smarts over other animals. According to one Princeton University study, grey squirrels can remember where they've buried thousands of nuts, for months at a time, without relying on their sense of smell. And, in a 2010 study, squirrels who knew they were being watched dug fake caches for their nuts, then made a show of digging holes and patting them over with dirt, all while they were really hiding their nuts under their armpits or in their mouth with the ultimate goal of deceiving witnesses until they could find a better hiding spot. Still, while they're sneakier than dolphins, few researchers would argue they're smarter.\n7 Pigs are better at video games than dolphins.\n\"Dolphins have big brains, so we spent time studying them,\" says Gregg. \"We ignored animals like pigs, because we eat them and turn them into bacon. But, these days, there's a lot more research that finds they do an awful lot of really complicated stuff not unlike what you see in primates.\"\nPigs are highly intelligent beings capable of recognizing themselves in a mirror, like dolphins. Plus, they're highly sensitive, are able to gain knowledge to help them solve problems later, and\u2014at least in the case of mothers\u2014are very protective, loving, and playful with their little ones. Several studies have shown pigs to be even smarter than dogs and cats, and they are able to solve problems quicker than many primates. Finally, they can also understand abstract representations and even apply the skill to play video games using a joystick. In other words: the time someone pummels you in Smash Bros., you can accurately call them a mean pig!\n8 Parrots have a better grasp of rudimentary concepts than dolphins.\n\"Parrots are surprisingly strong in their symbol manipulation,\" says Gregg. Like dolphins, they're capable of figuring out complex intellectual concepts that most humans can't master until kindergarten age. These birds solve puzzles and also understand the concept of cause and effect.\nOne parrot named Alex was given the same intelligence tests that were also given to dolphins and apes, and he scored as well in many areas\u2014and even better in some. When shown various objects, he was able to named 50. He knew different colors, and could recall numbers up to eight. And he also understood the concepts of \"different\" and \"same.\" More generally, African Grey parrots, the Einstein of this species, can learn an impressive number of human words and use them in context to communicate with humans.\n9 Rats, unlike dolphins, have \"metacognition.\"\nThe rat's psychology and emotional intelligence are similar to humans, and that's why they're often used for lab experiments. Similar to dolphins, rats also demonstrate altruistic behavior; for example, they've been known to free other rats from cages during experiments.\nThey also possess metacognition, or awareness of one's own thinking, which is a mental ability seen only in humans and some primates. In fact, they've even performed better than some humans on specific cognitive-learning tasks: They can make calculations to help them obtain food from a trap without being caught, and they can process sensorial cues to analyze situations and make their way out of intricate mazes.\n10 Crows and ravens are better problem-solvers than dolphins.\nIt's hard to tell for sure whether dolphins or corvids\u2014the bird family of crows and ravens\u2014are smarter, since they exist in such drastically different environments. But one thing's for sure: these feathered fellas are certainly more cunning. \"Crows are really good at manipulating and solving tool-based stuff; they can create tools to solve problems,\" says Gregg. \"They're one of the best tool-manufacturing species, and are better than dolphins at that.\"ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb\nAccording to reporting by the Sydney Morning Herald, they're expert problem-solvers and clever toolmakers. They also seem to understand that other birds have minds like theirs, and their decisions often take into account what others might know, want, or intend. They think watchers will know where they've hidden food and want to steal it later, so they'll take their food and sneakily hide it elsewhere, which is known as re-caching.\n11 Ants have stronger cooperative cognition than dolphins.\nAnts \"actually have good memories for landmarks,\" says Gregg. \"But they can't learn symbol manipulation or things like that, and are certainly a lot less human-like or flexible in their thinking than dolphins.\"\nThat said, ants have the largest brain mass of all insects. Like dolphins, they're intelligent and methodical, but it's their intelligence as a combined group that deserves all the credit. When they work together, they know how to form colonies that operate with remarkable efficiency. (Think of it like the world's most sophisticated form of artificial intelligence, but with Mother Nature's distinct touch.)\nAnts self-organize through scent. Because different ants with different \"jobs\" give off different smells, ants can figure out if there aren't enough ants on, say, food patrol, if they haven't smelled a food ant in a while. They'll then delegate responsibility and change jobs. They can even optimize the best and shortest path between the food and their nest.\n12 Orangutans understand object necessity better than dolphins.\nOrangutans are one of the most intelligent of the primates, and some experts go so far to claim they're actually the smartest. Compared to dolphins, orangutans are sharp because they understand how to build objects\u2014and why it's necessary.\nFor instance, one 2012 study showed orangutans demonstrated skillful engineering in building safe and comfortable beds. And, in a 2018 study, orangutans surprised researchers when they showed their mastery in creating fishhooks. The primates even utilized them better than human children in the same experiment!\n13 Bees are better at math than dolphins.\nBees are known for their sweet honey and their not-so-sweet sting, but they're also great problem-solvers. \"Bumblebee problem-solving tool use is really fascinating,\" says Gregg. \"There are [plenty of] experiments where bumblebees can be trained to pull on a string to get a food reward and learn from other bees that have acquired that skill.\"\nOh, and we can add two more abilities to their set of skills: addition and subtraction. Yeah, let's see a dolphin do that.\nSure, the ability to count or, at the very least, distinguish between various quantities isn't unusual in animals, but being able to solve equations using symbols is rare. It can only be done by chimpanzees, African grey parrots, and bees. One study showed bees successfully using colors in place of plus and minus symbols, and they got the answer right more than two-thirds of the time! And if you want to see how your arithmetic skills stack up, here are 30 Questions You'd Need to Ace to Pass 6th Grade Math.\n14 Goats understand humans better than dolphins.\nJust like dolphins, goats have strong cognitive abilities, despite their unassuming demeanor. Thanks to their domestication and the fact that they've spent a lot of time around humans, goats \"are very good at things that humans value\u2014they can even follow the human pointing gesture,\" which even cats and dogs are unable to do, according to Gregg.\nResearchers in Australia conducted an experiment to test their intelligence by setting up a contraption that held fruit at the end. To access the fruit, the goats had to use their teeth to drag a rope down, which then activated a lever they had to lift up with their mouths. Nine out of 12 goats mastered the task after four tries. When the researchers retested the same goats again ten months later, the majority still remembered how to work the system to get to the fruit.\n15 Pigeons are better at multitasking than dolphins.\nMany people are aware that pigeons were used during wars as messengers due to their ability to remember people and places for several years at a time. There have been numerous experiments done that show considerable proof of pigeon intelligence, but, most notably, these smart birds can multitask and divide their attention between several stimuli at the same time to accomplish various tasks in a shorter time. It's a remarkable show of intelligence that dolphins (and even some humans!) can't duplicate.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Endangered Species - Dolphin Research Center", "url": "https://dolphins.org/endangered_species", "text": "Northern Right Whale\nThe Northern right whale is the most endangered large whale in the world. It resides in the North Atlantic, along the east coast of the United States and Canada, and its population is estimated to be about 400 animals.\nCommercial whaling severely depleted right whale populations to virtual commercial extinction by the end of the nineteenth century. People continued to take right whales, however, and in 1935 an international treaty adopted a voluntary ban on hunting because the right whales were on the brink of biological extinction. Unfortunately, whaling of right whales continued until the 1960\u2019s. Currently, whaling is no longer a threat to the right whale, but because their numbers are so small, other human-related impacts threaten the population, namely collisions with ships and entanglement in nets.\nThe Western North Atlantic is the only population of right whales for which we have enough data on their distribution, demography, and human interactions to develop measures of protection. Over the past twenty years, the average number of calves born was fewer than twelve, and the reproduction rate is on the decline. Any form of protection for the right whales is crucial because even a small number of deaths will affect the population.\nSince 1970, nearly half of confirmed right whale deaths have been attributed to human factors, and most of those deaths have been a result of ship collisions and entanglement. In 1991, NOAA Fisheries developed a right whale recovery plan that divided the east coast of the United Stated into two halves, Northeast and Southeast. The plan for the Southeast coast established protection for right whale calving grounds. The Northeast program was coordinated with humpback whale recovery, and protects feeding grounds in New England. Focus has been centered on reducing the number of ship collisions.\nReducing the number of ship collisions has proved to be difficult because collisions are rare and mariners do not perceive themselves or the whales as a threat. Whales are also difficult to spot in time to change the course of a ship and collisions are usually unintentional. As a result, protection measures have focused on changing operating procedures for vessels that frequent right whale habitat, forming early warning systems, distributing educational material for mariners about right whales, instituting mandatory right whale reporting for ships in key habitats and conducting research to learn more.\nCommercial fishing is still considered a major threat to right whales. NOAA Fisheries reports that studies suggest that more than 85% of right whales have been photographed with scars from fishing gear. In order to address these issues, NOAA Fisheries developed the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team in 1996. They are focusing on fishing restrictions in key habitats, fishing gear that would be less likely to entangle whales, and detection of entangled whales.\nUnfortunately, funding for right whale protection has been insufficient. As a result, a National Whale Conservation Fund Act was established in 1998. Now, right whale conservation programs can make money from logos and accept donations from the public."}

In her early 20s, living on the Caribbean island of St Thomas, they took on a new significance. During Christmas 1963, her brother-in-law mentioned a secret laboratory at the eastern end of the island where they were working with dolphins. She decided to pay the lab a visit early the following year. \u201cI was curious,\u201d Lovatt recalls. \u201cI drove out there, down a muddy hill, and at the bottom was a cliff with a big white building.\u201d\nLovatt was met by a tall man with tousled hair, wearing an open shirt and smoking a cigarette. His name was Gregory Bateson, a great intellectual of the 20th century and the director of the lab. \u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d he asked Lovatt.\n\u201cWell, I heard you had dolphins,\u201d she replied, \u201cand I thought I\u2019d come and see if there was anything I could do or any way I could help\u2026\u201d Unused to unannounced visitors and impressed by her bravado, Bateson invited her to meet the animals and asked her to watch them for a while and write down what she saw. Despite her lack of scientific training, Lovatt turned out to be an intuitive observer of animal behaviour and Bateson told her she could come back whenever she wanted.\n\u201cThere were three dolphins,\u201d remembers Lovatt. \u201cPeter, Pamela and Sissy. Sissy was the biggest. Pushy, loud, she sort of ran the show. Pamela was very shy and fearful. And Peter was a young guy. He was sexually coming of age and a bit naughty.\u201d\nThe lab\u2019s upper floors overhung a sea pool that housed the animals. It was cleaned by the tide through openings at each end. The facility had been designed to bring humans and dolphins into closer proximity and was the brainchild of an American neuroscientist, Dr John Lilly. Here, Lilly hoped to commune with the creatures, nurturing their ability to make human-like sounds through their blow holes.\nLilly had been interested in connecting with cetaceans since coming face to face with a beached pilot whale on the coast near his home in Massachusetts in 1949. The young medic couldn\u2019t quite believe the size of the animal\u2019s brain \u2013 and began to imagine just how intelligent the creature must have been, explains Graham Burnett, professor of the history of science at Princeton and author of The Sounding of the Whale. \u201cYou are talking about a time in science when everybody\u2019s thinking about a correlation between brain size and what the brain can do. And in this period, researchers were like: \u2018Whoa\u2026 big brain huh\u2026 cool!\u2019\u201d\nTripper and flipper: Dr John Lilly, who started experimenting with LSD during the project. Photograph: Lilly Estate\nAt every opportunity in the years that followed, John Lilly and his first wife, Mary, would charter sailboats and cruise the Caribbean, looking for other big-brained marine mammals to observe. It was on just such a trip in the late 1950s that the Lillys came across Marine Studios in Miami \u2013 the first place to keep the bottlenose dolphin in captivity.\nUp until this time, fishermen on America\u2019s east coast, who were in direct competition with dolphins for fish, had considered the animals vermin. \u201cThey were known as \u2018herring hogs\u2019 in most of the seafaring towns in the US,\u201d says Burnett. But here, in the tanks of Marine Studios, the dolphins\u2019 playful nature was endearingly on show and their ability to learn tricks quickly made it hard to dislike them.\nHere, for the first time, Lilly had the chance to study the brains of live dolphins, mapping their cerebral cortex using fine probes, which he\u2019d first developed for his work on the brains of rhesus monkeys. Unable to sedate dolphins, as they stop breathing under anaesthetic, the brain-mapping work wasn\u2019t easy for either animals or scientists, and the research didn\u2019t always end well for the marine mammals. But on one occasion in 1957, the research would take a different course which would change his and Mary\u2019s lives for ever.\nNow aged 97, Mary still remembers the day very clearly. \u201cI came in at the top of the operating theatre and heard John talking and the dolphin would go: \u2018Wuh\u2026 wuh\u2026 wuh\u2019 like John, and then Alice, his assistant, would reply in a high tone of voice and the dolphin would imitate her voice. I went down to where they were operating and told them that this was going on and they were quite startled.\u201d\nPerhaps, John reasoned, this behaviour indicated an ambition on the dolphins\u2019 part to communicate with the humans around them. If so, here were exciting new opportunities for interspecies communication. Lilly published his theory in a book in 1961 called Man and Dolphin. The idea of talking dolphins, eager to tell us something, captured the public\u2019s imagination and the book became a bestseller.\nMan and Dolphin extrapolated Mary Lilly\u2019s initial observations of dolphins mimicking human voices, right through to teaching them to speak English and on ultimately to a Cetacean Chair at the United Nations, where all marine mammals would have an enlightening input into world affairs, widening our perspectives on everything from science to history, economics and current affairs.\nLilly\u2019s theory had special significance for another group of scientists \u2013 astronomers. \u201cI\u2019d read his book and was very impressed,\u201d says Frank Drake, who had just completed the first experiment to detect signals from extraterrestrial civilisations using a radio telescope at Green Bank in West Virginia. \u201cIt was a very exciting book because it had these new ideas about creatures as intelligent and sophisticated as us and yet living in a far different milieu.\u201d He immediately saw parallels with Lilly\u2019s work, \u201cbecause we [both] wanted to understand as much as we could about the challenges of communicating with other intelligent species.\u201d This interest helped Lilly win financial backing from Nasa and other government agencies, and Lilly opened his new lab in the Caribbean in 1963, with the aim of nurturing closer relationships between man and dolphin.\nA few months LATER, in early 1964, Lovatt arrived. Through her naturally empathetic nature she quickly connected with the three animals and, eager to embrace John Lilly\u2019s vision for building an interspecies communication bridge, she threw herself into his work, spending as much time as possible with the dolphins and carrying out a programme of daily lessons to encourage them to make human-like sounds. While the lab\u2019s director, Gregory Bateson, concentrated on animal-to-animal communication, Lovatt was left alone to pursue Lilly\u2019s dream to teach the dolphins to speak English. But even at a state-of-the-art facility like the Dolphin House, barriers remained. \u201cEvery night we would all get in our cars and pull the garage door down and drive away,\u201d remembers Lovatt. \u201cAnd I thought: \u2018Well there\u2019s this big brain floating around all night.\u2019 It amazed me that everybody kept leaving and I just thought it was wrong.\u201d\nLovatt reasoned that if she could live with a dolphin around the clock, nurturing its interest in making human-like sounds, like a mother teaching a child to speak, they\u2019d have more success. \u201cMaybe it was because I was living so close to the lab. It just seemed so simple. Why let the water get in the way?\u201d she says. \u201cSo I said to John Lilly: \u2018I want to plaster everything and fill this place with water. I want to live here.\u2019\u201d\nThe radical nature of Lovatt\u2019s idea appealed to Lilly and he went for it. She began completely waterproofing the upper floors of the lab, so that she could actually flood the indoor rooms and an outdoor balcony with a couple of feet of water. This would allow a dolphin to live comfortably in the building with her for three months.\nLovatt selected the young male dolphin called Peter for her live-in experiment. \u201cI chose to work with Peter because he had not had any human-like sound training and the other two had,\u201d she explains. Lovatt would attempt to live in isolation with him six days a week, sleeping on a makeshift bed on the elevator platform in the middle of the room and doing her paperwork on a desk suspended from the ceiling and hanging over the water. On the seventh day Peter would return to the sea pool downstairs to spend time with the two female dolphins at the lab \u2013 Pamela and Sissy.\n\u2018If I was sitting with my legs in the water, he\u2019d come up and look at the back of my knee for a long time\u2019: Margaret with Peter. Photograph: courtesy Lilly Estate\nBy the summer of 1965, Lovatt\u2019s domestic dolphinarium was ready for use. Lying in bed, surrounded by water that first night and listening to the pumps gurgling away, she remembers questioning what she was doing. \u201cHuman people were out there having dinner or whatever and here I am. There\u2019s moonlight reflecting on the water, this fin and this bright eye looking at you and I thought: \u2018Wow, why am I here?\u2019 But then you get back into it and it never occurred to me not to do it. What I was doing there was trying to find out what Peter was doing there and what we could do together. That was the whole point and nobody had done that.\u201d\nAudio recordings of Lovatt\u2019s progress, meticulously archived on quarter-inch tapes at the time, capture the energy that Lovatt brought to the experiment \u2013 doggedly documenting Peter\u2019s progress with her twice-daily lessons and repeatedly encouraging him to greet her with the phrase \u2018Hello Margaret\u2019. \u201c\u2018M\u2019 was very difficult,\u201d she remembers. \u201cMy name. Hello \u2018M\u2019argaret. I worked on the \u2018M\u2019 sound and he eventually rolled over to bubble it through the water. That \u2018M\u2019, he worked on so hard.\u201d\nFor Lovatt, though, it often wasn\u2019t these formal speech lessons that were the most productive. It was just being together which taught her the most about what made Peter tick. \u201cWhen we had nothing to do was when we did the most,\u201d she reflects. \u201cHe was very, very interested in my anatomy. If I was sitting here and my legs were in the water, he would come up and look at the back of my knee for a long time. He wanted to know how that thing worked and I was so charmed by it.\u201d\nCarl Sagan, one of the young astronomers at Green Bank, paid a visit to report back on progress to Frank Drake. \u201cWe thought that it was important to have the dolphins teach us \u2018Dolphinese\u2019, if there is such a thing,\u201d recalls Drake. \u201cFor example we suggested two dolphins in each tank not able to see each other \u2013 and he should teach one dolphin a procedure to obtain food \u2013 and then see if it could tell the other dolphin how to do the same thing in its tank. That was really the prime experiment to be done, but Lilly never seemed able to do it.\u201d\nInstead, he encouraged Lovatt to press on with teaching Peter English. But there was something getting in the way of the lessons. \u201cDolphins get sexual urges,\u201d says the vet Andy Williamson, who looked after the animals\u2019 health at Dolphin House. \u201cI\u2019m sure Peter had plenty of thoughts along those lines.\u201d\n\u201cPeter liked to be with me,\u201d explains Lovatt. \u201cHe would rub himself on my knee, or my foot, or my hand. And at first I would put him downstairs with the girls,\u201d she says. But transporting Peter downstairs proved so disruptive to the lessons that, faced with his frequent arousals, it just seemed easier for Lovatt to relieve his urges herself manually.\n\u201cI allowed that,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t uncomfortable with it, as long as it wasn\u2019t rough. It would just become part of what was going on, like an itch \u2013 just get rid of it, scratch it and move on. And that\u2019s how it seemed to work out. It wasn\u2019t private. People could observe it.\u201d\nFor Lovatt it was a precious thing, which was always carried out with great respect. \u201cPeter was right there and he knew that I was right there,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t sexual on my part. Sensuous perhaps. It seemed to me that it made the bond closer. Not because of the sexual activity, but because of the lack of having to keep breaking. And that\u2019s really all it was. I was there to get to know Peter. That was part of Peter.\u201d\nInnocent as they were, Lovatt\u2019s sexual encounters with Peter would ultimately overshadow the whole experiment when a story about them appeared in Hustler magazine in the late 1970s. \u201cI\u2019d never even heard of Hustler,\u201d says Lovatt. \u201cI think there were two magazine stores on the island at the time. And I went to one and looked and I found this story with my name and Peter, and a drawing.\u201d\nSexploitation: Hustler magazine\u2019s take on the story in the late 1970s. Photograph: Lilly Estate\nLovatt bought up all the copies she could find, but the story was out there and continues to circulate to this day on the web. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit uncomfortable,\u201d she acknowledges. \u201cThe worst experiment in the world, I\u2019ve read somewhere, was me and Peter. That\u2019s fine, I don\u2019t mind. But that was not the point of it, nor the result of it. So I just ignore it.\u201d\nSomething else began to interrupt the study. Lilly had been researching the mind-altering powers of the drug LSD since the early 1960s. The wife of Ivan Tors, the producer of the dolphin movie Flipper, had first introduced him to it at a party in Hollywood. \u201cJohn and Ivan Tors were really good friends,\u201d says Ric O\u2019Barry of the Dolphin Project (an organisation that aims to stop dolphin slaughter and exploitation around the world) and a friend of Lilly\u2019s at the time. \u201cIvan was financing some of the work on St Thomas. I saw John go from a scientist with a white coat to a full blown hippy,\u201d he remembers.\nFor the actor Jeff Bridges, who was introduced to Lilly by his father Lloyd, Lilly\u2019s self-experimentation with LSD was just part of who he was. \u201cJohn Lilly was above all an explorer of the brain and the mind, and all those drugs that expand our consciousness,\u201d reflects Bridges. \u201cThere weren\u2019t too many people with his expertise and his scientific background doing that kind of work.\u201d\nIn the 1960s a small selection of neuroscientists like John Lilly were licensed to research LSD by the American government, convinced that the drug had medicinal qualities that could be used to treat mental-health patients. As part of this research, the drug was sometimes injected into animals and Lilly had been using it on his dolphins since 1964, curious about the effect it would have on them.\nMargaret Lovatt today. Photograph: Matt Pinner/BBC\nMuch to Lilly\u2019s annoyance, nothing happened. Despite his various attempts to get the dolphins to respond to the drug, it didn\u2019t seem to have any effect on them, remembers Lovatt. \u201cDifferent species react to different pharmaceuticals in different ways,\u201d explains the vet, Andy Williamson. \u201cA tranquilliser made for horses might induce a state of excitement in a dog. Playing with pharmaceuticals is a tricky business to say the least.\u201d\nInjecting the dolphins with LSD was not something Lovatt was in favour of and she insisted that the drug was not given to Peter, which Lilly agreed to. But it was his lab, and they were his animals, she recalls. And as a young woman in her 20s she felt powerless to stop him giving LSD to the other two dolphins.\nWhile Lilly\u2019s experimentation with the drug continued, Lovatt persevered with Peter\u2019s vocalisation lessons and grew steadily closer to him. \u201cThat relationship of having to be together sort of turned into really enjoying being together, and wanting to be together, and missing him when he wasn\u2019t there,\u201d she reflects. \u201cI did have a very close encounter with \u2013 I can\u2019t even say a dolphin again \u2013 with Peter.\u201d\nBy autumn 1966, Lilly\u2019s interest in the speaking-dolphin experiment was dwindling. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have the zing to it that LSD did at that time,\u201d recalls Lovatt of Lilly\u2019s attitude towards her progress with Peter. \u201cAnd in the end the zing won.\u201d\nThe dolphinarium on St Thomas. Photograph: Lilly Estate\nLilly\u2019s cavalier attitude to the dolphins\u2019 welfare would eventually be his downfall, driving away the lab\u2019s director, Gregory Bateson, and eventually causing the funding to be cut. Just as Lovatt and Peter\u2019s six-month live-in experiment was concluding, it was announced that the lab would be closed.\nWithout funding, the fate of the dolphins was in question. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep Peter,\u201d says Lovatt, wistfully. \u201cIf he\u2019d been a cat or a dog, then maybe. But not a dolphin.\u201d Lovatt\u2019s new job soon became the decommissioning of the lab and she prepared to ship the dolphins away to Lilly\u2019s other lab, in a disused bank building in Miami. It was a far cry from the relative freedom and comfortable surroundings of Dolphin House.\nAt the Miami lab, held captive in smaller tanks with little or no sunlight, Peter quickly deteriorated, and after a few weeks Lovatt received news.\n\u201cI got that phone call from John Lilly,\u201d she recalls. \u201cJohn called me himself to tell me. He said Peter had committed suicide.\u201d\nRic O\u2019Barry corroborates the use of this word. \u201cDolphins are not automatic air-breathers like we are,\u201d he explains. \u201cEvery breath is a conscious effort. If life becomes too unbearable, the dolphins just take a breath and they sink to the bottom. They don\u2019t take the next breath.\u201d Andy Williamson puts Peter\u2019s death down to a broken heart, brought on by a separation from Lovatt that he didn\u2019t understand. \u201cMargaret could rationalise it, but when she left, could Peter? Here\u2019s the love of his life gone.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t terribly unhappy about it,\u201d explains Lovatt, 50 years on. \u201cI was more unhappy about him being in those conditions [at the Miami lab] than not being at all. Nobody was going to bother Peter, he wasn\u2019t going to hurt, he wasn\u2019t going to be unhappy, he was just gone. And that was OK. Odd, but that\u2019s how it was.\u201d\nIn the decades which followed, John Lilly continued to study dolphin-human communications, exploring other ways of trying to talk to them \u2013 some of it bizarrely mystical, employing telepathy, and some of it more scientific, using musical tones. No one else ever tried to teach dolphins to speak English again.\nInstead, research has shifted to better understanding other species\u2019 own languages. At the Seti (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute, founded by Frank Drake to continue his work on life beyond Earth, Drake\u2019s colleague Laurance Doyle has attempted to quantify the complexity of animal language here on our home planet.\n\u201cThere is still this prejudice that humans have a language which is far and away above any other species\u2019 qualitatively,\u201d says Doyle. \u201cBut by looking at the complexity of the relationship of dolphin signals to each other, we\u2019ve discovered that they definitely have a very high communication intelligence. I think Lilly\u2019s big insight was how intelligent dolphins really are.\u201d\nMargaret Howe Lovatt stayed on the island, marrying the photographer who\u2019d captured pictures of the experiment. Together they moved back into Dolphin House, eventually converting it into a family home where they brought up three daughters. \u201cIt was a good place,\u201d she remembers. \u201cThere was good feeling in that building all the time.\u201d\nIn the years that followed the house has fallen into disrepair, but the ambition of what went on there is still remembered. \u201cOver the years I have received letters from people who are working with dolphins themselves,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThey often say things like: \u2018When I was seven I read about you living with a dolphin, and that\u2019s what started it all for me.\u2019\u201d\nPeter is their \u201cMiss Kelly\u201d, she explains, remembering her own childhood book about talking animals. \u201cMiss Kelly inspired me. And in turn the idea of my living with a dolphin inspired others. That\u2019s fun. I like that.\u201d\nChristopher Riley is the producer and director of The Girl Who Talked to Dolphins, which will premiere at the Sheffield International Documentary Festival on 11 June, and is on BBC4 on 17 June at 9pm"}

(Also see \"How Did Rare White Whale Spotted Off Australia Get That Way?\")\nAlbinism occurs when cells that normally make the pigment melanin, responsible for skin, hair, and eye color, fail to produce it at normal levels, or at all.\nThis is usually because of a mutation in one of several genes. Pinky\u2019s parents might have looked like typical dolphins, but both of them must have carried a single copy of the mutation in the same gene. Combined, those mutations resulted in the marine mammal's distinctive color.\nPinky has been around for about eight years, but albinism can come with several different health problems. The pigment melanin provides protection against the sun\u2019s rays, and also plays an important role in eyesight: Without it, many albinos suffer from vision problems. (See \"Super-Rare Albino Tapir Photographed in Brazil.\")\nBecause of this, Barsh says, it\u2019s rare to see an albino animal in the wild. Many more are found in laboratories or as pets, which don\u2019t need to see to survive.\nPictures of unusually white animals Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

If Pinky mated with a carrier of the mutated gene, like Pinky\u2019s parents, their offspring would have a fifty-fifty chance of inheriting Pinky\u2019s color.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "How Do Dolphins Go to Sleep? - ThoughtCo", "url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/how-do-dolphins-sleep-2291489", "text": "Dolphins can't breathe underwater, so every time a dolphin needs to breathe, it has to make the decision to come to the water surface to breathe and supply its lungs with oxygen. Yet a dolphin might only be able to hold its breath for about 15 to 17 minutes. So how do they sleep?\nHalf of Their Brain At a Time\nDolphins sleep by resting half of their brain at a time. This is called unihemispheric sleep. The brain waves of captive dolphins that are sleeping show that one side of the dolphin's brain is \"awake\" while the other is in a deep sleep, called slow-wave sleep. Also, during this time, the eye opposite the sleeping half of the brain is open while the other eye is closed.\nUnihemispheric sleep was thought to have evolved due to the dolphin's need to breathe at the surface, but may also be necessary for protection against predators, the need for toothed whales to stay within their tightly-knit pods, and for regulation of their internal body temperature.\nDolphin Mothers and Calves Get Little Sleep\nUnihemispheric sleep is advantageous to mother dolphins and their calves. Dolphin calves are especially vulnerable to predators such as sharks and also need to be near their mothers to nurse, so it would be dangerous for dolphin mothers and calves to fall into a full deep sleep like humans do.\nA 2005 study on captive bottlenose dolphin and orca mothers and calves showed that, at least when at the surface, both mom and calf appeared awake 24 hours a day during the first month of the calf's life. Also during this lengthy time period, both eyes of the mom and calf were open, indicating that they weren't even sleeping 'dolphin-style'. Gradually, as the calf grew, sleep would increase in both the mom and calf. This study was questioned later, as it involved pairs that were only observed at the surface.\nA 2007 study, though, showed a \"complete disappearance of rest at the surface\" for a minimum of 2 months after the calf was born, although occasionally the mother or calf were observed with an eye closed. This may mean that dolphin mothers and calves engage in deep sleep in the early months after birth, but it is for only brief periods. So it appears that early in the dolphin's life, neither mothers nor calves get much sleep. Parents: sound familiar?\nDolphins Can Stay Alert for at Least 15 Days\nAs mentioned above, unihemispheric sleep also allows dolphins to monitor their environment constantly. A study published in 2012 by Brian Branstetter and colleagues showed that \u200bdolphins can remain alert for up to 15 days. This study initially involved two dolphins, a female named \"Say\" and a male named \"Nay,\" who were taught to echolocate to find targets in a pen. When they identified the target correctly, they were rewarded. Once trained, the dolphins were asked to identify targets over longer periods of time. During one study, they performed the tasks for 5 days straight with extraordinary accuracy. The female dolphin was more accurate than the male\u2014the researchers commented in their paper that, subjectively, they thought this was \"personality-related,\" as Say seemed more eager to participate in the study.\nSay was subsequently used for a longer study, which was planned for 30 days but was cut off due to an impending storm. Before the study was concluded, however, Say accurately identified the targets for 15 days, demonstrating that she could perform this activity for a long period of time without interruption. This was thought to be due to her ability to get rest through unihemispheric sleep while still remaining focused on the task she needed to perform. The researchers suggested that a similar experiment should be done while also recording the dolphins' brain activity while the tasks are being performed to see if they engage in sleep.\nUnihemispheric Sleep in Other Animals\nUnihemispheric sleep has also been observed in other cetaceans (e.g., baleen whales), plus manatees, some pinnipeds, and birds. This type of sleep may offer hope for humans who have sleep difficulties.\nThis sleep behavior seems amazing to us, who are used to \u2014 and usually need to \u2014 fall into an unconscious state for several hours each day to recover our brains and bodies. But, as it was stated in the study by Branstetter and colleagues:\n\"If dolphins sleep like terrestrial animals, they might drown. If dolphins fail to maintain vigilance, they become susceptible to predation. As a result, the apparent 'extreme' capabilities these animals possess are likely to be quite normal, unspectacular and necessary for survival from the dolphin's perspective.\"\nHave a good night's sleep!"}

The massive mammals range from the 600-pound dwarf sperm whale to the colossal blue whale, which can weigh more than 200 tons and stretch up to 100 feet long\u2014almost as long as a professional basketball court.\nWhales are warm-blooded creatures that nurse their young.\nTypes of whales\nThere are two types of whales: toothed and baleen. Toothed whales, as the name suggests, have teeth, which are used to hunt and eat squid, fish, and seals. Toothed whales include sperm whales, as well as dolphins, porpoises, and orcas, among others. The narwhal\u2019s \u201chorn\u201d is actually one long tooth protruding through its lip.\nBaleen whales are larger than toothed whales, for the most part.

They feed by straining tiny shrimp-like creatures called krill through the fringed plates of long, fingernail-like material called baleen attached to their upper jaws.\nWhale calls\nWhales, particularly humpbacks, produce otherworldly vocalizations that can be heard for miles underwater. The songs, complex combinations of moans, howls, and cries that can continue for hours, are produced when whales push air around in their heads, then amplify the sounds through a blob of fat that perches on the top jaw. It\u2019s thought that whales communicate through the calls, which researchers believe can be heard for thousands of miles.\nThreats\nThough the stark population declines from hunting have largely stopped, several whale species are threatened or endangered\u2014including the blue whale, right whale, and fin whale\u2014by a combination of fishing net entanglements and being struck by ships."}

They have long, narrow wings that allow them to fly great distances using very little energy.\nThere are around 21 species of albatross (scientists disagree over the exact number). Together they make up the family Diomedeidae.\nYou can find out more about animal groups such as families, orders and species on this page: Animal Classification\nThe largest albatross is the wandering albatross. Its wingspan can reach 3.7 m (12 ft.); the longest wingspan of any bird! (The southern royal albatross, a closely related species, is a similar size.)\nImagine 2 tall men lying head to toe on the ground; that\u2019s the size of the albatross\u2019s wingspan!\nAlbatrosses feed on fish, squid, krill and zooplankton. They either find food on the surface of the ocean or dive in to capture their prey.\nAlbatrosses spend most of their lives at sea. Some are known to travel all the way around the southern part of the world not once, not twice, but three times a year!\nFind out more at Active Wild\nAnglerfish\nAn anglerfish is a member of a group of carnivorous fish called the Lophiiformes. The group contains several different families, and includes fishes such as the goosefishes, monkfishes, frogfishes, sea toads and seadevils.\nAnglerfish are slow-moving ambush predators who get their name from the unique way in which they catch their prey.\nProjecting from the top of the anglerfish\u2019s head is a long, bony \u2018arm\u2019. A fleshy growth at the tip of the arm acts as a lure to tempt curious fish closer to the anglerfish. (Think of a fisherman using a fake fly to catch a trout.)\nWhen the unsuspecting fish comes within range of the anglerfish\u2019s fearsome jaws, the anglerfish strikes, capturing the prey in its long teeth!\nBivalves\nBivalves are a group of aquatic animals with shells. Most bivalves are ocean animals, but some live in freshwater habitats. A bivalve\u2019s shell has two parts. These are hinged on one side, and can be open and closed.\nAnimals such as oysters, mussels and clams are bivalves. Many bivalves are hunted and eaten by humans. The world\u2019s largest living bivalve is the giant clam.\nBivalves are members of Mollusca, a group of invertebrates whose members are known as mollusks (spelt mollusc in British English).\nCoral\nCorals are marine invertebrates in the phylum (a large group of related animals) Cnidaria. Jellyfish and sea anemones are also members of this group.\nCorals are free-swimming larvae for a short period of their lives. After this time they attach themselves to a suitable surface on the sea bed, never to swim again. Corals at this stage of their lives are known as polyps.\nThe polyps will then either produce more free-swimming larvae, or an exact copy of themselves which will remain attached to the original body.\nCorals can continue to produce copies of themselves over many years. As they do so their hard exoskeletons (skeletons that grow outside of the body) gradually combine to create rocky structures known as coral reefs.\nCoral reefs are themselves important habitats for many other ocean animals.\nCrab\nCrabs are members of the animal group Crustacea. Other crustaceans include lobsters, crayfish, krill and barnacles. Most crustaceans live in the sea, but some \u2013 such as woodlice \u2013 have adapted to life on land.\nA typical crab has five pairs of limbs. The front pair is usually modified into pincers, while the other four pairs are used for movement. Most crabs walk sideways rather than forwards.\nCrabs are protected by a hard exoskeleton. As the crab grows it periodically molts, removing its entire body \u2013 including its legs \u2013 from its old shell. Its new shell is soft and expandable, giving the crab enough room to continue to grow.\nDolphin\nDolphins are marine mammals. Although their ancestors were land animals, dolphins are entirely aquatic. Their bodies are streamlined and fish-like, although, being mammals, dolphins still have to come up to the surface to breathe.\nMost dolphins are members of the family Delphinidae, a group otherwise known as the oceanic dolphins. With 30 species, Delphinidae is the largest dolphin family.\nAs the name suggests, oceanic dolphins are ocean animals. Members of the other three dolphin families live in freshwater or brackish (a mixture of fresh and salt water) habitats.\nThe brains of dolphins are among the largest \u2013 in relation to body size \u2013 of any animal. Dolphins are highly-intelligent animals, capable of teamwork, teaching / learning, and problem solving.\nFind out more at Active Wild\nEel\nEels are fish with long, snake-like bodies. Eels have long fins running along much of the length of their bodies. They swim by moving from side to side, making waves that travel down their bodies, pushing them through the water. Eels are also able to swim backwards.\nThere are around 800 species of eel. Most live in the ocean, but some make their way into freshwater habitats before returning to the sea to breed.\nEels begin life as tiny, translucent larvae that float in the ocean for up to three years before they metamorphose into small eels. A juvenile eel is known as an elver.\nFlatfish\nFlatfish are fish with flattened bodies. Both of their eyes are positioned on the top of their bodies. This means that, unlike most animals, flatfish are asymmetrical.\nFlatfish are usually found either on or near the sea bed. The tops of their bodies are usually darker than the undersides, providing camouflage against their surroundings.\nAs larvae, flatfish look similar to other fish, with an eye on either side of their heads. As they pass from the larval to the juvenile stage of their development, one eye (either the left or the right, depending on the species) migrates to the other side of the head. At the same time they begin to swim on their sides, and the skull and jaws become flattened.\nFlatfish such as halibut, plaice and flounder are important food fish for humans\nGull\nGulls are a group of between 50 and 60 species in the family Laridae (this family also includes skimmers and terns). Gulls are medium to large birds, usually with white plumage with contrasting areas of grey or black. Most gulls are dark grey or brown as juveniles, becoming progressively whiter with each molt.\nThe great black-backed gull is the largest species of gull. It has a wingspan of between 144 and 166 cm.\nGulls are social, noisy birds. They traditionally form breeding colonies on rocks and cliff tops, but today are just as likely to nest on rooftops in towns and cities. Gulls mate for life.\nJellyfish\nJellyfish, like sea anemones and corals, are members of the invertebrate group Cnidaria.\nJellyfish in the free-swimming, adult stage of their development have round, jelly-like bodies (known as bells) with several trailing tentacles. A jellyfish in this stage of development is known as a medusa.\nThe tentacles of a jellyfish are equipped with stinging cells.\nAlthough jellyfish stings are painful, they are usually harmless to humans. However, in some cases contact can be fatal. Box jellyfish (a type of jellyfish identified by their square-shaped bells) are the most dangerous to humans.\nJellyfish have a complex life-cycle. They begin life as larvae. At this point they are free-swimming. The larvae then attaches itself to a suitable surface and becomes a polyp.\nThe polyp then begins to produce buds. The buds float off and eventually become medusae.\nFind out more at Active Wild\nKrill\nKrill may be small, but they play a vital role in the ocean food chain. Krill are crustaceans that spend their lives drifting in the ocean. During the daylight hours they are found in deep water, but during the night they rise up close to the surface.\nThere are 86 species of krill. Some of these species occur in such great numbers that their population makes up a significant proportion of the total biomass of an ecosystem.\nThe total biomass of the Antarctic krill, a species found in the Southern Ocean, may exceed 500 million metric tons. This floating feast is an essential part of the diets of many species, including baleen whales, seals, squid, seabirds and fish.\nLobster\nLobsters are large crustaceans that live on the sea bed. They have five pairs of limbs, with the front pair being equipped with large claws. The other four pairs are used for walking. The two pairs behind the larger front limbs also possess claws.\nLobsters usually walk slowly over the ocean floor, but if alarmed they are able to swim away backwards by curling and uncurling their tail.\nChemicals in the lobster\u2019s blood give it a blue color.\nKiller Whale / Orca\nThe killer whale \u2013 also known as the orca \u2013 is one of the best-known ocean animals. This fearsome carnivore is an apex predator, having no predators of its own.\nThe killer whale is found in all of the world\u2019s oceans. It is just as likely to crop up in the Southern Ocean near Antarctica as it is in the Arctic.\nDespite its name, the killer whale is actually a dolphin (although strictly speaking all dolphins, including the killer whale, are members of the group of animals known as toothed whales). It is a member of the family Delphinidae, also known as the oceanic dolphins.\nWith large males reaching 8 meters in length and 6 metric tonnes in mass, the killer whale is the largest oceanic dolphin.\nFind out more at Active Wild\nKiller Whale Facts\nPenguin\nPenguins are flightless birds that are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. Instead of flying through the air, penguins \u2018fly\u2019 through the water. Using their wings as flippers, penguins are fast and highly maneuverable. They have to be; their prey consists of sea animals such as fish, krill and squid.\nPenguins are usually found in cold regions in the Southern Hemisphere. Several penguin species are found on the coast of Antarctica itself.\nAll penguins have black backs and white fronts. This is an example of countershading \u2013 a system of camouflage used by many ocean animals \u2013 with the upper regions being darker than the underparts.\nFrom below, the penguin is difficult to see against the surface of the water. From above, it is concealed against the sea bed.\nSome penguin species have additional markings and patches of yellow or other colors.\nThe biggest penguin is the emperor penguin. It reaches a height of around 1.2 m (4ft.). The smallest penguin is the little penguin, which grows to around 33 cm (13 in.)\nFind out more at Active Wild\nRay\nRays are fish with wide, flat bodies and wing-like fins. Most rays are bottom-feeders, and many have powerful, plate-like teeth for crushing the shells and exoskeletons of their shellfish and crustacean prey.\nRays, along with sharks, are members of the group known as the cartilaginous fishes. The skeletons of fish in this group are made from a flexible substance called cartilage, rather than of bone.\nSome or all of the water taken in by rays for \u2018breathing\u2019 enters through openings called spiracles, which are positioned on the top of the ray\u2019s body. The water is then passed over the ray\u2019s gills. (Most fish take in water through the mouth alone.)\nStingrays are rays whose tails are equipped with sharp, venomous spines called stingers. These are usually only used defensively.\nStings from stingrays usually occur when swimmers accidentally step on the fish. The sting is extremely painful, but not usually life-threatening.\nFind out more at Active Wild\nSea Anemone\nSea anemones are members of a group of invertebrates known as Cnidaria. Other cnidarians include jellyfish and corals.\nLooking like underwater stars, sea anemones have a ring of stinging tentacles positioned around a central mouth.\nSea anemones begin life as free-swimming larvae. Depending on the species, they then either attach themselves to a solid surface or burrow into soft surfaces.\nAnemones are not completely immobile. Depending on the species they are able to move in a variety of ways, including crawling, swimming, or floating using a bubble of gas.\nSome sea anemones have a symbiotic relationship with other animals. (In nature, a symbiotic relationship is one in which two different species live together and help each other in some way.)\nFor example, some sea anemones live on the shells of hermit crabs. This gives the anemone a means of moving around, while the anemone\u2019s stinging tentacles provide protection for the crab.\nWhen the crab changes its shell, it takes the sea anemone with him!\nSea Lion\nSea lions are members of the eared seal family, Otariidae. This family is part of a larger group of animals known as pinnipeds, which also contains the true, or earless, seals, and the walrus.\nUnlike true seals, sea lions are able to use their hind flippers for walking on land. This makes them slightly more mobile when out of the water than their earless cousins.\nThere are six species of sea lion. The most familiar of these is the California sea lion. This is the species that is usually seen in zoos and water parks.\nFind out more at Active Wild\nSea Snake\nSea snakes are snakes in the family Elapidae that have adapted to life in the ocean. Not all members of this family live in the sea; cobras, for example, live on land.\nMost sea snakes spend their whole lives in the sea. They swim using their modified, paddle-like tails, and, rather than laying eggs, give birth to live young.\nSea snakes possess some of the most powerful venom of all snakes. This is delivered via hollow, fixed fangs positioned at the front of the upper jaw.\nSea Turtle\nSea turtles are a group of seven reptiles that, unlike other Testudines (turtles) have adapted to a life spent mainly in the sea. In fact, once a male sea turtle enters the ocean as a hatchling, it will never again walk on land.\nFemale sea turtles will periodically return to land \u2013 often to the very beach on which they hatched \u2013in order to lay their eggs.\nThe limbs of sea turtles have evolved into flippers. Although able to spend long periods of time under the water, sea turtles always have to return to the surface in order to breathe.\nSadly, sea turtles occasionally get caught up in the nets of fishing boats and drown. Sea turtles are also vulnerable to pollution, mistakenly eating pieces of plastic they find floating in the sea.\nThis, combined with the loss of many of their traditional nesting areas, means that sea turtles are in great danger.\nThree sea turtle species are rated Vulnerable, one is rated Endangered, and two are rated Critically Endangered.\nFind out more at Active Wild\nSeahorse\nSeahorses are small fish, named after the land mammals that they resemble. There are 45 species of seahorse.\nSeahorses are not powerful swimmers. They spend most of the time holding onto marine vegetation with their prehensile tails. (Prehensile means \u2018able to grip\u2019.)\nMale seahorses have pouches into which the female deposits eggs. The couple\u2019s eggs develop inside the pouch and the young emerge as tiny seahorses.\nFind out more at Active Wild\nSeal\nSeals are marine mammals whose ancestors were once land animals. Unlike whales and dolphins, whose ancestors were hoofed mammals, the ancestors of seals were carnivores.\nSeals are in the same order \u2013 Carnivora \u2013 as cats, dogs, weasels and bears.\nSeals have many adaptations for living in the ocean. These include having flippers for swimming, a layer of blubber under the skin for keeping warm, and streamlined, torpedo-shaped bodies for moving swiftly through the water.\nThere are two main types of seal: \u2018true seals\u2019 (also known as \u2018earless seals\u2019) in the family Phocidae, and \u2018eared seals\u2019 in the family Otariidae.\nTrue seals propel themselves through the water using their hind flippers. This adaptation comes at a cost; their hind flippers cannot be used for walking. Because of this, true seals move awkwardly on land.\nThe true seal family includes familiar species such as the harbor seal, which is the most widely-distributed seal, and the southern elephant seal \u2013 the largest seal species.\nThe eared seal family includes the fur seals and the sea lions. They swim mainly using their front flippers, and are able to reverse their hind flippers and use them for walking when on land.\nFind out more at Active Wild\nShark\nSharks are among the best known \u2013 and most feared \u2013 of all ocean predators. There are over 500 species of shark. Although not all are dangerous, species such as the great white shark, tiger shark and hammerhead shark are all apex predators; top of the food chain wherever they are found.\nSharks are fast, silent, and most species are armed with a mouthful of sharp teeth that are replaced continuously throughout the animal\u2019s lifetime.\nAll sharks have special electroreceptive organs in their heads. Using these, a shark can sense the electrical fields produced by other ocean animals. This \u2018sixth sense\u2019 is used to locate prey.\nSharks are cartilaginous fish. Whereas the skeletons of bony fish (the other main fish group) are made of bone, those of cartilaginous fish are made of a flexible substance called cartilage.\nThe world\u2019s largest fish \u2013 the whale shark \u2013 and the second-largest fish \u2013 the basking shark \u2013 are both sharks. Unlike their smaller, but deadlier cousins, these two giants are filter feeders. Their diet consists of small marine organisms such as krill.\nFind out more at Active Wild\nSquid\nSquid are mollusks in the class Cephalopoda. They have soft bodies with an internal shell called a pen, large eyes, a cluster of 8 arms and 2 tentacles. Like all mollusks, much of a squid\u2019s body is enclosed in a muscular wall known as a mantle.\nThe colossal squid \u2013 a squid that can reach 46ft. (14 m) in length \u2013 has the largest eyes of any animal. Its eyes can be up to 11 in. (27 cm) in diameter!\nSquid move through the water either by using their fins, or by jet propulsion. Jet propulsion is achieved by ejecting water at high speed by contracting the mantle.\nStarfish / Sea Star\nStarfish (also known as sea stars) are invertebrate ocean animals in the order Asteroidea. (The name comes from the Greek for \u2018star-like\u2019).\nStarfish live on the sea bed, where they feed on small mollusks and other marine invertebrates.\nMost starfish have five arms, but some species can have over 50. If a starfish loses one or more of its arms, it can re-grow them!\nWhale\nWhales are marine mammals. Along with dolphins and porpoises they form the group Cetacea \u2013 members of which are known as cetaceans.\nWhales are descended from land animals. Their ancestors were hoofed mammals in the order Artiodactyla (a group of animals whose members are known as \u2018even-toad ungulates\u2019.\nThe cetaceans\u2019 closest living relatives on land are the hippopotamus and the pygmy hippopotamus.\nThere are two types of whale: toothed whales such as the killer whale and the sperm whale, and baleen whales such as the humpback whale and blue whale.\nBaleen whales feed by filtering small organisms from the seawater using comb-like structures in their toothless mouths. Toothed whales are carnivorous predators.\nAmong the whales are some of the largest living animals. The blue whale (a baleen whale) is not only the largest living animal, it is also the largest animal that has ever lived.\nFind out more at Active Wild\nWorms\nWorms are invertebrates with long bodies and no limbs. Many unrelated types of worm have adapted to live in the sea. Worms form an important part of the marine food chain, and can act as prey, scavengers, predators and parasites.\nMany types of annelid (segmented worms whose bodies are made up of many rings, or segments) live in the sea. This group includes worms such as lugworms and ragworms \u2013 both of which are eaten by other sea animals. Some ragworms are also predators themselves.\nSea worms such as osedax (also known as \u2018zombie-worms\u2019) are scavengers who help to break down the bodies of larger ocean animals that have sunk to the sea bed.\nSome marine worms, such as the ribbon worm Parborlasia corrugatus, are parasites that live on the bodies of other sea animals while they are still alive.\nThe giant tube worm is a marine worm that is able to live in areas of high temperature and toxicity surrounding deep-sea volcanic vents.\nOcean Animals List For Kids & Adults: Conclusion\nOn this page you\u2019ve met a wide range of ocean animals, from coastal animals such as penguins that rely on the ocean for food, to deep sea worms that can survive in the most inhospitable of habitats.\nWe hope that you\u2019ve enjoyed reading about these amazing creatures and that you\u2019ve discovered something about ocean animals that you didn\u2019t already know!\nWhat\u2019s your favorite ocean animal?

But being a veteran isn\u2019t a description limited to Homo sapiens. As long as humans have been going to war, animals have been serving alongside them in battle. Horses are the most common compatriots, but others may surprise you\u2014even the humble glow worm has served in its own incandescent uniform. Here are some of the most unusual animals that have aided troops on the battlefield.\nAdvertisement\nDogs (and one cat)\nCanines\u2019 keen senses of smell and hearing have long helped soldiers sniff out bombs and land mines, locate wounded soldiers, and warn of impending attacks. Russian soldiers used sled dogs for transportation, and one American pit bull mix, Sergeant Stubby, was given his sergeant title after attacking a German spy in World War I. But dogs have also been used for less than noble purposes. Before the Civil War, bloodhounds were used to track down runaway slaves, and one (thankfully canceled) project in World War II used dogs to deliver explosives to the enemy.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nIn 1943, the United Kingdom created the Dickin Medal to award to animals who served in World War II. The majority of the 54 medal recipients were given to dogs and carrier pigeons, but one stalwart cat named Simon was awarded the medal for killing off a nefarious, ration-stealing rat population aboard a British naval ship, even after being injured by a cannon blast that killed 17 of the ship\u2019s crew. Simon and 11 other Dickin Medal recipients are interred at Ilford Animal Cemetery outside London.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nGlow worms\nIn World War I, British soldiers found bioluminescent allies in glow worms. After collecting thousands of worms in jars, soldiers would use them to illuminate messages and maps in the dark trenches. In 2004, the British government honored the glow worms and other military animals with a memorial sculpture bearing an inscription: \u201cThis monument is dedicated to all the animals that served and died alongside British and allied forces in wars and campaigns throughout time. They had no choice.\u201d\nElephants\nAlong with horses and dogs, elephants are some of the earliest animals historically on the battlefield, serving roughly the same role as tanks\u2014Hannibal famously brought more than 30 elephants in his march across the Alps in 218 B.C. Perhaps the oldest of animal veterans is Lin Wang, or Grandpa Lin, an elephant who served in World War II and lived to age 86. After being conscripted by Japanese forces to haul supplies through the Burmese jungle, Lin Wang was captured by the Chinese army and became a double agent. Elephants were also used to ford flooded rivers and may have inspired J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s oliphaunts in the Lord of the Rings series. The movie Operation Dumbo Drop was based on the true story of a U.S. mission to airlift a pair of elephants to transport lumber through the mountains of Vietnam. (The real name of the mission, Operation Barroom, was a reference to the sound a flatulent elephant makes.)\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nBut pachyderms also did their part outside the theater of war. The British army used roughly 1.2 million horses and mules in World War I, leaving a transportation labor shortage in British towns. Enter Lizzie the elephant, the Rosie the Riveter of the animal kingdom. Lizzie was a traveling circus elephant who was enlisted to haul scrap metal from merchants in Sheffield. She was able to pull the same weight as three horses. Other elephants were put to work on farms plowing fields and hauling crops, and camels were also used to tote heavy loads while horses were away at war.\nDolphins\nLike dogs\u2019 keen sense of smell above ground, dolphins\u2019 use of echolocation has been indispensable to U.S. troops in locating underwater mines. The Navy\u2019s Marine Mammal Program has also employed sea lions and seals (not to be confused with Navy SEALs) for their ability to fetch objects from the ocean. The Navy even uses orcas and beluga whales for deep diving expeditions, and sharks and rays for testing the resistance of Kevlar diving suits.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nCarrier pigeons\nCarrier pigeons aren\u2019t heralded for their loyalty as often as their quadruped counterparts. But one pigeon has earned particular regard for saving almost 200 U.S troops despite being badly injured. Cher Ami, a carrier pigeon donated to the U.S. Signal Corps by Britain, served with the 77th Infantry Division in World War I. Stranded behind enemy lines, the 77th came under friendly fire from unknowing U.S. troops. After the first two pigeons he sent were shot down by German troops, Lt. Colonel Charles Whittlesey wrote one last plea and attached it to Cher Ami\u2019s leg. German troops shot at Cher Ami as he flew away, and despite being blinded, shot in the breast and in the leg, Cher Ami continued his 25-mile journey and successfully delivered Whittlesey\u2019s message: \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, stop it.\u201d Cher Ami became an American hero, inspiring the writer Harry Webb Farrington to write a poem describing the harrowing flight that cost Cher Ami his leg (\u201cIt\u2019s hard a-standing on one leg!\u201d the poem ends). Today, you can visit a taxidermied Cher Ami in the Smithsonian National Museum of American History."}

Dolphins are able to protect vulnerable members of their pods and extended families such as young dolphins and injured or sick dolphins. Dolphins use their strong snouts as a powerful weapon to ram sharks, targeting their soft underbellies and gills to cause injuries.\nSharks pose less of a threat to larger members of the dolphin family. Indeed, orcas are the top predator in the ocean and small sharks are a target for some populations. Orcas will even attack and kill great white sharks just to eat their livers which are a high energy food source."}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Penguin Facts - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/penguins/", "text": "Penguin Profile\nPenguins are flightless, aquatic birds that spend half their lives in water, and on land. They mainly habitat the Southern Hemisphere, with only the Galapagos penguin, north of the equator.\nThey are members of the order Sphenisciformes and family Spheniscidae, and the number of extant penguin species is debated, somewhere between 17 \u2013 20 current living species in total.\nPenguin Facts Overview\nHabitat: Southern Hemisphere & Galapagos Islands Location: Angola, Antarctica, Argentina, Australia, Chile, Namibia, New Zealand, and South Africa Lifespan: 6 \u2013 25 Years (Depending on Species) Size: 1.3 \u2013 3.7 ft (0.4 \u2013 1.1 m) Weight: 2 \u2013 78 Pounds (1 \u2013 35 kg) Color: Black on their back, and white on their front. Some species have distinct markings or colors, such as yellow and orange. Diet: Seafood, such as fish, krill, squid Predators: Seals, Sea Lion, Killer Whales. Top Speed: 6 \u2013 9 kph (4 \u2013 6 mph) No. of Species:\n17 \u2013 20 Conservation Status:\n5 Species Endangered: Northern Rockhopper, Erect-crested, Yellow-eyed, African, Galapagos. 5 Species Vulnerable: Humboldt, Macaroni, S. Rockhopper, Fiordland, Snares. 3 Species Near-Threatened: Emperor, Magellanic, Royal.\nThey range from the Little Blue (or Fairy) Penguin (Eudyptula minor) which stands just 40-centimetres tall to the Emperor Penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) which averages just over 1-metre tall.\nDepending on the species, Penguins can weight from as little as 1-kilogram up to 40-kilograms and can live to 20 years. These meat eaters are usually found in coastal waters as well as areas that that are covered in ice.\nOne misconception about Penguins is that they are all cold weather creatures. They are native to the southern hemisphere and are found not just in the Antarctic. Many species inhabit warmer climates with one in particular \u2013 the Galapagos Penguin \u2013 that calls the region near the Equator home.\nInteresting Penguin Facts\n1. Penguins can\u2019t fly, but they sure can swim.\nThe wings of the Penguin have actually become flippers. This means they are somewhat clumsy on land, but can really move underwater. In fact, they are so agile ducking and weaving about that their actions in water look much like a bird in flight in air.\n2. Penguins are speedy underwater and are deep sea divers.\nWhen a Penguin dives into the water it can reach a speed of up to 12-kilometres per hour and when in high gear, some can reach up to 27 km/h. As for diving, the larger penguins can go deeper, with Emperor Penguins capable of diving down to depths of 565-metres \u2013 with dives lasting up to 22-minutes.\n3. The average Penguin spends as much time on land as it does in the water.\nActually, they will spend half of their life in one or the other.\n4. Penguins have devised ways to travel on land that would otherwise be hampered by their overall body shape and length of their legs.\nThey slide across snow on their bellies in a move known as tobogganing. When upright, Penguins waddle on foot or jump with both feet together in order to navigate terrain.\n5. Although the actual number is not clearly known, there are many Penguin species.\nThe common belief is that there are between 17 and 20 different Penguin species on the planet.\n6. Penguins use a layer of air for various benefits.\nWhen underwater, the layer of air that is trapped in the smooth plumage of the bird provides buoyancy. The air layer also acts as an insulator when in cold water.\n7. The diet of the Penguin is met with underwater diving.\nIt may look like they are playing, but since the Penguin feeds on sea life while swimming, it spends a lot of time in the water. One species, the Gentoo Penguin, can make up to 450 dives in a day when foraging for food.\n8. Penguins have special underwater vision.\nThe eyes of the Penguin have special adaptations which provide superior underwater vision. It assists in finding food and spotting predators.\n9. Penguins are highly social.\nBecause they tend to live in large colonies, Penguins have constant opportunities for social interaction and as a result have a number of vocal and visual signals that they have developed in order to communicate with one another.\n10. They have large extended families.\nPenguins also breed in large colonies. The Gentoo Penguin colonies can number just 100 pairs where other species have colonies in the size of several hundreds of thousands.\n11. Penguins know the value of working together.\nIn harsh environments, Penguins will huddle together to stay warm and conserve energy. Once a bird in the centre has warmed up, it moves to the perimeter and this continues so that each Penguin gets a turn in the centre of the huddle.\n12. Monogamy is common in the Penguin world.\nPairs will stick together during the breeding season. Often they will re-couple afterwards, or it depends. Sometimes a couple just goes their separate ways after the young have hatched and grow old enough to take care of themselves.\n13. Homosexuality is part of the Penguin culture.\nPenguins have the distinction of having the most widely publicized homosexual relationships of the entire animal kingdom.\n14. Penguins have small families.\nA typical clutch is two eggs however, the King and Emperor \u2013 the largest of the Penguin species \u2013 only have a single egg in a clutch. When measured proportionately to the adult Penguin body weight, these birds have the smallest eggs of any bird species on the planet.\n15. Roughly 99.999% of the Penguin species will share the incubation duties.\nIt\u2019s true, males take on as much of the work as females in the care of the eggs of their young. Well, that is with one exception. The male Emperor Penguin does not participate in this process.\n16. It\u2019s a good thing that most of the male Penguins pitch in with incubation shifts.\nWhen one part of the Penguin couple ventures off to sea in order to feed, the incubating egg is left with the other partner. Sometimes the shift can go days and even months simply because the ice pack can form leaving open ocean as much as 80-kilometres away from the colony.\n17. Penguins have incredible hearing.\nIt is with their sensitive hearing that parents and chicks are able to locate each other in a crowded colony.\n18. Penguins have a built-in camouflage.\nThe counter shading of the Penguin plumage \u2013 black backs with white fronts \u2013 protect these birds from most prey that cannot distinguish a swimming Penguin from sun shimmering on the water surface when viewed from deep in the water below. The dark plumage on their backs helps to \u2018hide\u2019 them from above.\n19. They have no land predators.\nPenguins are safe in colonies on land as they have no predators except those living in the water. This is very likely why Penguins have little or no fear of humans. Humans have taken advantage of this and have been able to conduct many studies on these interesting birds without much problem.\n20. The size of the Penguin can tell you where they are from.\nThe larger Penguin species inhabit the colder climates. This obviously means that the smaller Penguin species would live in the warmer climates of the world.\nPenguin Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification\nKingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Sphenisciformes Family: Spheniscidae\nGenus & Species List"}

It is obviously impossible to have one as a pet except if you are the owner of a zoo or an aquarium; but you can still look for great names which would suit your dolphin, if you were to have one.\nWhy You Should Name Your Dolphin\nNaming people and pets is necessary. By knowing a person\u2019s name, a stranger can become someone that deserves our decency and sympathy. The same empathizing effect of knowing another person\u2019s names is the same when it comes to other animals or pets. A name distinguishes a person or a pet from a generalized crowd or group of animals. For the same reason, our pets can easily gain access to our affection and endearment that is often reserved only for our own kind once we name them. Therefore, naming your pet dolphin has the same effect. Even dolphins in general have specific whistles, which are equivalent to names, that they use to call each other. If you decide to adopt a dolphin it is important to name your new family member. Even if a dolphin is not domesticated, naming it will result in it being watched and tended to more carefully and as a result, it will make the animal less stressed. Overall, naming a dolphin whether wild or domesticated is good for the animal\u2019s welfare. It has been proven that giving names to animals moves people to better conserve and care more for them in general.\nGood Dolphin Names\nFin: You can name your dolphin Fin, a perfect name which complements the dolphin\u2019s appearance as, dolphins have fins on their backs.\nJumper: Jumper is a good dolphin name which you can give to the dolphin who is always jumping in and out of the water.\nSnowflake: Snowflake is a good name for your adorable dolphin. The name is inspired by Snowflake, the dolphin character in the movie \u2018Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.\u2019\nLoki: Loki is the god of mischief and you can name your dolphin after this god. The name will definitely stick because dolphins are clever.\nNatsu: If you prefer giving your dolphin an exotic name; name him Natsu. That is Japanese for \u2018born in summer;\u2019 dolphins are fond of summer time.\nFlippy: Dolphins flip a lot when they jump into the air, making a great show for their spectators. Flippy is therefore a good name to give to your dolphin.\nDusty: Dusty makes a good dolphin name for a grey dolphin.\nOther suggested names which will suit your dolphin are below.\nSqueal\nDony\nSplash\nFreedom\nBlue\nMushroom\nEcho\nSquak\nSandy\nAran\nDolly\nFainne\nMolly\nOrk\nDingle\nFungie\nDorad\nTarquin\nSome Interesting Facts About Dolphins\nDolphins are an interesting species of animals that have some of the most elaborate acoustic capabilities in the animal kingdom. These animals make a variety of sounds such as whistles, clicks, squawks, squeaks, moans, barks, groans, and yelps too. Some types of dolphins such as bottlenose dolphins are some of the few animals, along with apes and humans, that have the ability to recognise themselves in a mirror. Known as \u2018reflective\u2019 of their intelligence, dolphins are also amongst some of the few animals that have been recorded using tools. In Shark Bay in Western Australia, these animals fit marine sponges over their beaks in order to protect them from any sharp, harmful rocks as they forage for their meals. Another fascinating fact about Bottlenose dolphins is that they sleep with one half of their brain awake at a time, and they also keep one eye open. It is believed that they do this to keep an eye out for their group. That way they can make sure that they stick together as well as look out for predators such as sharks. Dolphins have an interesting way of hunting too, they produce bubbles to herd their prey to the surface and sometimes they also use a hunting technique called \u2018fish-whacking. Fish whacking is when dolphins make use of their tail to hit fish in order to stun them so that they are easier to catch.\nCute Dolphin Names\nWe have also compiled cute names suitable for your adorable dolphin.\nCuddly: A friendly dolphin deserves to be named Cuddly.\nJumpy: If your dolphin constantly jumps out of the water, Jumpy is a great name for her.\nLove: The term love is used on someone or something that is adored. You can consider naming your dolphin Love, that will be cute.\nHopster: Hopster is a cute name for a dolphin who spends a lot of time jumping in and out of water.\nEldoris: Eldoris is a cute dolphin name. The name is Greek for \u2018of the sea.\u2019\nEzili: Ezili is a cute and unique name which is perfect for your dolphin. The name is inspired by the Benin goddess of beauty, water and love.\nUla: If you want a short and easy to pronounce type of name for your adorable dolphin; name her Ula. This name means \u2018sea jewel.\u2019\nBelow is a list of other cute names for your dolphin.\nBeck\nHaiti\nAoi\nKatrina\nSolomon\nSeychelles\nKona\nLeonora\nGully\nLumen\nNaewhal\nAmberjack\nCliff\nCilia\nKent\nBritney\nNegril\nLunan\nAqua\nBellus\nAngel\nBella\nWhat Do Dolphins Eat\nToothed whales such as dolphins are carnivores meaning that they eat other animals. Dolphins feed on a variety of fish, squid, shrimps, jellyfish as well as octopuses. The types of fish and other creatures that dolphins eat depend on the species of the dolphin, where the dolphins live, and the wildlife that they share their habitats with. Most dolphins are opportunistic feeders, meaning that they eat the fish and other animals that share their homes. Amazon river dolphins consume more than 40 different species of freshwater fish plus they also eat freshwater crustaceans. Although, dolphins are believed to have a keen sense of taste, they lack an olfactory nerve and associated lobes so it is believed that they are not able to smell their food. When it comes to water, dolphins get all of the water they require directly from the food they consume. The dolphin\u2019s main prey which is fish and squid contain a lot of water. Also, dolphins do not lose water by sweating, like we do, and as a result they do not need a lot of water like we do in their diets.\nFunny Dolphin Names\nThe funniest of names are made from puns and some are derived from comics.

Some other types of dolphins prefer to live in coastal areas, other dolphins like shallow water which may be located further out to sea while some species travel the high seas to get away from land. River dolphins including the Amazon River dolphin and the South Asian river dolphins live in fresh water rivers and lakes only. Some other dolphin species have populations that live in fresh water such as tucuxi, Irrawaddy dolphin and finless porpoise. Other species, such as common bottlenose dolphins, can visit or inhabit estuaries of large rivers and as result they end up living close to cities. Several other species of dolphins can be found in colder waters, such as white-beaked dolphins and hourglass dolphins, however most dolphins prefer tropical and temperate waters because they are warm-blooded mammals. As such, it is easier for them to regulate their body temperature in these warm environments.\nFemale Dolphin Names\nThe names below are nice for female dolphins.\nSnowflake: Snowflake is perfect for a female dolphin. The name is from a mascot in the \u2018Ace Ventura.\u2019\nChirp: Chirp is a great female dolphin name for a dolphin who constantly chirps.\nStar: People love a spectacular show performed by dolphins.

Dolphins are mammals and this puts them in the group of other marine mammals such as whales, seals, and manatees. These animals are seen as one of the world\u2019s most intelligent animals, plus they have several cognitive abilities that sets them apart. Dolphins have been seen displaying a combination of perception, communication, and problem-solving. This is seen in the way the dolphins communicate and use tools. Communication is a huge part of how dolphins socialize and hunt. They have the ability to echolocate with a series of clicks, and it also allows them to find other dolphins or similar species as well as prey even in the low-light conditions of the ocean. Dolphin echolocation also allows them to detect surgically implanted metal in swimming humans. What makes dolphins special is that these animals are a lot like any other pet such as a dog. Dolphins are sociable, playful, and curious too. To top it all, these animals get along well with humans. In addition, dolphins have been seen exhibiting signs of compassion and altruism amongst themselves and other animals.\nMale Dolphin Names\nIf your dolphin is male, you can choose a name for him from the suggested names below.\nDrake: You can name your male dolphin after Drake, a famous naval officer and sea explorer.\nKai: The name Kai is a nice name for a male dolphin.

They are 5 feet long.\nRough Toothed Dolphins: This kind hangs out with pilot whales. It has no noticeable forehead.\nRisso\u2019s Dolphin: It has a grey hide which lightens as it ages. It is also known as the grampus.\nKiller Whales: These are giant dolphins.\nWhat are Signature Whistles?\nDolphins are said to choose their own names by their whistles. Each dolphin has his or her signature whistle which is different from that of the next dolphin. Expects have gathered that these whistles are a way in which dolphins call one another; individuals only respond to their own calls by sounding their whistle back."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Manatees Facts and Information | SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment", "url": "https://seaworld.org/animals/facts/mammals/manatees/", "text": "Scientific Classification\nCommon Name manatee, sea cow Kingdom Animalia Phylum Chordata Class Mammalia Order Sirenia Family Trichecidae Genus Species Trichechus inunguis, the Amazonian manatee. The Amazonian manatee is the smallest of the manatees. Several physical characteristics distinguish it from the other two species. It lacks nails on its pectoral fins, and usually has whitish patches on its underside.\nTrichechus manatus, the West Indian manatee. There are two subspecies of the West Indian manatee: the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) and the Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus). These subspecies are distinguished by differences in cranial measurements and by their geographic distribution.\nTrichechus senegalensis, the West African manatee. About the same size and shape of the West Indian manatee, the West African manatee differs in some important respects: position of the eyes, snout, and cranial bones.\nFast Facts\nDescription The manatee's body is streamlined, full around the middle and narrowing to a paddle-shaped tail.\nThe true color of a manatee is gray, although it may appear brownish gray. Amazonian manatees usually have white or pink patches on the belly and chest.\nOrganisms such as algae, which may grow on the skin of slow-moving individuals, alter the body color and make some manatees look more green or brown. Size Adult West Indian and West African manatees average about 3 m (10 ft.) in length. Large individuals may reach lengths of up to 4 m (13 ft.).\nAmazonian manatees are the smallest of all 3 species. They are shorter and more slender. The longest specimen measured 2.8 m (9.2 ft.). Weight Average adult weights are approximately 363 to 544 kg (800 to 1,200 lbs.). One particularly large Florida manatee weighed 1,655 kg (3,650 lbs.). Females are generally larger than males. A particularly large Amazonian manatee individual weighed 480 kg (1,058 lbs.). Diet Manatees are primarily herbivores. They feed on a wide variety of submerged, emergent, floating, and shoreline vegetation. Manatees in Florida feed on more than 60 species of plants including turtle grass, manatee grass, shoal grass, mangrove leaves, various algae, water hyacinth, acorns, and hydrilla. Manatees consume about 4% to 9% (15 to 49 kg or 32 to 108 lbs. for an average adult manatee) of their body weight in wet vegetation daily.\nIn Sierra Leone, Africa, the West African manatee is considered a pest because they consume fields of planted rice.\nManatees have occasionally been seen to eat foods other than plants. Antillean manatees have been known to eat fish from nets and West African manatees have been known to eat clams.\nSome Amazonian manatees living in deep bodies of water apparently fast during dry seasons (November and December) when water levels drop as much as 9 to 15 m (30 to 50 ft.), eliminating their access to vegetation.\nBecause manatees have a very low metabolic rate, it is speculated that Amazonian manatees are able to fast for up to seven months if necessary. Incubation The exact gestation period of most manatee species is not known and is poorly studied. It is known, however, that a Florida manatee's gestation is approximately 12 months. Sexual Maturity Male: Male manatees (bulls) are sexually mature by about 9 to 10 years, although some have produced viable sperm at 2 to 3 years of age.\nFemale: Female manatees (cows) are sexually mature as young as 3 years of age. Life Span Manatees probably live a maximum of about 50 to 60 years. Range All living manatee species are found in warm tropical and subtropical waters.\nThe West Indian manatee was once abundant throughout the tropic and subtropical western North and South Atlantic and Caribbean waters. However, the manatee's numbers have been greatly reduced and is rarely seen throughout its range.\nThe range of the Florida manatee is primarily peninsular Florida but extends as far north as Rhode Island. Manatees have been rescued near Houston, Texas, and Mississippi.\nAntillean manatees have a patchy distribution throughout the Caribbean, Mexico, and northeastern South America. The southern range extends through Central and South America to Brazil.\nWest African manatees range from Senegal to Angola, on the west coast of Africa.\nAmazonian manatees are the only species of manatee confined to fresh water. They inhabit the Amazon Basin, mostly in Brazil. They are uncommon or close to extinction in Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. Habitat The West Indian and West African manatees inhabit rivers, bays, canals, estuaries, and coastal areas rich in seagrass and other vegetation. They can live in fresh, saline (salt), and brackish waters. They move freely between extremes.\nWest Indian manatees may be found in any waterway over 1 m (3.25 ft.) deep and connected to the coast. They prefer waters with temperatures above 21\u00b0C (70\u00b0F). Florida manatees rarely venture into deep ocean waters. However, manatees have been spotted as far offshore as the Dry Tortugas Islands, approximately 81 km (50 mi.) west of Key West, Florida.\nWest African manatees live in quiet coastal areas, large rivers, lagoons, and connected lakes, where the water temperature is above 18\u00b0C (64\u00b0F).\nThe Amazonian manatee is restricted to fresh water. They are most common in floodplain lakes and channels in white-water river systems with water temperatures ranging from 25\u00b0 to 30\u00b0C (77\u00b0 to 86\u00b0F).\nThe patchy distribution of manatees throughout all their ranges is due to their search of suitable habitat: plentiful aquatic plants and a freshwater source of water to drink. Population Global: Populations of all species of manatees have apparently declined over the past hundred years. These declines are due to such causes as hunting for their meat, destruction of their habitats, boating, pollution, and low reproduction rates. Antillean, Amazonian, and West African manatee populations are not known due to inadequate scientific research.\nRegional: An aerial census is done at least once a year on the Florida manatee. The Florida manatee census taken in February, 2004, found 2,505 individuals. The 2005 survey was 3,143. These figures represent the minimum amount of manatees known to be in the state of Florida at the time of the census. Detailed Florida manatee mortality statistics can be found at http://myfwc.com/research/manatee/rescue-mortality-response/mortality-statistics/ Status IUCN: All 4 species of sirenians are endangered or threatened.\nCITES: All 4 species of sirenians are Appendix I\nUSFWS: West Indian manatee, Florida manatee, and Antillean manatee are threatened: Amazonian manatee is endangered\nFun Facts\nManatees average 3 m (10 ft.) and 363 to 544 kg (800 to 1,200 lbs.). Manatees have paddle-like tails and foreflippers, and no hind limbs. Manatees belong to the mammalian order Sirenia. There are 3 species of manatee: Trichechus inunguis, the Amazonian manatee; Trichechus senegalensis, the West African manatee; and Trichechus manatus, the West Indian manatee. Scientists also recognize 2 subspecies of West Indian manatee: T.m. latirostris, the Florida manatee, and T.m. manatus, the Antillean manatee. The order Sirenia has one other living species, the dugong. A fifth species, Steller's sea cow, was hunted to extinction by 1768. All manatees inhabit tropical and subtropical waters of North and South America and Africa. The West Indian and West African manatees live in rivers, bays, estuaries, and coastal areas. They can move freely between freshwater and saltwater habitats. The Amazonian manatee is restricted to the freshwater Amazon basin. All manatees are herbivores. The Florida manatee feeds on more that 60 varieties of grasses and plants. A manatee's only teeth are molars, for grinding vegetation. Some research suggests that manatees periodically require fresh water. West Indian manatees have been seen congregating at river mouths and drinking from hoses, culverts, and sewage outfalls. A female manatee, called a cow, can give birth about once every 3 years. Gestation lasts about 12 months. At birth, West Indian manatees measure about 1.2 to 1.4 m (4 to 4.5 ft.) and weigh 27 to 32 kg (60 to 70 lbs.). A calf nurses from teats under the mother's pectoral flippers. Florida manatees are highly susceptible to cold; it's not unusual for them to die during extremely cold weather. But human activities pose a much greater threat to manatees. Each year, many Florida manatees are killed and injured by watercraft, the greatest human-induced cause of Florida manatee deaths. Other threats include entanglement, poaching, and habitat destruction. All manatees are threatened or endangered. They are protected by national and local legislation in every country in which they are found. Manatees are nonaggressive, nonterritorial herbivores that spend most of their time feeding (6 to 8 hours per day) and resting (2 to 12 hours per day). The remainder of their day is spent traveling, investigating objects, and socializing by interacting with other manatees. Marine zoological parks such as SeaWorld help conserve manatees. SeaWorld is authorized to rescue and rehabilitate ill, injured, or orphaned manatees. The first priority of the Manatee Rescue and Rehabilitation program is to return healthy manatees to their natural habitat. Manatees emit sounds under water. The chirps, whistles, or squeaks are probably produced in the larynx. They seem to make these sounds when they are frightened, sexually aroused, or interacting with each other. Manatees have well-developed eyes. In the water, they can detect objects from tens of meters away. A manatee's retinas contain both rod and cone cells, indicating that they probably have the ability to see both dim and bright light. Recent tests suggest manatees can distinguish between blue and green colors, although the full extent of their color vision is unknown and more studies are needed. For more information about manatees, explore the Manatee Info Book.\nEcology and Conservation\nAll species of sirenians are protected to some extent by national or local acts in every country they inhabit.\nFederal and state laws have been passed that protect Florida manatees. Federal laws prohibit hunting, capturing, killing, or harassing these animals. These laws include the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Penalties for breaking these federal laws could include a year in prison and a fine up to $20,000.\nThe Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act of 1978 is state legislation that allows the establishment of manatee sanctuaries in Florida.\nWest African manatees are protected under Class A of the African Convention of Nature and Natural Resources, signed by 38 African countries.\nAmazonian manatee hunting has been prohibited since 1973.\nThe Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is an international treaty developed in 1973 to regulate trade of wildlife items. All species of sirenians are protected by this treaty.\nBibliography\nNowak, R. M. and J. L. Paradiso. Walker's Mammals of the World.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Facts About Porpoises | Live Science", "url": "https://www.livescience.com/57712-porpoise-facts.html", "text": "Porpoises are members of the scientific order Cetacea and are related to dolphins, but the two animals are different species. They both have sleek bodies and large flippers. Both are considered brainy creatures and they both have a melon, a structure in the forehead that they use to produce sound waves for navigating their watery homes.\nHowever, porpoises and dolphins differ in several ways. For example, porpoises don't have elongated beaks like dolphins. Also, porpoises have triangular dorsal fins, while dolphins have curved or hook-shaped fins. The exception are finless porpoises. They don't have fins at all. Dolphins' teeth are cone-shaped, while porpoises' teeth are spade-shaped, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nSize\nPorpoises are also shorter than dolphins. They grow to 5 to 6.6 feet (1.5 to 2 meters) and weigh 110 to 265 lbs. (50 to 120 kilograms). In contrast, the bottlenose dolphin grows to around 8 feet (2.5 m) long and weighs between 440 to 660 lbs. (200 to 300 kg).\nHabitat\nThere are six species in three genera of porpoise. As their name implies, Gulf of California harbor porpoises are found around the northern part of the Gulf of California. Black porpoises, also known as Burmeister's porpoise, live off the coasts of eastern and western South America, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\nThe spectacled porpoise likes cold water and has been found all around the world in a zone just north of Antarctica. The common porpoise, or harbor porpoise, also likes cold water, but sticks to the east coast of North America, around southern Greenland, waters off the northern coasts of Scandinavia and off the coasts of Alaska and Japan.\nDall's porpoise sticks to the northern rim of the Pacific Ocean. Some finless porpoises can be found in the Yellow Sea between China and Korea, and around southern Japan, while others swim along the coasts of South Asia.\nSome porpoises don't just stay in the ocean. Some swim in rivers and channels, as well, and can handle both salt and fresh waters. For example, the finless porpoises live in coastal waters and rivers along the Indian Ocean and western Pacific Ocean.\nHabits\nMost porpoises are social animals. They live in groups called shoals that can have just a couple members to thousands, according to the Animal Diversity Web (ADW). Dall's porpoise, for example, lives in shoals with two to 20 members, while a harbor porpoise's shoal may have six to 100 members.\nDiet\nPorpoise diets vary, depending on species, but they mostly stick to fish, crustaceans, octopus and squid. They can also be big eaters. The harbor porpoise eats about 10 percent of its body weight each day, according to the National Wildlife Federation.\nOffspring\nThere isn't a lot known about porpoises in general, and there seems to be a particular lack of knowledge when it comes to the animal's reproductive habits. Since porpoises are mammals, they have live births. The females have a gestation period of 10 to 11 months and give birth to one young at a time. The young are called pups or calves.\nPups are weaned at seven to 24 months of age and are sexually mature around 2 to 8 years of age, depending on the species. Porpoises can live up to 23 years.\nThe vaquita porpoise (Image credit: Alejandro Robles)\nClassification/taxonomy\nHere is the taxonomy of porpoises, according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS):\nKingdom: Animalia Subkingdom: Bilateria Infrakingdom: Deuterostomia Phylum: Chordata Subphylum: Vertebrata Infraphylum: Gnathostomata Superclass: Tetrapoda Class: Mammalia Subclass: Theria Infraclass: Eutheria Order: Cetacea Suborder: Odontoceti Family: Phocoenidae Genera and species:\nNeophocaena phocaenoides (finless porpoise)\nPhocoena dioptrica (spectacled porpoise)\nPhocoena phocena (common porpoise, harbor porpoise)\nPhocoena sinus (Gulf of California harbor porpoise, Vaquita porpoise)\nPhocoena spinipinnis (black porpoise, Burmeister's porpoise)\nPhocoenoides dalli (Dall's porpoise, True's porpoise)\nConservation status\nThe only porpoise that is listed as endangered by the IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species is the Vaquita porpoise. The Vaquita porpoise is listed as critically endangered because the population is believed to be decreasing, though specific population counts are currently unknown.\nThe finless porpoise and the Indo-Pacific finless porpoise are listed as vulnerable. This is because their populations seem to be on the decline. Other species are listed as least concern or have no classification because there hasn't been enough data collected on the species.\nOther facts\nThe harbor porpoises' name is true to its habitat. They like to stay in water that is no deeper than 500 feet (152 m) along the coastline.\nFinless porpoises appear to be black, but they are actually grey with bits of blue.\nAdditional resources"}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Irrawaddy Dolphin - BioExpedition - Animal Facts and Information", "url": "https://www.bioexpedition.com/irrawaddy-dolphin/", "text": "Orcaella brevirostris\nIntroduction to Irrawaddy Dolphin\nOne of the notable things about the Irrawaddy Dolphin is that it has an appearance different from most species. They are noted for their flexible neck and the appearance of creases that are found at the back of the head. The Orca is closely related to them.\nClass Mammalia Order Cetacea Family Delphinidae Genus Orcaella Conservation status Vulnerable\nIrrawaddy Dolphin Description\nThe Irrawaddy Dolphin features a round head and they don\u2019t have a beak. They have a forehead that extends beyond the rest of the facial features. The color is dark \u2013 either blue or gray \u2013 and then they feature light gray on the belly. The dorsal fin is triangular with a round end, and it is small. They have flippers that are both wide and long. They can be from 70 to 108 inches long and they can weigh from 215 to 350 pounds.\nFemales tend to be smaller than the males. The males also have a larger dorsal fin than females so such features can help to distinguish the gender. The teeth are pointed and narrow like pegs. They have teeth found in the upper and lower jaws. They don\u2019t have two stomachs but instead they have one with three compartments. They don\u2019t have a cardiac sphincter.\nIrrawaddy Dolphin Distribution\nThere is a wide distribution for the Irrawaddy Dolphin. They are found in India around the Northeast and around the Philippines. They have been identified in the waters of the Indo-Pacific as well. These dolphins live in the shallow waters closer to the coastline. They are one of the few species that are known to be able to live in freshwater habitats.\nIrrawaddy Dolphin Behavior\nThe Irrawaddy Dolphin has to get air every minute to 2 \u00bd minutes so they are seen at the surface often. However, it is usually only the head that is seen. Rarely will they have their entire body out of the water. It is going to be a very rare occasion that you see one with the fluke out of the water. Since they don\u2019t come out of the water and into the air as other dolphins, they are deemed as being less active.\nThis species of dolphin lives in smaller pods than most of the species. They may have up to 6 members and some pods only have 2. They are still very social though and they create a very deep bond with the members of their pod. They are curious and they will look around at their surroundings when they come to the surface for air.\nIrrawaddy dolphin \u2013 Author: C. Berjeau\nIrrawaddy Dolphin Feeding\nCephalopods, fish, and crustaceans are the food sources for the Irrawaddy Dolphins. They take part in the process of spitting water and this could be a way for them to round up schools of fish since they have fewer members to gather food. There is still plenty of mystery though that surrounds this particular action. They also work with humans sometimes to gather food in the wild and that is really interesting to observe.\nSome fishermen are known to tape on the side of the boat to get the attention of the dolphins. Then they will swim in circles to gather up the schools of fish into one location. Once they do so there is enough turbulence for the fishermen to place their nets and to capture them. There are some fish that will be on the outer edges of the nets which the Irrawaddy Dolphins feed upon.\nIrrawaddy Dolphin Reproduction\nVery little information is known about the mating rituals of these dolphins. Since their pods are so small, it is believed they mix with other pods in order for breeding to occur. Mating may occur from December through June. The males are highly competitive with each other for mating rites. They will go to great efforts to be able to mate with as many females as they can.\nThe time it takes for the calf to be born ranges from 9 to 14 months depending on the location where the mother lives. The females will typically have a new calf every 3 year. The young remain with their mother until they are about 2 years of age and then they will be weaned and care for themselves. The young are introduced to food other than milk when they are about 6 months old. The average lifespan in the wild for the Irrawaddy Dolphin is 28 years.\nIrrawaddy dolphin \u2013 Author: C. Berjeau\nIrrawaddy Dolphin Conservation Status and Threats\nThey are considered to be a vulnerable dolphin species, with about 6,000 of them remaining in the wild today. There are conservation efforts in place to help them. The largest decline of them has been found in Thailand due to commercial fishing efforts. In some locations, fishing is off limits and in others the fishermen are asked to use safer equipment. They are also asked to carefully watch for dolphins so that they can be freed if they do get captured by accident.\nOne of the problems for the Irrawaddy Dolphin though as to do with the loss of habitat. The areas where they live have been widely used for mining, dams, and more. This has made it harder for them to move around to find food and to find mates. It has also increased stress levels for the dolphins. In some locations it is illegal to hunt them such as Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia.\nIrrawaddy Dolphin Related Articles\n(Visited 1,250 times, 1 visits today)"}

They are mammals, but are they actually whales? Read these killer whale facts for kids to find out \u2026\nThis article is part of our Arctic Animals series.\nKiller Whale Information For Kids\nThe killer whale is the largest member of the oceanic dolphin family, Delphinidae.\nDolphins (including the orca), sperm whales, beaked whales and porpoises are all members of a larger group of animals known as \u2018toothed whales\u2018.\nThis group is itself part of the group of animals known as \u2018whales\u2019 \u2013 or Cetacea, to give it its scientific name.\nThe Cetaceans\u2019 closet living relative is the hippopotamus!\nThe cooperative methods of hunting exhibited by killer whales have also earned them the nickname, \u2018Wolves of the Sea\u2019. Today, killer whales are most commonly called Orca.\nKiller Whale Markings\nKiller whales have a distinctive coloration, with black backs and fins, a lighter \u2018saddle patch\u2019 behind their dorsal fin, and white undersides. They also have white patches on their sides and behind their eyes.\nThe huge black dorsal fin is unmistakable. It can grow up to 1.8 m (almost 6 ft.) and its shape and condition can be used to identify individual killer whales in monitored populations.\nKiller Whale Size\nMale killer whales grow to around 8 m ( 26 ft.) in length and around 6 metric tonnes (6.6 short tones) in weight.\nFemales are smaller, growing to around 7m ( 23 ft.) in length and 4 tonnes in weight. Even baby killer whales can be 8 feet (2.5 meters) long and weigh as much as 400 pounds (180kg)!\nThere are bigger killer whales out there: specimens almost 32 feet (10 meters) long and weighing 7,500kg (16,500 pounds) have been recorded!\nWhere do Killer Whales Live?\nKiller whales can be found in all of the world\u2019s oceans, and inhabit both polar and tropical regions. They are the most widely distributed mammals after man. However, killer whales are most abundant in cold, temperate coastal areas.\nThe world population of Killer whales is estimated at around 50,000 animals.\nKiller whales live and hunt in groups called \u2018pods\u2019 which may be resident or migratory.\nKiller Whale Facts For Kids: What Do Killer Whales Eat?\nKiller whales like to feast on fish (including sharks), cephalopods (squid and octopus) as well as other marine mammals, and sometimes even turtles and seabirds.\nKiller whales are skilled hunters and use methods such as \u2018wave-hunting\u2019 to prey on seals. The Killer whales will \u2018spy-hop\u2019 to find seals resting on ice floes and then work together in groups to generate waves, disrupting the ice and causing the seal to slip into the water where the Killer whales can kill it.\nLike other dolphin species, Killer whales can use echolocation to hunt, producing sound waves that bounce off target objects or prey animals, letting the Killer whales know information such as the size or the animal and the distance to it.\nStudies have shown that resident populations tend to feast on fish whereas migratory ones prefer marine mammals.\nKiller Whale Video\nThe video below shows some amazing underwater views of killer whales. Skip to around 1:34 to get the best views!\nKiller Whale Families\nFemale Killer whales give birth to a single baby (calf) every 3 to 10 years after 17 months of pregnancy. The mothers will assist the baby in reaching the surface to breath within 10 seconds of birth.\nKiller whales are incredibly social animals and live in pods of up to 40 individuals, and adolescent females will assist mothers with their babies. Killer whales are also known to share food and protect sick or injured individuals.\nLike all dolphin species, Killer whales are excellent communicators, and each pod has distinctive noises (\u2018accents\u2019) that are recognized by members. In the wild, female Killer whales can live as long as 80 years, and males 50-60 years.\nThreats to Killer Whales\nKiller whales are listed as \u2018data deficient\u2019 on the IUCN Red List. Killer whales are not extensively hunted by humans, but have long been captured to be kept in captivity. Due to their incredible intelligence, Killer whales can be trained to do amazing tricks. However, conditions in captivity are not well suited to such large, social animals and captive Killer whales tend to die a lot younger than those in the wild. Killer whales are also sensitive to over-fishing and offshore energy activities such as oil exploration and construction of wind farms.\nSeveral charities are dedicated to whale and dolphin conservation, one of which is Whale and Dolphin Conservation.\n10 Killer Whale Facts For Kids\nKiller whales are actually dolphins. The dorsal fin of males can be nearly 2 meters (ft) tall. Killer whales \u2018speak\u2019 to each other using distinct clicks and whistles. The teeth of Killer whales can be up to 3 inches long, and some even longer. Killer whales can dive as deep as 30 meters during hunting. Killer whales can swim in bursts at up to 30 mph (48hm/h). Newborn calves can swim within 30 minutes of birth. White patches above the eyes can often by mistaken for the eyes. Killer whale distribution is seasonally limited by pack ice. The scientific name for Killer whales is Orcinus orca. Orcus was a mythological Roman god of the netherworld with a fierce reputation, and Orca means \u2018the shape of a barrel or cask\u2019 in Latin.\nWant to learn about more amazing animals?

There are several known subspecies though that are found as well. The fact that they are very similar to other dolphins but they don\u2019t need saltwater is interesting to explore.\nClass Mammalia Order Cetacea Suborder Odontoceti Superfamily Platanistoidea\nRiver Dolphins Description\nThe size of a River Dolphin varies significantly depending on where they live. Some of them are up to 8 feet long but most of them are quite a bit smaller than that. They are one of the rare types of dolphins that feature a variety of colors. They can be yellow, pink, black, gray, brown, or white. Many people don\u2019t realize it is a dolphin they have seen in the river due to the colors as they assume all dolphins are blue or gray.\nRiver Dolphins Distribution\nThere are quite a few known rivers out there where these dolphins call home. They tend to stay in areas though that offer them coastal access and that are brackish. The following rivers have them- Mekong, Yangtze, Indus, Amazon, and Ganges. The locations are dense and often surrounded by the poor villagers.\nThese aren\u2019t clean rivers though most of the time, often filled with water that is dark and very murky. The level of pollution is quite high so it is amazing that River Dolphins are able to do well in it. Other species of dolphins continually have huge issues due to pollution. This is just one more of the many mysteries surrounding these dolphins that needs further evaluation.\nRiver Dolphins Behavior\nThey are very social dolphins, and they live in groups that are called pods. There can be a handful or more than 100 River Dolphins in a single pod. They form bonds that are deep and they seem very protective of the members. They keep the young and the juveniles at the center of the pod for additional safety. The females also work together to care for the young instead of only caring for their own. The hierarchy is very complex within the pods of the River Dolphins. Some of them seem to have mainly males or mainly females in them.\nAmazon River Dolphin \u2013 Photo taken by Jorge Andrade\nRiver Dolphins Feeding\nEating a variety of fish is the main source of food for these dolphins. They can consume very large amounts of food on a daily basis. They hunt for food as a collective effort with many pod members using echolocation and cooperation to successfully surround the fish and to be able to dive in for a meal.\nRiver Dolphins Reproduction\nMating times significantly vary based on where the River Dolphins live. The females mate when they are around 8 years old and for the males it is about 10 years of age. The males are very competitive and do all they can to be the selected one to mate with a female. After mating occurs, it can be from 10 to 12 months when the young calf arrives.\nThe young will consume milk from the mother for a period of time that ranges from 1 \u00bd to 2 years. They will also start to eat fish when they are about 6 months old. While the mother is giving birth, other females will surround her to comfort her and offer protection. They also help the new arrival to reach the surface for air. The bonding that occurs here is amazing to observe.\nRiver Dolphins Conservation Status and Threats\nThe current status of the River Dolphin is from vulnerable to critically endangered. The fact that it is so hard to get a good count of them makes it impossible to know how many of them are in the wild. They can be very spread out and the waters are very dark. While they can live in locations with pollution, it is still believed to be a factor for their deaths. Efforts to clean up the water aren\u2019t really possible in these poor regions where even the people around the water in surrounding villages have very poor living conditions.\nFishing nets are also a problem for these dolphins as they can easily get tangled up in them. Even if they aren\u2019t injured, they could end up drowning. Hunting these dolphins for meat that villagers eat happens on a regular basis. Too many fishing nets in the water is also a concern as it means these dolphins find it harder and harder to get enough food for their own survival.\nAs a result, the Baiji River Dolphin has been considered functionally extinct since late 2006. They were last seen in the wild in 2004. There were some reports of them in 2007 but nothing that could be substantiated and confirmed. Many believe that if efforts aren\u2019t continued to help the River Dolphins then there is going to be more of the subspecies that see the same fate.\nRiver Dolphin Related Articles\n(Visited 329 times, 1 visits today)"}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Otter Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Otter-facts.html", "text": "otter Facts\nPortrait of a River Otter\nThe coolest of all otter facts is that they use tools to crack open the shells of crabs and clams. Furry, playful and very, very smart, otters are beloved for their adorable antics and sweet appearance. Otters regularly engage in many activities that appear to be positively precious, for instance, sea otters may hold eachothers hand to keep from floating away from eachother.\nThey will also wrap themselves in seaweed for the same reason. And river otters love to play on slippery rocks or ideally, snow banks, which they will body-surf down the length of, running back up to the top to do it all again. Their antics appear on memes, go viral, and can definitely make you smile, but looks can be deceiving.\nOtters are members of the mustilid, or weasel family which includes skunks, wolverines and the honey badger, an animal considered to be one of the toughest creatures on Earth.\nOtters are tough as nails too, and well known by zoo curators and wildlife specialists to be dangerous to handle. They are true carnivores, and have powerful jaws that can crack open clam shells with large, curved canine teeth for snagging salmon. Sea otters even have retractable claws on their front feet, which keeps them particularly sharp.\nThere are 12 species of otters, (13 until the Japanese river otter was declared extinct in only 2012), found all over the world except Australia and Antarctica.\nSome are almost exclusively aquatic, like the sea otters that live in the Pacific ocean, and some spend more than half their time on land, like the giant otter that lives in the tropical rain-forests of South America. They all eat fish, clams, lobsters and small animals occurring along the shore. Giant otters regularly feed on piranha, and have also been known to take down alligators.\nsea otter\nThe smallest otter species is the oriental or Asian small-clawed otter, a beautiful, expressive little otter that doesn't weigh much more than 10 pounds or so. Small-clawed otters live in family groups of 6 to 12 individuals. They have, as the name suggests, small nails on their paws that are shorter than the length of the digits. They are found in wetlands and along lake and river banks throughout the south of Asia, but their numbers are dwindling as habitat is lost.\nThe European otter, also known as the Eurasian otter, or the common otter, has the widest range of all otter species. They tend to be more adaptable than other otter species, and can survive on a large assortment of foods from fish to crab to muskrats and young beavers. They can be found throughout all of Europe, many areas of Asia, and some territories in northern Africa too. These otters are basically solitary, and very territorial. They are active both day and night hunting both in and out of the water.\nThe giant otter is the longest of the otters, sometimes reaching 7 feet from nose to tail, and weighing up to 85 pounds, but sea otters are much stouter and large male sea otters in particular are bulkier and heavier than giant otters. Giant otters are the most social of the otter species and have a lifestyle that is somewhat similar to wolves in that the group has an Alpha pair that are the only members who mate and reproduce. They also hunt in packs like wolves and have been known to kill and eat caiman, monkeys and anacondas, but fish is their main meal.\nThe North American river otter is a medium sized otter about 3 to 4 feet long from nose to tail and weighing up to 40 pounds. They usually live in small groups, but may be solitary as well. These otters eat a variety of fish, invertebrates and small mammals including the occasional rabbit. They are notorious for body surfing down snowy hills.\nThe sea otter is the heaviest of the otter species with large males weighing as much as 100 pounds. They are marine mammals, existing almost exclusively in the Pacific Ocean, and rarely coming ashore. They float on their backs with their feet out of the water, and dine on shellfish while using their bellies as plates.\nSea otters use rocks obtained from the ocean floor as little anvils they can crack clams open with. This tool use involves the selection of a suitable rock, and the storing of it in the loose skin under the forelimbs. Storing the tool while diving or resting is particularly intriguing evidence of intelligence, suggesting a bit of long term planning - very smart!\nriver otter facts\nRiver otters are long-bodied, well-muscled animals, with relatively short legs, five webbed toes on all four feet, (most carnivores have 4 toes on the rear foot), and a long flat tail used as a rudder in the water. The head is broad and somewhat flat with small ears and a powerful, well defined muzzle framed by very long, highly sensitive whiskers, called vibrissae.\nThe river otter is agile in water and on land, in fact there are two different names for a group of otters - a raft of otters if they are in the water, and a romp of otters if they are on land. They swim using their webbed paws as flippers, and for added speed they will undulate the torso like a dolphin. On land they use a rolling gait like a horses canter, or hop-like movements. They can climb rocky areas and steep shorelines fairly well, and they will regularly slide down appropriate surfaces as a happy short cut.\nAlthough some species of river otters are solitary, most are social, playing, sleeping, and sometimes even hunting together. They require a permanent water source and maintain territories of a few square miles revolving around a lake or river. Some species are very territorial and mark the perimeter of their territory with piles of scat, called spraint.\nMany of the river otter species look alike with medium brown fur and similar shaped heads and faces. The giant otters however, are fairly distinctive, with noticeably darker fur that looks almost black when wet, and a unique, round head shape. The muzzle is much more blunted, and the eyes sometimes have a bulging appearance. The giant otter has an unusual nose as well, because it is furred and looks almost like the nose of a monkey.\nAll river otters are designed for semi-aquatic life. Most have webbed toes, but all have incredibly dense fur that has water-shedding qualities, and is still used to make coats, boot and glove linings, and hats.\nMost river otter species are in danger because of their need for a specific habitat. As human encroachment increases, they may all suffer the fate of the recently extinct Japanese river otter. Once numerous, but last seen in the wild in 1979, the Japanese river otter was officially declared extinct in 2012 by the Japanese Ministry of Environment.\nriver otter lifestyle\nRiver otters spend equal amounts of time on land and water, and will build a den, called a holt, on the banks, or sometimes in the middle of their lake or stream. Holts may be a burrow, dug directly into the ground, with several entrances, and exits both underwater and on land, or converted beaver dens that otters may add their own flair to. Some holts are caves or stone outcroppings that the otters will partially enclose with a collection of sticks.\nDepending on what food is available, otters may forage across a territory of several square miles, eating any small animals within their grasp, from baby bunnies, to insects and grubs, to frogs, snakes and turtles. They will often forage alone, but sometimes hunt in groups, and have been known to attack animals larger than themselves if the numbers are on their side. This was discovered by the Bronx zoo recently, when a group of otters swarmed on a monkey that was being housed in the same exhibit. The otters worked as one swift and merciless unit, and displayed a bit of frenzy behavior.\nGiant river otters are the most social of the species, and display the most organized cooperative lifestyle. They live in a pack-like community, with an Alpha pair, their offspring, and assorted relatives, and go out hunting as a group, taking down animals like small deer and rabbits, but also dangerous stuff like anacondas and caiman.\nRiver otters are extremely playful and engage in lots of social bonding, mutual grooming, wrestling and snuggling. The whole family may take part in the rearing of young. Most river otter species are generally monogamous and they may even mate for life.\nFemales give birth to 2 to 6 babies called pups, that are well-furred, but otherwise helpless with closed eyes and ears. They stay in the den with their mother for several weeks, during which time she may be brought food by family members, and some trusted assistants may even babysit while the mother goes out for a bit of fresh air.\nThe pups eyes will open at about 4 weeks, and they will begin venturing out of the den at 6 to 10 weeks. River otter mothers have been known to push or drop their youngsters in the water to teach them to swim, which comes naturally of course. Most baby otters are fishing on their own by about 4 months, but they will stay with mom for at least a year.\nSome young otters will remain with their romp for life, others will head out on their own when they are between 1 and 4 years old to establish a territory.\nSea otter facts\nThere is one species of sea otter and three subspecies, the California or Southern sea otter is found off the central coast of California, the Northern sea otter is found in the waters off Alaska and Canada, and the common or Asian sea otter is found along coastlines of Japan and Russia.\nAlthough giant otters can be quite a bit longer, sea otters are far bulkier, heavier and ultimately largest species of otter. They are actually the largest member of the weasel, or mustelid family, but they are considered the smallest marine mammal. They can spend almost their entire lives in ocean waters, rarely coming onshore. They sleep, eat, mate and give birth in the water.\nSea otters don't venture far from shore, and spend their days diving to the ocean floor to scrounge up any number of different sea creatures. They prefer clams, mollusks and crab, using their muzzle full of sensitive whiskers and their dexterous, retractable claws to search through coral and kelp.\nThey take dives an average of 90 seconds long, but can stay under for over 4 minutes. They can store a few food items and rocks in the loose skin under their forelimbs that form pseudo-pouches, tucking away as many as a dozen clams or other small items.\nWhen they surface, they float on their backs and use their belly as a lunch counter. They empty their pouches and pile their clams and crawfish on their chest, pull out a rock they picked out of the sediment, and proceed to grasp each shellfish with their front paws, bashing it against the rock to open it.\nSea otters are perfectly designed for life in chilly, sometimes frigid water, and they exist in some of the coldest regions of the world, spending over 90% of their lives in the desperately cold ocean. They have the densest, basically warmest fur of any mammal, including their relative the mink, but the fur must be kept meticulously clean in order to do its job.\nThe one-million-hairs-per-square-inch coat keeps them warm with its own thickness, but also serves to trap a layer of air between it and the otters skin, acting like a puffed-up parka and a life jacket at the same time. The insulation only works if the fur is clean, straight and free of any foreign material so the otter spends about 1/3 of its life grooming, but its a matter of life and death. If the fur gets dirty, the otter won't float, and will loose body heat. A sea otter that has been soiled in an oil spill will die without intervention.\nThis incredible fur almost led to the near extinction of the sea otter, which was hunted down to only a few colonies. Fortunately, Russia, Japan, Canada and the U.S. signed a treaty to ban the hunting of sea otters and fur seals in 1911, and the recovery of the species has been, for the most part, a success.\nSea otters are a little like seals in that they may be found in very large groups, floating in the water in what is called a \"raft of otters\", but don't have particularly close relationships, or friendships.\nsea otter eating clam diner\nsea otter reproduction\nMale and female sea otters generally live in separate groups and come together during mating. Dominant male sea otters claim territories and defend them from younger, older, or less aggressive males. The dominant males will mate with all the females in their territory, and sometimes try to steal or lure females away from other males.\nMating itself is often forced on females. Male otters will bite and hold females by the face or nose in order to mate with them, and researchers actually identify some female sea otters by the scars they have received from violent males.\nThe female is pregnant for about 4 months and gives birth in the water. Baby sea otters are born quite precocious, or well-developed. They are fully furred have eyes and ears open and are fairly active shortly after birth. The babies fur is a different texture from the adult coat, and the mother pays special attention to grooming the newborn, pulling the fur away from the body and fluffing it out.\nThe fluffy baby fur is designed to trap air, and once fully groomed by the mother, the newborn baby otter will actually float on the surface of the water, essentially unable to drown, but also unable to swim or dive. The mother will leave the baby on the surface while she dives for food, often safely tucked in a bed of floating kelp. Some mother sea otters have also been observed hoisting their babies up on boat decks or docks to rest while they dive.\nIt takes 12 to 14 weeks for the adult fur to grow in, the last 2 to 3 weeks of which time the baby slowly loses its extreme buoyancy, and begins to experiment with diving and foraging itself.\nThe sea otters unique feeding style and fascinating tool use are passed down from mother to baby. Babies are taught to choose stones from the ocean floor that are the appropriate size - large enough to be used as an anvil, small enough to be tucked under the arm and carried to the surface. Otters may also use stones at the ocean floor to knock abalone and other crustaceans free from coral beds.\nMothers teach babies the proper selection of food items as well, and will even hunt and forage in areas with smaller creatures that the baby can manipulate, even though the mother otter would prefer larger prey.\nTool use in sea otters extends beyond stones. They use kelp to prevent themselves and their babies from drifting in the currents, and they also wrap crabs up in kelp to keep them from escaping.\nAll of these behaviors are passed down from mother to baby, and different uses and preferences for tools can be seen among different populations. It takes a long time to teach all this to a baby otter, and they don't have all the knowledge they need to survive until they are 6 to 8 months old.\nsea otter mother and baby\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

The primary injuries are usually to the muzzle and nose of the female, which the male will bite and hold onto. The nosepad, in some cases, is bitten off, or left hanging, and death may result from that injury, or injuries to the head and neck.\nIn some reports it is suspected that up to 15% of all female otter deaths are the result of injuries sustained during mating. Is the sea otter lifestyle a culture of rape? Well mating is designed to increase the population, not reduce it, and from the male otters standpoint, what would the advantage of killing a female who might otherwise bear your legacy?\nThis behavior has been a part of their existence since as long as they have been studied by naturalists, and does not seem to be leaving the gene pool, although it would seem that less violent males should be reproducing at a higher rate.\nsea otters, interspecies rape and necrophilia\nSo we learned that the cuddliest of creatures, the sea otter, has a violent sex-life, but it gets worse.\nMale sea otters sometimes look outside their own species to inflict themselves on other animals. Reports, eye-witness verification, scientific studies and photographic and video evidence all substantiate numerous cases of male sea otters raping baby seals. This is not a new phenomenon, the evidence has been around for decades.\nIn these cases, actual penetration occurs, either anal or vaginal, and has caused serious and fatal injury. Sometimes the otters deliberately cause the death of the seal by drowning or repeated bites. There are reports that similar attacks have been committed on seabirds like cormorants, and even one case believed to be quite legitimate, of a dog being the victim.\nInterspecies sexual relations are not uncommon, and hybrid animals are the result - like mules or ligers, but a degree of consent is generally required.\nTake this one step further to reports that if the baby seal dies during the attack, the sea otter will keep the body and continue to copulate with it for up to a week after the death.\nAttacks like this occur generally within the California sea otter population. In one two year period between 2000 and 2002, 19 separate sexual interactions were recorded between male sea otters and immature seals in Monterey Bay alone. None have been reported among Alaskan sea otters.\nIn the case of the dog attack, the otter was seen swimming about with the dead dog grasped between its front limbs, all the while copulating with it, as other dogs on shore barked and whined.\nThe explanation may lie in the fact that otters are polygynous, meaning only a few dominant males mate with the majority of females, leaving allot of frustrated boys to do what they may do. But plenty of animals are sexually frustrated without committing rape and necrophilia.\nThe activity that most closely resembles this is within another polygynous species, the fur seal, attempting to rape king penguins in Antarctica, but this is activity that has been observed only recently, and there are no reports of the seals keeping and engaging with dead bodies for any length of time.\nLike the fairly regular damaging and killing of female otters during violent sexual encounters, it seems like an enormous biological investment on the part of these male sea otters, for something that completely fails to advance the species.\nWell, we humans might know a little bit about that.\na few more otter facts\nGiant otters eat piranhas\nRiver otters love to body surf in the snow\nMother sea otters wrap their babies in kelp or seaweed while they dive\nOtter poop has its own special name - \"spraint\"\nThe sea otter has the densest coat of any mammal\nSea otter fur has one million individual hairs per square inch\nSea otters use rocks as tools to break open clams and crab shells\nThe sea otter is the smallest marine mammal\nFisherman in Bangladesh used trained otters to help them net the catch of the day\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Rodentia\nFamily Castoridae\nGenus Castor\nSpecies canadensis,\nOtter - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT boar, dog sow, bitch pup, kit, cub loose groups GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD bevy,romp worldwide river, ocean fish, clams\nRIVER OTTER TOP SPEED, AVERAGE SIZE etc. 16 mph 20-40 pounds 30-46 inches birth on land RAISED # OF YOUNG AT BIRTH INDEPENDENT mother 3-5 average blind, helpless 1 year SEA OTTER AVG TOP SPEED, AVERAGE SIZE etc. 6 mph 45-75 pounds 40-52 inches birth in water RAISED # OF YOUNG AT BIRTH INDEPENDENT mother 1 rarely 2 blind, helpless 8 months"}

T he distinctive coloration of killer whales is a type of camouflage known as disruptive coloration, in which the color pattern of an animal contradicts the animal's body shape. In the flickering, filtered sunlight of the sea, other animals may not recognize a killer whale as a potential predator. Killer whales live in groups called pods. A pod may have less than 5 to about 30 individuals: a mix of males, females, and calves of varying ages. Sometimes, several smaller pods join together to form larger herds of 50 or more whales. A female-dominant social hierarchy exists within a group of killer whales. The animals may rank and establish themselves within the hierarchy by behaviors such as tail-slapping, head-butting, jaw-snapping, biting, tooth-raking and various other postures and gestures. Killer whales are apex or top predators in the ocean. Known as \"wolves of the sea,\" killer whales often hunt cooperatively in pods for food; working together to encircle and herd prey into a small area before attacking. When hunting a large whale, a pod of killer whales may attack the whale from several angles. They may also slide out onto sandbars or ice floes in pursuit of prey and are capable of hitting ice floes from below to knock prey into the water. A recent survey of killer whales off the coast of New Zealand documented that 23% of males had bent dorsal fins. Killer whales are among the fastest swimming marine mammals. They can swim as fast as 48 kph (30 mph), but they usually cruise at much slower speeds, about 3 to 10 kph (2 to 6 mph). For more information about killer whales, explore the Killer Whale Info Book\nEcology and Conservation\nAlthough the worldwide population of killer whales is unknown, we do know that killer whales are not endangered (with the notable exception of the Southern Resident DPS \u2013 see Status). In some areas of the Antarctic alone their numbers have been estimated at about 180,000. Researchers can identify individual killer whales by taking pictures of dorsal fins, noting differences in shape, relative size, and scars. As with other marine mammals, the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 protects killer whales.\nBibliography\nJefferson, T.J. Leatherwood, S. and M.A. Webber. FAO Species Identification Guide.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Facts about orcas (killer whales) - Whale and Dolphin Conservation", "url": "https://uk.whales.org/whales-dolphins/facts-about-orcas/", "text": "Why are orcas called 'killer whales' when they are dolphins?\nDolphins and whales are closely related. Orcas were given the name \u2018killer whale\u2019 by ancient sailors\u2019 observations of groups of orcas hunting and preying on larger whale species. They called orcas asesina ballenas, or \u2018whale killer\u2019 \u2013 a term that was eventually flipped around to the easier \u2018killer whale\u2019. Their Latin name, Orcinus orca, also reflects this observation of orcas feeding on large whales. Orcinus translates to \u2018of the kingdom of the dead,\u2019 and orca refers to a kind of whale. We know that orcas are top predators, yes, but not the vicious \u2018whale killers\u2019 that the ancient mariners thought them to be. If you could give orcas another name, what would you call them?\nWhat do orcas eat?\nLooking at all populations, orcas are generalist eaters, consuming fish, seals and sea lions, dolphins and porpoises, sharks and rays, large whales, cephalopods (octopods and squids), seabirds and more. However, some orcas specialise on specific prey, and it turns out orcas are picky eaters! Once they\u2019ve learned what their family eats, they aren\u2019t likely to switch diets.\nHow do orcas sleep?\nOrcas sleep in a very different way to humans. We have a breathing reflex and when we sleep or become unconscious, we continue to breath automatically. Orcas cannot sleep in this way, they have to remain conscious, even when they are sleeping! This is because their breathing is not automatic - they have to actively decide when to breath, and so they must be conscious even when sleeping. If like us, orcas went into a deep unconscious sleep, they would stop breathing and suffocate or drown.\nTo get around this, orcas only allow one half of their brains to sleep at a time; the other half stays alert enabling them to continue breathing whilst looking out for dangers in the environment. They only close one eye when they sleep; the left eye will be closed when the right half of the brain sleeps, and vice versa. This type of sleep is known as unihemispheric sleep as only one brain hemisphere sleeps at a time. Orcas periodically alternate which side is sleeping so that they can get the rest they need without ever losing consciousness. When sleeping, orcas swim very slowly and steadily, close to the surface.\nHow do orcas communicate?\nIn orca populations, knowledge is passed down to younger individuals from their elders \u2013 what to eat and were to find it, how to catch it, who to avoid, vocalisations and calls unique to pods and family groups, and the distinct \u2018accent\u2019 of the population."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Bottlenose Dolphin - Facts and Beyond | Biology Dictionary", "url": "https://biologydictionary.net/bottlenose-dolphin/", "text": "Kingdom Animalia Phylum Chordata Class Mammalia Order Cetacea Family Delphinidae Genus Tursiops Species Tursiops truncatus and Tursiops aduncus Length 10 \u2013 12.5 feet ( 3 \u2013 3.8 meters) Weight Up to 1.400 feet (640 kg) Lifespan 45 \u2013 50 Social Structure Social, live in large pods Status Least Concern Habitat Tropica oceans and other warm waters Average litter size 1 Main food item Fish, squid, crustaceans Main predators Humans and Sharks\nThe Basics\nThe bottlenose dolphin is a marine mammal belonging to the order Cetacea. There are two species; the common bottlenose, or Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus). These species are the most commonly observed dolphins in the wild and are found in almost every sea and ocean, except for the colder waters of the North and South poles.\nCommon bottlenose dolphins are relatively large, reaching up to 12.5 feet ( 4 m) in length and weighing up to 1400 pounds (640 kg). They can live for 40 \u2013 60 years in the wild. These dolphins are mostly dark grey but they have a lighter belly. This type of coloration, called counter-shading, helps to conceal them from predators. Their body is extremely streamlined which helps them to move quickly through the water and they also have a short, blunt snout which is where they get the name \u2018bottlenose\u2019 from.\nSome bottlenose dolphins live in coastal areas while others are found in deeper water and spend their lives in the open ocean. Coastal populations are found in a wide range of habitats including seagrass beds, bays, estuaries, and beaches, and are more territorial than their oceanic counterparts. Oceanic populations, on the other hand, are migratory, moving from place to place. These dolphins can be found in small groups or pods of 2 \u2013 15 animals, or in large groups that can have as many as 1,000 individuals. Oceanic populations are normally much larger than the coastal populations.\nBottlenose dolphins eat a variety of food including several species of fish, squid, and shrimp, consuming between 13 and 15 pounds ( 6 \u2013 7 kg) of food a day! They are extremely intelligent and will often hunt in pods, encircling large schools of fish and taking turns to swim into the middle to eat. They also have two stomachs! One stomach is used to store food while the other digests it.\nBottlenose dolphins are also very social and playful animals. They have been shown to form friendships that last decades. They will often be found surfing in the waves and wakes of boats as well as swimming through self-made bubble rings.\nThese dolphins reach sexual maturity between 5 and 14 years of age and some individuals are known to breed for their entire life, which is fairly rare amongst mammals. Like the majority of mammals, females give birth to live young after a 12-month gestation period. One calf is born every 3 to 6 years. The young are born tail first and can swim from the moment they are born. However, they are dependant on their mothers for much longer, with some mothers nursing their young for up to two years.\nThreats to Bottlenose Dolphins\nThe common bottlenose dolphin is the most commonly-held species of cetacean in captivity and hundreds are held in zoos and marine parks around the world. The conditions in these captive environments are a far cry from their natural habitat, offering very little in the way of mental stimulation. Fortunately, some people have started to recognize the detrimental effects that captivity has on these animals and many countries are phasing out the capture and retention of these animals for entertainment.\nTheir main threats in the wild come from sharks and humans. Sharks are known to attack bottlenose dolphins and will try to take the juveniles as prey if they can. Humans pose a greater threat, as bottlenose dolphins can accidentally become entangled in fishing gear which can result in their death. Pollution in the water, as a result of agricultural runoff, can also cause problems, especially for juvenile dolphins that receive high levels of contaminants in their mother\u2019s milk. Pollution can also result in algal blooms which have been linked to dolphin deaths in coastal regions.\nFun Facts about the Bottlenose Dolphin!\nBottlenose dolphins are the most famous of the dolphin species. These social animals are highly intelligent and quick learners. They have demonstrated the ability to solve problems, have self-awareness, and show feelings such as joy and grief. These amazing animals can be found in coastal regions, as well as out at sea, and have several biological adaptations that make them suited for their environment. Let\u2019s take a closer look!\nPorpoising\nOne quirky adaptation that bottlenose dolphins use is called porpoising. This is when dolphins swim so fast that they come up through the surface of the water, emerging briefly before they go back down again. Bottlenose dolphins tend to use this move several times in a row. This singular, gliding motion isn\u2019t used by the dolphins just for fun, it actually enables them to conserve energy while swimming fast!\nQuite a few animals swim using this wave-like motion and there is the belief that it not only conserves energy but can be used to confuse predators. Some animals that can be found porpoising include penguins, sea otters, auks, and other seabirds.\nThe Bottlenose Dolphins is an Excellent Swimmer!\nDolphins are some of the fastest and agile swimmers in the animal kingdom. Bottlenose dolphins are known to reach speeds over 18 mph and they can leap up to 20 feet out of the water. This adaptation helps them to effectively escape from predators and is also a useful hunting skill.\nHow dolphins reach such speeds was a question that puzzled researchers for a long time but recent studies have shown that their power is all in their tail! A dolphin\u2019s tail, known as a fluke, is very muscular and provides enough thrust to power a dolphin through the water at amazing speeds.\nDolphins aren\u2019t the only animal that use their tails to help them move quickly. Crocodiles also have a strong, muscular tail that helps to propel them quickly through the water. Crocodiles can actually move faster than dolphins, reaching speeds of up to 20 mph!\nCommunication and Echolocation\nA Unique Whistle\nDolphins rely on sound to navigate their way around their ocean habitat and to communicate, hunt and avoid predators. Scientists have discovered that bottlenose dolphins can identify themselves with a signature whistle. The dolphins can use these signature whistles to identify themselves to other dolphins, sometimes over long distances so that they can be located. It is also thought they use these whistles in social interactions.\nA mother dolphin will also use this whistle to help her calf identify her. After birth, the mother may whistle to her calf for several days so that it learns to recognize its mother\u2019s call. The calf develops its own unique whistle soon after birth, with some developing it when they are just one month old!\nEcholocation\nDolphins also use sound to echolocate. The dolphins project high-frequency sound waves, produced by making clicking sounds, and listen for the echos. They can then interpret this echo to locate an object or prey item. Sound waves travel much faster through water than they do through air, making this an effective location tool.\nThe sequences of clicks that the dolphin produces pass through the melon \u2013 a key organ that is found in their forehead and is formed from adipose tissue. This organ focuses and modulates these outgoing sound waves. The sound waves are projected like a beam in the water in front of the animal. These sound waves then bounce off of the first object that they reach and return to the dolphin as an echo which can then be interpreted. Echolocation can inform the dolphin of the size, shape, speed, distance, and location of the object the sound bounces off.\nBats, shrews, and other species belonging to the dolphin and whale families use echolocation to navigate. The best echolocation abilities belong to the narwhal, thanks to its distinctive horn.\nAmazing Eyesight\nWhile dolphins often use echolocation to hunt for prey, they also have amazing eyesight. Their eyes are located laterally, with one on either side of their head, which enables them to get a good view to the front, back, and to the side of their body. Their eyes are capable of functioning independently which enables them to keep an eye on their environment in all directions simultaneously.\nThe lenses in a dolphin\u2019s eye are also able to change shape, depending on whether they are above or under the water. This means that they can see almost as well when their heads are above the surface as they see under it.\nBottlenose dolphins are also extremely sensitive to blue light. This means that they have great vision at depth and in low-light conditions, helping them to see their prey when they dive to deeper depths. Dolphins do however lack the cones that enable color vision in other animals, so it is like that they are color blind."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphin Facts - IDW", "url": "https://idw.org/dolphinfacts.htm", "text": "Facts about Dolphins\nQUESTION ANSWER\nHow dangerous is it to swim with dolphins? From video films, dolphins in the Moray Firth certainly appeared to be attacking porpoises which may reveal a previously unsuspected dark side to their nature. However, to date, no incidents have been reported of dolphins deliberately attacking people. Indeed the opposite is the case. There have been innumerable reports of dolphins saving people.\nNonetheless all those who swim with dolphins should be aware of the possible dangers. Dolphins can become extremely boisterous when playing with one another, and if a human joins in their games he/she may get injured.\nHow do dolphins sleep? Dolphins have to be conscious to breath. This means that they cannot go into a full deep sleep, because then they would suffocate. Dolphins have \"solved\" that by letting one half of their brain sleep at a time. Dolphins sleep about 8 hours a day in this fashion. REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, usually associated with dreaming has been recorded only very rarely. Some scientists claim dolphins do not have REM sleep at all. A dolphin's behaviour when sleeping/resting depends on the circumstances and possibly on individual preferences. They can either: - swim slowly and surface every now and then for a breath - rest at the surface with their blowhole exposed - rest on the bottom (in shallow water) and rise to the surface every now and then to breath.\nHow intelligent are dolphins? The short answer to this is that we do not know. There is no reliable method to measure intelligence in humans across cultures, so it is not surprising that comparing humans, dolphins, apes, dogs, etc. is impossible. There are some indications of their potential: they are fast learners and can generalise (which is also true of pigs). Also they can learn to understand complicated language-like commands (which is also true of the great apes). Dolphins have brains as large as humans and have had them for millions of years longer than us. Many scientists agree that if they were not using their brains during this long evolutionary period, dolphins\u2019 brains would have atrophied. Humans have used their brains to change their lifestyle and in doing so have changed the planet. In contrast, dolphins are in total harmony with their environment and probably use their brains to appreciate and enjoy their surroundings. This, some animal behaviourists argue, could make them more intelligent than us - but in a completely different way.\nHow do dolphins communicate and do they have their own language? Dolphins communicate mainly by means of sounds. These sounds include whistles, but also so-called pulsed sounds, which are often described as squawks, barks, rasps, etc. But they also use breaching (jumping and falling back into the water with a loud splash) and pectoral fin (or flipper) and tail (or fluke) slaps (hitting the flipper or fluke on the water surface). Body posturing and jaw popping also have a role in communication. As for language, we do not know if they have one. Several studies have demonstrated that dolphins can understand a structured language like ours. This same has been demonstrated for a number of other animal species as well (gorilla, bonobo, California sea lion, parrot). Some studies also indicate that dolphin vocalisations are complex enough to support some form of language. However, to date it has not been demonstrated yet that they can undoubtedly communicate among themselves. On the basis that dolphins have large brains and their primary sense is acoustic, Dr. Horace Dobbs has speculated that dolphins send holographic sound images to one another. In his series of books about a fictional dolphin named Dilo, author Horace Dobbs refers to Dilo\u2019s Magic Sound. Thus, when Dilo\u2019s Mother investigates a lobster with her sonar, she mimics the echo when informing her offspring about the lobster. In this way she can pass real information instead of using words, which are an abstraction. Thus Dr. Dobbs argues that dolphins have gone beyond language and could be far more advanced than humans when it comes to sonic communication.\nHow does dolphin sonar work? Dolphins (and other toothed whales) can produce high-pitched clicks. When these clicks hit an object, some of the sound will echo back to the \"sender\". By listening to the echo and interpreting the time it took before the echo came back, the dolphin estimate the distance of the object. (That's why sonar is also called echo-location: with information from the echoes, a dolphin can locate an object). Depending on the material the object is made of, part of the sound may penetrate into the object and reflect off internal structure. If the object is a fish, some sound will reflect off the skin, some off the bones and internal organs. So one click can result in a number of (weaker) echoes. This will give the dolphin some information about the structure and size of the fish. By moving its head (thereby aiming the clicks at other parts of the fish) the dolphin can get more information on other parts of the fish. It is like a medical ultrasound probe, but the results are far less clear. A medical probe moves back and forth very rapidly, much faster than a dolphin can move its head. Also the frequency of the sounds of the medical probe is much higher than a dolphin's sonar. Therefore the level of detail the echoes can provide is much higher in the medical probe.\nCan dolphins combine information from their sonar with their vision? The short answer is: yes, they can. Just like people can visualise an object by just touching it, dolphins can get an idea of what an object looks like by scanning it with their sonar. They can also identify objects with their sonar that they have only been able to see. If they form a visual picture from the sonar information (visualisation) or form an acoustical picture from visual information is still unresolved. This capability is called cross-modal transfer and it has been demonstrated in only a few animal species so far: the bottlenose dolphin and the California sea lion.\nWhat and how much do dolphins eat? Bottlenose dolphins eat several kinds of fish (including mullet, mackerel, herring, cod) and squid. The composition of their diet depends very much on what is available in the area they live in and also on the season. The amount of fish they eat depends on the fish species they are feeding on: mackerel and herring have a very high fat content and consequently have a high caloric value, whereas squid has a very low caloric value, so to get the same energy intake (calories) they will need to eat much more if they feed on squid than if they feed on mackerel or herring. On average an adult dolphin will eat 4-9% of its body weight in fish, so a 250 kg (550 lb) dolphin will eat 10-22.5 kg (22-50 lb) fish per day\nHow old can dolphins get? The maximum age for bottlenose dolphins is between 40 and 50 years. The average age a dolphin can get (the life expectancy) is about 25 years. There is, however, anecdotal evidence, which indicates that dolphins can live longer than estimated if death by human interference is eliminated from calculations.\nDo dolphins live shorter in captivity? A study, comparing the survival of dolphins in captivity from 1940 - 1992, showed no significant difference between the captive population and the wild population. In captivity dolphins have reached ages over 40 years. However, this conclusion could be misleading as many of the early dolphinariums did not record deaths and secretly replaced dolphins if one died, giving the replacement dolphin the same name as its predecessor. IDW do not approve of keeping dolphins in captivity\nHow did dolphins evolve? The earliest recognisable cetaceans lived about 50 million years ago. These evolved from large land mammals, some of which were carnivorous, some herbivorous. The earliest dolphins appeared in the late Miocene period, some 11 million years ago. The land animals that are closest to whales and dolphins are the Ungulates (hoofed animals).\nHow can you interact with wild dolphins? When swimming, boating or snorkeling in certain areas you can encounter wild dolphins. In the US it is illegal to directly approach dolphins. If dolphins come towards you and choose to interact, that is allowed. In several areas there are boat operators that can take you to areas where there is a good chance to encounter dolphins (Florida, Bahamas).\nA note of warning: there have been operators that have tried to lure dolphins by feeding them. This is illegal in the US and is highly undesirable, because it changes the dolphins' behaviour. There are also operators offering bird-feeding tours. These bird feedings take place in areas frequented by dolphins and are an attempt to circumvent the dolphin-feeding ban. Do not use these operators.\nWhy do whales and dolphins beach themselves? If a single whale or dolphin strands, it usually is a very sick (and exhausted) animal. Such an animal often has some infections (pneumonia is almost always one of them) and a lot of parasites (worms in the nasal passages are very common). Sometimes these animals can be rehabilitated, but often they are so sick they won't make it. Some species of whales and dolphins occasionally strand in groups. A stranding of two or more animals is usually called a mass stranding. There are a number of theories that try to explain the occurrence of mass strandings. No theory can adequately explain all of them. In some cases it will be a combination of causes. The most common explanations are: - deep-water animals (the species that most often are the victim of mass strandings) cannot \"see\" a sloping sandy beach properly with its sonar. They detect the beach only when they are almost stranded already and they will panic and run aground. Whales and dolphins may be navigating by the earth's magnetic field, if the magnetic field is disturbed the animals get lost and may run into a beach. In some highly social species, the group leader may be sick and wash ashore. The other members try to stay close and may strand with the group leader.\nHow deep can dolphins dive? The deepest dive ever recorded for a bottlenose dolphin was a 300 meters (990 feet). This was accomplished by Tuffy, a dolphin trained by the US Navy. Most likely dolphins do not dive very deep though. Many bottlenose dolphins live in fairly shallow water. In the Sarasota Bay area, the dolphins spend a considerable time in waters that are less than 2 meters (7 feet) deep. Other whale and dolphin species are able to dive to much greater depths even. The pilot whale can dive to at least 600 meters (2000 feet) and a sperm whale has been found entangled in a cable at more that 900 meters (500 fathoms) depth. Recent studies on the behaviour of belugas have revealed that they regularly dive to depths of 800 meters. The deepest dive recorded of a beluga was to 1250 meters.\nHow fast can dolphins swim? The dolphin's fast cruising speed (a travelling speed they can maintain for quite a while) is about 6-7 knots. . They can reach speeds of up to 9.3 knots while travelling in this fashion. When they move faster, they will start jumping clear of the water (porpoising). They are actually saving energy by jumping. When chased by a speedboat, dolphins have been clocked at speeds of 14.6 knots, which they maintained for about 1500 meters, leaping constantly. Studies have shown, that the most efficient travelling speed for dolphins is between 3.3 to 4.5 knots. There have been reports of dolphins travelling at much higher speeds, but these refer to dolphins being pushed along by the bow wave of a speeding boat. They were getting a free ride (their speed relative to the surrounding water was low). It is possible that dolphins can reach speeds over 15 knots during very short bursts (like in preparation for a high jump), but they can't maintain that speed.\nWhere can you find dolphins? Whales and dolphins can be found in almost every sea and ocean, from the Arctic Ocean, through the tropics all the way to the Antarctic. Each species however has its own preferred type of habitat. Some live in cold water only, others in tropical oceans only. There are also species that can be found in a large variety of environments, like the bottlenose dolphins, killer whales and sperm whales. The map shows documented sightings of bottle nosed dolphins in dark blue.\nCan dolphins live in fresh water? There are a number of dolphin species that live in fresh water. They all belong to the river dolphin families (shown here is a pink Amazon river dolphin). There is one species that can be found both in fresh water (the Amazon river) and in coastal sea waters. In general, salt-water species don't do well in fresh water. They can survive for some time, but they will be come exhausted, since they have less buoyancy in fresh water, and after a while their skin will start to slough (like our own skin after spending a long time in the bathtub)\nHow do dolphins get their water? Most dolphins live in the ocean and the ocean water is too salty for them to drink. If they drank sea water, they would actually use more water trying to get rid of the salt than they drank in the first place. Most of their water they get from their food (fish and squid). Also, when they metabolise (burn) their fat, water is released in the process. Their kidneys are also adapted to retaining as much water as possible. Although they live in water, they have to live as desert animals, since they have no direct source of drinkable water. Click here to see larger image\nAre there any fictional books starring dolphins? Horace Dobbs has written a series of books about a fictional dolphin, named Dilo, for children. The books also appeal to adults because they are written from a dolphin\u2019s viewpoint and give a wonderful insight into the undersea world as perceived by both humans and dolphins. They are available from the on-line Dolphin Shop.\nHow many species of dolphins are there? There are 33 different types of marine dolphins and 4 types of river dolphins Closely related families are the white whales with 2 species\nWhat species was the dolphin in the Flipper series? The bottlenose dolphin\nWhat is the largest dolphin? The killer whale. The males can grow up to 9.6 metres (31.5 ft).\nWhat is the difference between dolphins and porpoises? Dolphins and porpoises belong to different whale families. The most obvious differences are: - dolphins have a hook-shaped dorsal fin, whereas porpoises have a triangular dorsal fin. - dolphins have conical teeth; the teeth of porpoises are spatula shaped. - most dolphin species have a distinct beak, porpoises don't, giving their head a more rounded, blunt shape\nWhat are cetaceans? Cetaceans is a collective term for whales, dolphins and porpoises. The name is derived from the scientific name of these animals: Cetacea."}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Oceanic dolphin - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_dolphin", "text": "Family of marine mammals\nOceanic dolphins or Delphinidae are a widely distributed family of dolphins that live in the sea. Close to forty extant species are recognised. They include several big species whose common names contain \"whale\" rather than \"dolphin\", such as the Globicephalinae (round-headed whales including the orca and pilot whale). Delphinidae is a family within the superfamily Delphinoidea, which also includes the porpoises (Phocoenidae) and the Monodontidae (beluga whale and narwhal). River dolphins are relatives of the Delphinoidea.\nOceanic dolphins range in size from the 1.7-metre-long (5 ft 7 in) and 50-kilogram (110-pound) Maui's dolphin to the 9.4-metre (31 ft) and 10-metric-ton (11-short-ton) killer whale, the largest known dolphin. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism; the males are larger than females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not quite as flexible as seals, some dolphins can travel at speeds 29 km/h (18 mph) for short distances. Most delphinids primarily eat fish, along with a smaller number of squid and small crustaceans, but some species specialise in eating squid, or, in the case of the killer whale, also eat marine mammals and birds. All, however, are purely carnivorous. They typically have between 100 and 200 teeth, although a few species have considerably fewer. Delphinids travel in large pods, which may number a thousand individuals in some species. Each pod forages over a range of tens to hundreds of square kilometres. Some pods have a loose social structure, with individuals frequently joining or leaving, but others seem to be more permanent, perhaps dominated by a male and a harem of females. Individuals communicate by sound, producing low-frequency whistles, and also produce high-frequency broadband clicks of 80\u2013220 kHz, which are primarily used for echolocation. Gestation lasts from 10 to 18 months, and results in the birth of a single calf. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.\nAlthough oceanic dolphins are widespread, most species prefer the warmer waters of the tropic zones, but some, like the right whale dolphin, prefer colder climates. Some have a global distribution, like the killer whale. Oceanic dolphins feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the killer whale, feed on large mammals, like seals. Male dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer, and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for relatively long times. Dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.\nOceanic dolphins are sometimes hunted in places such as Japan, in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. Besides drive hunting, they also face threats from bycatch, habitat loss, and marine pollution. Dolphins have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. They occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the Warner Bros film Free Willy. Dolphins are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform in shows. The most common species of dolphin in captivity is the bottlenose dolphin, and less than 50 killer whales were found in oceanariums in 2012.\nTaxonomy [ edit ]\nEtruridelphis giulii skull in Bologna skull in Bologna\nDelphinids, especially bottlenose dolphins, are able to hybridize with a wide variety of other delphinid species; wolphins are just one of many possible hybrids.\nSix species, sometimes referred to as \"blackfish\", are dolphins commonly called whales: the killer whale, the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale, and the two species of pilot whales, but they are classified under the family Delphinidae.\nRecent molecular analyses indicate that several delphinid genera (especially Stenella and Lagenorhynchus) are not monophyletic as currently recognized. Thus, significant taxonomic revisions within the family are likely.\nBiology [ edit ]\nAnatomy [ edit ]\nThe Delphinidae are the most diverse of the cetacean families, with numerous variations between species. They range in size from 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) and 40 kg (88 lb) (Haviside's dolphin), to 9 m (30 ft) and 10 tonnes (killer whale). Most species weigh between 50 and 200 kg (110 and 440 lb). They typically have curved dorsal fins, clear 'beaks' at the front of their heads, and forehead melons, although exceptions to all of these rules are found. They have a wide range of colors and patterns.\nOceanic dolphins have a torpedo-shaped body with an inflexible neck, limbs modified into flippers, nonexistent external ear flaps, a large tail fin, and a bulbous head. A dolphin skull has small eye orbits, a long snout, but not as long as its river dolphin counterpart, and eyes placed on the sides of its head. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males.\nBreathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs; a spout only occurs when the warm air from the lungs meets the cold external air, so it may only form in colder climates.\nAll oceanic dolphins have a thick layer of blubber, the thickness of which depends on how far the species lives from the equator. This blubber can aid in protection to some extent as predators would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of fat and insulation from the harsh climate or cold depths. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with lanugos.\nLocomotion [ edit ]\nOceanic dolphins have two flippers on the underside toward the head, a dorsal fin, and a tail fin. These flippers contain four digits. Although oceanic dolphins do not possess fully developed hind limbs, some possess discrete rudimentary appendages, which may contain feet and digits. Oceanic dolphins are fast swimmers in comparison to seals who typically cruise at 11\u201327 km/h (7\u201317 mph); the killer whale, in comparison, can travel at speeds of up to 55.5 km/h (34.5 mph). The fusing of the neck vertebrae, while increasing stability when swimming at high speeds, decreases flexibility, which means they are unable to turn their heads. Oceanic dolphins swim by moving their tail fin and rear body vertically, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Some species log out of the water, which may allow them to travel faster. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. All species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves from involuntarily spinning in the water.\nSenses [ edit ]\nThe oceanic dolphin ear is specifically adapted to the marine environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In dolphins, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The dolphin ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. This allows dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation. Though most dolphins do not have hair, they do have hair follicles that may perform some sensory function. Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on an object's shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood.\nThe eye of oceanic dolphins is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes of a dolphin are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When dolphins surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Dolphins do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for color vision than most mammals. Most dolphins have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area. They also have glands on the eyelids and outer corneal layer that act as protection for the cornea.\nThe olfactory lobes are absent in oceanic dolphins, suggesting that they have no sense of smell.\nOceanic dolphins are not thought to have a good sense of taste, as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether. However, some have preferences between different kinds of fish, indicating some sort of attachment to taste.\nBehavior [ edit ]\nFeeding [ edit ]\nMost delphinids primarily eat fish, along with a smaller number of squid and small crustaceans, but some species specialize in eating squid, or, in the case of the killer whale, also eat marine mammals and birds. All, however, are purely carnivorous. They typically have between 100 and 200 teeth, although a few species have considerably fewer. Various methods of feeding exist among and within oceanic species, some apparently exclusive to a single population. Fish and squid are the main food, but the false killer whale and the killer whale also feed on other marine mammals. Killer whales on occasion also hunt whales larger than themselves.\nOne common feeding method is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a bait ball. Individual members then take turns plowing through the ball, feeding on the stunned fish. Corralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more easily. Killer whales and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it, a behavior known as beach or strand feeding. Some species also whack fish with their flukes, stunning them and sometimes knocking them out of the water.\nVocalizations [ edit ]\nOceanic dolphins are capable of making a broad range of sounds using nasal airsacs located just below the blowhole. Roughly three categories of sounds can be identified: frequency modulated whistles, burst-pulsed sounds, and clicks. Dolphins communicate with whistle-like sounds produced by vibrating connective tissue, similar to the way human vocal cords function, and through burst-pulsed sounds, though the nature and extent of that ability is not known. The clicks are directional and are for echolocation, often occurring in a short series called a click train. The click rate increases when approaching an object of interest. Dolphin echolocation clicks are amongst the loudest sounds made by marine animals.\nBottlenose dolphins have been found to have signature whistles. These whistles are used in order for dolphins to communicate with one another by identifying an individual. It can be seen as the dolphin equivalent of a name for humans. These signature whistles are developed during a dolphin's first year; it continues to maintain the same sound throughout its lifetime. In order to obtain each individual whistle sound, dolphins undergo vocal production learning. This consists of an experience with other dolphins that modifies the signal structure of an existing whistle sound. An auditory experience influences the whistle development of each dolphin. Dolphins are able to communicate to one another by addressing another dolphin through mimicking their whistle. The signature whistle of a male bottlenose dolphin tends to be similar to that of his mother, while the signature whistle of a female bottlenose dolphin tends to be more distinguishable. Bottlenose dolphins have a strong memory when it comes to these signature whistles, as they are able to relate to a signature whistle of an individual they have not encountered for over twenty years. Research done on signature whistle usage by other dolphin species is relatively limited. The research on other species done so far has yielded varied outcomes and inconclusive results.\nSurfacing behavior and play [ edit ]\nPacific white-sided dolphins porpoising\nOceanic dolphins frequently leap above the water surface, this being done for various reasons. When travelling, jumping can save the dolphin energy as there is less friction while in the air. This type of travel is known as porpoising. Other reasons include orientation, social displays, fighting, non-verbal communication, entertainment and attempting to dislodge parasites.\nDolphins show various types of playful behavior, often including objects, self-made bubble rings, other dolphins, or other animals. When playing with objects or small animals, common behavior includes carrying the object or animal along using various parts of the body, passing it along to other members of the group or taking it from another member, or throwing it out of the water. Dolphins have also been observed harassing animals in other ways, for example by dragging birds underwater without showing any intent to eat them. Playful behaviour that involves another animal species with active participation of the other animal can also be observed, however. Playful human interaction with dolphins is one example, but playful interactions have been observed in the wild with a number of other species as well, including humpback whales and dogs.\nIntelligence [ edit ]\nOceanic dolphins are known to teach, learn, cooperate, scheme, and grieve. The neocortex of many species is home to elongated spindle neurons that, prior to 2007, were known only in hominids. In humans, these cells are involved in social conduct, emotions, judgment, and theory of mind. Cetacean spindle neurons are found in areas of the brain that are homologous to where they are found in humans, suggesting that they perform a similar function.\nBrain size was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. Since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. Allometric analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately the \u2154 or \u00be exponent of the body mass. Comparison of a particular animal's brain size with the expected brain size based on such allometric analysis provides an encephalization quotient that can be used as another indication of animal intelligence. Killer whales have the second largest brain mass of any animal on earth, next to the sperm whale. The brain to body mass ratio in some is second only to humans.\nSelf-awareness is seen, by some, to be a sign of highly developed, abstract thinking. Self-awareness, though not well-defined scientifically, is believed to be the precursor to more advanced processes like meta-cognitive reasoning (thinking about thinking) that are typical of humans. Research in this field has suggested that cetaceans, among others, possess self-awareness. The most widely used test for self-awareness in animals is the mirror test in which a temporary dye is placed on an animal's body, and the animal is then presented with a mirror; they then see if the animal shows signs of self-recognition.\nIn 1995, Marten and Psarakos used television to test dolphin self-awareness. They showed dolphins real-time footage of themselves, recorded footage, and another dolphin. They concluded that their evidence suggested self-awareness rather than social behavior. While this particular study has not been repeated since then, dolphins have since passed the mirror test.\nInteractions with humans [ edit ]\nThreats [ edit ]\nConsumption [ edit ]\nIn some parts of the world, such as Taiji, Japan and the Faroe Islands, dolphins are traditionally considered as food, and are killed in harpoon or drive hunts. Dolphin meat is consumed in a small number of countries worldwide, which include Japan and Peru (where it is referred to as chancho marino, or \"sea pork\").\nDolphin meat is dense and such a dark shade of red as to appear black. Fat is located in a layer of blubber between the meat and the skin. When dolphin meat is eaten in Japan, it is often cut into thin strips and eaten raw as sashimi, garnished with onion and either horseradish or grated garlic, much as with sashimi of whale or horse meat (basashi). When cooked, dolphin meat is cut into bite-size cubes and then batter-fried or simmered in a miso sauce with vegetables. Cooked dolphin meat has a flavor very similar to beef liver. Dolphin meat is high in mercury, and may pose a health danger to humans when consumed.\nThe Faroe Islands population was exposed to methylmercury largely from contaminated pilot whale meat, which contained very high levels of about 2 mg methylmercury/kg. However, the Faroe Islands populations also eat significant amounts of fish. The study of about 900 Faroese children showed that prenatal exposure to methylmercury resulted in neuropsychological deficits at 7 years of age \u2013World Health Organization\nThere have been human health concerns associated with the consumption of dolphin meat in Japan after tests showed that dolphin meat contained high levels of mercury. There are no known cases of mercury poisoning as a result of consuming dolphin meat, though the government continues to monitor people in areas where dolphin meat consumption is high. The Japanese government recommends that children and pregnant women avoid eating dolphin meat on a regular basis.\nSimilar concerns exist with the consumption of dolphin meat in the Faroe Islands, where prenatal exposure to methylmercury and PCBs primarily from the consumption of pilot whale meat has resulted in neuropsychological deficits amongst children.\nLegally consuming dolphin meat in the United States would be near impossible for most due to the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which forbids \"...the act of hunting, killing, capture, and/or harassment of any marine mammal...\" (Exceptions are made for certain groups of people, such as Alaska Natives.) Theoretically, one could only eat the meat of a dolphin which died of natural causes, which would likely be highly undesirable (and potentially dangerous).\nFishing [ edit ]\nVarious fishing methods, like seine fishing for tuna and the use of drift and gill nets, unintentionally kill many oceanic dolphins. Accidental bycatch in gill nets is common and poses a risk for mainly local dolphin populations.\nDolphin safe labels attempt to reassure consumers that fish and other marine products have been caught in a dolphin-friendly way. The earliest campaigns with \"Dolphin safe\" labels were initiated in the 1980s as a result of cooperation between marine activists and the major tuna companies, and involved decreasing incidental dolphin kills by up to 50% by changing the type of nets used to catch tuna. The dolphins are netted only while fishermen are in pursuit of smaller tuna. Albacore are not netted this way, making albacore the only truly dolphin-safe tuna.\nSonar [ edit ]\nLoud underwater noises, such as those resulting from naval sonar use, live firing exercises, and certain offshore construction projects such as wind farms, may be harmful to dolphins, increasing stress, damaging hearing, and causing decompression sickness by forcing them to surface too quickly to escape the noise.\nIn captivity [ edit ]\nThe renewed popularity of dolphins in the 1960s resulted in the appearance of many dolphinaria around the world, making dolphins accessible to the public. Criticism and animal welfare laws forced many to close, although hundreds still exist around the world. In the United States, the best known are the SeaWorld marine mammal parks. In the Middle East the best known are Dolphin Bay at Atlantis, The Palm and the Dubai Dolphinarium.\nVarious species of dolphins are kept in captivity. These small cetaceans are more often than not kept in theme parks, such as SeaWorld, commonly known as a dolphinarium. Bottlenose dolphins are the most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan in captivity and have a friendly appearance. Hundreds if not thousands of bottlenose dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. Other species kept in captivity are spotted dolphins, false killer whales and common dolphins, Commerson's dolphins, as well as rough-toothed dolphins, but all in much lower numbers than the bottlenose dolphin. There are also fewer than ten pilot whales, Amazon river dolphins, Risso's dolphins, spinner dolphins, or tucuxi in captivity. Two unusual and very rare hybrid dolphins, known as wolphins, are kept at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii, which is a cross between a bottlenose dolphin and a false killer whale. Also, two common/bottlenose hybrids reside in captivity: one at Discovery Cove and the other at SeaWorld San Diego.\nKiller whales are well known for their performances in shows, but the number of orcas kept in captivity is very small, especially when compared to the number of bottlenose dolphins, with only 44 captive killer whales being held in aquaria as of 2012. The killer whale's intelligence, trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity and sheer size have made it a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales were taken from the wild in Iceland, 19 in Japan and three in Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.\nIn history and mythology [ edit ]\nc. 1600 BC, from Crete Fresco of dolphins,1600 BC, from Knossos\nIn Greek myths, they were seen invariably as helpers of humankind. Dolphins also seem to have been important to the Minoans, judging by artistic evidence from the ruined palace at Knossos. Dolphins are common in Greek mythology, and many coins from ancient Greece have been found which feature a man, a boy or a deity riding on the back of a dolphin. The Ancient Greeks welcomed dolphins; spotting dolphins riding in a ship's wake was considered a good omen. In both ancient and later art, Cupid is often shown riding a dolphin. A dolphin rescued the poet Arion from drowning and carried him safe to land, at Cape Matapan, a promontory forming the southernmost point of the Peloponnesus. There was a temple to Poseidon and a statue of Arion riding the dolphin.\nDionysus was once captured by Etruscan pirates who mistook him for a wealthy prince they could ransom. After the ship set sail Dionysus invoked his divine powers, causing vines to overgrow the ship where the mast and sails had been. He turned the oars into serpents, so terrifying the sailors that they jumped overboard, but Dionysus took pity on them and transformed them into dolphins so that they would spend their lives providing help for those in need. Dolphins were also the messengers of Poseidon and sometimes did errands for him as well. Dolphins were sacred to both Aphrodite and Apollo.\nDolphins are sometimes used as symbols, for instance in heraldry. When heraldry developed in the Middle Ages, not much was known about the biology of the dolphin and it was often depicted as a sort of fish. Traditionally, the dolphins in heraldry still may take after this notion, sometimes showing the dolphin skin covered with fish scales.\nIn the Middle Ages, the dolphin became an important heraldic element in the coats of arms of several European noble families, the most noticeable being those of the Dauphin de Viennois (later Dauphin of France) through which it passed to the Counts of Forez, Albon and other French families, as well as several branches of the Bourbon family (Count of Montpensier, Count of Beaujolais, among others) the Pandolfini of Florence, and the Delfini of Venice and Rome also used the dolphin as their \"canting\" armories. In the 19th century, Joseph Bonaparte adopted a dolphin in his coat of arms as King of Naples and Sicily.\nIn contemporary days, a dolphin is still used in the coat of arms of many cities, as well as in the coat of arms of Anguilla and the coat of arms of Romania, and the coat of arms of Barbados has a dolphin supporter. Cardinal Angelo Amato, prefect of the Congregation of the Causes of Saints, a dolphin in his coat of arms, as well as Cardinal Godfried Danneels, former Metropolitan Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Are Dolphins Mammals? - WorldAtlas", "url": "https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/are-dolphins-mammals.html", "text": "Yes, dolphins are mammals and not fish. Despite spending their lives almost completely underwater, and appearing in most ways like fish, they are actually mammals. Dolphins are members of the infraorder Cetacea, which is reserved for marine mammals, such as dolphins, porpoises and whales. While it can be tricky placing certain marine life into either the mammalian or fish categories, there are certain clues which help in classifying dolphins, and other sea life, into their respective groupings.\nWhy Dolphins Are Wrongly Considered To Be Fish\nOne of the reasons dolphins are sometimes confused for fish is that sharks are fish, and not mammals. Many people view dolphins in a similar category to sharks, and thus assume they would be classified in the same way. Similarly, many marine animals, including whales, are often thought to be very large fish. Their furless bodies, sleek shape, and fins, are often mental clues that these animals are most similar to fish. However, despite their aquatic nature and lifestyle, dolphins have a number of distinct characteristics that separate them from fish. By examining dolphins\u2019 specific characteristics, it is possible to prove their status as mammals, while simultaneously disqualify them from the fish class.\nWhy Dolphins Are Not Fish\nThe general anatomy of a dolphin.

Instead, they breath oxygen from the air like land dwelling mammals do. Though dolphins spend their entire lives in water, they frequently return to the surface for oxygen. Despite their marine status, they breath through a lung system in much the same way humans and other mammals do. The main difference between water mammals and land mammals, is that many, like dolphins, breath through blowholes instead of taking air through their mouths. A dolphin will rise to the surface of the water, and expose its blowhole to the open air. It will first exhale, to expel any water on the surface of its hole, and then inhale. The blowhole seals using strong muscles after an inhale to ensure no water gets in to the animals\u2019 lungs when it is underwater.\nTail Of Dolphins Align Horizontally\nAll fish, including sharks, have tail fins that are aligned vertically. This means that their tails move in a side to side motion, cutting through the water like a rudder. Dolphins, however, do not have this characteristic fish trait, as their tails align horizontally. Like whales and other marine mammals, these horizontal tails move in an up and down motion to propel the animal forward through the water.\nDolphins Have Only One Dorsal Fin\nA dolphin has only one dorsal fin. A dorsal fin is a fin on the back, or top of an animal. Marine mammals, such as dolphins and orcas, have one distinct dorsal fin, while fish have two or more. This is a good indicator of which sea creatures are fish, and which are mammals. Though both sharks and dolphins have distinct back fins, sharks and other fish have additional, usually smaller dorsal fins as well.\nWhy Dolphins Are Mammals\nDolphins give birth to live young ones and nurse them with their own milk. Baby dolphins always try to mimic their mother's actions and that is how they learn the essential life skills. Image credit: Vkilikov/Shutterstock.com\nDolphins Have Mammary Glands\nA mammal gets its name from the mammary gland, which every mammal possesses. This gland produces milk for young animals after they or born. Producing milk and nursing young is an act specific to mammals. Because dolphins also lactate, and have mammary glands, they can be considered mammals. Dolphins specifically can produce milk throughout their gestation period. Additionally, baby dolphins are able to nurse underwater by manipulating their tongues into a straw like shape, preventing the milk from escaping from the teat.\nDolphins Possess A Neocortex\nAll mammals have a neocortex. This is a section of the brain which houses higher level thinking, as well as memory, cognition, perception, language skills and motor commands. Because dolphins have a neocortex, they must categorically be classed as mammals. Dolphins process a particularly complex neocortex, and are known to exhibit self awareness, problem solving and higher level thinking. This is largely why they are thought to be some of the most intelligent creatures on Earth.\nDolphins Are Warm Blooded\nMammals, unlike fish, are warm blooded. Warm blooded animals, known as homeothermic animals, are creatures that have the ability to self regulate their body temperature. This means they do not need to rely on external sources to keep them warm or cool them down. Most marine mammals have a thick layer of blubber under their skin which traps in heat and allows them to remain warm internally even in cool water. In this way, their bodies are able to maintain enough heat for them to function normally, and they are not adversely effected by minor changes to their environment. Cold blooded animals, on the other hand, are greatly effected by their external conditions, and must use their surroundings to help regulate their body temperatures.\nDolphins Give Birth To Live Young Ones\nLive births While the question of laying eggs versus having live births is closely associated with the question of whether an animal is a mammal or not, it is important to note this is not a definitive quality. However, despite this, most mammals give birth to live young, while non mammals typically lay eggs. In a dolphins\u2019 case, their birthing habits follow the norm, and, like most mammals, they birth live young. Dolphins will give birth to a single offspring anywhere between once every year, to every five years, but usually produce young roughly once every three years. They have a gestation period of twelve months.\nFamily of dolphins pursuing fish in the Indian Ocean. Image credit: Lena2016/Shutterstock.com\nBy reviewing the evidence, it is clear that dolphins can be proven to be mammals, as well as systemically disqualified from being fish. Their mammal status is clear due to their having mammary glands, a neocortex, lung breathing systems, and warm blood. Conversely they are not fish as they lack gills, have horizontally aligned tails, and possess only one dorsal fin. By examining these distinct indicators, dolphins, along with other marine animals, can be classed in the same way. It is clear, then, that dolphins are indeed mammals, albeit marine mammals, and not, in fact, fish."}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Cetacean Characteristics and Facts - ThoughtCo", "url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/cetaceans-whales-dolphins-and-porpoises-2291928", "text": "The word cetacean is used to describe all whales, dolphins, and porpoises in the order Cetacea. This word comes from the Latin cetus meaning \"a large sea animal,\" and the Greek word ketos, meaning \"sea monster.\"\nThere are about 89 species of cetaceans. The term \"about\" is used because as scientists learn more about these fascinating animals, new species are discovered or populations are re-classified.\nCetaceans range in size from the tiniest dolphin, Hector's dolphin, which is just over 39 inches long, to the largest whale, the blue whale, which can be over 100 feet long. Cetaceans live in all of the oceans and many of the major rivers of the world.\nCetaceans are thought to have evolved from even-toed ungulates (a group that includes cows, camels, and deer).\nTypes of Cetaceans\nThere are many types of cetaceans, which are divided largely according to how they feed.\nThe order Cetacea is divided into two sub-orders, the Mysticetes (baleen whales) and the Odontocetes (toothed whales). The Odontocetes are more numerous, comprising 72 different species, compared to 14 baleen whale species.\nThe Mysticetes include species such as the blue whale, fin whale, right whale, and humpback whale.\nMysticetes have hundreds of comb-like plates of baleen hanging from their upper jaw. Baleen whales feed by gulping large amounts of water containing hundreds or thousands of fish or plankton, then forcing the water out in between the baleen plates, leaving the prey inside to be swallowed whole.\nOdontocetes include the sperm whale, orca (killer whale), beluga and all of the dolphins and porpoises. These animals have cone-shaped or spade-shaped teeth and usually capture one animal at a time and swallow it whole. Odontocetes feed mostly on fish and squid, although some orcas prey on other marine mammals.\nCetacean Characteristics\nCetaceans are mammals, which means they are endothermic (commonly called warm-blooded) and their internal body temperature is about the same as a human's. They give birth to live young and breathe air through lungs just like we do. They even have hair.\nUnlike fish, which swim by moving their heads from side-to-side to swing their tail, cetaceans propel themselves by moving their tail in a smooth, up-and-down motion. Some cetaceans, such as the Dall's porpoise and the orca (killer whale) can swim faster than 30 miles per hour.\nBreathing\nWhen a cetacean wants to breathe, it has to rise to the water surface and exhale and inhale out of the blowholes located on top of its head. When the cetacean comes to the surface and exhales, you can sometimes see the spout, or blow, which is the result of the warm air in the whale's lungs condensing upon reaching the cool air outside.\nInsulation\nWhales do not have a coat of fur to keep warm, so they have a thick layer of fat and connective tissue called blubber underneath their skin. This blubber layer can be as much as 24 inches thick in some whales.\nSenses\nWhales have a poor sense of smell, and depending on where they are, they may not be able to see well underwater. However, they have excellent hearing. They do not have external ears but have tiny ear openings behind each eye. They can also tell the direction of sound underwater.\nDiving\nWhales have collapsible rib cages and flexible skeletons, which allows them to compensate for high water pressure when they dive. They can also tolerate higher levels of carbon dioxide in their blood, allowing them to stay underwater for up to 1 to 2 hours for large whales."}

But despite their popularity, swim-with-the-dolphin programs have a dark underbelly, and those on the inside are starting to speak out against them.\nCourtney Vail/WDC\nDodo Shows Little But Fierce Pocket-Sized Kitten Grows Up To Be A Wild Woman\nCourtney Vail/WDC\nSwim-with-the-dolphin (SWTD) programs can be found all over the world, but they've become exceptionally popular in the Caribbean in the past decade or so. A former dolphin trainer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told The Dodo that these programs are inherently problematic - and cetaceans simply do not belong in captivity. \"Dolphins are beautiful and amazing creatures in their natural habitat,\" says the former trainer, who requested anonymity because he still works in the Caribbean hotel industry. \"But stick them in a cage, and you watch them change.\" One trainer's story Born and raised in the Bahamas, the trainer says he was employed at two swim-with-the-dolphin facilities in the Caribbean, and his concerns grew over his tenure. The dolphins' holding pens were not only excessively shallow, but also far too small. At one facility, he says, more than 40 dolphins were caged in three compact cells. In the open sea pens - as opposed to enclosed pools within a resort - debris like nails and fish hooks would float in from the ocean, he adds. \"Because they didn't have a vet or any type of veterinary care at [this particular] facility, the dolphins would swallow things, and there would be nothing you could do about it,\" he says. Though he witnessed the enclosed pens being cleaned, he claims the smell of the chlorine was so strong, it would \"choke\" the trainers - and that some of the animals eventually went blind because of its use. He also maintains that many of the dolphins suffered from \"psychosis,\" a behavior not unheard of in marine mammals forced to swim in small pens all day long. They were also under extreme pressure to perform, which may have made them dangerous to humans, he says: \"They did 10 interactions a day ... the same motions, the same speech, the same signals over and over. They would get frustrated ... and aggressive to guests or knock food buckets out of our hands.\"\nCourtney Vail/WDC\nCourtney Vail/WDC\nThe former trainer's most troubling allegation, however, is that some female dolphins prevented their new babies from breathing - by stopping them from coming to the surface. The trainer, who isn't a scientist, said he and his colleagues deduced the mothers did this because they didn't want their babies to \"live in captivity.\" Though that allegation can't be proven, another former trainer has echoed other worries. Moreover, studies have pointed to some issues with dolphin captivity in general. According to a World Animal Protection/Humane Society of the United States report called \"The Case Against Marine Mammals in Captivity,\" cetaceans in captivity are routinely given antibiotics and ulcer medications, are in need of vitamin supplements because they are being fed nutrient-deficient frozen fish and have a history of premature death from a variety of causes. The report also notes that, for many dolphins, enclosure sizes are less than 1 percent of their natural habitat range.\nWhat's wrong about swimming with dolphins? \"Swim with the dolphins\" (SWTD) is a general term for a variety of dolphin-themed itineraries. Besides swimming with a dolphin (or two), you can be photographed with a dolphin, pulled through the water by a dolphin (the \"dorsal tow\"), smooched by a dolphin or pushed by the beak of a dolphin. You can even pay to be a dolphin \"trainer,\" complete with a whistle and training manual. There are some 30 dolphinariums in the Caribbean, says Naomi Rose, a marine mammal scientist with the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI). They can be found at a number of tourist meccas, including the Bahamas, Jamaica, Tortola, Grand Cayman, the Dominican Republic and Cancun. Even more facilities are being built in the region, including one that recently opened in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, and others are being proposed in Turks and Caicos and St. Lucia, says Courtney Vail, the campaigns and program manager at Whale and Dolphin Conservation (WDC), who has been campaigning against cetacean captivity for 16 years. The WDC documented many welfare incidents in the Caribbean in a 2010 paper called \"Captivity in the Caribbean.\" In one facility in Antigua, dolphins were found to be \"unusually dark\" due to shallow enclosures and subsequent sunburn; some were found to be held in isolation for training purposes; and some were exposed to polluted water.\nShutterstock"}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "River dolphin - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_dolphin", "text": "Superfamily of dolphins\nRiver dolphins River dolphins are not a taxon, they are an informal grouping of the infraorder Cetacea Information Families considered river dolphins Parvorder Odontoceti\nFamily Platanistidae\nFamily (?\u2020) Lipotidae\nFamily Iniidae\nFamily Pontoporiidae New World range map Old World range map\nRiver dolphins are a polyphyletic group of fully aquatic mammals that reside exclusively in freshwater or brackish water. They are an informal grouping of dolphins, which itself is a paraphyletic group within the infraorder Cetacea. Extant river dolphins are placed in two superfamilies, Platanistoidea and Inioidea. They comprise the extant families Platanistidae (the South Asian dolphins) (Old World family), Iniidae (the Amazonian dolphins) and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins) (New World families). There are five extant species of river dolphins. River dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Artiodactyla, with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives the hippopotamuses, from which they diverged about 40 million years ago. Specific types of Dolphins can be pink.\nRiver dolphins are relatively small compared to other dolphins, having evolved to survive in warm, shallow water and strong river currents. They range in size from the 5-foot (1.5 m) long South Asian river dolphin to the 8-foot (2.4 m) and 220-pound (100 kg) Amazon river dolphin. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the males are larger than the females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. River dolphins use their conical-shaped teeth and long beaks to capture fast-moving prey in murky water. They have well-developed hearing that is adapted for both air and water; they do not really rely on vision since the water they swim in is usually very muddy. These species are well-adapted to living in warm, shallow waters, and, unlike other cetaceans, have little to no blubber.\nRiver dolphins are not very widely distributed; they are all restricted to certain rivers or deltas. This makes them extremely vulnerable to habitat destruction. River dolphins feed primarily on fish. Male river dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. River dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.\nRiver dolphins are rarely kept in captivity; breeding success has been poor and the animals often die within a few months of capture. As of 2015 , there were only four river dolphins in captivity.[citation needed]\nTaxonomy and evolution [ edit ]\nClassification [ edit ]\nFour families of river dolphins (Iniidae, Pontoporiidae, Lipotidae and Platanistidae) are currently recognized, comprising three superfamilies (Inioidea, Lipotoidea and Platanistoidea). Platanistidae, containing the two subspecies of South Asian river dolphin, is the only living family in the superfamily Platanistoidea. Previously, many taxonomists had assigned all river dolphins to a single family, Platanistidae, and treated the Ganges and Indus river dolphins as separate species. A December 2006 survey found no members of Lipotes vexillifer (commonly known as the baiji, or Chinese river dolphin) and declared the species functionally extinct. With their disappearance, one of the recently accepted superfamilies, Lipotoidea, has become extinct.\nThe current classification of river dolphins is as follows:\nIn 2012 the Society for Marine Mammalogy began considering the Bolivian (Inia geoffrensis boliviensis) and Amazonian (Inia geoffrensis geoffrensis) subspecies as full species Inia boliviensis and Inia geoffrensis, respectively; however, much of the scientific community, including the IUCN, continue to consider the Bolivian population to be a subspecies of Inia geoffrensis.\nIn October 2014, the Society for Marine Mammalogy took Inia boliviensis and Inia araguaiaensis off their list of aquatic mammal species and subspecies and currently does not recognize these species-level separations.\nEvolution [ edit ]\nPlatanista and other river dolphins. Phylogeny of cetaceans based on cytochrome b gene sequences, showing the distant relationship betweenand other river dolphins.\nRiver dolphins are members of the infraorder Cetacea, which are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the order Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates). They are related to the Indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago. The primitive cetaceans, or archaeocetes, first took to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic by 5\u201310 million years later. It is unknown when river dolphins first ventured back into fresh water.\nRiver dolphins are thought to have relictual distributions, that is, their ancestors originally occupied marine habitats, but were then displaced from these habitats by modern dolphin lineages. Many of the morphological similarities and adaptations to freshwater habitats arose due to convergent evolution; thus, a grouping of all river dolphins is polyphyletic. Amazon river dolphins are actually more closely related to oceanic dolphins than to South Asian river dolphins. Isthminia panamensis is an extinct genus and species of river dolphin, living 5.8 to 6.1 million years ago. Its fossils were discovered near Pi\u00f1a, Panama.\nRiver dolphin has been considered a taxonomic description, suggesting an evolutionary relationship among the group, although it is now known that they form two distinct clades. 'True' river dolphins are descendants of ancient evolutionary lineages that evolved in freshwater environments.\nSome species of cetacean live in rivers and lakes, but are more closely related to oceanic dolphins or porpoises and entered fresh water more recently. Such species are considered facultative freshwater cetaceans as they can use both marine and freshwater environments. These include species such as the Irrawaddy dolphin, Orcaella brevirostris, found in the Mekong, Mahakam, the Irrawaddy Rivers, as well as the Yangtze finless porpoise Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis. Some oceanic cetacean populations are known to live semi-permanently in river and estuarine systems, such as the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin group resident in the Swan River of Western Australia which travel as far inland as Belmont.\nThe tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis) in the Amazon River is another species descended from oceanic dolphins; however, it does not perfectly fit the label of 'facultative' either, as it occurs only in fresh water. The tucuxi was until recently considered conspecific with the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis), which inhabits marine waters. It may also be true for the Irrawaddy dolphin and the finless porpoise that, although the species may be found in both freshwater and marine environments, individual animals found in rivers may not be able to survive in the ocean, and vice versa. The tucuxi is currently classified as an oceanic dolphin (Delphinidae).\nThe Franciscana (Pontoporia blainvillei) has shown a converse evolutionary pattern, and has an ancient evolutionary lineage in freshwater, but inhabits estuarine and coastal waters.\nBiology [ edit ]\nAnatomy [ edit ]\nRiver dolphins have a torpedo shaped body with a flexible neck, limbs modified into flippers, non-existent external ear flaps, a tail fin, and a small bulbous head. River dolphin skulls have small eye orbits, a long snout and eyes placed on the sides of the head. River dolphins are rather small, ranging in size from the 5-foot (1.5 m) long South Asian river dolphin to the 8-foot (2.4 m) and 220-pound (100 kg) Amazon river dolphin. They all have female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males. River dolphins are polygynous, meaning male river dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them.\nRiver dolphins have conical teeth, used to catch swift prey such as small river fish. They also have very long snouts, with some measuring 23 inches (58 cm), four times longer than most of their oceanic counterparts. They have a two-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to that of terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and pyloric chambers. Breathing involves expelling stale air from their blowhole, followed by inhaling fresh air into their lungs. They do not have the iconic spout, as this only forms when the warm air exhaled from the lungs meets cold external air, which does not occur in their tropical habitats.\nRiver dolphins have a relatively thin layer of blubber. Blubber can help with buoyancy, protection from predators (they would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of fat), energy for leaner times, and insulation from harsh climates. The habitats of river dolphins lack these needs.\nLocomotion [ edit ]\nRiver dolphins have two flippers and a tail fin. These flippers contain four digits. Although river dolphins do not possess fully developed hind limbs, some possess discrete rudimentary appendages, which may contain feet and digits. River dolphins are slow swimmers in comparison to oceanic dolphins, which can travel at speeds up to 35 miles per hour (56 km/h); the tucuxi can only travel at about 14 miles per hour (23 km/h). Unlike other cetaceans, their neck vertebrae are not fused together, meaning they have greater flexibility than other non-terrestrial aquatic mammals, at the expense of speed. This means they can turn their head without actually moving their entire body. When swimming, river dolphins rely on their tail fins to propel themselves through the water. Flipper movement is continuous. River dolphins swim by moving their tail fins and lower bodies up and down, propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. All species have a dorsal fin.\nSenses [ edit ]\nRiver dolphins have very small eyes\nThe ears of river dolphins have specific adaptations to their aquatic environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In river dolphins, and other cetaceans, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, river dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allows for greater directional hearing underwater. Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. This allows river dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation.: 203\u2013427  They are so dependent on echolocation that they can survive even if they are blind. Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on the object's shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood. The small hairs on the rostrum of the Amazon river dolphin are believed to function as a tactile sense, possibly to compensate for their poor eyesight.\nRiver dolphins have very small eyes for their size, and do not have a very good sense of sight. In addition, the eyes are placed on the sides of the head, so the vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When river dolphins surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light. They have both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Most river dolphins have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area. They also have glands on their eyelids and an outer corneal layer that act as protection for the cornea.: 505\u2013519\nOlfactory lobes are absent in river dolphins, suggesting that they have no sense of smell.: 481\u2013505\nRiver dolphins are not thought to have a sense of taste, as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether. However, some dolphins have preferences between different kinds of fish, indicating some sort of attachment to taste.: 447\u2013454\nInteractions with humans [ edit ]\nThreats [ edit ]\nDevelopment [ edit ]\nDevelopment and agriculture have had devastating impacts on the habitats on river dolphins. The total population of Araguaian river dolphins is estimated to be between 600 and 1,500 individuals, and genetic diversity is limited. The ecology of their habitat has been adversely affected by agricultural, ranching and industrial activities, as well as by the use of dams for hydroelectric power. The inhabited section of the Araguaia River probably extends over about 900 miles (1,400 km) out of a total length of 1,300 miles (2,100 km). The Tocantins river habitat is fragmented by six hydroelectric dams, so the population there is at particular risk. Its probable eventual IUCN status is vulnerable or worse.: 54\u201358\nBoth subspecies of South Asian river dolphins have been very adversely affected by human use of the river systems in the subcontinent. Irrigation has lowered water levels throughout both subspecies' ranges. Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and agricultural chemicals may have also contributed to population decline. Perhaps the most significant issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed gene pool in which the dolphins can breed. Currently, three subpopulations of Indus river dolphins are considered capable of long-term survival if protected.: 31\u201332, 37\u201338\nAs China developed economically, pressure on the baiji river dolphin grew significantly.: 41\u201346 Industrial and residential waste flowed into the Yangtze. The riverbed was dredged and reinforced with concrete in many locations. Ship traffic multiplied, boats grew in size, and fishermen employed wider and more lethal nets. Noise pollution caused the nearly blind animal to collide with propellers. Stocks of the dolphin's prey declined drastically in the late 20th century, with some fish populations declining to one thousandth of their pre-industrial levels. In the 1950s, the population was estimated at 6,000 animals, but declined rapidly over the subsequent five decades. Only a few hundred were left by 1970. Then the number dropped down to 400 by the 1980s and then to 13 in 1997 when a full-fledged search was conducted. On December 13, 2006, the baiji (Lipotes vexillifer) was declared \"functionally extinct\", after a 45-day search by leading experts in the field failed to find a single specimen. The last verified sighting was in September 2004.\nCompetition [ edit ]\nThe region of the Amazon in Brazil has an extension of 3,100,000 sq mi (8,000,000 km2) containing diverse fundamental ecosystems. One of these ecosystems is a floodplain, or a v\u00e1rzea forest, and is home to a large number of fish species which are an essential resource for human consumption. The v\u00e1rzea is also a major source of income through excessive local commercialized fishing. V\u00e1rzea consist of muddy river waters containing a vast number and diversity of nutrient-rich species. The abundance of distinct fish species lures the Amazon River dolphin into the v\u00e1rzea areas of high water occurrences during the seasonal flooding.\nIn addition to attracting predators such as the Amazon river dolphin, these high-water occurrences are an ideal location to draw in the local fisheries.: 54\u201358 Human fishing activities directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species, the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) and the pirapitinga (Piaractus brachypomus), resulting in deliberate or unintentional catches of the Amazon river dolphin. The local fishermen overfish, and when the Amazon river dolphins remove the commercialized fish from the nets and lines, it damages the equipment and the capture and causes a negative reaction from the local fishermen.  The Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources prohibit fishermen from killing the Amazon river dolphin, yet they are not compensated for the damage to their equipment and the loss of their catch.\nBycatch [ edit ]\nDuring the process of catching the commercialized fish, the Amazon river dolphins get caught in the nets and exhaust themselves until they die, or the local fishermen deliberately kill the dolphins that become entangled in their nets. The carcasses are discarded, consumed, or used as bait to attract a scavenger catfish, the piracatinga (Calophysus macropterus). The use of the Amazon river dolphin carcass as bait for the piracatinga dates back from 2000. The increasing consumption demand by the local inhabitants and Colombia for the piracatinga has created a market for distribution of the Amazon river dolphin carcasses to be used as bait throughout these regions.: 54\u201358\nFor example, of the 15 dolphin carcasses found in the Japur\u00e1 River in 2010\u20132011 surveys, 73% of the dolphins were killed for bait, disposed of, or abandoned in entangled gillnets. The data does not fully represent the actual overall number of deaths of the Amazon river dolphins, whether accidental or intentional, because a variety of factors make it extremely complicated to record and medically examine all the carcasses. Scavenger species feed upon them and the complexity of the river currents makes it nearly impossible to locate all the carcasses. More importantly, the local fishermen do not report these deaths out of fear that legal action will be taken against them, as the Amazon river dolphin and other cetaceans are protected under the Brazilian federal law, prohibiting any takes, harassments, and kills of the species.\nIn captivity [ edit ]\nA baiji conservation dolphinarium was established at the Institute of Hydrobiology (IHB) in Wuhan in 1992. This was planned as a backup to any other conservation efforts by producing an area completely protected from any threats, and where the baiji could be easily observed. The site includes an indoor and outdoor holding pool, a water filtration system, food storage and preparation facilities, research labs and a small museum. The aim is to also generate income from tourism which can be put towards the baiji plight. The pools are not very large, only kidney shaped tanks with dimensions of 82 feet (25 m) arc 23 feet (7.0 m) width and 11 feet (3.4 m) depth, 33 feet (10 m) diameter, 6.6 feet (2.0 m) deep and 39 feet (12 m) diameter, 11 feet (3.4 m) deep, and are not capable of holding many baijis at one time. Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine documented their encounters with the endangered animals on their conservation travels for the BBC programme Last Chance to See. The book by the same name, published in 1990, included pictures of a captive specimen, a male named Qi Qi (\u6dc7\u6dc7) that lived in the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology dolphinarium from 1980 to July 14, 2002. Discovered by a fisherman in Dongting Lake, he became the sole resident of the Baiji Dolphinarium (\u767d\u9c40\u8c5a\u6c34\u65cf\u9986) beside East Lake. A sexually mature female was captured in late 1995, but died after half a year in 1996 when the Shishou Tian-e-Zhou Baiji Semi-natural Reserve (\u77f3\u9996\u534a\u81ea\u7136\u767d\u9c40\u8c5a\u4fdd\u62a4\u533a), which had contained only finless porpoises since 1990, was flooded.\nThe Amazon river dolphin has historically been kept in dolphinariums. Today, only three exist in captivity: one in Acuario de Valencia in Venezuela, one in Zoologico de Guistochoca in Peru, and one in Duisburg Zoo in Germany. Several hundred were captured between the 1950s and 1970s, and were distributed in dolphinariums throughout the US, Europe, and Japan. Around 100 went to US dolphinariums, and of that, only 20 survived; the last (named Chuckles) died in Pittsburgh Zoo in 2002.: 58\u201359\nIn mythology [ edit ]\nAsia [ edit ]\nIn Hindu mythology, the Ganges river dolphin is associated with Ganga, the deity of the Ganges river. The dolphin is said to be one of the creatures which heralded the goddess' descent from the heavens, and Ganga's mount, the Makara, is sometimes depicted as a dolphin.\nIn Chinese mythology, the baiji has many origin stories. For example, near the mouth of the Yangtze, the baiji was a princess that had lost her parents and had lived with her stepfather, whom she had longed to get away from. The stepfather wanted to trade her since she would be sold for a great sum of money, but as they were crossing the river to get to the trader, a storm rolled in. The enraged stepfather tried to take her, but she plunged herself into the river, was transformed into a dolphin before she drowned, and swam away from her abusive stepfather, who also fell in and was transformed into a porpoise.\nIn another story, the baiji was the daughter of a general deported from the city of Wuhan during a war who ran away while her father was in duty. Later, the general met a woman who told him how her father was a general. When he realized that she was his daughter, he threw himself into the river out of shame, and his daughter ran after him and also fell into the river. Before they were drowned, the daughter was transformed into a dolphin and the general into a porpoise.\nSouth America [ edit ]\nAmazon river dolphins, known by the natives as the boto, encantados or toninas, are very prevalent in the mythology of the native South Americans. They are often characterized in mythology with superior musical ability, seductiveness and love of sex that often results in illegitimate children, and attraction to parties. Despite the fact that the Encante are said to come from a utopia full of wealth and without pain or death, the encantados crave the pleasures and hardships of human societies.\nTransformation into human form is said to be rare, and usually occurs at night. The encantado will often be seen running from a festa, despite protests from the others for it to stay, and can be seen by pursuers as it hurries to the river and reverts to dolphin form. When it is under human form, it wears a hat to hide its blowhole, which does not disappear with the shapeshift.\nBesides the ability to shapeshift into human form, encantados frequently wield other magical abilities, such as controlling storms, hypnotizing humans into doing their will, transforming humans into encantados, and inflicting illness, insanity, and even death. Shamans often intervene in these situations.\nKidnapping is also a common theme in such folklore. Encantados are said to be fond of abducting humans with whom they fall in love, children born of their illicit love affairs, or just about anyone near the river who can keep them company, and taking them back to the Encante. The fear of this is so great among people who live near the Amazon River that both children and adults are terrified of going near the water between dusk and dawn, or entering water alone. Some who supposedly have encountered encantados while out in their canoes have been said to have gone insane, but the creatures seem to have done little more than follow their boats and nudge them from time to time.\nReferences [ edit ]\nFurther reading [ edit ]"}

All the dolphins at the institute are trained to hold onto any litter that falls into their pools until they see a trainer, when they can trade the litter for fish. In this way, the dolphins help to keep their pools clean.\nKelly has taken this task one step further. When people drop paper into the water she hides it under a rock at the bottom of the pool. The next time a trainer passes, she goes down to the rock and tears off a piece of paper to give to the trainer. After a fish reward, she goes back down, tears off another piece of paper, gets another fish, and so on. This behaviour is interesting because it shows that Kelly has a sense of the future and delays gratification. She has realised that a big piece of paper gets the same reward as a small piece and so delivers only small pieces to keep the extra food coming. She has, in effect, trained the humans.\nHer cunning has not stopped there. One day, when a gull flew into her pool, she grabbed it, waited for the trainers and then gave it to them. It was a large bird and so the trainers gave her lots of fish. This seemed to give Kelly a new idea. The next time she was fed, instead of eating the last fish, she took it to the bottom of the pool and hid it under the rock where she had been hiding the paper. When no trainers were present, she brought the fish to the surface and used it to lure the gulls, which she would catch to get even more fish. After mastering this lucrative strategy, she taught her calf, who taught other calves, and so gull-baiting has become a hot game among the dolphins.\n\u201cIntelligence\u201d is a term with many definitions and interpretations. It\u2019s difficult enough to measure in humans let alone other animals. Large brains are traditionally associated with greater intelligence, and the brain of the adult bottlenose dolphin is about 25% heavier than the average adult human brain. Generally though, larger mammals tend to have larger brains, and so a more accurate estimate of brain power comes from the ratio of brain size to body size - the \u201cencephalisation quotient\u201d (EQ). While river dolphins have an EQ of 1.5, some dolphins have EQs that are more than double those of our closest relatives: gorillas have 1.76, chimpanzees 2.48, bottlenose dolphins 5.6. The bottlenose\u2019s EQ is surpassed only by a human\u2019s, which measures 7.4 (Australopithecines - hominids that lived around 4m years ago - fall within the dolphin range: 3.25-4.72). But we don\u2019t know enough about the workings of the brain to be sure of what these anatomical measurements truly represent. Today, most scientists share the view that it is behaviour, not structure, that must be the measure of intelligence within a species.\nDolphins have invented a range of feeding strategies that more than match the diversity of habitats in which they live. In an estuary off the coast of Brazil, tucuxi dolphins are regularly seen capturing fish by \u201ctail whacking\u201d. They flick a fish up to 9 metres with their tail flukes and then pick the stunned prey from the water surface. Peale\u2019s dolphins in the Straits of Magellan off Patagonia forage in kelp beds, use the seaweed to disguise their approach and cut off the fishes\u2019 escape route. In Galveston Bay, Texas, certain female bottlenose dolphins and their young follow shrimp boats. The dolphins swim into the shrimp nets to take live fish and then wriggle out again - a skill requiring expertise to avoid entanglement in the fishing nets.\nDolphins can also use tools to solve problems. Scientists have observed a dolphin coaxing a reluctant moray eel out of its crevice by killing a scorpion fish and using its spiny body to poke at the eel. Off the western coast of Australia, bottlenose dolphins place sponges over their snouts, which protects them from the spines of stonefish and stingrays as they forage over shallow seabeds.\nA dolphin\u2019s ability to invent novel behaviours was put to the test in a famous experiment by the renowned dolphin expert Karen Pryor. Two rough-toothed dolphins were rewarded whenever they came up with a new behaviour. It took just a few trials for both dolphins to realise what was required. A similar trial was set up with humans. The humans took about as long to realise what they were being trained to do as did the dolphins. For both the dolphins and the humans, there was a period of frustration (even anger, in the humans) before they \u201ccaught on\u201d. Once they figured it out, the humans expressed great relief, whereas the dolphins raced around the tank excitedly, displaying more and more novel behaviours.\nDolphins are quick learners. Calves stay with their mothers for several years, allowing the time and opportunity for extensive learning to take place, particularly through imitation. At a dolphinarium, a person standing by the pool\u2019s window noticed that a dolphin calf was watching him. When he released a puff of smoke from his cigarette, the dolphin immediately swam off to her mother, returned and released a mouthful of milk, causing a similar effect to the cigarette smoke. Another dolphin mimicked the scraping of the pool\u2019s observation window by a diver, even copying the sound of the air-demand valve of the scuba gear while releasing a stream of bubbles from his blowhole.\nMany species live in complex societies. To fit in, young dolphins must learn about the conventions and rules of dolphin society, teamwork and who\u2019s who in the group. For these dolphins, play provides an ideal opportunity to learn about relationships in a relatively non-threatening way. At Sarasota Bay in Florida, Randall Wells and his team have observed groups of juvenile male bottlenose dolphins behaving like boisterous teenage boys. Using its head to do the lifting, one dolphin may even get another dolphin air borne, actually tossing it out of the water. It\u2019s unclear exactly what is going on. It could be play, but more likely these are serious interactions that are defining social relationships.\nDolphins gradually build up a network of relationships, ranging from the strong bond between a mother and calf, to casual \u201cfriendships\u201d with other community members. Wells and his team were the first to notice that adult male bottlenose dolphins tend to hang out in pairs. The dolphins\u2019 motivation for ganging together is under study but may involve ecological and/or reproductive benefits. Dolphins may also form \u201csupergangs\u201d. Richard Connor and his team in Shark Bay, Western Australia, discovered a group of 14 males. The supergang was a force to be reckoned with. In the three years it was studied, it never lost a fight.\nTo keep track of the many different relationships within a large social group, it helps to have an efficient communication system. Dolphins use a variety of clicks and whistles to keep in touch. Some species have a signature whistle, which, like a name, is a unique sound that allows other dolphins to identify it. Dolphins also communicate using touch and body postures. By human definition, there is currently no evidence that dolphins have a language. But we\u2019ve barely begun to record all their sounds and body signals let alone try to decipher them. At Kewalo Basin Marine Laboratory in Hawaii, Lou Herman and his team set about testing a dolphin\u2019s ability to comprehend our language. They developed a sign language to communicate with the dolphins, and the results were remarkable. Not only do the dolphins understand the meaning of individual words, they also understand the significance of word order in a sentence. (One of their star dolphins, Akeakamai, has learned a vocabulary of more than 60 words and can understand more than 2,000 sentences.) Particularly impressive is the dolphins\u2019 relaxed attitude when new sentences are introduced. For example, the dolphins generally responded correctly to \u201ctouch the frisbee with your tail and then jump over it\u201d. This has the characteristics of true understanding, not rigid training.\nLou Herman and Adam Pack taught the dolphins two further signals. One they called \u201crepeat\u201d and the other \u201cdifferent\u201d, which called for a change from the current behaviour. The dolphins responded correctly. Another test of awareness comes from mirror experiments. Diana Reiss and her researchers installed mirrors inside New York Aquarium to test whether two bottlenose dolphins were self-aware enough to recognise their reflections. They placed markings in non-toxic black ink on various places of the dolphins\u2019 bodies. The dolphins swam to the mirror and exposed the black mark to check it out. They spent more time in front of the mirror after being marked than when they were not marked. The ability to recognise themselves in the mirror suggests self-awareness, a quality previously only seen in people and great apes.\nNot only do dolphins recognise their mirror images, but they can also watch TV. Language-trained chimps only learned to respond appropriately to TV screens after a long period of training. In contrast, Lou Herman\u2019s dolphins responded appropriately the very first time they were exposed to television.\nOf course, an understanding of TV is of little use in the wild, but the ability to respond to new situations has huge implications. In the shallows of Florida Bay, Laura Engleby and her team have recently discovered an ingenious fishing strategy. A number of the local dolphin groups seem to use a circle of mud to catch mullet. The action usually begins with one dolphin swimming off in a burst of speed. It then dives below the surface, circling a shoal of fish, stirring up mud along the way. On cue, the other dolphins in the group move into position, forming a barrier to block off any underwater escape routes. As the circle of mud rises to the surface, the mullet are trapped. Their only option is to leap clear out of the water and unwittingly straight into the open mouths of the waiting dolphins.\nThere is still much to learn about these flexible problem-solvers, but from the evidence so far, it seems that dolphins do indeed deserve their reputation for being highly intelligent.\nMore on dolphin intelligence\nZoologist Anuschka de Rohan produced last month\u2019s Wildlife on One programme, Dolphins - Deep Thinkers?

There are so many fascinating similarities between these marine mammals that we often forget their differences. To get the full scope on these amazing sea animals, let\u2019s start by talking about the general differences between whale species.First thing\u2019s first: all dolphins are whales, but not all whales are dolphins. That\u2019s because the Cetacean order of sea animals encompasses dolphins, porpoises and what we think of as whales. And Cetacean is derived from the Greek word for whale, ketos.It may sound confusing, but all dolphins are simply smaller types of whales. The whale order (Cetacea) is divided into several different families, one of them being Delphinidae (this includes all oceanic dolphin species). For example, Killer whales are the largest member of this dolphin family, so they are both a whale and a dolphin at the same time.Because they belong to the Cetacean order,dolphins and whales share mammalian traits like warm blood, hair, and lung-based breathing. Other physical similarities include fins on their tails called flukes, streamlined bodies adapted for swimming and, in some cases, dorsal fins on their backs.There are two types of whales out there, baleen, or Mysticeti, and toothed, also known as Odontoceti. In mysticeti whales, stiff plates of baleen grow down from the gums of the upper jaw. These plates are perfect for filtering vast quantities of water and trapping all the plankton and other small creatures inside their mouths.When it comes to breathing, whales and humans alike are limited by their lung capacities. However whales\u2019 lungs can hold much more oxygen than land-walkers, meaning they can stay under water for much longer before they have to come up for air. Whales also use blowholes to breathe\u2014some even have two! The plankton-eating baleen whale has two blowholes, whereas whales with teeth have just one.Toothed whales have the ability to echolocate. This means they emit various clicking sounds through the water and wait for the rebounding sound waves to indicate where their prey is. Echolocation also enhances their communication abilities. Baleen whales such as humpbacks and blue whales communicate through a series of \u201csongs,\u201d but not echolocation. When it comes to the loudness between whales and dolphins, the competition is tight. Dolphins\u2019 clicks, whistles and pulsed sounds can reach up to 220 decibels. For reference, 150 decibels is loud enough to burst a human\u2019s eardrum. However, the sperm whale\u2019s echolocation clicks have been measured upwards around 230 decibels.Whales and dolphins share social patterns of communication such as teaching each other various hunting techniques, learning, cooperating with one another and even exhibiting \u2018grief\u2019 over lost members of their pod. Dolphins\u2019 advanced communication abilities forge strong bonds within their pods, and dolphins have even been witnessed assisting injured or sick whales. One of the most impressive characteristics is the dolphins\u2019 ability to call to each other using signature whistles. Dolphins use these unique whistles to communicate identity, location, and to address other individuals. We often use nicknames; perhaps dolphins use click-names.Both whales and dolphins are incredible species that we should all continue to learn from, and about.

Dolphins aren't fish but are aquatic mammals. Like other mammals, they are warm-blooded, give birth to live young, feed their babies milk, and breathe air with their lungs, not through gills. Some common characteristics of dolphins include:\nStreamlined bodies. They swim by moving their tail up and down, thus propelling themselves forward.\nA pronounced beak. Rather than a squared-off or gradually tapering head, dolphins have an obvious beak-like rostrum.\nOne blowhole. Compare this to baleen whales, which have two.\nMammalian temperature. A dolphin's body temperature is very similar to ours\u2014about 98 degrees. But dolphins have a layer of blubber to keep them warm.\nDo you know what dolphin and cattle have in common? A female dolphin is called a cow, a male is a bull, and the babies are calves! Dolphins are carnivores (meat eaters). They eat marine life such as fish and squid.\nDolphins have great eyesight and use this along with echolocation to move about in the ocean and locate and identify objects around them. They also communicate with clicks and whistles.\nDolphins develop their own personal whistle, which is distinct from other dolphins'.

This projected that all the world\u2019s commercially exploited fish species would have experienced collapse by 2048 (based on the extrapolation of regression in Fig. 3A to 100% in the year 2048), i.e., that to continue to commercially exploit these populations would become impossible by 2048.\nhttps://news.stanford.edu/news/2006/november8/ocean-110806.html\nCritics of the film have said that this projection date was corrected in the 2009 paper \u2018Rebuilding Global Fisheries\u2019 (reference below), authored by Worm and others, including fisheries scientists (who analyse marine populations from a business perspective using measurements such as maximum yield from fisheries rather than markers of species conservation by marine conservationists). The 2009 paper does not correct, but rather cites the earlier paper, showing that some rates of decline had slowed since 2006 (in \u20185 out of 10 ecosystems\u2018) but that 63% of assessed fish \u2018stocks\u2019 worldwide \u2018required rebuilding\u2019. Furthermore, fish populations in places with little management capacity \u2013 mainly the developing world and constituting a majority of fish landed \u2013 are faring much worse than those with better resources for management.\n(https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/338/6106/517.full.pdf ).\nIn summary, the 2006 study has not been corrected or retracted, and has been cited over 3,000 times. Many of its critics are industry-funded, including the most quoted author Professor Ray Hilborn, who, according to his own website, receives funding from the fishing industry. (according to Greenpeace over $3.5 million: https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/research/overfishing-denier/; his industry funding was largely undeclared until the Greenpeace investigation)\nhttps://t.co/a3gS0hDQQR?amp=1\nIn 2016 Boris Worm in his paper \u2018Averting a Global Fisheries Disaster\u2019 again found the outlook very poor, summarising that population health had in fact declined since his original study, and that 88% of \u2018stocks\u2019 would be overfished and well below their target biomass by 2050.\nhttps://www.pnas.org/content/113/18/4895\nFurther, in 2018, the Secretary-General of UNCTAD (Mukhisa Kituyi) and the UN Secretary General\u2019s Special Envoy for the Ocean and Co-Chair, Peter Thomson reported that nearly 90% of typical fish stocks in the oceans will be gone by 2050 (link below), saying global subsidies for large commercial fishing must stop.\nhttps://unctad.org/news/90-fish-stocks-are-used-fisheries-subsidies-must-stop\nhttps://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/07/fish-stocks-are-used-up-fisheries-subsidies-must-stop/\nLastly, in 2020, an FAO report used figures up to 2018 which show that 59.6% of fish stocks are \"maximally sustainably fished\" and 34.2% of stocks are \"fished at biologically unsustainable levels\". In summary, 93.8% of fish stocks are either biologically unsustainable or at their maximum level of exploitation.\nhttp://www.fao.org/fisheries/en/\nThere is a problem of moving goalposts that is unacknowledged in most of the above assessments: the target stock size at which a fishery is considered to be sustainable has been lowered over the last couple of decades by fisheries scientists. This means that without any improvement in management, more fish stocks are considered sustainable today than they were three decades ago\nhttps://academic.oup.com/icesjms/advance-article/doi/10.1093/icesjms/fsaa224/6050569?login=true\nThe outcome of this altered approach \u2013which lacks a sound basis in ecological science \u2013 is that fishing is more risky, with a greater probability of causing population collapse, has more impacts on the environment and ocean health, and reduces resilience of ocean ecosystems to global change.\n\u200b"}

Burmeister\u2019s porpoise (P. spinipinnis) has blunt tubercles on its dorsal fin and lives off the coasts of eastern and western South America. The spectacled porpoise (P. dioptrica) is named for the patchlike pigmentation pattern around its eyes and is distributed throughout the southern Indian, Atlantic, and Pacific oceans.\nBritannica Quiz Know Your Mammals Quiz Where can you find a capybara?

Active and gregarious, it often rides the bow waves of ships. The Dall porpoise is black with a large white patch on each side of the body. It is usually seen in groups of 2 to 20 along the northern rim of the Pacific Ocean, where it eats squid and fish. True\u2019s porpoise (P. dalli truei) is considered by some authorities to be a separate subspecies and is distinguished from the Dall porpoise by its absence of the striking white body patches. It is found only near Japan.\nThe finless porpoises (Neophocaena phocaenoides and N. asiaeorientalis) are small slow-moving inhabitants of coastal waters and rivers along the Indian Ocean and western Pacific Ocean. Black above and white below, finless porpoises have a rounded head. Unlike other porpoises, they lack a dorsal fin entirely. Finless porpoises live alone or in small groups and eat crustaceans, fish, and squid. Both species are considered vulnerable; however, the population of the Yangtze finless porpoise (N. asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis), a subspecies of narrow-ridged finless porpoise found only in the Yangtze River, has declined significantly since 1984. It was classified as a critically endangered species by the IUCN in 2013.\nMembers of the family Phocoenidae are related to the oceanic dolphins (family Delphinidae), river dolphins, and other toothed whales of the suborder Odontoceti. The common name is derived from the Latin porcus (\u201chog\u201d or \u201cpig\u201d) and piscinus (\u201cfish\u201d), as their flesh was said to taste somewhat like pork."}

The sound they make can reach up to 188 decibels (anything over 120-130 is painful for humans). Only the sperm whale makes a louder sound.\nThe tongue of a blue whale weighs as much as an elephant and is so big a whole football team could stand on it.\nMost blue whales migrate to cold waters to find food and to warmer waters to breed. Females usually give birth to a calf once every two or three years after a gestation period (pregnancy) of up to 12 months.\nA blue whale calf can drink 250 litres of its mother's milk every day. It is weaned after around six months.\nThe major blood vessel of a blue whale\u2019s heart is so big that a baby could crawl through it.\nDuring their four-month migration, they eat very little, surviving mostly on reserves of blubber.\nAlthough hunting blue whales has been banned for a long time, they are still an endangered species with an estimated worldwide population of 10,000 - 25,000.\nBlue whales may be encountered on whale watching trips operating in locations such as Iceland, Canada (Gulf of St Lawrence), California, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Australia."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Mongoose Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Mongoose-facts.html", "text": "mongoose Facts\nAlthough they appear remarkably similar to weasels in form and lifestyle, mongooses are actually members of the superfamily feliforma, or \"cat-like\" carnivores, while weasels are in the superfamily caniforma or \"dog-like\" carnivores.\nAnd yes - the plural of mongoose is mongooses - not mongeese!\nFeliforms and caniforms have significant differences in skull structure among other things, and are classified based on these complex, skeletal criteria. So the mongoose, which shares ancient ancestors with cats, is actually most closely related to the civet, and is in the same superfamily as the hyena and the leopard.\nSimply put, the mongoose is not a weasel. The meerkat, however, is a mongoose, but since it is such a popular little animal and is in its own genus, you can read about it here - Meerkat Facts.\nMost mongoose species are highly social animals living in busy groups of 6 to 40 individuals called \"packs\" or \"mobs\". Some particularly gregarious species like the Gambian mongoose may live in packs of 50 or more. These groups may be lead by an alpha male and female who are often the only two individuals who mate and reproduce.\nSome mongoose species live in a cooperative society where each member of the pack has a specific job and subsequent duties. Some are hunters, some stay behind and \"baby sit\". In this system, older or infirmed members and youngsters are often nurtured by the entire pack, with kills being brought back to the home front and generally freely shared.\nThe mongoose is a small animal but an excellent hunter, with keen senses of smell, sight and hearing, and remarkable reflexes. They hunt insects and small animals such as mice, rats, rabbits, lizards and snakes, including one of the most dangerous creatures on Earth - the dreaded King cobra. They are largely immune to the venom of scorpions and snakes, although repeated stings or strikes may sicken and even kill them.\nMongooses are remarkably bright animals that have complex social structures and have even displayed simple tool use. Several species of mongoose routinely crack open eggs, nuts, or shelled creatures such as crabs or mollusks by dropping or throwing them on rocks. Some will raise up on their hind legs with the item in their forepaws and drop it on a stone. Others have been observed hunched over like a football center, launching objects between their legs against a large stone or tree. This behavior is observed and practiced by youngsters until perfected. - Mongoose Facts\nhow does a mongoose kill a cobra?\nThe mongoose is notorious for one fascinating fact - their astounding ability to battle and kill some of the deadliest creatures on Earth. Native to India, the King cobra is the largest venomous snake in the world, capable of reaching a length of 20 feet and a weight of over 35 pounds. A bite from a King cobra can kill an adult human being in less than 30 minutes.\nIn the wild, there are only 2 things a King cobra must fear, people and mongooses. The mongoose is a constantly active hunter and forager that eats a wide variety of small prey animals and loves snakes in particular. All species of mongoose eat snakes regularly, but the slender mongoose and the grey mongoose are the two species most likely to confront and devour a King cobra.\nFirst, their habitats overlap, second, these mongooses are some of the largest species, and third, practice makes perfect. A confrontation between a mongoose and a cobra is not an everyday event, but it is not uncommon either. In general, the mongoose is the cobras only natural predator other than human beings.\nKing cobras actually eat other snakes as their main diet, as well as small animals like rats and birds. Many of the things they eat are larger than a typical mongoose, but the King cobra wants no part of the mongoose. The snake will try to avoid confrontation if it runs into a mongoose, but will stand its ground once cornered and defend itself if it can't get away.\nThe mongoose is incredibly, blurringly swift and is capable of dodging the strikes of the also very swift cobra, but the mongoose also possesses something called acetylcholine receptors which make it , not fully immune, but relatively tolerant of cobra venom. When it makes its move, the mongoose leaps, teeth bared, directly for the head of the snake. If the mongoose grabs the snake correctly it will kill it by biting right into its skull.\nThe cobra may wrap around the mongoose but will usually succumb to the mongooses attack in a matter of moments If the mongooses first leap is inaccurate, it may be bitten.\nIf the cobra bites the mongoose more than once, the mongoose may loose the battle and become the cobras dinner. It is thought that mongooses win about 75 to 80% of these encounters, and they will eat the cobra, venom sacs and all.\nA king cobras venom is not poison, it is a modified saliva that must be injected into the victim in order to be lethal, so the mongoose is free to consume the entire body of its neutralized victim. - Mongoose Facts\nsome of the many mongoose species\nmongoose reproduction\nMongoose mother and baby\nThe numerous species of mongooses have many different lifestyles and reproductive strategies.\nSome live in groups where only the alpha male and female will reproduce. In these packs the rest of the gang will help with the raising of just a few youngsters from this select breeding.\nOther species live in larger colonies where the females have synchronized estrus cycles. All the females will mate with the most dominant males and they will all give birth within hours of each other.\nThe babies will be raised by the entire colony, and when the members of these packs leave the den to forage, several \"babysitters\" will stay behind and mind the huge, communal litter of pups.\nA few mongoose species are solitary animals with males and females only coming together to mate once a year. With these species the male may stay to help raise the litter of 2 to 6 babies called pups, or the female may raise her pups alone.\nIn some mongoose societies, young pups beg all the adults in the pack for food but eventually choose one adult, called an \"escort\" who will provide that individual pup with food until the youngster can fend for itself at about 5 months old.\nA baby mongoose spends most of its time playing and wrestling with litter mates while the adults in the pack forage. When an adult uncovers a beetle, digs up a millipede or snatches an egg, the pups forget about play and beg for a meal using high-pitched chirps like baby birds. Youngsters of most species remain with their family group for life. - Mongoose Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

They are sometimes referred to as red meerkats although both animals are in their own genus. The yellow mongoose lives in busy colonies and digs large and fairly elaborate dens with multiple rooms and tunnels. They often peacefully share their dens with ground squirrels. The colony will usually start the day by slowly emerging from their burrow and lounging about the entrance sunbathing and grooming each other. Then they will set off to forage for their favorite foods - big bugs.\nBasically an insectivore, the yellow mongoose relishes scorpions, millipedes, beetles and roaches. Birds eggs, the occasional mouse or lizard and some unfortunate snakes round out the menu, but bugs are by far the bulk of their diet.\nYellow mongoose packs usually consist of an alpha male and female and assorted relatives. Youngsters are commonly cared for by the entire family, and older or less able individuals are often nurtured by the group as a whole, supplied with food, and protected by all the members of the pack. - Mongoose Facts\nbanded mongoose facts\nThe banded mongoose is a medium sized species of mongoose weighing about 5 pounds. They live in big social groups with several dominant males who not only routinely mark their territory but also the other members in the group with their scent glands.\nThe banded mongoose has several very unique habits and has become famous for its interaction with other species of animals. Bandeds have been observed foraging with troops of chacma baboons and co-existing rather peacefully. Some baboons have been observed stroking and even holding mongooses as if they were pets. Mostly, the two species must find some safety in numbers as they forage.\nIn another interesting example of inter-species activity, banded mongooses have been regularly observed grooming warthogs. Individuals have been seen climbing on the backs of these potentially very dangerous animals and carefully removing ticks and other irritants.\nThis species of mongoose in particular, has shown amazing adaptive abilities, and their cooperation with other species is matched only by teamwork within their own pack.\nIf startled or threatened a pack of banded mongooses has a unique and unsettling defense mechanism. Sometimes referred to as \"mobbing\" the entire group will mass together in a tightly packed formation and charge their opponent as one. While charging they will scream, churl and holler, but most unnervingly they will rise up, sink down and writhe side to side creating the illusion of one single huge and convulsing animal.\nFew foes will stand their ground against a well executed banded mongoose mobbing, and many a hyena, leopard or lion has been sent fleeing from the sight! - Mongoose Facts\ndwarf mongoose facts\nThe smallest of the mongoose species, the tiny dwarf mongoose is only 7 to 10 inches long and lives in social groups of up to 20 individuals. The dwarf mongoose pack moves about its large territory using numerous termite mounds, caves and tree hollows as shelters for a few days at a time. Termite mounds are a favorite, and they will renovate the structures to suit their needs, adding rooms and widening tunnels.\nThey mark their territory with anal gland secretions, rubs of their cheek glands, and the strategic placement of communal latrines, where all members defecate in a concentrated pile. The dwarf mongoose pack is usually led by a dominant female who chooses new den sites and directions of travel. Generally she is the only female to mate and will often produce three litters a year. The pups, usually 2 to 5 per litter, will be raised by the entire pack. Subordinate females within the group lactate and actually nurse the dominant females pups.\nLike the banded mongoose, the dwarf mongoose has been seen collaborating with other species. They are often seen together with birds of the hornbill species, each creature benefiting from the others heightened senses and alerting each other of predators as they forage. - Mongoose Facts\na few more mongoose facts\nA group of mongooses is called a \"mob\" a \"pack\" a \"gang\" or a \"troop\"\nThe mongoose is not a weasel\nThe meerkat is a species of mongoose\nSome mongoose species live in abandoned termite mounds\nThe mongoose was made famous in the jungle book story \"Rikki tikki tavi\" by Rudyard Kipling, a short story about an Indian grey mongoose.\nSeveral species of mongoose show an example of simple tool use by throwing or dropping eggs, shellfish and nuts against rocks to open them.\nThe mongoose has horizontal pupils.\nMost mongoose species have very high tolerance to scorpion and snake venom -Mongoose Facts!\nthe mongoose is a\ncarnivorous (meat-eating)\ndiurnal (active during the day)\nterrestrial (lives on ground) digitigrade(walks on toes)\nfeliform (cat-like carnivore)\nmammal (animal with mammary glands and hair follicles) Scientific Classification\nClass - Mammalia\nOrder - Feliforma\nFamily - Herpestidae\nGenus - 18\nSpecies - 37 MONGOOSE - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT male female pup, puppy usually colony GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD gang, pack Europe, Asia, Africa grasslands,desert insects, mice ENEMIES AVG.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Seal Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Seal-facts.html", "text": "seal Facts\nPortrait of a Seal\nThe true seals, also known as the earless seals and the crawling seals, are over 18 species of semi-aquatic marine mammals of the family Phocidae. They are one of three families within the super family known as pinnipeds.\nPinniped means feather(pinni) foot(ped) in Latin. The other two families are the walrus, alone in its own genus, and the sea lions.\nSea lions and fur seals are known as eared seals or walking seals. True seals differ from sea lions in that they have no external ears, and are unable to walk on all-fours as the sea lions can.\nThe fur seals are also in the sea lion family and are not true seals, although they are called by the name \"seal\", but all the pinnipeds, seals, walruses and sea lions, are all seals, as lions and cheetahs and domestic cats are all cats. So it is not wrong to call a sea lion or a walrus a seal, just as it would not be wrong to call a jaguar or a mountain lion a cat, just a little less accurate.\nThe seals ancient ancestors were land animals, probably somewhat similar to otters.\nFor reasons unknown, these terrestrial creatures returned to the ocean about 20 million years ago, where they have since become the most successful and widely distributed family of carnivores in the world.\nSeals live mostly in very cold, often frozen environments, and their bodies are layered in blubber to protect them from the elements. Blood actually migrates to the exterior layers of blubber when the animal needs to cool down, and flows back to the interior layers, close to the bodies core, when the temperature is colder.\nThe body of a seal is specifically structured for life in the water, with a smooth, torpedo shaped torso, and flattened, powerful flippers, like four large swim fins instead of feet. In fact, the swim-fins scuba divers and backyard snorkelers use were modeled after the unique, compressed and web-toed feet of a seal.\nMost seal species live in very large social groups called colonies that may come together to sunbathe in masses of hundreds, and take to the beach to mate and raise young in tightly packed gatherings of thousands.\nOn land they are extremely cumbersome, and must move their often enormous bodies by wriggling almost like a worm. Some species move around by bouncing, some pull themselves forward with their front flippers, and many seals will also occasionally roll their bodies one or two revolutions to one side or the other if they wish to move short distances.\nIn the ocean though, seals swim with exceeding grace and swiftness, using all four flippers for both propulsion and steering. Some species can dive 1000 feet deep and remain submerged for over an hour.\nThey have larger volumes of blood and a greater concentration of oxygen in the blood than any land animals, and they expel all oxygen from their lungs before they dive, avoiding issues such as \"the bends\".\nIn dives as deep as 1000 feet and as long as 100 minutes, their special bodies survive on only the oxygen in their blood.\nseal lifestyle and reproduction\nThere are over 18 species of true seals, most of which display varying extents of sexual dimorphism - an obvious difference in appearance between males and females. Depending on the species, male seals can be larger than females by as much as five times, and in several species, such as the hooded and elephant seals, mature males have distinct pendulous noses and other facial features.\nSeals are highly social and desire close contact, but don't really have close relationships. They may move about among hundreds of other seals happily communing with dozens of individuals. Although they live in large groups seals are solitary hunters diving several hundred feet deep in search of fish, crustaceans and squid.\nLifestyle naturally varies among the many species, but seals, in general, are promiscuous, and males do not contribute to the raising of young. Seals migrate between breeding grounds and feeding grounds, traveling several hundred to up to two thousand miles a year.\nWhen females arrive at the breeding grounds, which are called rookeries, the males have already staked claims to prime areas, battling each other with loud roaring, charges and sometimes violent contests.\nFemales arrive already pregnant from the previous season, and give birth to one baby, called a pup, within a few days of arriving. After the birth of the baby the mother seal will remain on land for up to 6 weeks, nursing the pup till it is three times its birth weight.\nIn some species, such as the familiar harp seal, the mother fasts for a few weeks, doing nothing but nursing her newborn, then, after only 4 to 5 weeks, she leaves the pup for good, returning to the ocean to mate again.\nThe harp seal pups are snow white in color to camouflage them in their snowy environment, which is critical over the next week or two, as they begin to forage and fend for themselves.\nOther seals spend more time nurturing their young ones, but many species use this method of complete dedication by the mother for a few weeks and then basically a cold turkey abandonment.\nGroups of forlorn pups gather on beaches calling for their mothers and falling prey to killer whales, and polar bears. Eventually the strongest survivors take to the water and find their way to the feeding grounds which may be hundreds of miles away.\nwhat is the difference between seals and sea lions?\nseal on the beach\nsea lion running\nSea lions are members of the seal or pinniped family. The word pinniped means \"flipper feet\" or \"feather feet\" and includes three types of semi-aquatic marine mammals. The walrus, the \"true seals\" and the \"eared seals\" or \"walking seals\".\nThere are 7 species of sea lions and 9 species of fur seals that make up the \"earred seals\".\nEared seals differ from true seals in that they have external ears, larger, more powerful forelimbs, and can rotate their hind limbs forward and beneath them. These differences in skeletal structure allow the sea lion and fur seal to not only sit in a semi-upright position, (that classic pose), but also to walk and even run on all-fours.\nIn contrast, the rear limbs of true seals are fused together and are permanently facing rearward making walking impossible.\nAll pinnipeds, even walruses, are considered seals, in the same broad sense that leopards are considered cats, so it is not incorrect to call a sea lion a seal, just less precise.\nEared seals spend a great deal of time on land, breeding and sunning on the shores. With long, powerful front flippers, their natural position is upright with the chest raised off the ground. Their rear legs are two separate, front-facing flippers that can be rotated under the body, and they can rise up and move around with a two beat gate.\nAlso often referred to as the \"walking seals\", the eared seals can actually walk, and even run, quite rapidly when necessary.\nThe \"true seals\" have no external ear flaps, smaller front flippers and rearward facing hind limbs that are fused together into one scalloped flipper. They move across land by stretching their upper bodies out and arching their backs to pull themselves forward.\nTrue seals also swim differently from eared seals, getting most of their propulsion from their fused, tail-like rear flippers and undulating motions similar to a dolphin to propel themselves, while the eared seals use their strong front flippers as big, highly effective oars, appearing to fly through the water like birds.\nWalruses have skeletons designed more like the eared seals, but have no ears. They move like the true seals in the water, but like the eared seals on land, and so are somewhere in between these two groups, and are classified in a genus of their own. - Seal Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

These noses are multi-chambered and can be inflated with air to help the male make incredibly loud roars which intimidate rivals and impress females.\nThe female Southern elephant seal averages about 10 ft in total length, but the male Southern elephant seal averages 16 feet in length and weighs over 7000 pounds. The biggest adult males can be almost 20 feet long and top 8500 pounds.\nThe elephant seal is not only the largest pinniped, (way bigger than a walrus) but also the largest terrestrial carnivore, dwarfing such animals as African lions (826 pounds record weight) and polar bears,(2209 pounds record weight).\nFound on the beaches of New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa, the Southern elephant seal is land-bound for two separate one month long periods each year.\nFirst is mating season where males will remain on the beach and fast for weeks while establishing territories, and females will fast while feeding newborns. Males may battle fiercely during this time and things can get violent.\nMost adult male elephant seals have many scars from battles with sharp-toothed rivals. After breeding season, they return to the water to refuel, but then beach themselves again for molting season, where they return to their mating grounds to lounge about while they regrow their top layer of skin and fur in one 30 day marathon.\nElephant seals are the most adept deep sea divers of any pinniped capable of underwater excursions of 100 minutes or more without taking a breath. - Elephant Seal Facts\nelephant seal big bulls battle\nlife on the ice\nroaring leopard seal\nThe majority of seal species are located in some of the coldest environments in the world. Some species spend the majority of their lives on or under the Arctic ice cap coming up for air at strategic holes that they create themselves.\nSeals in these icy regions are well equipped with strong, sharp claws on their front flippers that they dig breathing holes with. They can maintain breathing holes through layers of ice up to 6 feet thick with constant tending.\nSome Arctic seals like the ringed seal, a staple of the polar bears diet, actually dig out caves in the snow that covers their breathing holes. They hollow out an area known as a lair, and under the snow cover they can come up out of the water.\nRinged seals raise their pups in the lairs and usually maintain more than one at a time so they can avoid predators. Polar bears have an astounding sense of smell, however, and can detect seals hiding in lairs.\nThe vastness of the Arctic is the seals best defense, but if a polar bear does discover its hiding spot, the ringed seal still has a good chance of escaping back down the breathing hole into the ocean water below before the bear can claw its way though the ceiling of hard packed snow from above.\nAnother notorious ice dwelling seal is the rather fierce leopard seal. These very unique seal species take some of the largest prey of all pinnipeds, such as penguins and other seal species.\nBut as impressive a hunter as they are, one of their dietary staples is the tiny invertebrate called krill. Leopard seals teeth are specially designed to sieve krill out of mouthfuls of sea water.\nThey are by far the most solitary of the seal species, living alone on the ice floes of Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands. The leopard seal earns its name with its spotted coat, its effective hunting style, and its often gaping mouthful of dagger sharp teeth.\nseals on ice - hunting and hunted\nall in the colony, all in the raft\nA group of seals on land is called a colony, and a group of seals in the water is called a raft.\nSeals can come together during breeding season and at certain popular breeding grounds in masses of hundreds, and sometimes thousands. Crowding is not a problem, in fact close body contact is desired by most seal species.\nThere is lots of lounging, floating, feeding and noisy discussion in the life of a seal. A raft of seals floating in the water may appear to be a larger creature to some predators who will think twice.\nSeals in water will regulate their body temperature by raising a flipper or tail out into the air. Many seal species spend equal amounts of time on land and sea, preferring isolated beaches, rocky outcrops and ice floats.\nPopular lounging areas are called \"haul outs\" or the term can be used to describe the activity, as in \"the seals are hauled out on the beach.\" Some species, such as elephant seals and leopard seals spend the majority of their lives in the water, only coming on land to molt once a year, and fight for breeding territory.\nMating itself takes place both on land and in the water, depending on species.\nMolting requires seals to remain on land where they can more easily regulate their temperature. Fur can be seen sloughing off seals and sea lions in huge chunks during this period.\nWhile human beings loose skin cells on a daily basis, and may replace 10 pounds of epidermis a year in tiny increments, molting involves the complete replacement of the epidermis skin and fur in the course of just a few weeks,\na few more seal facts\nSeals are known as the true seals, the earless seals or the crawling seals\nA male seal is called a bull, a female is called a cow, and a baby is called a pup\nA group of seals is called a colony on land, and a raft when in the water.\nThe male Southern elephant seal can grow to the size of a small truck weighing over 7000 pounds and measuring over 16 feet long.\nSome seals can stay underwater for up to an hour without taking a breath\nSeals replace their skin and their fur every year in one 30 day long molt.\nSeal the seal is a\ncarnivorous (meat-eating)\ndiurnal (awake during the day)\naquatic (lives in and near water)\npinniped(webbed digits)\nphocid (true seal family) mammal (animal with mammary glands and hair follicles)\nScientific Classification\nClass - Mammalia\nOrder - Carnivora\nGenus - Phocidae\nSpecies - phoca Seal Facts - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT bull cow pup group GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD colony, raft varied oceans fish, squid ENEMIES ENDANGERED TOP SPEED GENDER DIFFERENCE shark, orca polar bear threatened 25 mph Males often much larger LENGTH\nFEMALE WEIGHT FEMALE LENGTH MALE WEIGHT MALE 4 - 9 feet 130 - 1500 pounds 5 - 18 feet 200 - 8000 pounds ESTRUS GESTATION BIRTH LENGTH BIRTH WEIGHT 1 x year 10 - 14 months 1 - 4 feet 10 - 50 pounds RAISED BY # OF YOUNG AT BIRTH EYES OPEN mother 1, rarely 2 furred, sighted at birth WEANED INDEPENDENT MATURITY LIFESPAN 12-16 months 2 years 4 - 10 years 10 - 30 years"}

The Amazon rainforest is known as one of the highest levels of biodiversity in the world. And this forest is home to thousands of species of birds, animals and creatures. Climate change, deforestation, poaching and pollution also play a role in the destruction of the Amazon rainforest habitat and endangered species. So let us gather a little more information about endangered animals in the rainforest facts.\nThe scientific name of this species is Ateles. The common spider monkey is also called the yellow monkey. Common spider monkeys are found not only in Peru but also in other South American countries such as Venezuela and Brazil. Common spider monkey feeds mainly on fruits, insects and roots.\nThe biggest threat to the common spider monkey is the hunting of human prey and the destruction of its habitat as the mining industry has taken over many areas where the life of the common spider monkey is evolving. This species gives great agility and is one of its characteristic very long organs.\n2. Giant Otters\nThe scientific name of this species is Pteronura brasiliensis. Giant Otters are known as one of the most beautiful animals in the Amazon rainforest wildlife. This species can grow up to 1.7 meters long and can be found in waterways passing through the forest. Thanks to the resistant whiskers and sharp eye of Giant Otters.\nGiant otters can easily recognize the movements of prey in the water. Giant Otters eat mostly fish. The hapless prey of the Giant Otters is its most representative threat. In addition, water pollution, habitat destruction and fishing in the area are the biggest risks from Giant Otters. Peru protects giant otters in several national parks.\n3. Golden Lion Tamarin\nThe scientific name of this species is Leontopithecus rosalia. The golden lion tamarin is known as a species of native monkey in Brazil. Golden lion tamarin weighs more or less 800 grams. The popular name for this species comes from its main which has a very strong orange color.\nThe golden lion tamarin is an endangered species native to the Atlantic coastal forests and the golden lion tamarin. In the latest census, 3,200 Golden lion tamarins remain in the wild. Golden lion tamarin is found to be extinct very fast. In Brazil, captives have retained about 490 Golden lion tamarins in 150 zoos.\n4. Hyacinth Macaw\nThe scientific name of this species is Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus. This species is known as a surprisingly beautiful bird. Hyacinth Macaw has rich blues and green feathers. The main threat to the survival of the Hyacinth Macaw magnificent bird is the illegal pet trade. Unfortunately Hyacinth Macaw has a market because of its splendor and this reduces the number seen in the wild.\nThis type of bird is native to Central and Eastern South America. The Hyacinth Macaw is about one meter long and is longer than other species of parrots. The Hyacinth Macaw is known as the largest Macaw and the largest flying parrot.\n5. Jaguar\nThe scientific name of this species is Panthera onca. The Jaguar is known as a large creeping species and the Jaguar is the only existing member of the Panthera genus native to America. This type of species is known as one of the most endangered species in the Amazon rainforest wildlife. The Jaguar is considered to be the largest cat in South America. And in the jungles of the Amazon there are unfortunately currently very few specimens of Jaguar.\nThe Jaguar weighs up to 120 kg with a length of up to 2.5 m. Jaguar is a good swimmer. Jaguar has a nocturnal habit. And this type of species is known as a solitary animal. Threats to this species include loss of habitat and fragmentation.\n6. Lazy Bear\nThe Lazy Bear is known as the most unique animal in the Amazon. Lazy Bear is well known for its lethargy. This type of species moves at a maximum speed of about 0.24 km / h. And Lazy Bear sleeps about 20 hours a day. This is because unlike other mammals. Lazy Bear lives in an atmosphere of 24 C to 33 C.\nThis species feeds on fruits, ants and hybrids. Lazy Bear is found to be extinct mainly due to habitat loss and degradation. This species has long, shaggy fur, around the face and long, sickle-shaped claws.\n7. Pink Amazon Dolphin\nThe scientific name of this species is Inia geoffrensis. This type of dolphin is also known as boto and bufeo. Pink Amazon dolphins live in the Amazon River basin and can be pink and pale blue. However the most common is that the Pink Amazon dolphin is albino. The Pink Amazon dolphin is one of five species of freshwater dolphins in the world.\nThis type of dolphin is endangered throughout the Amazon region, including Peru. The main threat to the endangered Pink Amazon dolphin is the construction of dams, canals and deviations in the natural course of rivers.\n8. The South American Tapir\nThe scientific name of this species is Tapirus terrestris. The South American Tapir is known as a very beautiful animal. The South American Tapir is a thriving mammal. The South American Tapir are astonishingly agile in sight and feeding on the earthenware pots found in the forest.\nThe South American Tapir is now thought to be in danger of extinction in Peru. Loss of accommodation in The South American Tapir, such as burning and logging, are its main risks. In addition, the South American Tapir is endangered as a result of poaching and the South American Tapir's habitat is destroyed by human activities.\n9. The Uakari Monkey\nThe scientific name of this species is Cacajao. The most notable feature of The Uakari Monkey is its unusually bright red face. This type of monkey derives its name from the Uakari tribe. The Uakari Monkey once lived in the Amazon but is now extinct. The Uakari Monkey is often seen nesting in trees and eating fruit hanging from branches.\nThe Uakari Monkey is a sensitive species. And The Uakari Monkey is included in the appendix to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Hunting and deforestation are the main factors in the decline of the Uakari Monkey. However, the Peruvian government considers The Uakari Monkey to be a protected species.\n10. White-Cheeked Spider Monkey\nThe scientific name of this species is Ateles marginatus. The White-Cheeked Spider Monkey is a kind of New World monkey. White-Cheeked Spider Monkey is a native of Brazil. The White-Cheeked Spider Monkey roams around the forest canopy in small family groups of two to four large groups of a few dozen animals.\nThis species feeds on fruits, leaves, flowers, bark, honey and small insects. The expansion of farmland in the Amazon rainforest and the creation of new roads through its territory have seen another Chiku tree-dweller reduce the number of White-Cheeked Spider Monkeys."}

Shocking Facts About Marine Park Cruelty", "url": "https://www.seaworldofhurt.com/features/is-seaworld-bad-animal-abuse-cruelty-facts/", "text": "Is SeaWorld bad? Compassionate people everywhere want to see animals treated humanely, and they have questions about places like SeaWorld. These days, the public has concerns about the complex needs of intelligent marine mammals\u2014like orcas and other dolphins\u2014and hates to see animals suffering in cramped tanks.\nSeaWorld has worked hard to create the illusion of being a \u201cconservation\u201d organization that cares for happy, healthy marine animals. But years of hard-hitting PETA campaigns and the eye-opening documentary Blackfish have exposed the marine park chain\u2019s lies.\nSo, is SeaWorld bad? Check out these shocking facts about the cruelty of marine parks to discover the truth:\nWhat Is SeaWorld? What Do Animals Endure There?\nSeaWorld is an entertainment company that puts animals in cramped concrete tanks at its marine parks across the country. It builds its business on the suffering of smart and social animals.\nConsider these facts:\nSeaWorld often keeps dolphins, whales, and other animals trapped with incompatible tankmates. The tension leads to fights and even fatal injuries. Staff members drug some animals to try to relieve their endless frustration. Orcas at SeaWorld parks often break their teeth from chewing on the metal bars and concrete walls of their tanks.\nWhere Is SeaWorld? Take Note: Never Vacation Here\nThere are three SeaWorld parks in the U.S.\nCalifornia: SeaWorld San Diego Florida: SeaWorld Orlando Texas: SeaWorld San Antonio\nA former location, SeaWorld Ohio, closed in 2000. SeaWorld Abu Dhabi is scheduled to open in 2022.\nBuying SeaWorld tickets funds animal suffering. You can help stop it: Never visit SeaWorld or any other marine park. After you finish reading this post, be sure to tell your friends and family why they should stay away, too.\nIs SeaWorld Bad or Good? Don\u2019t Buy the \u2018Humane Washing\u2019\nNo two ways around it\u2014SeaWorld is bad.\nAmong other horrors, here are just a few things that it\u2019s done to animals:\nEmployees drill out the inside of orcas\u2019 worn and broken teeth. Often, they use no painkillers. This drilling keeps the animals\u2019 teeth from becoming infected, but it does nothing to relieve the stress of being held in inadequate enclosures. SeaWorld trainers masturbated male orcas to collect sperm. The marine park company still does this to other dolphins today. Female animals are sexually abused and forcibly impregnated, and they\u2019re often drugged to prevent them from resisting. SeaWorld still offers touch tanks and other animal \u201cencounters,\u201d falsely teaching kids that it\u2019s OK to handle wildlife against their will. In late 2018, a PETA veterinarian observed dolphins at all three SeaWorld parks. She found animals with open wounds and extensive scarring on their faces and bodies. According to a scathing article from The Travel, SeaWorld forces every employee to participate in its conspiracy to conceal its cruelty from the public.\nHow Many Orcas Have Died at SeaWorld?\nMore than 40 orcas have died at SeaWorld parks, and the death toll continues to climb. Here\u2019s just one story:\nAn orca named Kasatka was imprisoned in a SeaWorld tank for nearly 40 years. Men abducted her from her ocean home when she was only a year old. She died in August 2017, after reportedly having suffered from a bacterial lung infection since at least 2008. Lesions covered her ailing body before her death. In addition, her mate, Kotar, was killed after a pool gate closed on his head, fracturing his skull.\nHave Other Animals Died at SeaWorld?\nOrcas aren\u2019t the only animals suffering at SeaWorld.\nA blind walrus named Obie spent his life trapped in a cramped tank at SeaWorld San Diego. He appeared to suffer from deep psychological distress, as he would press his mouth against the tank\u2019s glass and repeatedly regurgitate and re-swallow his food. This is a common neurotic behavior among captive animals, and it can cause serious health problems. In June 2015, after 18 years of living in a tank, Obie died. Approximately 400 pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses) have died at SeaWorld parks.\n[text-button text=\u201dLearn more about the orcas who have died at SeaWorld parks\u201d link=\u201dhttps://www.seaworldofhurt.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/infographic-SWOH-lives_stolen-12052019.png\u201d target=\u201d_blank\u201d color=\u201dfacebook\u201d size=\u201dmedium\u201d text_tag=\u201dstrong\u201d]\nMore than 60 bottlenose dolphins\u2014including 16 stillborn babies\u2014died at SeaWorld parks in just 10 years. Captive dolphins routinely die prematurely of infectious diseases at marine parks. More than 300 dolphins and whales have died on SeaWorld\u2019s watch.\nCaptive dolphins routinely die prematurely of infectious diseases at marine parks.\nSeaWorld abducted a beluga whale named Nanuq from his home waters at the age of 6. He was used for artificial insemination. Workers removed him from the water about 42 times, and then they collected his sperm. Six of his babies died at birth or shortly thereafter. After an interaction with another animal shattered his jaw, Nanuq died.\nHow Many Workers Have Died at Marine Parks Like SeaWorld?\nOrca aggression toward humans is nearly nonexistent in nature, but the constant stress of living in captivity causes them to lash out.\nSeaWorld\u2019s incomplete incident log, as of 2011, documented more than 100 incidents of orca aggression at its parks. These attacks often resulted in injuries to humans. Here are a few incidents:\nOn February 21, 1991, Sealand of the Pacific trainer Keltie Byrne fell into a pool containing three orcas. One of them, Tilikum, pulled her to the bottom of the tank, and she ultimately drowned. It took Sealand employees two hours to recover her body from the orcas. She was the first of three humans who were killed because of Tilikum\u2019s frustration and confinement. All three orcas held at Sealand of the Pacific were later sold to SeaWorld. Years of stressful captivity caused Tilikum to exhibit further aggression toward humans, which ultimately cost two more lives. He killed Daniel P. Dukes in 1999 and Dawn Brancheau in 2010. Tilikum scalped and dismembered Dawn, breaking bones throughout her body before drowning her. In 2006, SeaWorld flew an orca named Keto and three other orca calves halfway around the world, from San Diego to Loro Parque in Spain\u2019s Canary Islands. A SeaWorld senior trainer reportedly supervised the training session when Keto killed trainer Alexis Martinez in 2009. Since then, SeaWorld has tried to distance itself from Loro Parque, ultimately transferring ownership of the four orcas to the Spanish facility.\nWhat Happened to SeaWorld After Blackfish\nBlackfish is a game-changing 2013 documentary that exposed some of SeaWorld\u2019s most shocking abuse.\nAfter the film\u2019s release, SeaWorld lost many corporate sponsors. Scores of famous musicians canceled scheduled performances at SeaWorld parks. As part of an aggressive response to criticism, the company even sent a spy to PETA protests in order to incite illegal activity. In 2018, SeaWorld and its former CEO agreed to pay $5 million to settle charges that the company misled investors about the negative impact that Blackfish was having on its business. After 33 years in captivity, Tilikum, the \u201ckiller whale\u201d star subject of Blackfish, died in a SeaWorld tank.\nWhat Is Shamu\u2019s Story? What Happened to Her?\nIn 1965, an orca named Shamu performed in the first-ever orca show at SeaWorld.\nShe was kidnapped from her mother in the open ocean. During Shamu\u2019s capture, men shot her mother with a harpoon. They killed her right in front of Shamu. Shamu died six years later in captivity. SeaWorld continued to name other orcas Shamu for years to come.\nMore Shocking Facts About SeaWorld: Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Marine Park Cruelty\nThe company abducted some of the orcas it still imprisons today from their homes in the ocean. Workers at SeaWorld facilities have to cover the skin of sunburned orcas with black zinc oxide to hide burns and blisters from the public. With nowhere deep to dive, many animals trapped at SeaWorld can\u2019t escape the hot rays of the sun. In 2017, SeaWorld separated two bonded polar bears\u2014Szenja and Snowflake\u2014after they\u2019d spent 20 years together, leaving Szenja without any other members of her species to interact with. She died two months later\u2014likely from a broken heart. It may be surprising, but SeaWorld trainers often have no formal background in marine biology, because the main purpose of the parks is to entertain and put on a \u201cgood show\u201d for visitors. Informing people about the natural lives, foraging behavior, and habitats of the animals held prisoner there is not the parks\u2019 primary concern.\nYou Can Help Animals Trapped at SeaWorld Today\nThe question isn\u2019t \u201cis SeaWorld Bad?\u201d It\u2019s \u201cjust how bad is SeaWorld?\u201d\n[peta-video youtube=\u201dslLD7v_h7CM\u201d][peta-video youtube=\u201dMmABrxzZPDc\u201d]\nSeaWorld has received hundreds of thousands of calls from compassionate people to modernize its parks, stop using animals for entertainment, and move those held in tanks to seaside sanctuaries. However, it hasn\u2019t listened.\nThe good news is that you can help animals at SeaWorld right now, and it doesn\u2019t matter where you are.

They are the only whales that have them. The tusk is a hollow tooth, which always spirals counter-clockwise from the left side of the skull. It can measure 2.5 to 2.7 m long (8 to 9 ft.). Most narwhals have just one tusk, but narwhals with two tusks have been reported. Almost exclusively seen in males, there are only scattered reports of females developing a tusk. Narwhals have no other visible teeth in their jaws. Like the beluga whales, narwhals lack a dorsal fin and instead have a dorsal ridge. Mature narwhals tend to have a black and white spotted coloration the dorsal region of their body, while older narwhals may be almost completely white. Narwhal calves typically are a blotchy gray. Size Newborn calves average 1.6 m (5.25 ft.) in length\nMale: Minus the tusk, adult male narwhals measure up to 5 m (16.1 ft.) long\nFemale: Females are smaller, with a size up to 4 m (13 ft.) in length Weight At birth, calves can weigh as much as 80 kg (176 lbs.)\nMale: Mature males weigh up to 1,600 kg (3,200 lbs.)\nFemale: Adult females can reach a weight of up to 900 kg (2,000 lbs.) Diet Fish, squid, and shrimp make up the Narwhal\u2019s diet, especially Arctic fish species, such as Greenland Halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), Arctic Cod (Boreogadus saida), and Polar Cod (Arctogadus glacialis). Gestation 14 to 15 months Estral Period Throughout the winter and spring with a peak in April Nursing Duration At least 12 months Sexual Maturity Male: 8 to 9 years\nFemale: 4 to 7 years Life Span Up to 50 years Range Narwhals primarily inhabit the Atlantic sector of the Arctic and are rare in the Pacific sector. The principal distribution is from the central Canadian Arctic, eastward to Greenland and into the eastern Russian Arctic. They are rarely observed in the far eastern Russian Arctic, Alaska, or the western Canadian Arctic. In summer, narwhals spend approximately two months in high Arctic ice-free shallow bays and fjords and overwinter in offshore, deep, ice-covered habitats along the continental slope. Habitat The migrations of narwhals closely follow the movement of loose pack ice. Seasonal distributions are connected by extensive annual migrations (over 1,000 km) which last approximately 2 months. Population Global: Total global abundance of more than 170,000 whales, however this does not include Northeast Greenland or the Russian Arctic for which no estimates are available. Ten subpopulations number more than 10,000 individuals, and two subpopulations number more than 35,000. While Narwhals occur broadly in Arctic waters, their distribution, movements, and genetic characteristics suggest the existence of about 12 discrete or semi-discrete subpopulations or management stocks. Status IUCN: Least concern\nCITES: Appendix II\nUSFWS: Not listed\nFun Facts\nNarwhals and Belugas are the only members of the family Monodontidae. Some theorize that males \"joust\" with their tusks or use them to poke their way through ice floes or even to skewer prey. These theories are unlikely. If the tusk were damaged, it could lead to severe infections and death for the narwhal. The tusk probably serves as a secondary sexual characteristic for males, indicating which males are older and more mature. Contrary to common belief, narwhals do not spear fish with their tusks, but instead suck prey into their mouth and then swallow it whole. Narwhals travel farther north than perhaps any other whale species. They are well adapted for life in frigid water, with blubber accounting for up to 35% of their body weight for insulation.\nEcology and Conservation\nKiller whales and Greenland sharks preyed upon narwhals, but the main enemy of narwhals is man. Since some believe their tusks possess almost magical healing and aphrodisiac properties, they are still illegally hunted today. As with other whales, both national and international laws protect narwhals.\nBibliography\nJefferson, T.J. Leatherwood, S. and M.A. Webber. FAO Species Identification Guide.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Pig Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Pig-facts.html", "text": "pig Facts\nPortrait of a Pig\nOne of the most useful pig facts is that pigs do not have many sweat glands, so the term \"sweats like a pig\" is quite inaccurate! All pigs and pig species are descended from a rabbit-sized, plant-eating creature called diacodexis, which could be found about 50 million years ago throughout Europe, Asia and North America.\nToday, there are 10 different species of pigs that can be found on every continent except Antarctica, including the amazing looking warthog found in Africa, and the wild boar, also known as the Eurasian wild pig, found throughout much of Europe and Southern Asia.\nThe domestic pig is a direct descendant of the wild boar, and they can still inter-breed. Among domestic pigs there are about 80 different breeds, most developed for their meat.\nDomestic pig species range in size from about 60 pounds full grown, to over 2,000 pounds, and everything in between. There are even species being bred for extreme small size, called \"mini\" or \"micro pigs\", claimed to only reach 30 or 40 pounds full grown.\nPigs were domesticated between 9,000 and 12,000 years ago in the Middle East and China. Theoretically, wild boars, which will eat practically anything, were attracted to the garbage created from human settlements. Domestication most likely occurred within communities that were permanent and not nomadic, because pigs, unlike goats and cattle, are not herd animals, and can be difficult to move from place to place.\nVietnamese potbelly piglets\nPigs live in large social groups and enjoy close interaction. When first introduced they will fight for social status, which is usually established within a few minutes or hours. Pigs in the wild are most active at dawn and dusk, and may even be somewhat nocturnal.\nPigs don't ruminate and don't chew cud like cows. They have a single chambered stomach, and require more nutrition than just a grass or hay diet can provide. They will graze on grasses, but they also forage for fungi, tubers, bulbs, vegetables, and an assortment of small insects, reptiles and animals. They search through soil, mud and sand, using their blunt, disc-shaped snout to dig.\nThey do not actively hunt, but will eat carrion when available, and are opportunistic predators, killing and eating young, small, or injured animals they may come upon, up to and including animals as large as young deer. Feral pig species in Australia have been reported to persue and consume small animals, particularly lambs.\nThe pig has a reputation for gluttony, sloth and uncleanliness, but if given free range they are active creatures that spend hours and walk long distances in search of food stuffs.\nWallowing in mud is something all pig species enjoy, when the opportunity presents itself, but many pigs live in forest and even near-desert conditions and may go for days without doing so. Wallowing can help regulate body temperature, since pigs can't sweat, but the mud can also act as a sun screen, and a layer of dried mud may reduce bug bites and also remove ticks and other parasites.\npigs are not smarter than dogs\nDespite wide-spread reports, pigs are not \"smarter\" than chimps, dolphins, 3 year olds and dogs.\nThe source of this suggestion seems to be a study that was done in 1997 by Dr. Stanley Curtis, who ran the department of Dairy and Animal Science at Penn State University. His research addressed practical problems with the care of livestock, but he focused mainly on pigs, which he admitted to being very fond of. Like Temple Grandin, many of his behavior-based approaches were responsible for improved animal equipment and facility designs, and a better quality of life for many farm animals.\nThe study in question involved whether pigs could use a joystick, manipulated with the snout, to maneuver a cursor on a computer screen. One or more perimeters of the screen would turn blue, and when the pigs moved the cursor into the blue area they received a treat. Only 2 pigs were used in the experiment, and Dr. Curtis himself stated that \"the pigs are still far from being very accurate, but the work is promising. If the animals reliably develop the use of this system, down the road I think some really interesting stuff could be coming out of this.\"\nChimps, bonobos and other apes have been taught to play a variety of actual video games, including Pacman, and will happily play without any food rewards, and with a full understanding of the rules. But anyone who actually believes pigs are as smart as chimps needs to take a look at some of the evidence of chimp intelligence, which is boundless.\nAs for pig intelligence rivaling that of a chimp or a dolphin, there simply is no evidence.\nCheck out this peer-reviewed paper, which sites numerous studies.\nThough it is often quoted that \"pigs recognize themselves in mirrors\", there is absolutely no evidence of this, no study that indicates this, and no individual video evidence to support the claim.\nIf you take a look at the experiments that are supposed to prove that \"pigs use mirrors to find food that they otherwise can't see\", you will find that the food bowls can in fact be seen, if the pig peeks around the wall, and of course, simply follows its nose.\nYes, pigs can be trained to respond to humans pointing gestures. This was proved fairly conclusively in a 2015 study involving 30 piglets, which is a very reasonable number of subjects. However, researchers found that \"the domestic pigs we used in this experiment did not seem to share the spontaneous abilities of dogs to follow the human pointing gesture to find a hidden reward\"\nDogs not only understand pointing gestures without special training, they also demonstrate numerous other qualities considered markers of intelligence. Take a guide-dog for example.\nWhen trained to guide the blind, dogs must use their ability to generalize as they apply the skills they learned. In other words, they are trained to safely guide someone across an intersection, and then must apply that skill to hundreds of different intersections during the course of their very productive lives. And they do, every day.\nGuide dogs also have to learn to look up, for obstacles that might impact their human, and in doing so must understand the concept of scale, the art of anticipation. Think about that. Once they detect an obstacle, they must solve the problem by re-charting a safe course, and they may accomplish all of this in the middle of a bustling street, with hundreds of distracting sights, sounds and smells.\nAnd although pigs have been used by truffle farmers for years to lead them to the hidden fungus, dogs are now the animal most often employed for the task.\nI have personally worked with and handled domestic pigs in a farm situation, pet pigs in households, and one wild boar that had been bottle-fed as a newborn and had appeared in numerous movies and commercials. The boar, named Jonnie, was quite bright, knew his name, would stay on a spot and move on queue, would squeal on command and would play dead with just a hand signal. He was 100% housebroken, and was a very affectionate and thoroughly pleasant animal. He wasn't even close to being \"smarter\" than a dog, in my humble opinion, in fact, I've known horses, parrots and goats that were at least as intelligent.\nMost of the insistence that pigs are smarter than dogs seems to be an attempt to save them from being eaten, and the headlines are just rehashed without any independent verification of the statements.\nRidiculous headlines like \"9 ways a pig is smarter than your honor student\" found in the Huffington Post. Absurd, completely unsubstantiated claims like \"pigs outperform 3-year-old human children on cognition tests and are smarter than any domestic animal, and animal experts consider them more trainable than cats or dogs\" - a statement quoted as \"fact\" on PETA's website, and which appears at the top of Google searches on the subject.\nNot wanting these awesome animals to come to harm is perfectly understandable - we love pigs too - but when you create and disseminate misinformation as fact, you may jeopardize your chances of being taken seriously on more important issues.\nIt is astonishing the number of videos, newspaper articles and even documentaries that make these claims, with no evidence, and no independent verification whatsoever. So I repeat -\nPigs are NOT smarter than dolphins. Pigs are NOT smarter than chimps. Pigs are NOT smarter than dogs.\nhandsome pig\npig lifestyle\nPigs are social, adaptable, and will eat virtually anything. In fact, throughout China people once employed something called a \"pig toilet\" which delivered human feces straight to the pig pen for consumption.\nPigs are also called hogs and swine, and anything associated with pigs is often referred to as \"porcine\".\nPigs have large heads, short necks, barrel-shaped bodies and strangely slender legs. The tail can be straight and held high as in the warthog, or curled and held close to the rump as in most domestic pigs, but the most distinctive feature of the pig is its remarkable snout.\nPigs spend the bulk of their time rooting and foraging for food, which involves them digging in mud, soil and sand for anything edible. The pig has a highly specialized nose just for this purpose. The muzzle ends in a blunted upper lip which is a flexible disc encircling the two nostrils. The disc is made of cartilage and is covered with skin that has a high density of tactile receptors. The nose is also strengthened by the prenasal bone, and can dig right into soil, moving rocks and roots out of the way with ease.\nIn addition to excavating, the nose can detect odors up to 7 miles away, and also scents hidden deep within the ground. Pigs may smell something tasty 3 feet deep, and dig it up in a matter of minutes.\nThe ability of pigs to smell through soil encouraged the Israeli military to try to train them to sniff out landmines. The project failed, and the pigs were replaced by giant African pouched rats.\nSpecial pigs known as \"truffle hogs\", were also employed in France and Italy to sniff out truffles, a rare and expensive mushroom that can sell for $4,000 a pound. Amazingly, truffles produce a scent that mimics the sex hormones of a boar, so female pigs are used to find them.\nSmelling like something that a pig wants to find insures the truffles survival, because they need to be eaten by the pig and then spread about in the pigs feces to reproduce. This is a process called mycophagy.\nBut lady pigs aren't the only ones that find the scent of truffles intoxicating, it is said to be an aphrodisiac for people too. In the last few decades, dogs have started to replace pigs in the task of truffle hunting, because the pigs were quite reluctant to give up what they found.\nPigs are so driven to dig around and search their surroundings that they can get depressed without a stimulating environment. Farmers provide them with straw to shovel through which reduces their stress levels and provides them with hours of interesting activity.\nPigs are extremely vocal while they root about, and have a vast vocabulary of snorts, grunts and squeals. Mothers have specific calls for piglets, pigs make special noises when being fed, while resting together, or while waiting to come in or go outside. They communicate with eachother constantly, and may call to eachother across distances of miles if separated.\nThe squeal of a pig is said to be almost as loud as a jet engine, and people who work with them in large quantities sometimes wear ear protection to prevent hearing loss.\npig!\npig facts on reproduction\npig mother and baby\nPigs are social animals that live in groups called sounders. A sounder is made up of several mother pigs and their offspring, which may stay with the sounder for life, or in the case of males, will leave in a few years to live alone or in a bachelor group.\nAdult males, called boars, generally join the sounder for a few days at a time when females are in season. Female pigs, called sows, or gilts if they are under a year old and have not been bred, have an estrus cycle of about 25 days, and are capable of having 2 complete litters a year.\nMost large hoofed mammals, like horses, cows, and deer, have only one offspring, sometimes twins, but pigs have large litters of piglets, averaging between 6 and 12.\nThe female is pregnant for about 115 days and gives birth, also called \"farrowing\", lying down, in a nest that she prepares a day before. Piglets are precocious, born with eyes open, stand and walk within minutes, and may leave the family to relieve themselves in the appropriate corner at just a few hours old.\nPiglets have \"assigned teating\" - the first teat they start with will be the one that they always use, and they will fight to get back to it. This is an advantage to piglets at the first 3 or 4 rows of teats, because they actually have the most milk.\nThere are almost always one or two runts in the litter, and they may be pushed aside by their siblings, which may make their condition worse. Caregivers must regularly remove runt piglets and bottle feed them to insure they survive.\nOne of the most common causes of piglet death is being crushed by the mother. Sows can weigh many hundreds of pounds, and pigs are not very agile, so bumpers are provided in domestic pig farrowing pens to prevent these losses.\nPigs mature very quickly, can be weaned anywhere from 4 to 12 weeks, and grow at enormous rates, many large breeds reaching over 300 pounds in just their first year of life.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "12 Fascinating Facts About the Amazon River - Treehugger", "url": "https://www.treehugger.com/facts-about-the-amazon-river-5185025", "text": "The Amazon River is unparalleled to any other river on Earth. Its massive volumes of water feed the adjacent Amazon Rainforest, make it impossible to build bridges over, and even raise the height of the ocean in the Caribbean Sea.\nIn addition to the Amazon River's role as a global freshwater powerhouse, its geologic past, unique wildlife, and impact on human history make this river one of the most fascinating places on Earth.\nHere are 12 amazing facts about the Amazon.\n1. The Amazon River Once Flowed in the Opposite Direction\nBetween 65 and 145 million years ago, the Amazon River flowed towards the Pacific Ocean, in the opposite direction it flows today. Where the Amazon River's mouth sits today, there was once a highland that allowed for this westerly flow. The rise of the Andes Mountains in the west forced the Amazon River to reverse course.\n2. It's the Largest River in the World by Volume\nCIFOR / Flickr / CC BY-NC-ND 2.0\nThe Amazon River has the largest volume of freshwater of any river in the world. The River releases around 200,000 liters of freshwater into the ocean every second. Together, this freshwater flow accounts for nearly 20% of all river water that enters the sea.\n3. And the Second Longest River on Earth\nAt about 4,000 miles long, the Amazon River is the second-longest river in the world. The Amazon's impressive length is exceeded by the 4,132 mile-long Nile River. Behind the Amazon, the next-longest river is the Yangtze River, which is only about 85 miles shorter than the Amazon.\n4. It Affects Sea Level in the Caribbean Sea\nThe Amazon River releases so much freshwater into the Atlantic Ocean, it alters sea level in the Caribbean. As freshwater leaves the mouth of the Amazon, it gets picked up by the Caribbean Current, which carries the water to the Caribbean islands.\nOn average, models predict the Amazon River alone causes sea levels around the Caribbean to be around 3-cm higher than they would be without the Amazon's freshwater contributions.\n5. It's Home to the Amazon River Dolphin\nThe Amazon River dolphin is one of just a few river dolphins on Earth. Michel VIARD / Getty Images\nThe Amazon River Dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), also known as the pink river dolphin or boto, is one of just four species of \"true\" river dolphins. Unlike their ocean-dwelling counterparts, river dolphins live exclusively in freshwater habitats. Based on a fossilized dolphin discovered in Peru's Pisco Basin, the Amazon River Dolphin is estimated to have evolved about 18 million years ago.\nWhile the Amazon River dolphin is quite abundant in the waters of the Amazon and Orinoco rivers, it is currently considered an endangered species due to recent population declines resulting from a number of human activities. Populations of the Amazon River dolphin are particularly hurt by the damming and pollution of the Amazon River. The dolphins are also killed by fishermen for use as bait to catch catfish. In recent years, fisherman have switched from catching the \"capaz\" catfish (Pimelodus grosskopfii) to the \"mota\" (Calophysus macropterus), the latter of which is easily attracted by Amazon River dolphin bait.\n6. The Dorado Catfish Also Lives Here\nThe dorado catfish (Brachyplatystome rousseauxii) is one of six species of \"goliath\" catfish found in the Amazon River. Like the capaz and mota catfishes, the goliath catfishes are commercially important species, with the dorado catfish being perhaps the most important of all of the Amazon's catfish. The dorado catfish can grow to be over six feet long and migrates over 7,200 miles to complete its life cycle.\n7. It's Named After a Greek Myth\nThe Amazon River and the Amazon Rainforest were named by Francisco de Orellana, the first European explorer to reach the area, after he encountered the indigenous Pira-tapuya people. In a battle against de Orellana and his men, Pira-tapuya men and women fought alongside one another.\nAccording to Greek mythology, the \"Amazons\" were a group of nomadic female warriors that roamed around the Black Sea. While partially fictitious, the myth of the Amazons is based on the Scythians, a group known for being masters at horseback riding and archery. While the Scythians were not a society of all women, as the Greek myth describes, women in Scythian society joined men in hunting and in battle.\nBased on this mythology, it is thought that de Orellana named the river \"the Amazon\" after his batter with the Pira-tapuyas, likening the women of the Pira-tapuya to the Amazons of Greek mythology.\n8. A Family Canoed to the Amazon River from Canada\nIn 1980, Don Starkell and his two sons, Dana and Jeff, left Winnipeg on a canoe towards the Amazon River. Jeff abandoned the trip when they reached Mexico, but Don and Dana ventured on. Nearly two years later, the father-son duo reached the Amazon River. By the end of the trip, they had canoed over 12,000 miles.\n9. It Has Over 100 Dams\nAccording to a 2018 study, the Amazon River's Andean headwaters have 142 dams, with an additional 160 dams proposed for construction. The dams provide electricity in the form of hydropower but hurt the ecology of the Amazon River system. Fishermen in Brazil's portion of the Amazon River, the Madeira River, already report negative effects on the system's fish, which scientists attribute to the installation of hydroelectric dams.\n10. But No Bridges\nA speed boat is the only means of transport across the river. Image by Ramesh Thadani / Getty Images\nAll 10 million people who live on the banks of the Amazon River can only cross the freshwater flow by boat. The lack of bridges is due, in part, to the seasonal changes in the Amazon River bed. During the rainy season, the Amazon River can rise over 30 feet, tripling the width of the River in some places. The Amazon's soft river banks erode as with the seasonal inundation of rainwater, making previously sturdy areas into unstable floodplains. Any bridge to cross the Amazon River would need to be incredibly long to have sure footing. There are also few roads connecting to the Amazon River, with the Amazon River itself used for most people's transportation needs.\n11. It Crosses Through Four Countries\nThe Amazon River passes through Brazil, Columbia, Peru, and Venezuela, with Brazil holding by far the largest portion of the River. The Amazon River's watershed, or the areas where it receives freshwater from, includes even more countries. Rainfall in Bolivia, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela also supplies the Amazon River with much of its freshwater.\n12. It's Where 40% of All Water in South America Ends Up\nDuring the rainy season, the Amazon River floods its banks, dramatically expanding the size of the River. Kevin Schafer / Getty Images\nThe Amazon River's height rises substantially in the rainy season because around 40% of all of South America's water ends up in the River. Like a wide net, the Amazon River watershed collects rainfall from miles around the Amazon River, including the Andes Mountains and the Amazon Rainforest."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Orca - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orca", "text": "Largest living species of dolphin\nThe orca or killer whale (Orcinus orca) is a toothed whale belonging to the oceanic dolphin family, of which it is the largest member. It is recognizable by its black-and-white patterned body. A cosmopolitan species, orcas can be found in all of the world's oceans in a variety of marine environments, from Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas.\nOrcas have a diverse diet, although individual populations often specialize in particular types of prey. Some feed exclusively on fish, while others hunt marine mammals such as seals and other species of dolphin. They have been known to attack baleen whale calves, and even adult whales. Orcas are apex predators, as they have no natural predators. They are highly social; some populations are composed of very stable matrilineal family groups (pods) which are the most stable of any animal species. Their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviours, which are often specific to a particular group and passed across generations, have been described as manifestations of animal culture.\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature assesses the orca's conservation status as data deficient because of the likelihood that two or more orca types are separate species. Some local populations are considered threatened or endangered due to prey depletion, habitat loss, pollution (by PCBs), capture for marine mammal parks, and conflicts with human fisheries. In late 2005, the southern resident orcas, which swim in British Columbia and Washington waters, were placed on the U.S. Endangered Species list.\nWild orcas are not considered a threat to humans, and no fatal attack on humans has ever been documented. There have been cases of captive orcas killing or injuring their handlers at marine theme parks. Orcas feature strongly in the mythologies of indigenous cultures, and their reputation in different cultures ranges from being the souls of humans to merciless killers.\nNaming\nOrcas are commonly referred to as \"killer whales\", despite being a type of dolphin. Since the 1960s, the use of \"orca\" instead of \"killer whale\" has steadily grown in common use.\nThe genus name Orcinus means \"of the kingdom of the dead\", or \"belonging to Orcus\". Ancient Romans originally used orca (pl. orcae) for these animals, possibly borrowing Ancient Greek \u1f44\u03c1\u03c5\u03be (\u00f3ryx), which referred (among other things) to a whale species. As part of the family Delphinidae, the species is more closely related to other oceanic dolphins than to other whales.\nThey are sometimes referred to as \"blackfish\", a name also used for other whale species. \"Grampus\" is a former name for the species, but is now seldom used. This meaning of \"grampus\" should not be confused with the genus Grampus, whose only member is Risso's dolphin.\nTaxonomy and evolution\nOrcinus citoniensis fossil, an extinct species of the same genus, Museo Capellini in fossil, an extinct species of the same genus, Museo Capellini in Bologna Modern orca skeleton, Naturalis , Leiden\nOrcinus orca is the only recognized extant species in the genus Orcinus, and one of many animal species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. Konrad Gessner wrote the first scientific description of an orca in his Piscium & aquatilium animantium natura of 1558, part of the larger Historia animalium, based on examination of a dead stranded animal in the Bay of Greifswald that had attracted a great deal of local interest.\nThe orca is one of 35 species in the oceanic dolphin family, which first appeared about 11 million years ago. The orca lineage probably branched off shortly thereafter. Although it has morphological similarities with the false killer whale, the pygmy killer whale and the pilot whales, a study of cytochrome b gene sequences indicates that its closest extant relatives are the snubfin dolphins of the genus Orcaella. However, a more recent (2018) study places the orca as a sister taxon to the Lissodelphininae, a clade that includes Lagenorhynchus and Cephalorhynchus. In contrast, a 2019 phylogenetic study found the orca to be the second most basal member of the Delphinidae, with only the Atlantic white-sided dolphin (Leucopleurus acutus) being more basal.\nTypes\nVariations in Antarctic orcas\nThe three to five types of orcas may be distinct enough to be considered different races, subspecies, or possibly even species (see Species problem). The IUCN reported in 2008, \"The taxonomy of this genus is clearly in need of review, and it is likely that O. orca will be split into a number of different species or at least subspecies over the next few years.\" Although large variation in the ecological distinctiveness of different orca groups complicate simple differentiation into types, research off the west coast of North America has identified fish-eating \"residents\", mammal-eating \"transients\" and \"offshores\". Other populations have not been as well studied, although specialized fish and mammal eating orcas have been distinguished elsewhere. Mammal-eating orcas in different regions were long thought likely to be closely related, but genetic testing has refuted this hypothesis.\nFour types have been documented in the Antarctic, Types A\u2013D. Two dwarf species, named Orcinus nanus and Orcinus glacialis, were described during the 1980s by Soviet researchers, but most cetacean researchers are skeptical about their status Complete mitochondrial sequencing indicates the two Antarctic groups (types B and C) should be recognized as distinct species, as should the North Pacific transients, leaving the others as subspecies pending additional data. A 2019 study of Type D orcas also found them to be distinct from other populations and possibly even a unique species.\nAppearance and morphology\nDifferent angle views of a typical killer whale's appearance (female)\nOrcas are the largest extant members of the dolphin family. Males typically range from 6 to 8 metres (20 to 26 ft) long and weigh in excess of 6 tonnes (5.9 long tons; 6.6 short tons). Females are smaller, generally ranging from 5 to 7 m (16 to 23 ft) and weighing about 3 to 4 tonnes (3.0 to 3.9 long tons; 3.3 to 4.4 short tons). Calves at birth weigh about 180 kg (400 lb) and are about 2.4 m (7.9 ft) long. The skeleton of the orca is typical for an oceanic dolphin, but more robust.\nWith their distinctive pigmention, adult orcas are seldom confused with any other species. When seen from a distance, juveniles can be confused with false orcas or Risso's dolphins. The orca typically has a sharply contrasted black-and-white body; being mostly black on the upper side and white on the underside. The entire lower jaw is white and from here, the colouration stretches across the underside to the genital area; narrowing between the flippers then widening some and extending into lateral flank patches close to the end. The tail fluke is also white on the underside while the eyes have white patches behind them and a grey or white \"saddle patch\" exists behind the dorsal fin and across the back. Males and females also have different patterns of black and white skin in their genital areas. Juveniles have a yellowish colour. Antarctic orcas may have pale grey to nearly white backs. Some Antarctic orcas are brown (instead of black) and yellowish (instead of white) due to diatoms in the water. Both albino and melanistic orcas have been documented.\nDifferences of dorsal fins between males (front) and females (background)\nOrca pectoral fins are large and rounded, resembling paddles, with those of males significantly larger than those of females. Dorsal fins also exhibit sexual dimorphism, with those of males about 1.8 m (5.9 ft) high, more than twice the size of the female's, with the male's fin more like a tall, elongated isosceles triangle, whereas the female's is shorter and more curved. In the skull, adult males have longer lower jaws than females, as well as larger occipital crests. The snout is blunt and lacks the beak of other species. The orca's teeth are very strong, and its jaws exert a powerful grip; the upper teeth fall into the gaps between the lower teeth when the mouth is closed. The firm middle and back teeth hold prey in place, while the front teeth are inclined slightly forward and outward to protect them from powerful jerking movements.\nOrcas have good eyesight above and below the water, excellent hearing, and a good sense of touch. They have exceptionally sophisticated echolocation abilities, detecting the location and characteristics of prey and other objects in the water by emitting clicks and listening for echoes, as do other members of the dolphin family. The mean body temperature of the orca is 36 to 38 \u00b0C (97 to 100 \u00b0F). Like most marine mammals, orcas have a layer of insulating blubber ranging from 7.6 to 10 cm (3.0 to 3.9 in) thick beneath the skin. The pulse is about 60 heartbeats per minute when the orca is at the surface, dropping to 30 beats/min when submerged.\nAn individual orca can often be identified from its dorsal fin and saddle patch. Variations such as nicks, scratches, and tears on the dorsal fin and the pattern of white or grey in the saddle patch are unique. Published directories contain identifying photographs and names for hundreds of North Pacific animals. Photographic identification has enabled the local population of orcas to be counted each year rather than estimated, and has enabled great insight into life cycles and social structures.\nRange and habitat\nOrcas are found in all oceans and most seas. Due to their enormous range, numbers, and density, relative distribution is difficult to estimate, but they clearly prefer higher latitudes and coastal areas over pelagic environments. Areas which serve as major study sites for the species include the coasts of Iceland, Norway, the Valdes Peninsula of Argentina, the Crozet Islands, New Zealand and parts of the west coast of North America, from California to Alaska. Systematic surveys indicate the highest densities of orcas (>0.40 individuals per 100 km2) in the northeast Atlantic around the Norwegian coast, in the north Pacific along the Aleutian Islands, the Gulf of Alaska and in the Southern Ocean off much of the coast of Antarctica. They are considered \"common\" (0.20\u20130.40 individuals per 100 km2) in the eastern Pacific along the coasts of British Columbia, Washington and Oregon, in the North Atlantic Ocean around Iceland and the Faroe Islands.\nIn the Antarctic, orcas range up to the edge of the pack ice and are believed to venture into the denser pack ice, finding open leads much like beluga whales in the Arctic. However, orcas are merely seasonal visitors to Arctic waters, and do not approach the pack ice in the summer. With the rapid Arctic sea ice decline in the Hudson Strait, their range now extends deep into the northwest Atlantic. Occasionally, orcas swim into freshwater rivers. They have been documented 100 mi (160 km) up the Columbia River in the United States. They have also been found in the Fraser River in Canada and the Horikawa River in Japan.\nMigration patterns are poorly understood. Each summer, the same individuals appear off the coasts of British Columbia and Washington. Despite decades of research, where these animals go for the rest of the year remains unknown. Transient pods have been sighted from southern Alaska to central California.\nPopulation\nWorldwide population estimates are uncertain, but recent consensus suggests a minimum of 50,000 (2006). Local estimates include roughly 25,000 in the Antarctic, 8,500 in the tropical Pacific, 2,250\u20132,700 off the cooler northeast Pacific and 500\u20131,500 off Norway. Japan's Fisheries Agency estimated in the 2000s that 2,321 orcas were in the seas around Japan.\nFeeding\nTail-slapping in Vestfjorden , Norway Resident (fish-eating) orcas: The curved dorsal fins are typical of resident females. Resident orca pursuing a chinook\nOrcas are apex predators, meaning that they themselves have no natural predators. They are sometimes called \"wolves of the sea\", because they hunt in groups like wolf packs. Orcas hunt varied prey including fish, cephalopods, mammals, seabirds, and sea turtles. Different populations or ecotypes may specialize, and some can have a dramatic impact on prey species. However, whales in tropical areas appear to have more generalized diets due to lower food productivity. Orcas spend most of their time at shallow depths, but occasionally dive several hundred metres depending on their prey.\nFish\nFish-eating orcas prey on around 30 species of fish. Some populations in the Norwegian and Greenland sea specialize in herring and follow that fish's autumnal migration to the Norwegian coast. Salmon account for 96% of northeast Pacific residents' diet, including 65% of large, fatty Chinook. Chum salmon are also eaten, but smaller sockeye and pink salmon are not a significant food item. Depletion of specific prey species in an area is, therefore, cause for concern for local populations, despite the high diversity of prey. On average, an orca eats 227 kilograms (500 lb) each day. While salmon are usually hunted by an individual whale or a small group, herring are often caught using carousel feeding: the orcas force the herring into a tight ball by releasing bursts of bubbles or flashing their white undersides. They then slap the ball with their tail flukes, stunning or killing up to 15 fish at a time, then eating them one by one. Carousel feeding has only been documented in the Norwegian orca population, as well as some oceanic dolphin species.\nIn New Zealand, sharks and rays appear to be important prey, including eagle rays, long-tail and short-tail stingrays, common threshers, smooth hammerheads, blue sharks, basking sharks, and shortfin makos. With sharks, orcas may herd them to the surface and strike them with their tail flukes, while bottom-dwelling rays are cornered, pinned to the ground and taken to the surface. In other parts of the world, orcas have preyed on broadnose sevengill sharks, small whale sharks and even great white sharks. Competition between orcas and white sharks is probable in regions where their diets overlap. The arrival of orcas in an area can cause white sharks to flee and forage elsewhere. Orcas appear to target the liver of sharks.\nMammals and birds\nOrcas are sophisticated and effective predators of marine mammals. Thirty-two cetacean species have been recorded as prey, from observing orca feeding activity, examining the stomach contents of dead orcas, and seeing scars on the bodies of surviving prey animals. Groups even attack larger cetaceans such as minke whales, grey whales, and, rarely, sperm whales or blue whales. In cases where blue whales are attacked, as many as 50 orcas will join the hunt to successfully kill the larger whale, taking turns trying to harass and drown the blue whale in groups of six to eight to attack when one group becomes exhausted. Predation by orcas on whale calves in high-productivity, high-latitude areas may account for great whale migrations during breeding season to low-productivity tropical waters where orcas are scarcer.\nHunting a large whale usually takes several hours. Orcas generally attack young or weak animals. When hunting a young whale, a group chases it and its mother to exhaustion. Eventually, they separate the pair and surround the calf, drowning it by keeping it from surfacing, and may consume only its jaw and tongue. Pods of female sperm whales sometimes protect themselves by forming a protective circle around their calves with their flukes facing outwards, using them to repel the attackers. Rarely, large orca pods can overwhelm adult female sperm whales, but the ability to overcome an adult bull is not recorded. A once controversial claim that orca pods can also prey upon a fully grown blue whale, the largest animal to have ever existed\u2014has been verified in a 2019 event documented at the Bremer Marine Park, off the southern coast of Australia.\nPrior to the advent of industrial whaling, great whales may have been the major food source for orcas. The introduction of modern whaling techniques may have aided orcas by the sound of exploding harpoons indicating the availability of prey to scavenge, and compressed air inflation of whale carcasses causing them to float, thus exposing them to scavenging. However, the devastation of great whale populations by unfettered whaling has possibly reduced their availability for orcas, and caused them to expand their consumption of smaller marine mammals, thus contributing to the decline of these as well.\nOrca beaching to capture sea lion at Valdes Peninsula\nOrcas swimming in close synchronization to create a wave to wash the seal off the ice floe\nOther marine mammal prey species include seals and sea otters. The most frequently preyed on seal species include harbour seal, California sea lion, Steller sea lion, South American sea lion, southern elephant seal and walrus. Often, to avoid injury, orcas disable their prey before killing and eating it. This may involve throwing it in the air, slapping it with their tails, ramming it, or breaching and landing on it. In the Aleutian Islands, a decline in sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to orca predation, although with no direct evidence. The decline of sea otters followed a decline in harbour seal and Steller sea lion populations, the orca's preferred prey,[a] which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now decimated by industrial whaling.\nIn steeply banked beaches off Pen\u00ednsula Vald\u00e9s, Argentina, and the Crozet Islands, orcas feed on sea lions and elephant seals in shallow water, even beaching temporarily to grab prey before wriggling back to the sea. Beaching, usually fatal to cetaceans, is not an instinctive behaviour, and can require years of practice for the young. Orcas can then release the animal near juvenile whales, allowing the younger whales to practice the difficult capture technique on the now-weakened prey. \"Wave-hunting\" orcas \"spy-hop\" to locate Weddell seals, crabeater seals, leopard seals, and penguins resting on ice floes, and then swim in groups to create waves that wash over the floe. This washes the prey into the water, where other orcas lie in wait.\nOrcas have also been observed preying on terrestrial mammals, such as deer swimming between islands off the northwest coast of North America. Orca cannibalism has also been reported based on analysis of stomach contents, but this is likely to be the result of scavenging remains dumped by whalers. One orca was also attacked by its companions after being shot. Although resident orcas have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and kill porpoises and seals for no apparent reason.\nOrcas in many areas may prey on cormorants and gulls. A captive orca at Marineland of Canada discovered it could regurgitate fish onto the surface, attracting sea gulls, and then eat the birds. Four others then learned to copy the behaviour.\nBehaviour\nOrcas, like this one near Alaska, commonly breach , often lifting their entire bodies out of the water.\nDay-to-day orca behaviour generally consists of foraging, travelling, resting and socializing. Orcas frequently engage in surface behaviour such as breaching (jumping completely out of the water) and tail-slapping. These activities may have a variety of purposes, such as courtship, communication, dislodging parasites, or play. Spyhopping is a behaviour in which a whale holds its head above water to view its surroundings. Resident orcas swim alongside porpoises and other dolphins.\nSocial structure\nOrcas are notable for their complex societies. Only elephants and higher primates live in comparably complex social structures. Due to orcas' complex social bonds, many marine experts have concerns about how humane it is to keep them in captivity.\nResident orcas in the eastern North Pacific live in particularly complex and stable social groups. Unlike any other known mammal social structure, resident whales live with their mothers for their entire lives. These family groups are based on matrilines consisting of the eldest female (matriarch) and her sons and daughters, and the descendants of her daughters, etc. The average size of a matriline is 5.5 animals. Because females can reach age 90, as many as four generations travel together. These matrilineal groups are highly stable. Individuals separate for only a few hours at a time, to mate or forage. With one exception, an orca named Luna, no permanent separation of an individual from a resident matriline has been recorded.\nClosely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually consisting of one to four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for weeks or months at a time. DNA testing indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods. Clans, the next level of resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans. The highest association layer is the community, which consists of pods that regularly associate with each other but share no maternal relations or dialects.\nTransient pods are smaller than resident pods, typically consisting of an adult female and one or two of her offspring. Males typically maintain stronger relationships with their mothers than other females. These bonds can extend well into adulthood. Unlike residents, extended or permanent separation of transient offspring from natal matrilines is common, with juveniles and adults of both sexes participating. Some males become \"rovers\" and do not form long-term associations, occasionally joining groups that contain reproductive females. As in resident clans, transient community members share an acoustic repertoire, although regional differences in vocalizations have been noted.\nAs with residents and transients, the lifestyle of these whales appears to reflect their diet; fish-eating orcas off Norway have resident-like social structures, while mammal-eating orcas in Argentina and the Crozet Islands behave more like transients.\nOrcas of the same sex and age group may engage in physical contact and synchronous surfacing. These behaviours do not occur randomly among individuals in a pod, providing evidence of \"friendships\".\nVocalizations\nLike all cetaceans, orcas depend heavily on underwater sound for orientation, feeding, and communication. They produce three categories of sounds: clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls. Clicks are believed to be used primarily for navigation and discriminating prey and other objects in the surrounding environment, but are also commonly heard during social interactions.\nNortheast Pacific resident groups tend to be much more vocal than transient groups in the same waters. Residents feed primarily on Chinook and chum salmon, which are insensitive to orca calls (inferred from the audiogram of Atlantic salmon). In contrast, the marine mammal prey of transients hear whale calls well and thus transients are typically silent. Vocal behaviour in these whales is mainly limited to surfacing activities and milling (slow swimming with no apparent direction) after a kill.\nAll members of a resident pod use similar calls, known collectively as a dialect. Dialects are composed of specific numbers and types of discrete, repetitive calls. They are complex and stable over time. Call patterns and structure are distinctive within matrilines. Newborns produce calls similar to their mothers, but have a more limited repertoire. Individuals likely learn their dialect through contact with pod members. Family-specific calls have been observed more frequently in the days following a calf's birth, which may help the calf learn them. Dialects are probably an important means of maintaining group identity and cohesiveness. Similarity in dialects likely reflects the degree of relatedness between pods, with variation growing over time. When pods meet, dominant call types decrease and subset call types increase. The use of both call types is called biphonation. The increased subset call types may be the distinguishing factor between pods and inter-pod relations.\nDialects also distinguish types. Resident dialects contain seven to 17 (mean = 11) distinctive call types. All members of the North American west coast transient community express the same basic dialect, although minor regional variation in call types is evident. Preliminary research indicates offshore orcas have group-specific dialects unlike those of residents and transients.\nNorwegian and Icelandic herring-eating orcas appear to have different vocalizations for activities like hunting. A population that live in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica have 28 complex burst-pulse and whistle calls.\nIntelligence\nOrcas have the second-heaviest brains among marine mammals (after sperm whales, which have the largest brain of any animal). They can be trained in captivity and are often described as intelligent, although defining and measuring \"intelligence\" is difficult in a species whose environment and behavioural strategies are very different from those of humans. Orcas imitate others, and seem to deliberately teach skills to their kin. Off the Crozet Islands, mothers push their calves onto the beach, waiting to pull the youngster back if needed.\nAn orca plays with a ball of ice, soon after a researcher threw a snowball at the whale.\nPeople who have interacted closely with orcas offer numerous anecdotes demonstrating the whales' curiosity, playfulness, and ability to solve problems. Alaskan orcas have not only learned how to steal fish from longlines, but have also overcome a variety of techniques designed to stop them, such as the use of unbaited lines as decoys. Once, fishermen placed their boats several miles apart, taking turns retrieving small amounts of their catch, in the hope that the whales would not have enough time to move between boats to steal the catch as it was being retrieved. The tactic worked initially, but the orcas figured it out quickly and spilt into groups.\nIn other anecdotes, researchers describe incidents in which wild orcas playfully tease humans by repeatedly moving objects the humans are trying to reach, or suddenly start to toss around a chunk of ice after a human throws a snowball.\nThe orca's use of dialects and the passing of other learned behaviours from generation to generation have been described as a form of animal culture.\nThe complex and stable vocal and behavioural cultures of sympatric groups of killer whales (Orcinus orca) appear to have no parallel outside humans and represent an independent evolution of cultural faculties.\nLife cycle\nFemale orcas begin to mature at around the age of 10 and reach peak fertility around 20, experiencing periods of polyestrous cycling separated by non-cycling periods of three to 16 months. Females can often breed until age 40, followed by a rapid decrease in fertility. Orcas are among the few animals that undergo menopause and live for decades after they have finished breeding. The lifespans of wild females average 50 to 80 years. Some are claimed to have lived substantially longer: Granny (J2) was estimated by some researchers to have been as old as 105 years at the time of her death, though a biopsy sample indicated her age as 65 to 80 years. It is thought that orcas held in captivity tend to have shorter lives than those in the wild, although this is subject to scientific debate.\nMales mate with females from other pods, which prevents inbreeding. Gestation varies from 15 to 18 months. Mothers usually calve a single offspring about once every five years. In resident pods, births occur at any time of year, although winter is the most common. Mortality is extremely high during the first seven months of life, when 37\u201350% of all calves die. Weaning begins at about 12 months of age, and is complete by two years. According to observations in several regions, all male and female pod members participate in the care of the young.\nMales sexually mature at the age of 15, but do not typically reproduce until age 21. Wild males live around 29 years on average, with a maximum of about 60 years. One male, known as Old Tom, was reportedly spotted every winter between the 1840s and 1930 off New South Wales, Australia, which would have made him up to 90 years old. Examination of his teeth indicated he died around age 35, but this method of age determination is now believed to be inaccurate for older animals. One male known to researchers in the Pacific Northwest (identified as J1) was estimated to have been 59 years old when he died in 2010. Orcas are unique among cetaceans, as their caudal sections elongate with age, making their heads relatively shorter.\nInfanticide, once thought to occur only in captive orcas, was observed in wild populations by researchers off British Columbia on December 2, 2016. In this incident, an adult male killed the calf of a female within the same pod, with the adult male's mother also joining in the assault. It is theorized that the male killed the young calf in order to mate with its mother (something that occurs in other carnivore species), while the male's mother supported the breeding opportunity for her son. The attack ended when the calf's mother struck and injured the attacking male. Such behaviour matches that of many smaller dolphin species, such as the bottlenose dolphin.\nConservation\nThe \"type C\" orca has two-toned grey colouring, including a dark \"dorsal cape\", in body areas where most orcas have solid black colouring. Research is ongoing into whether one or more orca types are distinct species in need of protection.\nIn 2008, the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) changed its assessment of the orca's conservation status from conservation dependent to data deficient, recognizing that one or more orca types may actually be separate, endangered species. Depletion of prey species, pollution, large-scale oil spills, and habitat disturbance caused by noise and conflicts with boats are the most significant worldwide threats. In January 2020, the first orca in England and Wales since 2001 was found dead with a large fragment of plastic in its stomach.\nLike other animals at the highest trophic levels, the orca is particularly at risk of poisoning from bioaccumulation of toxins, including Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). European harbour seals have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated with high levels of PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the Washington coast found PCB levels in orcas were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbour seals. Blubber samples in the Norwegian Arctic show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and brominated flame-retardants than in polar bears. A 2018 study published in Science found that global orca populations are poised to dramatically decline due such toxic pollution.\nIn the Pacific Northwest, wild salmon stocks, a main resident food source, have declined dramatically in recent years. In the Puget Sound region, only 75 whales remain with few births over the last few years. On the west coast of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, seal and sea lion populations have also substantially declined.\nAn adult female and her calf\nIn 2005, the United States government listed the southern resident community as an endangered population under the Endangered Species Act. This community comprises three pods which live mostly in the Georgia and Haro Straits and Puget Sound in British Columbia and Washington. They do not breed outside of their community, which was once estimated at around 200 animals and later shrank to around 90. In October 2008, the annual survey revealed seven were missing and presumed dead, reducing the count to 83. This is potentially the largest decline in the population in the past 10 years. These deaths can be attributed to declines in Chinook salmon.\nScientist Ken Balcomb has extensively studied orcas since 1976; he is the research biologist responsible for discovering U.S. Navy sonar may harm orcas. He studied orcas from the Center for Whale Research, located in Friday Harbor, Washington. He was also able to study orcas from \"his home porch perched above Puget Sound, where the animals hunt and play in summer months\". In May 2003, Balcomb (along with other whale watchers near the Puget Sound coastline) noticed uncharacteristic behaviour displayed by the orcas. The whales seemed \"agitated and were moving haphazardly, attempting to lift their heads free of the water\" to escape the sound of the sonars. \"Balcomb confirmed at the time that strange underwater pinging noises detected with underwater microphones were sonar. The sound originated from a U.S. Navy frigate 12 miles (19 kilometres) distant, Balcomb said.\" The impact of sonar waves on orcas is potentially life-threatening. Three years prior to Balcomb's discovery, research in the Bahamas showed 14 beaked whales washed up on the shore. These whales were beached on the day U.S. Navy destroyers were activated into sonar exercise. Of the 14 whales beached, six of them died. These six dead whales were studied, and CAT scans of two of the whale heads showed hemorrhaging around the brain and the ears, which is consistent with decompression sickness.\nAnother conservation concern was made public in September 2008 when the Canadian government decided it was not necessary to enforce further protections (including the Species at Risk Act in place to protect endangered animals along with their habitats) for orcas aside from the laws already in place. In response to this decision, six environmental groups sued the federal government, claiming orcas were facing many threats on the British Columbia Coast and the federal government did nothing to protect them from these threats. A legal and scientific nonprofit organization, Ecojustice, led the lawsuit and represented the David Suzuki Foundation, Environmental Defence, Greenpeace Canada, International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Raincoast Conservation Foundation, and the Wilderness Committee. Many scientists involved in this lawsuit, including Bill Wareham, a marine scientist with the David Suzuki Foundation, noted increased boat traffic, water toxic wastes, and low salmon population as major threats, putting approximately 87 orcas on the British Columbia Coast in danger.\nUnderwater noise from shipping, drilling, and other human activities is a significant concern in some key orca habitats, including Johnstone Strait and Haro Strait. In the mid-1990s, loud underwater noises from salmon farms were used to deter seals. Orcas also avoided the surrounding waters. High-intensity sonar used by the Navy disturbs orcas along with other marine mammals. Orcas are popular with whale watchers, which may stress the whales and alter their behaviour, particularly if boats approach too closely or block their lines of travel.\nThe Exxon Valdez oil spill adversely affected orcas in Prince William Sound and Alaska's Kenai Fjords region. Eleven members (about half) of one resident pod disappeared in the following year. The spill damaged salmon and other prey populations, which in turn damaged local orcas. By 2009, scientists estimated the AT1 transient population (considered part of a larger population of 346 transients), numbered only seven individuals and had not reproduced since the spill. This population is expected to die out.\nOrcas are included in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), meaning international trade (including in parts/derivatives) is regulated.\nRelationship with humans\nIndigenous cultures\nThe indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast feature orcas throughout their art, history, spirituality and religion. The Haida regarded orcas as the most powerful animals in the ocean, and their mythology tells of orcas living in houses and towns under the sea. According to these myths, they took on human form when submerged, and humans who drowned went to live with them. For the Kwakwaka'wakw, the orca was regarded as the ruler of the undersea world, with sea lions for slaves and dolphins for warriors. In Nuu-chah-nulth and Kwakwaka'wakw mythology, orcas may embody the souls of deceased chiefs. The Tlingit of southeastern Alaska regarded the orca as custodian of the sea and a benefactor of humans.\nThe Maritime Archaic people of Newfoundland also had great respect for orcas, as evidenced by stone carvings found in a 4,000-year-old burial at the Port au Choix Archaeological Site.\nIn the tales and beliefs of the Siberian Yupik people, orcas are said to appear as wolves in winter, and wolves as orcas in summer. Orcas are believed to assist their hunters in driving walrus. Reverence is expressed in several forms: the boat represents the animal, and a wooden carving hung from the hunter's belt. Small sacrifices such as tobacco or meat are strewn into the sea for them.\nThe Ainu people of Hokkaido, the Kuril Islands, and southern Sakhalin often referred to orcas in their folklore and myth as Repun Kamuy (God of Sea/Offshore) to bring fortunes (whales) to the coasts, and there had been traditional funerals for stranded or deceased orcas akin to funerals for other animals such as brown bears.\n\"Killer\" stereotype\nIn Western cultures, orcas were historically feared as dangerous, savage predators. The first written description of an orca was given by Pliny the Elder circa AD 70, who wrote, \"Orcas (the appearance of which no image can express, other than an enormous mass of savage flesh with teeth) are the enemy of [other kinds of whale]... they charge and pierce them like warships ramming.\"\nMale orca depicted in St Mary's in Greifswald , Germany, 1545\nOf the very few confirmed attacks on humans by wild orcas, none have been fatal. In one instance, orcas tried to tip ice floes on which a dog team and photographer of the Terra Nova Expedition were standing. The sled dogs' barking is speculated to have sounded enough like seal calls to trigger the orca's hunting curiosity. In the 1970s, a surfer in California was bitten, and in 2005, a boy in Alaska who was splashing in a region frequented by harbour seals was bumped by an orca that apparently misidentified him as prey. Unlike wild orcas, captive orcas have made nearly two dozen attacks on humans since the 1970s, some of which have been fatal.\nCompetition with fishermen also led to orcas being regarded as pests. In the waters of the Pacific Northwest and Iceland, the shooting of orcas was accepted and even encouraged by governments. As an indication of the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the orcas captured in Puget Sound for aquariums through 1970 bore bullet scars. The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of orcas in Icelandic waters in 1956 with machine guns, rockets, and depth charges.\nFrom July to October 2020, there were at least forty reliable reports of orcas attacking boats off the Atlantic coast of Portugal and Spain, unusual and unprecedented behaviour. The nudging, biting and ramming attacks, on medium-size sailing boats sailing at moderate speed, concentrated on the rudder, with some impacts on the hull. A small group of orcas are believed to be responsible, with three juveniles which have been named black Gladis, white Gladis and grey Gladis, identified as present in most attacks. No one was injured in any of the attacks. The Portuguese coastguard banned small sailing vessels from a region where several incidents had been reported. It is thought that the behaviour is playful, rather than aggressive or vengeful.\nModern Western attitudes\nIngrid Visser 's research team filming orcas in New Zealand\nWestern attitudes towards orcas have changed dramatically in recent decades. In the mid-1960s and early 1970s, orcas came to much greater public and scientific awareness, starting with the first live-capture and display of an orca known as Moby Doll, a resident harpooned off Saturna Island in 1964. So little was known at the time, it was nearly two months before the whale's keepers discovered what food (fish) it was willing to eat. To the surprise of those who saw him, Moby Doll was a docile, non-aggressive whale who made no attempts to attack humans.\nIn 2002, the orphan Springer was successfully returned to her family.\nBetween 1964 and 1976, 50 orcas from the Pacific Northwest were captured for display in aquaria, and public interest in the animals grew. In the 1970s, research pioneered by Michael Bigg led to the discovery of the species' complex social structure, its use of vocal communication, and its extraordinarily stable mother\u2013offspring bonds. Through photo-identification techniques, individuals were named and tracked over decades.\nBigg's techniques also revealed the Pacific Northwest population was in the low hundreds rather than the thousands that had been previously assumed. The southern resident community alone had lost 48 of its members to captivity; by 1976, only 80 remained. In the Pacific Northwest, the species that had unthinkingly been targeted became a cultural icon within a few decades.\nThe public's growing appreciation also led to growing opposition to whale\u2013keeping in aquarium. Only one whale has been taken in North American waters since 1976. In recent years, the extent of the public's interest in orcas has manifested itself in several high-profile efforts surrounding individuals. Following the success of the 1993 film Free Willy, the movie's captive star Keiko was returned to the coast of his native Iceland in 2002. The director of the International Marine Mammal Project for the Earth Island Institute, David Phillips, led the efforts to return Keiko to the Iceland waters. Keiko however did not adapt to the harsh climate of the Arctic Ocean, and died a year into his release after contracting pneumonia, at the age of 27. In 2002, the orphan Springer was discovered in Puget Sound, Washington. She became the first whale to be successfully reintegrated into a wild pod after human intervention, crystallizing decades of research into the vocal behaviour and social structure of the region's orcas. The saving of Springer raised hopes that another young orca named Luna, which had become separated from his pod, could be returned to it. However, his case was marked by controversy about whether and how to intervene, and in 2006, Luna was killed by a boat propeller.\nWhaling\nThe orca named Old Tom swims alongside a whaleboat , flanking a whale calf. The boat is being towed by a harpooned whale (not visible here), near Eden, Australia.\nThe earlier of known records of commercial hunting of orcas date to the 18th century in Japan. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the global whaling industry caught immense numbers of baleen and sperm whales, but largely ignored orcas because of their limited amounts of recoverable oil, their smaller populations, and the difficulty of taking them. Once the stocks of larger species were depleted, orcas were targeted by commercial whalers in the mid-20th century. Between 1954 and 1997, Japan took 1,178 orcas (although the Ministry of the Environment claims that there had been domestic catches of about 1,600 whales between late 1940s to 1960s) and Norway took 987. Extensive hunting of orcas, including an Antarctic catch of 916 in 1979\u201380 alone, prompted the International Whaling Commission to recommend a ban on commercial hunting of the species pending further research. Today, no country carries out a substantial hunt, although Indonesia and Greenland permit small subsistence hunts (see Aboriginal whaling). Other than commercial hunts, orcas were hunted along Japanese coasts out of public concern for potential conflicts with fisheries. Such cases include a semi-resident male-female pair in Akashi Strait and Harimanada being killed in the Seto Inland Sea in 1957, the killing of five whales from a pod of 11 members that swam into Tokyo Bay in 1970, and a catch record in southern Taiwan in the 1990s.\nCooperation with humans\nOrcas have helped humans hunting other whales. One well-known example was the orcas of Eden, Australia, including the male known as Old Tom. Whalers more often considered them a nuisance, however, as orcas would gather to scavenge meat from the whalers' catch. Some populations, such as in Alaska's Prince William Sound, may have been reduced significantly by whalers shooting them in retaliation.\nWhale watching\nWhale watching continues to increase in popularity, but may have some problematic impacts on orcas. Exposure to exhaust gases from large amounts of vessel traffic is causing concern for the overall health of the 75 remaining southern resident orcas (SRKWs) left as of early 2019. This population is followed by approximately 20 vessels for 12 hours a day during the months May\u2013September. Researchers discovered that these vessels are in the line of sight for these whales for 98\u201399.5% of daylight hours. With so many vessels, the air quality around these whales deteriorates and impacts their health. Air pollutants that bind with exhaust fumes are responsible for the activation of the cytochrome P450 1A gene family. Researchers have successfully identified this gene in skin biopsies of live whales and also the lungs of deceased whales. A direct correlation between activation of this gene and the air pollutants can not be made because there are other known factors that will induce the same gene. Vessels can have either wet or dry exhaust systems, with wet exhaust systems leaving more pollutants in the water due to various gas solubility. A modelling study determined that the lowest-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) of exhaust pollutants was about 12% of the human dose.\nAs a response to this, in 2017 boats off the British Columbia coast now have a minimum approach distance of 200 metres compared to the previous 100 metres. This new rule complements Washington State's minimum approach zone of 180 metres that has been in effect since 2011. If a whale approaches a vessel it must be placed in neutral until the whale passes. The World Health Organization has set air quality standards in an effort to control the emissions produced by these vessels.\nCaptivity\nThe orca's intelligence, trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity and sheer size have made it a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales were taken from the wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.\nOrganizations such as World Animal Protection and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation campaign against the practice of keeping them in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the dorsal fin collapse seen in 60\u201390% of captive males. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s.[b] That said, a 2015 study coauthored by staff at SeaWorld and the Minnesota Zoo suggested no significant difference in survivorship between free-ranging and captive orcas. However, in the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average, and up to 70\u201380 years in rare cases. Wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average, and up to 50\u201360 years. Captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat, and captive whales' social groups are foreign to those found in the wild. Critics claim captive life is stressful due to these factors and the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild orca behaviour, see above. Wild orcas may travel up to 160 kilometres (100 mi) in a day, and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity. Captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves, their tankmates, or humans, which critics say is a result of stress. Between 1991 and 2010, the bull orca known as Tilikum was involved in the death of three people, and was featured in the critically acclaimed 2013 film Blackfish. Tilikum lived at SeaWorld from 1992 until his death in 2017.\nIn March 2016, SeaWorld announced that they would be ending their orca breeding program and their theatrical shows. As of 2020, theatrical shows featuring orcas are still ongoing.\nSee also\n^ According to Baird, killer whales prefer harbour seals to sea lions and porpoises in some areas. ^ Although there are examples of killer whales living longer, including several over 30 years old, and two captive orcas (Corky II and Lolita) are in their mid-40s.\nReferences"}

Spanning hundreds of millions of years, the Earth has played host to over nine million species of animal in every conceivable habitat. Today, over 1,5 million living animals have been identified and described, with new ones being added every day, while some sadly fall into extinction.\nBelonging to the biological kingdom of Animalia, animals can be defined as multicellular eukaryotic organisms (more than one cell, with each cell containing a nucleus within a membrane) that breathe oxygen, consume organic material, are able to move, and reproduce sexually. As you can imagine, with all the different sizes and shapes; ways to breathe like gills or lungs; diet like plants or meat; ways to move like swimming, slithering, flying, crawling, running and hopping; body coverings like scales, feathers, fur, shells and skin; laying eggs or giving birth to live young; creatures being warm-blooded or cold, the animal kingdom is not only huge, but massively varied.\nNo matter where you find an animal \u2013 whether that\u2019s the freezing cold of the Antarctic, the blistering Sahara desert, the sweltering tropics of the Amazon, the vast African savannah, to the darkest caves and deepest oceans, animals have evolved to be uniquely adapted to their environment, with each species having complex interactions with one another and playing an important role in the ecosystem and food chain they find themselves in.\nThrough zoology, the study of animals, we\u2019ve come to learn about the smallest insects, smaller than a millimetre, to the largest blue whales at over 100 feet long. With so many animals to study, we\u2019re still learning about many, which also means undoing human damage as a result of fear and misunderstanding. Today, we know that wolves and sharks are intelligent animals with complex social hierarchies and, while dangerous, are not monsters to be killed.\nBy learning about animals, we're able to enhance our own lives. Termites have taught us about architecture, horseshoe crabs may hold the secret to never being sick, gorillas and orangutans can help us understand our early origins, livestock like horses, cattle and sheep have provided us with textiles to keep warm, transport and food, fish have taught us about streamlined shapes, while birds and whales served as inspiration for mastering the skies and seas.\nIn every culture in the world, animals can be found at their heart as symbols of strength, fertility, power and even gods incarnate. It\u2019s easy to forget that we people are animals too, but it\u2019s important to remember that we\u2019re part of the intricate web of life on Earth and it\u2019s our responsibility to look after every single creature that inhabits it.\nLearn more about fascinating animals from vertebrates to invertebrates, marine and land animals, mammals and reptiles in this section."}

The most obvious difference between monkeys and apes is that apes do not have tails.\nA few isolated monkey species do not have tails either, but they are the exception rather than the rule.\nThe great apes, which are the human being, the orangutan, the gorilla, the chimpanzee and the bonobo, are much larger than monkeys and much more highly evolved.\nThe gibbon, which has many aspects of both monkeys and apes, is truly its own separate creature, although it is often lumped in with either apes or monkeys by virtue of many different arguments, both scientific and not so scientific.\nWe have separated the gibbons and offer their own article. We have also separated the baboon into it's own page because it is so well known, but the baboon is in fact an Old World monkey with the customary large size and non-prehensile tail..\nMonkeys are highly intelligent and active primates that are broken into two groups known as Old World monkeys and New World monkeys.\nThe Old World monkeys (including baboons) inhabit Africa and Asia, and are more closely related to apes. They are generally larger than New World monkeys, have more elongated faces, and have a tail that is not \"prehensile\".\nNew world monkeys are five families of primates that inhabit Central America, South America and some parts of Mexico. New world monkeys are generally smaller, have more flattened faces and have \"prehensile tails\" which they are capable of gripping with.\nThe prehensile tail is slim, muscular and very long, usually longer than the body length, and can easily support the weight of the entire monkey. These tails often have a patch of bare rough skin called a tactile pad or friction pad, that helps in grasping objects.\nWhile the tail is used primarily to assist in climbing and keeping the hands free for foraging and carrying, some monkey species will use it almost as an extra hand to hold and manipulate food items.\nNew world monkeys often use their tails to grab each other during wrestling and play, and will wrap their tails around each other for comfort.\nThe Old World baboons are the largest of the monkeys with males reaching almost 4 feet long and weighing nearly 80 pounds. The tiny pygmy marmosets of the New World rain forests are the smallest monkeys and can be as tiny as 4 inches and 4 ounces!\nof monkey hands and tails\nProboscis Monkeys - Old World\nSpider Monkey - New World\nOld World monkeys are most quickly differentiated from New World monkeys by looking at their tails.\nThe Old World monkeys have non-prehensile tails that can not grip. The New World monkeys have long. slim prehensile tails that they may climb with and that they can carry and manipulate items with.\nThe most dexterous tail in the monkey kingdom belongs to the spider monkey. These monkeys can hold, carry and even catch items with their tails, and will gesture with them as well.\nThere is a small bare area of rough skin on the underside of the last vertebra in the tail. This \"tactile pad\" has many nerve endings like a fingertip, which aids in delicate tasks like peeling a banana.\nThe prehensile tail is surely a product of the New World monkeys densely forested environment. Most New World monkeys are largely arboreal, spending the majority of their time high in the forest canopy, and some never leave the trees at all.\nWhile many Old World monkeys like the baboons, spend most of their time on the ground walking around on all fours like a dog.\nAnother area of monkey anatomy that shows some variety is the hand. All of the great apes have opposable thumbs meaning that the thumb can be swiveled around so that the pad of the thumb faces the pads of the fingers and can be brought together in a \"pincer\" grip.\nLikewise, all of the Old World monkeys have opposable thumbs.\nBut many New World monkeys, including marmosets, spider monkeys and capuchins do not have opposable thumbs.\nThese animals thumbs range from completely unopposable where the thumb can not be rotated, as in the marmoset and the tamarin, pseudo-opposable where there is partial rotation of the thumb to the side of the hand, and a third situation, as in the spider monkey, where the thumb is actually a very small digit - only 15% the length of the other fingers, and has very little use at all.\nThe New World monkeys life high in the trees no doubt plays a part. Using all five digits together to encircle a branch with more of a cupping motion rather than grasping, seems more effective when speed and mobility are of the essence.\nWith a tail that is able to help as well as its hands, the spider monkey swings from limb to limb with incredible ease, and with a thumb that is always in harmony with the rest of the hand.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Bachelor males may live either in small groups, or completely alone. Proboscis are similar to lions in that when a new male displaces the dominant male, he may kill the existing infants.\nThis is not the typical monkey lifestyle however. Most monkeys live in social groups from 5 to 30 individuals, and separate into pairs for a few days while mating takes place.\nOften there is a change that signals both the males and females readiness to mate, including swelling of the genitals, and reddening of both the genitals and sometimes the face.\nFemales may mate with several males and usually give birth alone.\nSome species, like macaques and baboons, give birth on the ground, but many others make nests up in the trees.\nOne infant is standard, and the baby will be held close to the chest for a few hours to up to two weeks before they graduate to riding on the mothers back.\nInfant monkeys live exclusively on mothers milk for as many as three months, but even after starting solid food, they will continue to nurse for up to a year.\nIn some species, there is some mild cooperation within the group in the rearing of young, but the mother is mostly responsible, and most male monkeys do not treat their own offspring with any special interest.\nYoung monkeys are agile, active and incredibly curious. The most advanced monkey species have their own culture, including greatly varied \"accents\" to their vocalizations, even from troop to troop of the same species.\nLittle ones are taught social codes, local ways to gather and handle food, hunting techniques, seasonality of fruits and nuts, the safest places to sleep and eat.\nLike humans and apes, monkeys have been seen to demonstrate actions in order to teach young ones. In one such instance a mother macaque was observed repeatedly washing a piece of fruit until the toddler caught on and began dipping his own lunch in the river. - Amazing Monkey Facts\nmonkey face\nthe many faces of monkeys\nThere are over 260 known species of monkeys, all of whom display their own distinct look. Colors and patterns, Mohawks and mono-brows, variations in eye shape, skull, nostril, and ear structure, bare skin to fur ratios, and overall proportions produce a slide show of differences unrivaled by any other animal group.

There are 16 species within the tamarin genus.\nMarmosets and tamarins differ in jaw shape and skull construction but otherwise have a very similar appearance and lifestyle. They are the smallest monkey species and differ from other monkey families in several ways.\nTheir teeth are specially designed to strip open the bark of trees exposing the sap inside. Some marmoset species may get up to 70% of their diet from tree sap. Otherwise they will eat insects, birds eggs, flowers and fruits.\nMarmosets and tamarins have more primitive brains than other monkeys, and they have claws on their hands and feet as opposed to the flat nails that other monkeys and apes have.\nThese beautiful little monkeys have an amazing variety of face and head decorations, from the flowing red locks of the Golden Lion tamarin, to the feather like extensions of the cotton eared marmoset, to the outrageous mustache of the emperor tamarin.\nThese monkeys almost always give birth to twins.

They are easy to recognize due to their black back and a white underside. Orca is another name for them. These animals are carnivores eating a diet of fish and seals and are considered an apex predator. They can adapt to both cold and warm water habitats.\n5 Incredible Killer Whale Facts!\nFemale orcas are known to live 10 to 20 years longer than males\nOrcas use echolocation to hunt in the ocean\nNewborns can dive and swim\nEach of an adult\u2019s teeth is 4 inches long\nThese animals have no animal predators\nKiller Whale Scientific Name\nOrcinus orca is the scientific name of a killer whale. The word Orcinus is Latin meaning kingdom of the dead. This refers to this animal\u2019s reputation for eating a variety of sea life. This animal is also called an orca.\nIt belongs to the Delphinidae family and is in the Mammalia class.\nMarine biologists have divided these animals into three groups. These include:\nResident killer whales\nTransient killer whales\nOffshore killer whales\nThere are some differences in the diet, habitat, behavior, and even the genetics of these three types.\nKiller Whale Appearance & Behavior\nOrcas have a smooth black back including a large dorsal fin while their underside is bright white. These animals have a white eyespot located just behind each of their eyes. They have teeth that can be as long as 4 inches. If you cut a bowling pin into four equal parts, the animal\u2019s 4-inch tooth would equal one of those parts.\nIn terms of size, the orca can measure from 23 to 32 feet in length. A 23-foot-long orca equals 2/3 the length of a telephone pole. It\u2019s difficult to grasp the size of these animals until you see one with your own eyes!\nThey can weigh up to 6 tons. Imagine 3 adult giraffes standing on a gigantic scale. Their total weight would equal the weight of one 6-ton orca.\nThese animals share some features with the pygmy killer whale. The scientific name of the pygmy killer whale is Feresa attenuata. It\u2019s another member of the Delphinidae family. In terms of size, the pygmy species is much smaller than the orca.\nThe pygmy species grow to be 8.5 feet long and weigh up to 500 pounds. That\u2019s the length of a newborn killer whale. In addition, the pygmy killer whale hunts squid and fish while the orca eats larger prey. Furthermore, the pygmy species is rarely seen whereas the killer whale is observed in various locations.\nThe dorsal fin (the one on the animal\u2019s back) can measure as long as six feet. Six feet is the length of a full-size bed! The tail fin is called a fluke and helps it to move through the water with speed. Its dorsal fin provides balance as the animal swims. Alternatively, its pectoral (side) fins help the orca to steer as well as stop.\nThe largest killer whale on record measured 32 feet long.\nIts long, sleek body travels through the ocean kind of like a submarine. These animals can travel up to 35 mph. This helps them to hunt and capture fish, seals, and other sea life.\nThese animals have lungs that need to take in and let out oxygen. You have that in common with a killer whale! The blowhole of a killer whale serves as its nose. Its blowhole is located on the top of its head. So, when the animal needs to take in or let out a breath, it simply raises the top of its head above the surface of the water.\nThe highest amount of time these animals can stay underwater without taking a breath is about 15 minutes. But most can hold their breath for about 10 minutes or so.\nKiller whales are social animals and travel in groups called pods. They jump and dive swimming in circles around one another. The size of a pod differs with each type of killer whale. For instance, resident orcas travel in pods ranging from 5 to 50 members. Transient killer whale pods usually contain 7 or fewer members. Offshore killer whales may have over 100 members in a pod or fewer than 20.\nOrcas have a unique way of communicating. They use whistles and clicks to talk with other orcas around them. What do the whistles and clicks mean? You would have to be a killer whale to know the answer to that question.\nThese animals are not aggressive unless they are in pursuit of prey. To the contrary, they are known to be curious, playful animals that sometimes try to interact with humans sailing nearby.\nMiles Away Photography/Shutterstock.com\nKiller Whale Habitat\nThese animals live in oceans all over the world. They are especially plentiful in the cold waters in the Arctic, Antarctic and around Norway. A large number of orcas are found in the North Pacific Ocean from California all the way to Russia.\nOrcas that live in the Pacific Northeast region are known as residents. They are called residents because they stay inland.\nAlternatively, transient killer whales swim up and down the coast of southeast Alaska and British Columbia. Offshore killer whales stay way out in the ocean.\nThese animals can live in both cold and warm water habitats.\nKiller Whale\u2019s Diet\nThis animal has a carnivorous diet. But the type of meat it eats depends on whether it\u2019s a resident, transient or offshore orca. These three types of killer whales occupy different habitats. This means they have different types of prey available to them.\nWhat eats killer whales?\nThere are no animals that eat these animals. However, they are hunted by humans.\nWhat do killer whales eat?\nKiller whales are carnivores that eat fish, squid, bird, and marine mammals like seals. A-Z-Animals.com\nResident killer whales eat fish. Salmon is a favorite item in their diet. Transient killer whales eat larger prey including sea lions, harbor seals, porpoises, grey whales, or Minke whales. Sometimes a transient killer whale will push itself onto shore to grab a seal or sea lion, then slide back into the ocean. The diet of offshore killer whales includes blue sharks, salmon sharks and dogfish.\nOne of the most interesting facts about these animals is that an adult can consume up to 300 pounds of food per day. Three hundred pounds of food is equal to the size of one adult pig!\nThese animals hunt with the help of echolocation. This is something they have in common with dolphins. Orcas make a high-frequency clicking sound that goes out into the water around them. When the sound hits an object, it bounces back to the animal. An orca can determine whether the object is prey by the type of echoing sound that bounces back at them!\nA bat uses the same type of hunting method as it flies through the air. Who knew orcas and bats had something in common!\nFor a complete analysis on the diet of killer whales, make sure to read \u2018What Do Killer Whales (Orcas) Eat?\nKiller Whales Predators and Threats\nThough these animals don\u2019t have any animal predators, it does face some threats.\nWater pollution is a threat to their habitat. Also, orcas are sometimes killed by commercial fishermen because they eat much of the prey that the fishermen are trying to catch. Tourism poses another threat to orcas. Boats with tourists on them can disrupt the environment and their activities.\nRespiratory disorders, heart disease, Hodgkin\u2019s disease, and tumors are some examples of ailments that affect these animals. They can also become stranded on a beach and die.\nThe IUCN Redlist has given the orca the conservation status of Data Deficient.\nKiller Whales Reproduction, Babies and Lifespan\nBreeding can take place at any time throughout the year. These animals have multiple partners. Female killer whales give birth every 3 to 10 years. The gestation period of a killer whale ranges from 15 to 18 months. This is similar to another member of the Delphinidae family, the pilot whale. The gestation period of a pilot whale is 12 to 16 months.\nThe female gives live birth to just one baby also called a calf. A newborn calf is from 8 to 8.5 feet long and weighs from 265 to 353 pounds! Once a calf is born, its eyes are open, and it begins swimming right alongside its mother. The calf nurses from its mother for about one year. After that, a calf is weaned by its mother eating the prey that she hunts. An orca calf stays with its mother until it\u2019s an adult. In fact, some of them never leave their mothers. They simply become a member of the same pod that travels together.\nMales live to be 40 to 50 years old. Females can live for 60 years or even longer. Females reach sexual maturity at 14 or 15 years old.\nFor many years, marine biologists observed the activities of a female killer whale living in the Salish Sea. They estimated her to be at least 100 years old. Her name was Granny.\nKiller Whales Population\nThough the conservation status of these animals is Data Deficient, there are some estimates on its population. The NOAA Fisheries estimates their worldwide population at 50,000. There are around 2,500 orcas in the eastern North Pacific Ocean region. The population is thought to be struggling and may even be in decline.\nKiller Whales in the Zoo\nYou can see orcas in aquariums such as:\n\u2022 Visit orcas at SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida\n\u2022 See amazing orcas with your own eyes at SeaWorld in San Diego, California\n\u2022 An orca exhibition can be seen at SeaWorld in San Antonio, Texas\nView all 43 animals that start with K"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dusky dolphin - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusky_dolphin", "text": "Species of mammal\nThe dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus) is a dolphin found in coastal waters in the Southern Hemisphere. Its specific epithet is Latin for \"dark\" or \"dim\". It is very closely genetically related to the Pacific white-sided dolphin, but current scientific consensus holds they are distinct species. The dolphin's range is patchy, with major populations around South America, southwestern Africa, New Zealand, and various oceanic islands, with some sightings around southern Australia and Tasmania. The dusky dolphin prefers cool currents and inshore waters, but can also be found offshore. It feeds on a variety of fish and squid species and has flexible hunting tactics. The dusky dolphin is known for its remarkable acrobatics, having a number of aerial behaviours. The status of the dolphin is unknown, but it has been commonly caught in gill nets.\nTaxonomy [ edit ]\nPlate 5 of Mammalogy section in Mammalogy and Ornithology (1858) Dusky dolphin drawings inofsection in(1858)\nIt is commonly thought that the dusky dolphin was first described by John Edward Gray in 1828 from stuffed skin and a single skull shipped from the Cape of Good Hope to the British Museum. Gray first described the species as Delphinus obscurus, with the subgenus Grampus in his 1828 Specilegia Zoologica. Gray reported that the animal was captured around the Cape of Good Hope by a Captain Haviside (often misspelt \"Heaviside\") and sent to the British Museum though the Royal College of Surgeons in 1827.\nHowever, Gray later wrote that a similar dolphin was described as Delphinus supercilious by French surgeons and naturalists Ren\u00e9 Primev\u00e8re Lesson and Prosper Garnot from a specimen collected off the coast of Tasmania two years before his own classification. Gray classified D. supercilious as a junior synonym of his D. obscurus and credited Lesson and Garnot (1826) for their original description. Meanwhile, Charles Darwin also described what turned out to be this species as Delphinus fitzroyi from a specimen harpooned off Argentina in 1838. The dusky dolphin was reclassified as Prodelphinus obscurus in 1885 by British naturalist William Henry Flower, before gaining another name, Lagenorhynchus obscurus, from American biologist Frederick W. True in 1889.\nGenetics [ edit ]\nThe dusky dolphin and the Pacific white-sided dolphin are considered phylogenetically related species. Some researchers have suggested they are the same species, but morphological and life-history evidence shows otherwise. The two sister species diverged at around 1.9\u20133.0 million years ago. Recent analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene indicates that the genus Lagenorhynchus, as traditionally conceived, is not a natural (monophyletic) group. Another study finds that the dusky and the Pacific white-sided dolphin form the sister group to the (expanded) genus Cephalorhynchus. If this placement is accurate, a new genus name will need to be coined to accommodate these two species. It has therefore been proposed that the dusky dolphin, together with Pacific white-sided, hourglass, and Peale's dolphin are moved to the resurrected genus Sagmatias.\nDusky dolphins from Argentina and southwest Africa separated 2000 generations ago from an ancestral Atlantic population and subsequently diverged without much gene flow. Most populations have low genetic diversity, with the Peruvian population being an exception. Possible hybrids of dusky dolphins have been described with a long-beaked common dolphin and a southern right whale dolphin. There are three subspecies classified: the African dusky dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obscurus obscurus), Fitzroy's dolphin (L. o. fitroyi), and the Peruvian/Chilean dusky dolphin (L. o. posidonia). A fourth subspecies, L. o. superciliosus or the New Zealand dusky dolphin, has been proposed but is not currently accepted.\nDescription [ edit ]\nCloseup of dusky dolphin surfacing\nThe dusky dolphin is small to medium in length compared with other species in the family. There is significant variation in size among the different population areas. The largest dusky dolphins have been encountered off the coast of Peru, where they are up to 210 cm (6 feet) in length and 100 kg (210 pounds) in mass. The size for dusky dolphins in New Zealand have been recorded to be a length range of 167\u2013178 cm and a weight range of 69\u201378 kg for females and a length range of 165\u2013175 cm and a weigh range of 70\u201385 kg for males.\nAlmost no sexual dimorphism occurs in this species, although males have more curved dorsal fins with broader bases and greater surface areas. The back of the dolphin is dark grey or black, and the dorsal fin is distinctively two-toned; the leading edge matches the back in colour, but the trailing edge is a much lighter greyish white. The dusky dolphin has a long, light-grey patch on its fore side leading to a short, dark-grey beak. The throat and belly are white, and the beak and lower jaw are dark grey. Two blazes of white colour run back on the body from the dorsal fin to the tail. Right between the white areas remains a characteristic thorn-shaped patch of dark colour, by which the species can easily be recognised. Aside from that, dusky dolphins may be confused with other members of their genus when observed at sea. It can be distinguished from the common dolphin, which has a more prominent and longer beak and yellow flank markings. The skull of a dusky dolphin has a longer and narrower rostrum than that of an hourglass dolphin or Peale's dolphin of similar age and size.\nPopulations and distribution [ edit ]\nDusky dolphins of New Zealand\nThe dusky dolphin has a discontinuous semi-circumpolar range. The dolphins can be found off the coasts of South America, southwestern Africa, southern Australia and Tasmania, New Zealand, and some oceanic islands. Off South America, they range from southern Peru to Cape Horn in the west and from southern Patagonia to around 36\u00b0S in the east. Its range also includes the Falkland Islands. They are particularly common from Peninsula Valdes to Mar de Plata. In comparison, they are uncommon in the Beagle Channel and the inshore waters of the Tierra del Fuego region.\nDusky dolphins are found throughout New Zealand waters. The dolphin population in this area centres around East Cape and Cape Palliser on the North Island to Timaru and Oamaru on the South Island. They are especially common in the cold waters of the Southland and Canterbury currents. In Africa, the dusky dolphin ranges from Lobito Bay, Angola in the north to False Bay, South Africa in the south. Within Australian waters, dusky dolphins have been recorded in colder waters of Kangaroo Island, eastern Tasmania, and Bass Strait, although they are uncommon and those that are sighted there are possibly transients from New Zealand. They are also found around Campbell, Auckland, and Chatham in the western South Pacific, Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic and \u00cele Amsterdam, and \u00cele Saint-Paul in the southern Indian Ocean.\nEcology and behaviour [ edit ]\nDusky dolphins at Kaikoura , New Zealand\nDusky dolphins prefer cool, upwelling waters, as well as cold currents. They largely live in inshore waters and can be found up to the outer continental shelf and in similar zones in offshore islands. They can move over great distances (around 780 km), but have no well-defined seasonal migrations. However, dolphins off Argentina and New Zealand make inshore and offshore seasonal and diurnal movements. In Argentina, dusky dolphins associate closely with southern right whales and South American sea lions. They have been found around bottlenose dolphins, but apparently do not interact with them, and may share feeding areas with Risso's dolphins. They also associate with various seabirds, such as kelp gulls, cormorants, terns, shearwaters, petrels, and albatrosses. In New Zealand, dusky dolphins mingle with common dolphins. Dusky dolphins have also been observed with southern right whale dolphins and pilot whales off southwestern Africa.\nVocalisations and echolocation [ edit ]\nIn general, three different types of sounds are produced by dolphins (and other toothed whales). These are click trains, which are made of numerous individual clicks, usually broadband signals that change from low value to high value quickly, burst pulses, which are individual clicks with high repetition and can be heard by humans only as a buzzing sound, and whistles, which are signals that are pure-tones and whose frequency varies depending on the time. Dusky dolphins produce all three sounds, but most commonly make burst pulses. Whistling is more common when dusky dolphins mingle with other dolphin species such as common dolphins.: 79 Their echolocation signals are broadband and of short duration, much like those other whistle-producing toothed whales.: 95 They tend to have bimodal frequency spectra which peak between 40 and 50 kHz at low frequency and between 80 and 110 kHz at high frequency. The species' echolocation signals are about 9\u201312 dB lower than for the larger white-beaked dolphin.\nForaging and predation [ edit ]\nDusky dolphins\nDusky dolphins prey on a variety of fish and squid species. Common fish species eaten include anchovies, lantern fish, pilchards, sculpins, hakes, horse mackerel, hoki and red cod. They are generally coordinated hunters. Their very flexible foraging strategies can change depending on the environment. In certain parts of New Zealand, where deep oceanic waters meet the shore, dusky dolphins forage in deep scattering layers at night. They arrive at the hunting site individually, but form groups when in the layer. The dolphins use their echolocation to detect and isolate an individual prey. Groups of foraging dolphins tend to increase when the layer is near the surface and decrease when it descends.\nWhen hunting in shallower waters in New Zealand and Argentina, dusky dolphins tend to forage during the day. The dolphins chase schools of fish or squid and herd them into stationary balls. They may control the school with light reflected from their white bellies. Dolphins herd prey against the surface, but also horizontally against the shore, a point of land, or the hull of a boat. During these times, dusky dolphins are believed to increase prey availability for other predators, including other dolphins, seabirds, sharks, and pinnipeds. In Argentina, dusky dolphins may use bird aggregations to locate and herd prey. Conversely, pinnipeds and sharks take advantage of the dolphin hunts. Dusky dolphins are themselves preyed on by killer whales and large sharks. Dolphins avoid killer whales by swimming into shallower water. Dusky dolphins are also susceptible to parasitism by certain nematode, cestode, and trematode species, mostly the genera Nasitrema and Anisakis, and Phyllobothrium delphini, Braunina cordiformis, and Pholeter gasterophilus.\nSocial behaviour and reproduction [ edit ]\nDusky dolphins live in a fission-fusion society, with most group size increases occurring during foraging and decreases in group sizes occurring during resting and traveling. In the Golfo San Jos\u00e9 off the Valdes Peninsula, dolphins commonly switch between small traveling groups and large sociosexual groups, and encounter a variety of associates. Studies of dolphins off Kaikoura, New Zealand, showed the dolphins normally live in large groups that split into smaller subgroups. These subgroups are composed of mating adults (mating groups), mothers with calves (nursery groups) and nonbreeding adults. Dusky dolphins have a promiscuous mating system in which both males and females mate with multiple partners. Mating groups are generally made of around 10 males and a single female. These mating groups can be found in both shallow and deep water but more often gather near shore.: 162\nTwo dolphins jumping\nIn the mating groups, the males pursue a female in high-speed chases. Females seem to prefer males with great speed and agility rather than size, strength, or aggression.: 164 : 175 Females may extend the chase as long as possible so only the best male remains. Females may try to evade males that are not vigorous or lack social skill.: 170 Males also may form alliances to catch females.: 167\u201369 Unlike male bottlenose dolphins, male dusky dolphins cannot monopolise females.: 166 The time when female dusky dolphins first reproduce varies between regions. New Zealand dolphins first reproduce at about seven to years, with possibly six to seven years for Argentine dolphins. A study of dusky dolphins off the coast of Peru showed the reproductive cycle lasts around 28.6 months, with mother dolphins pregnant for 12.9 months, lactating for a further 12 months, and resting for 3.7 months before the cycle begins again. During copulation, females tend to be on the top.: 170 As with all species where females mate with multiple partners, male dusky dolphins have large testicles for sperm competition.: 166 Dusky dolphins sometimes engage in sexual behaviour for reasons other than reproduction, perhaps for greeting, communication, or strengthening social bonds. Homosexual behaviour between males has been observed. Dolphins having sex for social reasons tend to be more relaxed.: 175\nFemales with calves tend to gather in nursery groups in shallow water. Nursery groups likely provide mothers and calves more time to rest, which is important for both. While the behaviours of nursery groups vary by month, resting is the predominant behaviour during most months.: 188 The formation of nursery groups in shallow waters also allows members to hunt prey species that inhabit in these waters. Both adults and calves have been observed to chase and catch fish, and the adults may be teaching the calves how to hunt.: 188\u201389 In contrast to shallower waters, hunting in deep water at night may be too dangerous for calves.: 189 Calves are particularly vulnerable to predators like killer whales and use of shallow water by nursery groups may be a way to avoid predation.: 183 Nursery groups tend to avoid mating groups.: 174 Adult males in these groups will aggressively herd and chase females. They can separate calves from their mothers and harass them, as well.: 185 Calves may also become even more vulnerable to predators as they become exhausted and disoriented.: 185 Mother dolphins may look after calves that are not their own.: 192\nDusky dolphin performing a flip\nAerial behaviour [ edit ]\nDusky dolphins perform a number of aerial displays, including leaps, backslaps, headslaps, tailslaps, spins, and noseouts. They also perform head-over-tail leaps which have been called the most \"acrobatic\" of the displays. A headfirst re-entry is performed when a dolphin leaps entirely out of the water and positions its back in a curve while it flips the tail to land back in the water head-first. \"Humping\" is similar, except the snout and tail remain in the water when the dolphin is the arch. Leaps, head-over-tail leaps, backslaps, headslaps, tailslaps, and spins are often done over and over again. Young dusky dolphins apparently are not born with the ability to perform the leaps and must learn to master each one.: 190 Calves appear to learn the leaps in this order: noisy leaps, head first re-entries, coordinated leaps, and acrobatic leaps.: 190\u201391 Adults may perform different leaps in different contexts, and calves may independently learn how to perform leaps, as well as learn when to perform these when interacting others.: 191\nRelationship with humans [ edit ]\nStatus [ edit ]\nThe dusky dolphin, protected in much of its range, is listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN because; \"... assessment of global population status is not possible with the currently available estimates of abundance and removals. The subpopulation off Peru has probably been overexploited, but present data do not allow estimation of present decline\". Dusky dolphins may fall victim to the small cetacean fisheries of Peru and Chile. The expansion of these fisheries could have started in Peru when the anchoveta fishery collapsed in 1972. Dolphins have also been caught in gill nets in New Zealand, but catches appear to have dropped since the 1970s and 1980s. In Peru, dusky dolphins are killed in large numbers (10,000\u201315,000 per year) and used as shark bait or for human consumption. The dolphins are also thought to have been harpooned off South Africa, but the numbers are not considered large.\nThe dusky dolphin is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements.\nA pair of dusky dolphins swimming alongside a boat\nMussel farming [ edit ]\nThe effect of mussel farming on dusky dolphins has been studied in Admiralty Bay, New Zealand. Dusky dolphins are commonly seen in this area, which is also where the greatest density of farming activity is proposed. Apparently, dolphins rarely enter existing farms, and when they do, they usually swim quickly up the lanes and between rows of lines and floats.\nTourism [ edit ]\nDusky dolphins are popular attractions for whale-watching tours. Since 1997, dolphin-watching activities have increased in Patagonia, with dusky dolphins (along with Commerson's dolphins) as the target species. Tourists interested in seeing dusky dolphins grew from 1,393 in 1997 to 1,840 in 2000. Encounters with dolphins increased from 25% during 1999 to 90% in 2001. Dolphin watching in this areas started as an alternative to whale watching, which was mostly based on that of the southern right whale. Dusky dolphin watching is also popular in New Zealand, whose dolphin-watching industry begin in the late 1980s, as a side attraction to sperm whale watching. Whale and dolphin watching tours have grown with around 75 permitted dolphin tour operators.: 235 New Zealand has several locations to view and swim with dusky dolphins, notably in Kaikoura and Marlborough Sounds.: 236\nWhile dusky dolphin tourism is a larger industry in New Zealand than it is in Argentina, the effects of tourism on the dolphins seem to be lower in the former than the latter.: 241 New Zealand tours are operated under permits, and are limited in number and have conditions and guidelines related to approach procedures and swim operations.: 241 By contrast, no direct regulation of dolphin watching is done in Argentina. As such, dolphin activities are often disturbed by touring vessels.: 233\u201335\nSee also [ edit ]\nReferences [ edit ]\nGeneral [ edit ]"}

These genes include those involved in brain and metabolism.\nThese changes could be why dolphins are known to be exceptionally smart, able to use tools, recognize themselves and even communicate with each other and with trainers.\n\"We are interested in what makes a big brain from a molecular perspective,\" study researcher Michael McGowen, of Wayne State University School of Medicine in Michigan, told LiveSCience. \"We decided to look at genes in the dolphin genome to see if there are similarities in the genes that have changed on the dolphin lineage and those that have changed on the primate lineage.\"\nThe researchers compared about 10,000 genes from the bottlenose dolphin with nine other animals. (These included the cow, horse, dog, mouse, human, elephant, opossum, platypus and chicken \u2014 cows being the dolphin's closest relatives with a sequenced genome.)\nBy studying its mutations, they pinpointed which genes were \"evolving\" or what scientists call \"being selected for\" \u2014 genes that underwent changes and were passed on to future generations of dolphins \u2014 by comparing them to the analogous genes from the other species. If a dolphin gene has more protein-changing mutations than the cow version, for instance, that means it was actively evolving in the dolphin population at some time. [Animal Code: Our Favorite Genomes]\nBrain changes\nMore than 200 of the genes in their survey were drastically changed in the dolphins. Twenty-seven of these were involved in the nervous system (like the brain and sensory organs). There were also many changes in the genes related to metabolism (similar to changes seen in primates), which McGowen said are important because, \"brain tissue uses much more energy than other tissues.\"\nWhile we know these genes are associated with the brain, and this study says the genes are different in smarter animals, the researchers caution against linking them directly. Differences in the gene's \"code\" doesn't mean the gene actually acts any differently in the animal.\n\"We may not know exactly what they do yet even in humans or mice (the two most well-characterized mammals from a genetic perspective), much less dolphins; however, their function in the brain points to their importance,\" McGowen said. \"Probably, changes in these genes could have led to the amazing cognitive capacity seen in dolphins \u2014 it definitely points in that direction.\"\nSet apart\nUnexpectedly, the researchers also saw that the dolphins were evolving more slowly than some of the other animals, a trait also seen in other mammals with big brains.\n\"Over time (since the split between dolphins and cows about 70 million years ago), we observe many more mutations or changes in the DNA along the cow branch (and indeed horse and dog branches) than we do along the dolphin branch,\" McGowen told LiveScience in an email. \"This is exactly what we see in primates and elephants.\"\nThis is probably because these animals are using a different life-history approach \u2014 investing more in their offspring, but having fewer babies \u2014 which leads to slower evolution.\n\"It is striking that we see such similar molecular rates between all of these lineages and they have all such comparative large brains,\" McGowen said of the dolphins and primates.\nThe research is detailed in the June 27 issue of the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.\nFollow Jennifer Welsh on Twitter @microbelover or LiveScience @livescience.

They are Odontoceti (toothed whales) and have one blowhole. These dolphins live in small groups called pods.\nSIZE\nSHAPE AND FINS\nBottlenose Dolphins have stream-lined bodies and a rounded head with a distinctive beak. They have a tall, falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsal fin and broad, slightly pointed flippers.\nDIET AND TEETH\nBottlenose dolphins are hunters that fish mostly at the surface of the water, eating mostly fish and squid . They have many pairs of sharp, pointed teeth distributed in both the upper and lower jaws.\nPREDATORS OF DOLPHINS\nSome sharks (including tiger sharks, dusky sharks and bull sharks) and orcas will prey upon dolphins. Dolphins are also often trapped in people's fishing nets.\nSOCIAL GROUPS\nBottlenose dolphins live in small pods of up to 12 whales; they are very social animals. Often, many pods group together to form congregations of hundreds of dolphins.\nDIVING, JUMPING, AND BOW RIDING\nDolphins can dive down to more than 1,000 feet (300 m) and can jump up to 20 feet (6 m) out of the water.\nA bow rider is a dolphin that hitches a rides in the bow wave in front of a ship. The dolphin surfs using the pressure created in front of a moving ship.\nSPOUTING - BREATHING\nDolphins breathe air at the surface of the water through a single blowhole located near the top of the head. They need to breathe about every 2 minutes, but can hold their breath for several minutes. Their blow is a single, explosive cloud.\nSPEED\nDolphins are very fast swimmers.\nHABITAT AND RANGE\nBottlenose dolphins live near the coast and inshore waters from northern Cape Hatteras to southern Florida and westward through the Gulf of Mexico. Another population lives near the continental shelf off New Jersey. Bottlenose dolphins live in different areas during the different parts of their life cycle, for example, breeding and giving birth.\nLIFE SPAN\nPOPULATION COUNT\nCLASSIFICATION\nKingdom Animalia (animals)\nPhylum Chordata (vertebrates)\nClass Mammalia (mammals)\nOrder Cetacea (whales and dolphins)\nSuborder Odontoceti (toothed whales)\nFamily Delphinidae\nGenus Tursiops\nSpecies truncatus\nBOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN ACTIVITIES\nDolphin Anatomy: Label Me!\nA first grade addition activity.

The game takes place in real time, reflecting the current time of day and season. The individual games have been widely praised for their uniqueness and innovative nature, which has led to the series becoming one of Nintendo's leading franchises. As of January 2010, over 15,000,000 units of games from the Animal Crossing series have been sold.\nAn updated Japan-exclusive version, Doubutsu no Mori e+, was released in June 2003.\nEmulation Information\nGame Boy Advance <-> GameCube Connectivity\nThis title supports GameBoy Advance connection, which can be used via joybus emulation. As of 5.0-14690 Dolphin now has mGBA built in for GBA connectivity features. Simply set a GBA (Integrated) to the controllers you wish to connect and ensure you have a GBA BIOS configured in the Options -> Configuration -> GameCube and everything else with connecting will be handled automatically.\nIf you wish to use standalone GBA emulators for connectivity, you still can through the GBA (TCP) setting. mGBA 0.9.0 or newer and the latest VBA-M SVNs should be supported. Please follow each emulator's instructions for Joybus connectivity in order to connect to Dolphin.\nTo connect GBA in game:\nLaunch Dolphin, start Animal Crossing. There is a special island that is unlocked with a GBA connection and you can play NES games on the GBA screen.\nProblems\nNES Games: Bad Graphics\nNES games are distorted by default. They require XFB Real to display correctly due to scaling. You can also avoid that by using Progressive Scan to play them without RealXFB. Also playing them on the GBA works without XFB Real.

For the electronica band, see Swimming With Dolphins (band)\nWoman swimming with a dolphin\nThe popularity of swimming with dolphins and other interactions with dolphins greatly increased in the 1980s and 1990s due to the satisfaction and learning that human beings experience while swimming with dolphins. This activity may help to treat depression in humans.\nThere has been a proliferation of privately owned, for-profit dolphinariums around the world despite the controversy around this activity, which has yet to be circumscribed by the law. The renewed popularity of dolphins in the 1960s resulted in the appearance of many dolphinariums around the world. Though criticism and more strict animal welfare laws have forced many dolphinariums to close their doors, hundreds still exist around the world attracting a large number of visitors. These institutions are frequently the object of severe opposition from animal rights groups, particularly when poor conditions lead to the loss of animals, and when the dolphins are sourced from wild-caught populations such as the dolphin fishery of Taiji, Japan. The risks associated with interaction with dolphins include injury for humans and injury, stress and death for dolphins.\nScenarios [ edit ]\nThere are three types of environments where people can swim with dolphins: artificial pools, natural demarcated areas and at the sea. The natural demarcated areas are places adjacent to the sea that share the sea's pure water and seabed, Riviera Maya, and Cozumel in Mexico. Some (though certainly not all) sea swim programs are done at certain points where wild dolphins are accustomed to getting food. Some researchers are against feeding wild dolphins because of the risks of changing their eating habits. This practice costs somewhere in the range of $100 to $400+.\nPrograms [ edit ]\nSwimming with dolphins is an activity offered by many dolphinariums around the world, and there is a large and varied array of interactive programs and activities. Each dolphinarium usually has their specific supply and particular way to present their activities. Most programs include direct contact with dolphins; in some places it is allowed to take the dolphin fin and be dragged by the animal. Other dolphinariums do not allow this because it could be harmful to the animal. In recent years a program that allows customers to have the experience of being coaches has become popular. Some programs offer guests additional interaction by allowing them to act as trainers for the day. Most programs offer pictures and video memories of the experience.\nCountries with swimming with dolphin programs include Mexico, the United States, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and Israel as well as most Caribbean countries, including Cura\u00e7ao, the Bahamas, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic.\nMost dolphinariums charge between $75 to up to $200 per person per session.

Pinnipedia is made up of three main groups: The walrus, which is the only living member of the family Odobenidae; the eared seals of Otariidae, including numerous kinds of fur seal and sea lion; and the earless seals, known as true seals or Phocidae. Despite the name, earless seals have ears\u2014they\u2019re just hidden beneath the surface of their skin.\nPinnipeds can be found on every continent on Earth, though most species occur in cold-water environments. Thick layers of fat, also known as blubber, keep the animals warm, in addition to dense fur. Walruses are the exception to the rule, as these large, tusked pinnipeds have nearly hairless bodies.\nSeals range greatly in size, from the gargantuan southern elephant seal, which can weigh more than a pickup truck, to the relatively slender, 100-pound Baikal seal.\nWhile there are many differences among the species, all seals have feet shaped like fins. In fact, the word pinniped means \"fin-footed\" in Latin. Those fin-shaped feet make them supreme swimmers, and all pinnipeds are considered semi-aquatic marine mammals. This means they must spend some part of their lives on land or sea ice, usually during the mating and birthing seasons.\nWith so much time spent in water, some species like the elephant seals have evolved the ability to hold their breath for up to two hours and dive to depths of more than 6,500 feet looking for food. (Read more about how diving animals can stay underwater for so long.)\nNearly all seal species are reliant on marine habitats, though some will enter estuaries and rivers in search of food. An outlier is the Baikal seal, which spends its whole life in Lake Baikal, a freshwater lake in Siberia.\nEvolutionarily speaking, seals are thought to be most closely related to bears and the group of animals that includes weasels and otters, as well as skunks, raccoons, and red pandas.\nVaried diets\nAll seals eat other animals, and most rely on fish caught out at sea. But a few species break the mold.\nFor instance, leopard seals make a living hunting down penguins and even other seals. And walruses survive on a diet of clams and other shellfish, which they detect with their highly sensitive whiskers and then suction up from the seafloor with their powerful mouths.\nThere is also a species of pinniped known as the crabeater seal, which lives in Antarctica. However, these animals don\u2019t eat crabs at all\u2014at least not the kind you would think. Instead, these seals use highly specialized teeth to filter water for tiny, abundant crustaceans known as Antarctic krill.\nPinnipeds in peril\nHistorically, hunters have heavily targeted pinniped species for their fur, a practice that drove some species to extinction: The Caribbean monk seal, for instance, disappeared from the planet in the 1970s. Though hunting is more regulated today, the animals still face many threats, including lack of food, entanglement in fishing gear, and conflict with fishermen. Some species, like the Hawaiian monk seal and Mediterranean monk seal, remain very close to extinction.\nHowever, climate change represents the single largest threat to many species of pinnipeds, especially those that rely on sea ice. Various species of Arctic seals rely on ice for breeding, for instance, while walruses use seasonal ice formations to forage for food farther from shore. (Read how climate change is changing what leopard seals eat.)\nRinged seals build caves in the snow and create holes in the ice that give them access to the ocean. If that snow melts earlier than usual, it will put the animals at greater risk of predation from polar bears."}

Historically, they were hunted by coastal people, and in the case of aboriginal whaling, still are. This sort of subsistence hunting was on a small scale and produced only localised effects. Dolphin drive hunting continues in this vein, from the South Pacific to the North Atlantic. The commercial whaling industry and the maritime fur trade, which had devastating effects on marine mammal populations, did not focus on the animals as food, but for other resources, namely whale oil and seal fur.\nToday, the consumption of marine mammals is much reduced. However, a 2011 study found that the number of humans eating them, from a surprisingly wide variety of species, is increasing. According to the study's lead author, Martin Robards, \"Some of the most commonly eaten animals are small cetaceans like the lesser dolphins... That was a surprise since only a decade ago there had only been only scattered reports of this happening\".\nHistory [ edit ]\nHistorically, marine mammals were hunted by coastal aboriginal humans for food and other resources. The effects of this were only localised as hunting efforts were on a relatively small scale. Later, commercial hunting was developed and marine mammals were heavily exploited. This led to the extinction of the Steller's Sea Cow and the Caribbean monk seal. Today, populations of species that were historically hunted, such as blue whales Balaenoptera musculus and B. m. brevicauda), and the North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica), are much lower compared to their pre-exploited levels. Because whales generally have slow growth rates, are slow to reach sexual maturity, and have a low reproductive output, population recovery has been very slow. Despite the fact commercial whaling is generally a thing of the past since the passage of the International Whaling Commission\u2019s (IWC) moratorium on commercial whaling, a number of marine mammals are still subject to direct hunting. The only remaining commercial hunting of whales is by Norway where several hundred northeastern North Atlantic minke whales are harvested each year, and Iceland, which takes approximately 150 North Atlantic fin whales and less than 50 minke whales each year. Japan also harvests several hundred Antarctic and North Pacific minke whales each year under the guise of scientific research. However, the illegal trade of whale and dolphin meat is a significant market in some countries. Seals and sealions are also still hunted in some areas such as Canada.\nOverview [ edit ]\nThe fluke (tail) of a whale thinly sliced, rinsed and topped with vinegar-miso sauce Dolphin sashimi\nFor thousands of years, Arctic people have depended on whale meat. In Alaska now, the meat is harvested from legal, non-commercial hunts that occur twice a year in the spring and autumn. The meat is stored and eaten throughout the winter. Coastal Alaska Natives divided their catch into 10 sections. The fatty tail, considered to be the best part, went to the captain of the conquering vessel, while the less-desired sections were given to his crew and others that assisted with the kill. The skin and blubber (muktuk) taken from the bowfin, beluga, or narwhal is also valued, and is eaten raw or cooked.\nIn recent years Japan resumed hunting for whales, which they call \"research whaling\". Japanese research vessels refer to the harvested whale meat as incidental byproducts resulting from lethal study. In 2006, 5,560 tons of whale meat was sold for consumption. In modern-day Japan, two cuts of whale meat are usually distinguished: the belly meat and the tail or fluke meat. Fluke meat can sell for $200 per kilogram, over three times the price of belly meat. Fin whales are particularly desired because they are thought to yield the best quality fluke meat.\nIn some parts of the world, such as Taiji in Japan and the Faroe Islands, dolphins are traditionally considered food, and are killed in harpoon or drive hunts. Whaling has also been practiced in the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic since about the time of the first Norse settlements on the islands. Around 1000 Long-finned pilot whales are still killed annually, mainly during the summer.\nDolphin meat is consumed in a small number of countries world-wide, which include Japan and Peru (where it is referred to as chancho marino, or \"sea pork\"). While Japan may be the best-known and most controversial example, only a very small minority of the population has ever sampled it.\nIn Taiwan, demand for dolphin meat still exists. Despite laws banning the slaughter of dolphins and jail-time consequences for anyone who consumes dolphin meat, as many as 1,000 dolphins are killed by Taiwanese fishermen each year.\nDolphin meat is dense and such a dark shade of red as to appear black. Fat is located in a layer of blubber between the meat and the skin. When dolphin meat is eaten in Japan, it is often cut into thin strips and eaten raw as sashimi, garnished with onion and either horseradish or grated garlic, much as with sashimi of whale or horse meat (basashi). When cooked, dolphin meat is cut into bite-size cubes and then batter-fried or simmered in a miso sauce with vegetables. Cooked dolphin meat has a flavor very similar to beef liver. Dolphin meat is high in mercury, and may pose a health danger to humans when consumed.\nRinged seals were once the main food staple for the Inuit. They are still an important food source for the people of Nunavut and are also hunted and eaten in Alaska. Seal meat is an important source of food for residents of small coastal communities. Meat is sold to the Asian pet food market; in 2004, only Taiwan and South Korea purchased seal meat from Canada. The seal blubber is used to make seal oil, which is marketed as a fish oil supplement. In 2001, two percent of Canada's raw seal oil was processed and sold in Canadian health stores. There has been virtually no market for seal organs since 1998. Archaeological evidence indicates that for thousands of years, indigenous peoples have also hunted sea otters for food and fur.\nSee also [ edit ]\nReferences [ edit ]"}

Critically endangered LC NT VU EN CR EW EX Least Concern Extinct Current Population Trend : Decreasing\nWhat is a gharial?\nGharials, sometimes called gavials, are a type of Asian crocodilian distinguished by their long, thin snouts. Crocodilians are a group of reptiles that includes crocodiles, alligators, caimans, and more.\nHabitat\nGharials live in clear freshwater river systems, congregating at river bends where the water is deeper. They\u2019re not well-suited for land so they generally only leave the water to bask in the sun or to nest.\nOnce found from Pakistan to Myanmar, the reptile's range has shrunk to two countries: India, along the Chambal, Girwa, and Son Rivers; and Nepal, along the Narayani River.\nAppearance and behavior\nA typical gharial will reach 12 to 15 feet in length and weigh up to 2,000 pounds. Gharials regulate their body temperature by basking in the sun to warm up or resting in shade or water to cool down.\nMale gharials sport a large growth on their snout called a ghara, the Hindi word for \"mud pot.\" Males use their gharas to vocalize and blow bubbles during mating displays. The animals congregate to mate and make nests during the dry season, when females lay eggs in sandbanks along slow-moving sections of water. Eggs incubate for 70 days, and hatchlings will stay with their mothers for several weeks or even months.\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\nGharials do not stalk and lunge at prey like other crocodilians\u2014their snouts contain sensory cells that can detect vibrations in the water. By whipping their heads from side to side, the animals zero in on fish and grab them in their jaws, which are lined with more than a hundred teeth. While adults eat fish, their offspring also eat insects, crustaceans, and frogs.\nThreats to survival\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies the species as critically endangered. The biggest threats it faces are related to human activities.\nSince the 1940s, the gharial's numbers have declined as much as 98 percent due to hunting for traditional medicine and drastic changes to their freshwater habitats. For instance, people have manipulated the flow of rivers, causing certain areas to dry out and making it more difficult for water-reliant gharials to survive. Young gharials are also susceptible to being caught in fishing nets, which can lead to injury or drowning.\nConservation\nConcerns about the gharial\u2019s status has led to a number of conservation efforts in recent decades. The Indian government granted the species full protection in the 1970s with the goal of reducing poaching.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, conservation groups in India and Nepal launched rear and release programs that have introduced more than 6,000 captive-bred gharials into the wild. Unfortunately, the lack of effective monitoring means it\u2019s unclear how successful these programs have been."}

Southern elephant seals breed on land but spend their winters in the frigid Antarctic waters near the Antarctic pack ice.\nSouthern elephants are the largest of all seals. Males can be over 20 feet long and weigh up to 8,800 pounds. But these massive pinnipeds aren't called elephant seals because of their size. They take their name from their trunklike inflatable snouts.\nMating Battles and Reproduction\nWhen breeding season arrives, male elephant seals define and defend territories. They collect a harem of 40 to 50 females, which are much smaller than their enormous mates. Males battle each other for mating dominance. Some encounters end with roaring and aggressive posturing, but many others turn into violent and bloody battles.\nSea elephants, as these seals are sometimes called, give birth in late winter to a single pup and nurse it for approximately a month. While suckling their young, females do not eat\u2014both mother and child live off the energy stored in ample reserves of her blubber. Females give birth to a single pup each year after an 11-month pregnancy.\nMigration\nElephant seals migrate in search of food, spending months at sea and often diving deep to forage. They return to their rookeries in winter to breed and give birth. Though both male and female elephant seals spend time at sea, their migration routes and feeding habits differ: Males follow a more consistent route while females vary their routes in pursuit of moving prey.\nElephant seals were aggressively hunted for their oil, and their numbers were once reduced to the brink of extinction. Fortunately, populations have rebounded under legal protections."}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "10 Animals That Practice Homosexuality - Listverse", "url": "https://listverse.com/2013/04/20/10-animals-that-practice-homosexuality/", "text": "Scientific research is spotting a surprising range of animals that engage in same-sex relationships. In this mind-expanding list, we will look at the \u201cLesbian Albatrosses\u201d of Hawaii; male dolphins who keep boyfriends; and sam-sex seagull couples who adopt young to raise together. In the animal world, big surprises always await us:\n10 Rams\nWe are often told to count sheep when we want to fall asleep, but the natural tendencies of rams actually might keep scientists up at night. Domestic rams are statistically among the most extensively gay mammals in existence. Scientific studies have shown that up to an incredible eight percent of male sheep may form exclusively male-to-male pair bonds, forsaking all contact with the female ewes.\nThese same sex couples do not mate, but they act as a couple in every other way throughout their lives. The homosexual herds stand out as an example of diverse relationship status among animals\u2014but of course, they\u2019re less than popular among farmers, who seek to breed as many sheep as possible.\n9 Laysan Albatrosses\nIn 2007, scientists studying the laysan albatrosses of Oahu noticed that sixty percent of birds present were female, and that thirty-one percent of all the albatross pairs were lesbian. These pairs of female birds exhibit all the behaviors of close pair bonding, and engage in nesting, bill kissing, and a variety of other albatross breeding behaviors.\nLaysan albatrosses are normally highly defensive when they sense intruders\u2014 indicating that the acceptance of another female is true pair bonding. The same-sex partnerships may last as long as traditional pairs\u2014in one case, a whopping nineteen years. In New Zealand, a same-sex pair of even larger royal albatrosses were recently found tending a nest together, suggesting that the phenomenon may be widespread.\n8 Bottlenose Dolphins\nDolphins have a position on the top tier of animal intelligence, and are comparable to both chimpanzees and humans in cognitive and social abilities. Great diversity exists in dolphin societies as well, and numerous same-sex liaisons have been identified.\nIn one incredible case, a pair of gay dolphins enjoyed a seventeen year relationship, while researchers identified a whole pod of dolphins\u2014composed entirely of males\u2014whose members were certainly not lacking in romantic experiences. It has become clear that dolphin relationships are extremely strong, regardless of the specific orientation of the marine mammals involved. Many other dolphins have been found to be bisexual, enjoying passionate contact among their own sex as well as the opposite.\n7 Bonobos\nBonobos, which resemble miniature chimpanzees, are not only among the world\u2019s most intelligent animals but are in fact humanity\u2019s closest relative. Living in highly social colonies, bonobos are more good-natured compared to their frequently violent chimpanzee relatives. They\u2019re famous for using a language of love, rather than a language of aggression, to resolve problems and communicate with each other.\nSince many of the conflicts occur between two males or between two females, homosexual bonding is a frequent occurrence among these amorous apes. Sexual encounters may serve to increase social standing among females\u2014but it also occurs among males, who may take a more \u201cplay fight\u201d-based approach. Bonobos are critically endangered, and they require the utmost effort from conservationists to keep them in the wild.\n6 Cock of the Rock\nAndean \u201ccock of the rock\u201d are spectacular forest songbirds with an extremely dramatic appearance, combining brilliant orange with a huge crest. Natural selection has led to some rather outlandish feather adornments. Remarkably, up to forty percent of males engage in same sex activity.\nUnlike the seabirds previously discussed, only the male birds of this species seek homosexual encounters. It is possible that the gay behavior stems from high population densities, and extensive competition for females. Same sex encounters also satisfy the bird\u2019s desire for opportunities to express their promiscuous and highly developed mating drive, thereby increasing social stability among the normally edgy birds.\n5 African Lions\nAfrican lions are frequently invoked as symbols of traditional rulership, especially in patriarchal societies which involve female harems. A certain percentage of male African lions, however, forsake the available females in order to form their own same-sex group gatherings.\nMale lions have been documented mounting other males, and engaging in a variety of behaviors normally reserved for single pairs of opposite-sex couples. Though many other animal societies are structured in a way that might occasionally favor same-gender pairing, the reason for male lion associations is unknown. Lions have some of the strongest sex drives of any cat species, meaning that the encounters are probably more . . . purposeful than same sex interactions among birds or rams.\n4 Waterfowl and Penguins\nHomosexual behavior has been documented in wild Australian black swans, which sometimes form threesomes involving two males as they establish a nest site. Incredibly, such arrangements involving two males actually led to higher breeding success, due to the effectiveness of the males in defending the nest site from predators.\nAdditionally, two male penguins made headlines after they paired up in a zoo, and were given an egg which they successfully raised. Prior to being given an egg of their own, the gay penguins attempted to steal eggs from straight penguin couples.\nOrnithologists exploring the phenomenon have observed that, generally speaking, male bird pairs form among the more promiscuous songbird species, while female pairs form among monogamous species. While such behavior was naturally established in some bird species, scientific research has indicated that increased rates of same sex pairing among the South American ibis may be the result of mercury pollution from mining operations, which changes sex hormones.\n3 Western Gulls\nWestern gulls resemble the laysan albatross, but they\u2019re actually more closely related to puffins. Convergent evolution has given them a resemblance to the huge albatrosses, along with a similar mating system\u2014again sometimes involving two females. The more expressive gull pairs may even engage in mounting behaviors.\nScientific expeditions to California\u2019s Channel Islands revealed that no less than fourteen percent of gull pairs were partners in female-female couples. This diversity in the colonies was first noticed when some nests were found to contain surprisingly large numbers of eggs. Some of these eggs were even fertilized, due to \u201con the side\u201d encounters with male gulls.\n2 Giraffes\nYoung male giraffes, prior to mating with a female, sometimes engage in same-sex encounters and short term alliances. Activities may include tongue kissing, neck massaging and \u201chugs,\u201d as well as full-body contact and nuzzling. Scientists theorize that the purpose of the same-gender interactions is to develop a familiarity with the mating techniques before using them to court the appropriate female giraffe. In the small-town community which is the giraffe herd, it seems that the idea is to get it right with the girls from the word go\u2014by checking out some of the guys, first.\n1 Dragonflies\nIt\u2019s a fact: bugs can be gay. Dragonflies are among the most highly evolved predators in the insect world, and they\u2019re also among the most demonstrative\u2014engaging in spectacular in-flight ballets as well as serious sensual encounters with other dragonflies.\nBut the presence of the opposite sex is not always a prerequisite to dragonfly dating; investigations have revealed a surprisingly high frequency of matings between same-sex dragonflies. Understanding the reasons for same gender pairings among such small invertebrates is challenging, and the interactions are poorly understood even today. Environmental chemistry and the unavailability of partners may be one factor influencing dragonfly mating behavior.\nAndrew Blackstone is a radical researcher with a passion for the unexpected or mysterious elements of the universe. He is based in Canada\u2019s incredible coast mountains region."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Otters, facts and information - Animals", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/otters-1", "text": "Common Name : Otters Scientific Name : Mustelidae Type : Mammals Size : 2 to 6 feet long Weight : 10 to 75 pounds\nThe charismatic otter, a member of the weasel family, is found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica. Most are small, with short ears and noses, elongated bodies, long tails, and soft, dense fur.\nThere are 13 species in total, ranging from the small-clawed otter to the giant otter. Though most live in freshwater rivers, lakes, and wetlands, the sea otter and the smaller marine otter are found in the Pacific Ocean.\nHabitat and young\nWebbed feet and powerful tails, which act like rudders, make otters strong swimmers. Their nostrils and ears close to keep water out, and waterproof fur keeps them warm. They must carefully groom their fur and furry undercoat to keep them clean and sealed off to water, because they\u2019re not covered in a fatty layer like other seagoing creatures. Otters have the densest fur of any animal\u2014as many as a million hairs per square inch in places.\nOtters also have particularly stinky poop, which even has its own name: spraints. It\u2019s thought to get its special odor, which some scientists describe as smelling like violets, from the seafood diet otters eat.\nMost otter species come ashore to give birth in dens, which sometimes have been used by other animals such as beavers. Sea otters are the exception, giving birth in the water. Baby otters, called pups or kittens, stay with their mothers until they\u2019re up to a year old, or until she has another litter. River otters don\u2019t breed until they\u2019re at least five years old.\nAmazing behaviors\nAll otters are expert hunters that eat fish, crustaceans, and other critters. Sea otters have an ingenious method to open shellfish. A sea otter will float on its back, place a rock on its chest, then smash the mollusk down on it until it breaks open.\nWhen it\u2019s time to nap, sea otters entangle themselves in kelp so they don\u2019t float away. They also sometimes intertwine their feet with another sea otter, so that they stay together.\nRiver otters are especially playful, gamboling on land and splashing into rivers and streams. They learn to swim when they are about two months old, when their mother pushes them into the water.\nThreats\nOtters and their mustelid relatives were once hunted extensively for their fur, many to the point of near extinction. Despite regulations designed to protect them, many species remain at risk from pollution and habitat loss. The sea otter is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List, pressured by pollution, pesticides, and conflicts with fishermen who kill them for eating their fish. Asian otter species also face threats from the illegal pet trade."}

There are almost 40 species of dolphin in 17 genera. Dolphins vary in size from 1.2 metres (4 feet) and 40 kilograms (88 pounds) (Maui\u2019s Dolphin), up to 9.5 metres (30 feet) and 10 tonnes (the Orca). However, the average length for most North American species is 13.89 feet in length. Most species weigh about 50 to 200 kilograms (110 to 440 pounds).\nDolphins are found worldwide, mostly in the shallower seas of the continental shelves, and are carnivores, mostly eating fish and squid. The family Delphinidae is the largest in the Cetacea and relatively recent. Dolphins evolved about 10 million years ago, during the Miocene (The Miocene epoch is a period of time that extends from about 23 to 5.3 million years before the present).\nDolphins have a spindle-like shaped body that tapers at both ends, adapted for fast swimming. Their head contains the \u2018melon\u2019 (an oval shaped oily, fatty lump of tissue found at the centre of the forehead ), which is used for echolocation (non-human animals emitting sound waves and listening to the echo in order to locate objects or navigate).\nIn many species of dolphin, the jaws are elongated, forming a distinct beak however for some species like the Bottlenose Dolphin, there is a curved mouth that looks like a fixed smile. Teeth can be very numerous (up to 250) in several species. The dolphin brain is large and has a highly structured cortex, which often is referred to in discussions about their high intelligence.\nDolphins are often regarded as one of the most intelligent animal species. Dolphins often leap above the water surface, sometimes performing acrobatic figures. Scientists are not quite certain about the purpose of this behaviour, but it may be to locate schools of fish by looking at above water signs, like feeding birds.\nDolphins can also communicate with other dolphins to join a hunt, attempting to dislodge parasites, or simply doing it for fun.\nPlay is a very important part of dolphins lives and they can often be observed playing with seaweed or playfighting with other dolphins. Dolphins have even been seen harassing other creatures, like seabirds and turtles. Dolphins also seem to enjoy riding waves and are frequently seen \u2018surfing\u2019 coastal swells and the bow waves of boats.\nDolphin Species Scientific Name\nBottlenose Dolphin Tursiops truncatus\nAtlantic Spotted Dolphin Stenella frontalis\nPantropical Spotted Dolphin Stenella attenuata\nStriped Dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba\nRough-toothed Dolphin Steno bredanensis\nCommerson\u2019s Dolphin Cephalorhynchus commersonii\nHector\u2019s Dolphin Cephalorhynchus hectori\nCommon Dolphin:\nLong-Beaked Common Dolphin Delphinus capensis\nShort-Beaked Common Dolphin Delphinus delphis\nRisso\u2019s Dolphin Grampus griseus\nSpinner Dolphin Stenella longirostris"}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphins and Man.....Equals?", "url": "http://littletownmart.com/dolphins/", "text": "As a brain grows in size and as a child ages, immersed in many daily language situations, both brain and language increase in complexity. The usual human brain reaches 1400 grams at 10 to 17 years of age. The levels of complex thinking at this time increase tremendously over that of beginning speech.\nThe brain size of a bottle-nosed dolphin is comparable to ours at birth and, during their lifetime develops well into the upper levels of the maximum size for modern man -- about 1700 grams. A dolphin's brain size increases very rapidly during youth and seems to slow down at nine years of age. This decrease is less than our slow down which occurs at our equivalent age of 17 years and afterwards.\nThere was no random or apparent accidental contacts before the dolphin learned how. The same thing happened with three different dolphins. They seemed to anticipate the purpose of the switch. Probably from seeing him push it and connecting the push to the reward. Dr. Lilly had used this same technique on monkeys and made the statement that it usually took a chimp about 100 random tries before he learned to push the button, and then a few more to learn how to push the button.\nDr. John C. Lilly , who has provided extensive research on dolphins, performed the following two experiments which I consider well worthy of notice.\nA similar occurrence was noted when, in 1962, several Lockheed Aircraft Corporation scientists erected a similar barrier across a channel, this time with stronger microphones. As the dolphins approached clicking noises were heard -- possibly sonar soundings. They gathered into a group in nearby shallow water about 400 feet from the barrier. During this time lots of clicks and squeaky-door sounds were recorded. A scout left the group and examined the barrier. When the dolphin returned he was greeted in the same manner as before. After about four minutes of conversation another scout was sent out. Upon his return he too was greeted with the explosion of whistles. After about two and a half minutes the dolphins merrily clicked through the barrier. Returning into the bay that afternoon, and the next morning leaving the bay, the pod did not send a scout when they came to the barrier.....nor did they even slow down. 5\nIn 1962 Dr. Dreher and Dr. Evans were aboard the research vessel Sea Quest, 300 miles south of San Diego, studying gray whales. They had strung a number of vertical aluminum poles and microphones inside Scammon's Lagoon, erecting a type of barrier. A short time later five Pacific Bottle-nosed dolphins were spotted about 500 yards from the barrier. After a few minutes of what was labeled conversation, a scout was sent from the group. Microphones picked up his sonar soundings as he closely surveyed the poles. When he returned to the pod an explosion of whistles, chirps and Bronx cheer-like noises were recorded via microphones. After several minutes of conversation the dolphins proceeded through the barrier and into the bay. 4\nAt Marine Studio Oceanarium, Bimbo, an 18 foot pilot whale stopped eating and became aggressive to smaller dolphins in the tank. The trainers, after a long issue, decided that maybe his ego needed bolstering. So they proceeded to drain the tank to the three-foot level. Bimbo, now stranded, began to whistle piteously. Soon all the dolphins gathered around and comforted him with conversation which consisted of whistles, chirps and the usual dolphinese sounds. When the tank was again refilled, Bimbo's manners improved immediately. 3\nIn 1965 Anthropologist Gregory Bateson made the discovery that dolphins live in social groups dominated by a leader. This tie is so strong that dolphins kept in total isolation will suffer ill health and possibly death. It has also been observed that dolphins frequently stroke each other with their flippers, hence, indicating that they require physical contact much like humans. A dolphin's skin is extremely delicate and easily injured by rough surfaces--very similar to human skin.\nOutside of his striking friendliness, the Dolphin seems to have been blessed with a well developed sense of humor. Dolphins have been known to silently maneuver behind an unsuspecting pelican and snatch its tail feathers -- usually leaving the bird minus a few. Other pranks include grabbing unsuspecting fish by the tail, pulling them backward a few feet as well as bothering slow turtles by rolling them over and over. Once a dolphin was seen placing a piece of squid near a grouper's rock cranny. When the fish came out, the dolphin promptly snatched the bait away, leaving the puzzled fish behind.\nThe California Lockheed Company has done research on Pacific Bottle-nose dolphins under Navy contracts. Heads of Department Dr. John Dreher and Dr. William E. Evans have, after much research, reported 32 distinct patterns of dolphin whistles. Also, nearly identical sounds are made by Atlantic bottle-nose dolphins and Pacific pilot whales.\nAnother experiment, done by Dr. Lilly while stimulating parts of Dolphin #6's brain with electrical currents, proved that dolphins are capable of making more sounds than we had been previously aware of. Apparently Dr. Lilly's probe stimulated the part of the brain controlling the vocal cords. I couldn't find the exact number of sounds the dolphin produced, as it had been taped. However Dr. Lilly made the comment that he heard more types and variations of whistles, buzzings, rasping barks, and Bronx cheer-like noises than he'd ever thought a dolphin capable of.\nAnother dolphin was taped, after Dr. Lilly said \"the TRR is now ten per second\" (train repetition rate) repeating \"TRR\" in a high pitched, Donald Duck, quacking-like voice. The same dolphin also picked out \"three hundred and twenty three\" and also mimicked every laugh laughed in the lab at that time. 11\nA dolphin kept in complete captivity (with only human contacts) was trained to raise to the surface, emit a sound when any word was shouted over the surface of the water. After a careful examination of all the tapes, a conclusion was made that 18% of the sounds he emitted were considered humanoid emissions -- in other words, the dolphin was imitating our words.\nThere were several mentions where research was in process to compile a dictionary of \"Dolphinese\" but I couldn't find any results.\nEver since the first time man ventured into the sea, dolphins have been man's friend. Throughout history mentions are made showing this.\nIn Plutarch's book On the Cleverness of Animals and explanation was made of Odysseus worship of dolphins. Apparently Odysseus' son, Telmachos, fell into the sea and was saved by a dolphin. \"And this was why his father had dolphins engraved on his ring and emblazoned on his shield, making his requital to the animal\" 12 . A more familiar occurrence is mentioned in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. Arion, a rich poet and musician had his life threatened by pirates on board his ship. His last will was to sing one last song, and since he must die, he wished to jump overboard, taking his own life. After a very high-pitched, long, whaling song, Arion jumped overboard. But he did not drown. A dolphin carried him about 200 miles to shore. The Greek people say that Arion was not a god and that this is true and happened while Pereander was king (about 60 years BC). This incident was also recorded by historian Herodotos and others. 13\nIn about the year 200 AD Athenaios and Aelian both told the following story. A boy, Dionysios, had somehow made friends with a wild dolphin. The village people would come out on 'weekends' to watch the boy and dolphin play. It seems that the dolphin would take the boy far out to sea and stay gone for a 'long' time, possibly most of the day. No definite times were given. Hence the length of this relationship is not known, but the fact that 'rarely did anyone come anymore' made it sound like old stuff. Possibly it went on for several years before the dolphin met his tragic end. He followed the boy too far one day and was stranded on the beach. No one was around to help carry the dolphin back to sea and the dolphin died. 14\nIn 1962 a dolphin became very famous at Oponoi beach for his friendliness with people. He would show up every day and allow the children to play with him. About two thousand years ago in the Roman colonial town Hippo (now Bigerta, Africa, near Tunis) in the mouth of Hokianga Harbor a dolphin also allowed himself to be played with. In each case one person was allowed to ride on the dolphin's back.\nThere is a Greek legend that shows that the Greeks did consider the dolphin more than just a fish: Dionysos, god of wine and frenzy, was mistaken and to be sold as a slave. He was aroused to anger and changed the rowing oars into snakes. When the men felt \"madness\" coming on they leaped overboard, turning into dolphins. This is how the first dolphins were created, and why dolphins always help man.\nIn present day, man has started working with trained dolphins. A famous example of this is Tuffy, a trained porpoise who carried messages to Sealab I. He was by far the fastest means of transporting materials back and forth, as it took him only nine seconds for the round trip. Tuffy even rescued a simulated lost diver who called the dolphin with a buzzer.\nIn 1965 a young male dolphin named Keiki (who was caught in 1964 off Oahu) worked in the open sea off Oahu Hawaii, for 7 days. He was trained to return to a wire cage at night and come to a whistle. When he was first taken out to sea, he seemed fearful, but returned every evening to his cage and never once tried to rejoin wild dolphins even when a school swam within 400 feet of him.\nAfter hearing so much good about dolphins, it's time to hear some of the bad. Right? Since I did want to produce a true picture I tried to look for some negative facts. Would you believe I really couldn't find any!\nPhoto by Daniel McCulloch \u00a9 1991\nAs we continue in our quest to manipulate our environment, what does science hope to learn from the Dolphin? For one thing, the secret to his sonar would help the navy in sonar development. A dolphin's built-in sonar far surpasses the performance of man-made equipment. He can not only tell size, shape and texture, but also density. Furthermore, no one has, as of yet, been able to jam their sonar. The dolphin's ability to directionalize his sonar beam lends a glint of jealously in any scientist eyes. An excellent example of this is the fact that a dolphin can find a single BB (shot) when dropped at the far end of a 70 foot pool in less than 20 seconds.\nSonar isn't the only dolphin secret science is after, not by far. The shape of the dolphin's body and its ability to reach unbelievable speeds (40 knots and up) could help aviation as well as seafaring vessel development. To be able to mimic the dolphin's ability to dive and surface quickly and silently would be highly desirable by any submarine captain. There could be a potential value of an air/sea eye, as well.\nWe do not yet know how dolphins navigate, they cold use the stars, moon and sun, or they might use methods involving depth (bottom of the sea soundings), currents, water temperature, salinity, plankton, water tastes, etc. At any rate this secret could lend a helping hand to science.\nDolphins have never in all our history been known to attack man -- even when man tries to make him. The dolphin will resist even until his death. This alone leads me to believe that there is something superior in dolphins than in any other creature.........including man. C.S. Lewis, in Perelandra (book two of his space trilogy), wrote about a planet where God had created two intelligent species....one that walked on the ground and one that swam in the oceans. What if.......\nSee an Estonian translation of this article.\nNOTE: The above statement regarding dolphin attacks on man was true when this article was first written in 1970. However, during the last few years there have been several documented attacks and saves.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "How did whales evolve? - Whale & Dolphin Conservation USA", "url": "https://us.whales.org/whales-dolphins/how-did-whales-evolve/", "text": "Hippos are the closest living relatives of whales, but they are not the ancestors of whales. Both hippos and whales evolved from four-legged, even-toed, hoofed (ungulate) ancestors that lived on land about 50 million years ago. Modern-day ungulates include hippopotamus, giraffe, deer, pig and cow. Unlike the hippo\u2019s ancestor, whale ancestors moved to the sea and evolved into swimming creatures over a period of about 8 million years.\nFossils of gigantic ancient whales called Basilosaurus were first mistaken for dinasaur fossils but were later recognised as mammals. These prehistoric whales were more elongated than modern whales and had small back legs and front flippers. Their nostrils were situated halfway between the tip of the snout and the forehead and they had earbones just like those of modern whales. Basilosaurus shows the link or intermediate between whales and their terrestrial ungulate ancestors.\nThe theory is that some land-living ungulates favoured munching on plants at the water\u2019s edge which had the added advantage of allowing them to easily hide from danger in shallow water. Over time their descendants spent more and more time in the water and their bodies became adapted for swimming. Their front legs became flippers and a thick layer of fat called blubber replaced their fur coats to keep them warm and streamlined. Eventually, their tails became bigger and stronger for powerful swimming and their back legs shrunk. Gradually, their nostrils moved to the top of their heads so that they could breathe easily without the need to tilt their heads while swimming. As some of these creatures began to feed on a different diet, they evolved into baleen filter feeders and lost their teeth."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Cuttlefish, facts and photos - Animals", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/invertebrates/facts/cuttlefish", "text": "Common Name : Cuttlefish Scientific Name : Sepiida Type : Invertebrates Diet : Carnivore Average Life Span : One to two years Size : 1.7 to 20 inches long\nWhat are cuttlefish?\nDespite their name, cuttlefish are not fish but intelligent invertebrates related to the octopus, squid, and nautilus. These fascinating creatures can count, exert self-control, and have numerous wily tactics to evade predators, including creating their own body double from a cloud of ink. Despite being colorblind, cuttlefish also have highly sophisticated color-changing abilities.\nThe more than 120 different species of cuttlefish are usually solitary animals and can be found in oceans all around the world. While most live in shallow waters, some species can be found at depths of more than 3,000 feet.\nAppearance and behavior\nThese cephalopods (which means \u201chead foot\u201d) have eight arms and two long tentacles attached directly to their head. The mantle\u2014the area behind the eyes which contains the cuttlefish\u2019s internal organs\u2014is surrounded by a fringe-like fin that flaps in a rippling motion for maneuvering.\nCuttlefish control buoyancy using an internal shell called the cuttlebone. By adding different amounts of liquid or gas into tiny holes within this structure, these animals can change their buoyancy, making them float up or down. They can also move using jet propulsion: filling their body cavities with water then forcefully squirting it out to propel themselves backward.\nThese predators feed on fish, crabs, prawns, smaller cuttlefish, and shrimp, using extendable tentacles to grab prey which they immobilize with a toxic bite. The cuttlefish\u2019s beak, located at the base of its arms, is sharp enough to break hard crab shells.\nIntelligence\nCuttlefish have a large brain-to-body size ratio\u2014among the biggest of all invertebrates\u2014which makes them incredibly intelligent. They can count and can remember what, where, and when they last ate; a memory trait once believed to be unique to humans. Unlike many human toddlers, they can even pass the marshmallow test : A 2021 study found cuttlefish can will eat less food earlier if they know they will be rewarded with shrimp, their favorite treat, if they wait.\n2:20\nMasters of camouflage\nLike other cephalopods, cuttlefish are masters of disguise. By controlling the 10 million color cells within their skin, they can quickly change color, pattern, and texture\u2014sometimes completing the illusion by making shapes with their tentacles to better blend into the background.\nThese disguises help them deter or evade predators, mimic other species to catch prey , and communicate with other cuttlefish. They can even display two messages at once: At least one male cuttlefish has been spotted simultaneously wooing a female mate by flashing courtship colors on one flank while disguising itself as a female on the other flank to trick a male rival.\nVision\nAlthough renowned for their color-changing ability, these \"chameleons of the sea\" are colorblind. They have distinctive W-shaped pupils, which allow them to see almost entirely behind them and may even be able to switch between forward-facing and peripheral vision.\nUnlike humans, cuttlefish can detect differences in polarized light, which adds an extra dimension to their vision by allowing them to perceive the angle at which light is reflected when it bounces off a surface. In fact, they have more acute polarized vision than any other animal.\n1:36\nEvading predators\nPreyed on by dolphins, sharks, large fish, sea lions, and even other cuttlefish, these soft-bodied mollusks have several self-defense tactics. Camouflage helps them merge into the background and they spend 95 percent of their time in hiding. Another defense mechanism involves squirting a cloud of ink as a distraction while the cuttlefish tries to escape, sometimes even mixing mucus with the ink to create a \u201cpseudomorph\u201d in the shape of their body as a decoy.\nWhen hunted, cuttlefish adapt their response to the predator: striking, intimidating visual displays to discourage those that hunt by sight or simply swimming away from those that find prey through other senses. To avoid sharks, which detect the electrical currents emitted by prey, cuttlefish minimize these electric signals by freezing, covering their body with their arms, and slowing their breathing.\nMating behavior\nDuring courtship, male cuttlefish put on a dazzling display to attract females\u2014over whom rival males will fight viciously. Males will pass a packet of sperm to the female, who stores sperm from several males in her mouth cavity until she chooses which to use for fertilization. To maximize chances of reproductive success, males can shoot water into a female\u2019s mouth to displace other males\u2019 sperm packets before depositing theirs.\nWhen a female is ready, she finds a safe spot to lay and fertilize her eggs, which are called sea grapes because they are set in bunches and stained black by the mother\u2019s ink. Cuttlefish die after reproduction, usually at around two years old.\nThreats to survival\nMost species of cuttlefish are not endangered. However, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature lists the giant Australian cuttlefish (Sepia apama) as near threatened and notes that the ocean acidification caused by increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is potentially a threat to all cuttlefish. Meanwhile, the common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) have been declared endangered along Britain\u2019s south coast from overfishing."}

They get their name from their spectacular dorsal fin that stretches nearly the length of their body and is much higher than their bodies are thick.\nFeeding\nThey are members of the billfish family, and as such, have an upper jaw that juts out well beyond their lower jaw and forms a distinctive spear. They are found near the ocean surface usually far from land feeding on schools of smaller fish like sardines and anchovies, which they often shepherd with their sails, making them easy prey. They also feast on squid and octopus.\nGame Fishing\nTheir meat is fairly tough and not widely eaten, but they are prized as game fish. These powerful, streamlined beasts can grow to more than 10 feet and weigh up to 220 pounds. When hooked, they will fight vigorously, leaping and diving repeatedly, and sometimes taking hours to land.\nPopulation\nSailfish are fairly abundant throughout their range, and their population is considered stable. They are under no special status or protections."}

These are known as extinct animals.\nAnd we\u2019re not just talking about roar-some prehistoric dinosaurs! There are \u2018recently extinct\u2019 animals, too \u2013 animals that have died out since the 1500s. Join us as we travel back in time to discover the sad stories of eight of these incredible creatures\u2026\nEight extinct animals\nDodo\nMauritius 1680s*\nAll that remains today of the dodo are a few bones and partial skeletons \u2013 so it\u2019s no wonder we have the expression \u2018dead as a dodo\u2019! But these chubby, flightless birds were once alive and well in the forests of Mauritius. Their tragic tale began in the 16th century, when Dutch sailors arrived on the island and hunted this brilliant bird. The main cause of the dodo\u2019s extinction, however, was the animals the sailors brought with them, such as cats, pigs and rats \u2013 they guzzled on dodo eggs and out-competed the birds for food, wiping them out by the 1680s.\n(* The year of extinction)\nGreat Auk\nRocky islands off the North Atlantic coast (1844)\nThe black-and-white great auk was once found around the North Atlantic, waddling around on craggy coasts \u2013 including in the UK \u2013 or swimming in the waves using its short wings. But during the early 19th century, the great auk was killed in huge numbers for its feathers, meat and oils, and because people believed it had supernatural powers. Unafraid of humans, the flightless, defenceless birds were very easy to catch. Sailors would simply round them up and walk them onto ships, before bashing them on the head. Not an auk-some ending.\nThylacine\nTasmania, mainland Australia and New Guinea (1936)\nAlso known as the Tasmanian tiger, the thylacine was once the world\u2019s largest meat-eating marsupial. It looked a bit like a wolf, but had yellow-brown fur, stripes on its back and a thick, long tail. Its scientific name Thylacinus cynocephalus is Greek for \u2018dog-headed pouched one.\u2019 Although populations suffered disease and habitat loss, it\u2019s believed humans were to blame for the thylacine\u2019s ultimate extinction. Since the fierce predators liked to feast on sheep and other livestock, European settlers were quick to kill them \u2013 in fact, the Tasmanian government even paid people to do so! The last known thylacine died in 1936, in Hobart Zoo, Australia.\nSteller\u2019s Sea Cow\nBering Sea, north Pacific Ocean (1768)\nGerman naturalist Georg W. Steller first studied and described this amazing animal in 1741, in the north Pacific Ocean. Related to today\u2019s manatees and dugongs, Steller\u2019s sea cows were huge marine mammals that grew up to 10m long \u2013 that\u2019s twice the length of a large family car! Living in peaceful herds, they grazed on sea grass, kelp and algae. Sadly, sailors and seal hunters soon realised the animal\u2019s fatty meat provided a hefty food supply for their voyages and they began to hunt them, big time. The result? The Steller\u2019s sea cow became extinct just 27 years after being discovered.\nDid you know we have a FREE downloadable Extinct Animals Primary Resource? Great for teachers, homeschoolers and parents alike!\nAurochs\nEurope and Asia (1627)\nTurn the clocks back several centuries, and you\u2019ll find huge, horned aurochs roaming the forests of Europe and parts of Asia \u2013 perfect hunting fodder for early humans. Today, all that remains of these colossal cattle are a few skeletons in museums, along with some prehistoric cave paintings of the big beasts in Lascaux Cave, France, which may date back 20,000 years! It\u2019s highly likely that aurochs are the ancestors of today\u2019s cows, but they were much, much bigger, growing up to 1.85m in height (way taller than the average man!). The last of the aurochs lived in Poland, where the bulky breed died out in 1627.\nGastric Brooding Frog\nAustralia (1980s)\nTadpoles swim in ponds, right? Not the incredible gastric brooding frog\u2019s. The females would \u2018eat\u2018 their own frogspawn, brooding the tadpoles in their stomachs for 6-7 weeks, having \u2018turned off\u2019 their digestive juices and stopped eating food. They then \u2018gave birth\u2018 to a brood of baby frogs by projectile vomiting them out of their mouths. Wow! Sadly, the Australian amphibians were wiped out within a decade of being discovered in 1973. But we have exciting news\u2026 by taking cells from gastric brooding frogs frozen in labs years ago, and inserting them into the eggs of today\u2019s living frogs, scientists hope to bring this super species back to life. Sick!\nTecopa Pupfish\nCalifornia, USA (1981)\nThese fab little fish once swam in the waters of two hot springs in California\u2019s Death Valley, USA. Tiny but tough, the Tecopa pupfish had adapted\nto withstand the 43\u00b0C waters. But in 1965, the springs where they lived were merged together to build a bathhouse, and the water became too hot and salty for the fish to survive. As a result, in 1970, the poor pupfish was added to the Endangered Species List \u2013 unfortunately, it was too late. By 1981, it was declared Extinct \u2013 another awful outcome of human development.\nBaiji River Dolphin\nChina (2004)\nIn ancient Chinese folklore, the almost blind Baiji River dolphin was said to be the reincarnation of a princess who was drowned after refusing to marry a man she did not love. Sadly, the real-life story of the Baiji is just as tragic. Up until the 1950s, thousands of the small, pale grey aquatic animals splashed about in the murky waters of China\u2019s Yangtze River. But, due to overfishing, collisions with ships and pollution, it\u2019s believed these mammals are now Extinct. While they\u2019re still listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List (see right), there have been no confirmed sightings of this spectacular swimmer since 2004.\nThe IUCN Red List\u2026\nWe often hear about animals and plants being \u2018Endangered\u2019 or \u2018Vulnerable\u2019, but what does this actually mean? To help work out which species need most help, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), created the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in 1964 \u2013 a system for classifying species according to the risk of extinction they face.\nSo, how does the Red List work? After scientists have thoroughly evaluated a certain animal, plant or fungus, they place it in one of several categories on the Red List\u2026\nLeast Concern (LC)\nWidespread and not in imminent danger\nof being threatened. Phew!\nNear Threatened (NT)\nA species that could in the near future be\nplaced in a \u2018threatened\u2019 category (below).\nVulnerable (VU)\nFacing a high risk of extinction in the wild.\nEndangered (EN)\nA species that\u2019s facing a very high risk\nof extinction in the wild.\nCritically Endangered (CR)\nFacing an extremely high risk of extinction\nin the wild.\nExtinct In The Wild (EW)\nNo longer found in the wild. Populations are only found in zoos, botanical gardens or\nbreeding programmes.\nExtinct (EX)\nNo individuals exist in the wild, in captivity or cultivation.\nDifferent factors are taken into account before selecting the correct category, including current population size, rate of decline and geographic range. Scientists around the world regularly reassess the different species to see if there are any changes to the status of the species on the list. In this way, we can help preserve and protect our world\u2019s incredible nature. Fingers crossed!\nWhat do you think of our list of extinct animals? Leave a comment below and let us know!"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Mammal Pictures & Facts - National Geographic", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/", "text": "About Mammals\nMammals are among the most adaptable animals on the planet.\nThey are found on every continent and in every ocean, and range in size from tiny bumblebee bats to enormous blue whales. One reason for their success is the way they move. Mammals as a group use every possible form of locomotion. Terrestrial species walk, run, jump, climb, hop, swing, dig, and burrow. Aquatic ones swim, shuffle, and dive. A few even fly.\nDiet and behavior vary, too. Many carnivores, for example, are top predators that live generally solitary lives. These include jaguars, tigers, and polar bears. By contrast, lions, otters, wolves, and dolphins live in family groups. Even more social are some of the herbivores, especially hoofed animals like deer and zebra. By living in large groups, they gain both protection against becoming another animal\u2019s meal and more opportunities to breed. Among omnivores, primates are known for their high intelligence, and rodents for their high numbers.\nMammal bones, especially skulls, are used for identification, and to work out the evolutionary history of each species. The jaws of a house cat are more lion- than wolf-like, for example. The teeth of horses and zebras look alike. The ear bones of mammals were once the jaws of prehistoric reptiles. And so on.\nDespite these differences, all mammals share four traits that are shown in the diagram below: hair, mammary glands, a hinged jaw, and three tiny middle ear bones. Most have specialized teeth and moveable external ears."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "How do Whales and Dolphins Sleep Without Drowning?", "url": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-whales-and-dolphin/", "text": "Marine mammals such as whales and dolphins spend their entire lives at sea. So how can they sleep and not drown? Observations of bottlenose dolphins in aquariums and zoos, and of whales and dolphins in the wild, show two basic methods of sleeping: they either rest quietly in the water, vertically or horizontally, or sleep while swimming slowly next to another animal. Individual dolphins also enter a deeper form of sleep, mostly at night. It is called logging because in this state, a dolphin resembles a log floating at the water's surface.\nWhen marine mammals sleep and swim at once, they are in a state similar to napping. Young whales and dolphins actually rest, eat and sleep while their mother swims, towing them along in her slipstream--a placement called echelon swimming. At these times, the mother will also sleep on the move. In fact, she cannot stop swimming for the first several weeks of a newborn's life. If she does for any length of time, the calf will begin to sink; it is not born with enough body fat or blubber to float easily.\nLots of swimming will tire an infant, producing a weak animal susceptible to infection or attack. Adult male dolphins, which generally travel in pairs, often swim slowly side by side as they sleep. Females and young travel in larger pods. They may rest in the same general area, or companionable animals may pair for sleeping while swimming.\nWhile sleeping, the bottlenose dolphin shuts down only half of its brain, along with the opposite eye. The other half of the brain stays awake at a low level of alertness. This attentive side is used to watch for predators, obstacles and other animals. It also signals when to rise to the surface for a fresh breath of air. After approximately two hours, the animal will reverse this process, resting the active side of the brain and awaking the rested half. This pattern is often called cat-napping.\nDolphins generally sleep at night, but only for a couple hours at a time; they are often active late at night, possibly matching this alert period to feed on fish or squid, which then rise from the depths. Bottlenose dolphins, based on electroencephalogram (EEG) readings, spend an average of 33.4 percent of their day asleep. It is not clear whether cetaceans undergo dream sleep. Rapid Eye Movement (REM)--a characteristic of deep sleep--is hard to discern. But a pilot whale was noted as having six minutes of REM in a single night.\nTo avoid drowning during sleep, it is crucial that marine mammals retain control of their blowhole. The blowhole is a flap of skin that is thought to open and close under the voluntary control of the animal. Although still a matter of discussion, most researchers feel that in order to breathe, a dolphin or whale must be conscious and alert to recognize that its blowhole is at the surface.\nHumans, of course, can breathe while the conscious mind is asleep; our subconscious mechanisms have control of this involuntary system. But equipped with a voluntary respiratory system, whales and dolphins must keep part of the brain alert to trigger each breath.\nOther methods help marine mammals to hold their breath longer than other types of mammals can. Marine mammals can take in more air with each breath, as their lungs are proportionately larger than those in humans. In addition, they exchange more air with each inhalation and exhalation. Their red blood cells also carry more oxygen. And when diving, marine mammals' blood travels only to the parts of the body that need oxygen--the heart, the brain and the swimming muscles. Digestion and any other processes have to wait.\nFinally, these animals have a higher tolerance for carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Their brains do not trigger a breathing response until the levels of CO 2 are much higher than what humans can tolerate. These mechanisms, part of the marine mammal diving response, are adaptations to living in an aquatic environment and help during the process of sleeping. Cetaceans reduce the number of breaths they take during rest periods; a dolphin might average 8 to 12 breaths a minute when fairly active only to have their breathing rate drop to 3 to 7 per minute while resting.\nIt is actually rare for a marine mammal to \"drown,\" as they won't inhale underwater; but they do suffocate from a lack of air. Being born underwater can cause problems for newborn whale and dolphin calves. It is the touch of air on the skin which triggers that first, crucial breath. And necropsies sometimes show that an animal never gets to the surface to take its first breath of air. The same problem can occur when an animal is caught in a fishing net. If unable to reach the surface, or if in a panic, the animal may dive deeper, where it will be unable to breathe and suffocate.\nObviously sleeping safely at sea can pose problems, but the marine mammal system has addressed them."}

Despite its protected status, the tiger is still illegally hunted, both for its hide and for other body parts, which are used in traditional Asian medicine.\nYou can find out more about tigers on this page: Tiger Facts\nYou can read stories featuring tigers in our Tales From The Brink endangered animal story books\nBack to animal index\nTiger Chameleon\nPhoto: Hans Stieglitz, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons (cropped/resized by ActiveWild.com)\nScientific name: Archaius tigris\nType of animal: Reptile\nWhere found: The Seychelles\nThe tiger chameleon is an endangered reptile found only on the Seychelles, an African island country in the Indian Ocean. The species is around 6.3 in / 16 cm in length, and has a distinctive cluster of spiky growths on its chin. It hunts insects using its extendable sticky tongue.\nWhy are tiger chameleons endangered?\nThe main threat to the tiger chameleon is the introduction of the non-native tree, Cinnamomum verum, which is dominating native species.\nBack to animal index\nWhale Shark\nScientific name: Rhincodon typus\nType of animal: Fish\nWhere found: Tropical oceans worldwide\nThe whale shark, which reaches lengths of up to 62 ft. / 18.8 m, is the world\u2019s largest fish species.\nUnlike all but two of the over 500 other species of sharks, the whale shark it is a filter feeder. (The other two filter-feeding sharks are the basking shark, which is also endangered, and the megamouth shark, which is not currently threatened.)\nDespite its great size, the whale shark diet consists of plankton \u2013 small organisms that drift in the water.\nThe whale shark is usually found near the surface of the ocean, but is known to dive to depths of 1.2 miles / 1.928 km.\nWhy are whale sharks endangered?\nThe whale shark is endangered due to hunting (both targeted and accidental). It is also the victim of vessel strikes.\nYou can find out more about the whale shark on this page: Whale Shark Facts\nBack to animal index\nWhooping Crane\nScientific name: Grus americana\nType of animal: Bird\nWhere found: North America\nThe whooping crane is a long-necked, long-legged bird whose white plumage distinguishes it from the much more common sandhill crane (whose plumage is generally grey-brown). It is the tallest, and one of the heaviest, birds of North America.\nThe wild population of whooping cranes currently numbers around 250 adult individuals (due to recent breeding successes this number may actually be substantially larger). Most spend summers in Canada\u2019s Wood Buffalo National Park, and overwinter in wetlands in Texas, USA.\nThe species is named for its extremely loud whooping call.\nWhy are whooping cranes endangered?\nThe whooping crane became an endangered species due to overhunting and habitat loss.

They are killed for food, their body parts, and to be used as bait in other fisheries. Arguably the most notorious and bloody hunts take place in Taiji, Japan and the Faroe Islands where dolphins and small whales are driven onto beaches or into coves, before being slaughtered., In Taiji, some of the young animals are removed and sold into a life in captivity. The Taiji hunt and the method of slaughter is so controversial that the hunters set up a curtain across the shoreline to hide their activities from the public."}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Skunk Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Skunk-facts.html", "text": "skunk Facts\nPortrait of a Skunk\nThe skunk is a small, well-furred carnivore about the size of a house cat. It has iconic black and white markings, and the most notorious defense mechanism in the animal kingdom - the power of stench.\nOnce considered a member of the mustelid, or weasel family, which includes badgers and otters, skunks are now classified, since 1997, in their own family Mephitidae from the word \"mephitical\" meaning \"noxious vapor\". The new family includes 10 species of American skunks, and 2 species of old world animals called \"stink badgers\", which are native to Indonesia.\nOne of the Americas most recognizable animals is the striped skunk. Striped skunks are as wide-spread as any species in North America, and can be found in every state in the contiguos United States.\nStriped skunks are crepuscular animals, meaning they are most active at dusk and dawn, and they spend most of their time digging and hunting for insects, grubs, mice, rats, and just about anything else they encounter.\nThey will eat fruits or vegetables occasionally, human garbage happily, and unattended dog and cat food too.\nMost skunks are black and white in color, although brown is not uncommon, and albino individuals occur as well. Dramatic stripes or spots across the coat serve as a warning for predators to stay away, and for the most part, they do.\nOnly inexperienced animals will push the limits of a little skunk, and the skunk will give lots of warning if they are being harassed. Skunks will hiss, do little bluff-charges, stamp their feet, and, last but not least, do handstands while whisking their tails violently.\nIf the aggressor doesn't heed the warnings, the skunk finally faces it's raised tail towards the offender and releases a 10 foot stream of sulfuric anal juices. Like tear gas, the skunks anal secretions not only wreak, but also burn the eyes and mucous membranes of unfortunate victims.\nMost animals, be they mountain lions, bear cubs or young coyotes, once sprayed, will never risk contact with a skunk again, and the skunks dramatic coloring makes it easy for their victims to remember them and avoid them in the future.\nThe only creature that preys on them regularly is the great horned owl, which, somehow, is not deterred by the odor or the stinging sensations. Many domestic dogs and cats though, for whatever reason, just don't seem to learn their lesson, some making a lifetime habit of getting \"skunked\".\nWhile a bath in tomato juice is often used to try to remove the odor, the actual remedy is a mixture of baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, and liquid detergent - it's supposed to do the trick!\nAlthough they try to avoid confrontation with humans, pets and predators, skunks are carnivorous hunters, possessing large sharp teeth and extremely long, curved claws.\nThey are generally helpful animals, ridding farms and suburban neighborhoods of all sorts of unwanted vermin, but can be destructive to lawns, sheds and the lower perimeters of homes as they dig and rip in search of grubs and mice.\nFor this reason, more than any other, the idea that skunks can make nice house pets is a challenged one. Skunks have been bred since the 1950's for the pet trade, and are offered for sale after having their anal glands surgically removed.\nPet skunks come in an assortment of colors beyond the classic black and white, with shades of lavender, apricot, cinnamon and champagne being most popular.\nWith their large, grape-sized anal glands removed, pet skunks can no longer spray, but they have other, smaller glands, located under their chins and throughout their bodies, that produce a musky odor, much like a ferret.\nThe issue of the musky smell comes down to personal tolerance, but the real concern with pet skunks is that their natural drive to dig and forage, usually leads to destruction of household items, furnishings, and fairly important things like flooring, drywall, and moldings.\nWith its strong shoulders, back, and forelimbs specially designed for digging, and claws like little steel tire-irons, a curious skunk can rip a baseboard loose in seconds, and even tear up ceramic tile.\nYes, skunks are cute, and more cuddly then you might expect, but investigate thoroughly before considering one as a pet!\nskunk spray\nMost carnivores, including domestic dogs and cats, have anal glands. These are glands located on either side of the anus that create an oily, sulfuric substance with a powerful smell.\nThe secretions of the anal glands are stored in anal sacs, and when the animal has a bowel movement, some of the substance escapes onto the excrement, leaving a specific calling card of odors for any animals that follow.\nDogs greet each other by sniffing the anal glands. Other animals, such as badgers and mongooses, mark territory by pressing their rears against logs, stones, and other badgers.\nBut skunks use their anal glands as a weapon.\nHow these organs have evolved into such an amazing defense mechanism is unclear, but the skunks ability to project their sulfuric spray as far as 15 feet, aimed directly at the intended target, is unique, and truly amazing.\nWhen ready to spray, two bright red nozzles project out of the anus, and a noxious, oily, golden stream of stink is hurled, with remarkable accuracy, directly at the intended target.\nSkunks have precise control over these nozzles. If they can't see their target, in heavy brush for instance, they may expel more of a mist to cover a larger area, but if the harassing party is visible, the skunk will aim for the eyes, with a powerful sulfur spray that lands in thick, rain-sized drops.\nskunk sprayers close-up!!\nSkunk spray is an entire recipe of chemicals, with seven volatile ingredients including a sulfur based thiol common in garlic and onions. The spray itself is extremely flammable, and the components are slightly different from species to species, to the point where experts can tell from the odor which species produced the stench.\nLike being exposed to teargas, the victim may experience extreme discomfort, pain, difficulty breathing, and even temporary blindness. The odor will remain on hair, clothing, fur, skin and surroundings for days to weeks, and can be smelled from over a mile away.\nThe skunks two grape-sized anal glands contain a total of about 4 tablespoons of fluid, and most is expelled in a full-on event. It can take several days to replenish them, so skunks do not spray randomly, because without this remarkable line of defense, they would be relatively helpless against the large predators they encounter.\nBut whether their arsenal is depleted or not, they still go about their business with a bit of a brazen attitude, assuming they won't be pestered.\nFor this reason, it is the automobile, not the cougar or grizzly bear, that is the number one killer of skunks in North America. Folks who have accidentally hit a skunk on the road, occasionally report the animal raising its tail and spraying instead of running out of the way of the on-coming 3,000 pound vehicle, and we've all experienced that moment driving down the highway, when everyone hits the window buttons and covers their nose. - Amazing Skunk Facts\nskunk lifestyle\nSkunks are solitary animals that sleep in nests or burrows during the day, and forage and hunt during the night. They are most active at dusk and dawn, making fairly regular rounds across their range, which is usually about 1 square mile.\nSkunks are not territorial, and are not aggressive towards other skunks, except for mild skirmishes over food or den sites. These encounters are usually bluff sessions, rarely ending in any real confrontation, and almost never involving spraying eachother, except during mating season, when non-receptive females will spray persistent males, and both may spray if startled during breeding.\nStriped skunks can be found in almost every habitat in the United States, but are most often found in areas known as ecotomes, where two different types of environments meet. Skunks are omnivores that will eat just about anything, and these margins offer the greatest variety of food stuffs.\nHumans are the number one creators of ecotomes, planting lawns next to forests, parks in the middle of cities, and the traditional suburban layout of house/barn/garage/sheds, surrounded by lawn, surrounded by lush landscaping, across the street from a stripmall, is the ultimate ecotome!\nStriped skunks thrive in these environments, and though the humans that engineered them may never see the creatures they share their handy work with, they benefit from the skunks active removal of a host of pests, like grubs, hornets, stinkbugs, rats and mice.\nSkunks set up nests under porches or sheds, in old logs or woodpiles, and will also excavate their own underground burrows. One skunk may have as many as ten nests distributed throughout her range, and will rest and sleep in them in a random fashion.\nThey use their most secret and well-protected nest to bed down during winters in the Northern parts of their range. They don't actually hibernate, but in locations where winter temperatures fall below freezing, they will go into something called a torpor, which is a sleep period of reduced metabolism.\nUnlike hibernation, which is a long term state of very low body temperature and metabolism, torpor is a lighter sleep, with only a slightly lowered body temperature, and the animal will wake up occasionally, especially if there is a warm day or two.\nOver cold winter months, several skunks may actually den together, probably to retain body heat.\nSkunks have a fantastic defense mechanism, and so there are few animals that will mess with them, but most birds of prey have a very poor sense of smell, and the great horned owl, in particular, has no problem eating a skunk.\nBut rattlesnakes have an excellent sense of smell, and will actually stop rattling and lay low if they smell the musk of an approaching skunk, because skunks feast on snakes, and appear to be immune to the venom of snakes, bees and scorpions.\nSkunks will also eat a creature known as the stink beetle, which smells just as awful as them, and is also generally unmolested by most predators. Skunks will disarm these tasty morsels by rolling them violently around on the ground, waiting till they have expelled all their acrid chemicals. When the stinkbugs tank is empty, the skunk chows down.\nBaby Skunks!\nskunk reproduction\nskunk baby\nBreeding season for striped, hog-nosed and hooded skunks is mid-February to mid-April. In areas where there is a large skunk population, things can get pretty stinky at this time, and it is the most common time of year for dogs to get sprayed too.\nWhy? Well because skunks are so preoccupied with finding mates - as in multiple mates for both males and females - that they are easily startled, and a little anxious. Skunks also have a tendency to spray each other during this two month span, either while two males argue over a female, or when a female is not in the mood.\nThere is more of a battle than a courtship with skunks, and nightime screeching is commonly heard, but otherwise the mating is brief, and both male and female may have several partners over the course of a few days or weeks.\nIf a female conceives early in the season, the development of the fertilized eggs may be paused for a few weeks, in a process called delayed implantation. This insures that the babies will be born in the warmer months of May and June, when the winter is over, and food is more plentiful.\nThe mother prepares a nursery den, and will give birth to a litter of about 4 to 8 kittens, or kits. The newborn skunks are hairless and blind, but their bare skin has the stripe pattern already visible. They will begin to raise their tails when frightened in a matter of days, and can spray at about 3 or 4 weeks old - right about the time their eyes open.\nThe mother will start to leave the den with her little charges when they are 6 weeks old. They follow behind her in single file, and tend to maintain body contact with each other at all times when first out exploring. The family makes a lot of squeaking, gurgling type noises to keep in touch, and may seem to move as one bushy little unit.\nBabies forage and start to hunt after about 2 months, and are off on their own at 8 months. - Skunk Facts\nSkunk mother and babies\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Striped skunks occur in every one of the contiguous United States, in various habitats from seashore to city, desert to forest. They are small, cat-sized animals averaging about 6 pounds but getting as large as 16 pounds.\nThey are generally black, with a bold white splash that starts at the top of the head, splits into two stripes at the shoulders, and joins back into one stripe at the hips and down to the tip of the tail. This is the pattern that is seen most often, but markings can be quite variable across the population. Striped skunks have been seen in solid black to nearly solid white, with three or more stripes, and shades of brown instead of black.\nStriped skunks are true ground dwellers that have no climbing ability at all. In fact, one of the more common skunk-related calls pest removal services get is when a skunk has fallen into a window well, sometimes no more than 2 feet deep, and can't climb out.\nThe hooded skunk is a little smaller than the striped skunk with a smaller range, but a very similar appearance. They are called hooded because of a ruff of fur they have around their necks. Like the striped skunks, hooded skunks are not very good climbers.\nHog-nosed skunks are common in the southwestern states, especially. There are several sub-species of hog-nosed, some of which can get larger than striped skunks, and several of which are brown and white in color. Hog-nosed skunks have well developed snouts for rooting through dry soil for scorpions and spiders. They will also trudge into caves filled with bats to pick off baby bats that have fallen to the guano-covered ground. Hog-nosed skunks are more agile than striped and hooded skunks, climbing rocky slopes and hillsides regularly.\nThe smallest skunk species is the spotted skunk, which rarely gets much bigger than 2 pounds or so. The spotted skunk is quite the opposite of the other species, in that it not only climbs, but actually hunts in trees.\nThey sleep in dens or burrows on the ground, but climb exceedingly well, and will even rob birds nests of eggs and chicks. Spotted skunks are the most elusive and secretive of the skunk species, though by far the most social, sometimes denning together in groups of 5 or more.\nThe tiny spotted skunk also has the most elaborate threat display of all the skunks, maybe because it is so small. They will do a full handstand with their tail and legs hoisted completely in the air in an attempt to appear larger. Spotted skunks can walk around on their front paws like this for several minutes, hoping their combatant disperses, but if push comes to shove, they will actually eject their spray from this odd position, leaving a very lasting memory.\na few more skunk facts\nSkunks can accurately spray up to 15 feet\nSkunk spray is not urine, it is the secretions of the anal glands\nThe skunks bold coloring is a warning to stay away\nSkunks almost never spray eachother, except during mating season\nThe only thing that eats skunks regularly is the Great horned owl\nGreat horned owls have a very poor sense of smell!\nSkunks are immune to rattlesnake venom, bee stings and scorpions, and will eat all of them\nSome people keep skunks as pets"}

Each dolphin has a unique whistle that functions like a name, allowing the marine mammals to keep close social bonds.\nThe new research shows that dolphins have the longest memory yet known in any species other than people. Elephants and chimpanzees are thought to have similar abilities, but they haven't yet been tested, said study author Jason Bruck, an animal behaviorist at the University of Chicago. (Also see \"Chimps, Orangutans Have Human-Like Memory.\")\nBruck came up with the idea to study animal memory when his brother's dog, usually wary of male strangers, remembered and greeted him four years after last seeing him. \"That got me thinking: How long do other animals remember each other?\"\nI Remember You!\nBruck studied dolphins because their social bonds are extremely important and because there are good records for captive dolphins (as opposed to wild ones).\nSo he collected data from 43 bottlenose dolphins at six facilities in the U.S. and Bermuda, members of a breeding consortium that has swapped dolphins for decades and kept careful records of each animal's social partners. (Watch video: \"Dolphin Talk Decoded.\")\nHe first played recordings of lots of unfamiliar whistles to the dolphins in the study until the subjects got bored and stopped inspecting the underwater speaker making the sounds.\nAt this point, he played the whistles of the listening dolphins' old friends.\nWhen the dolphins heard these familiar whistles, they would perk up and approach the speakers, often whistling their own name and listening for a response.\nOverall, the dolphins responded more to animals they'd known decades ago than to random animals\u2014suggesting they recognized their former companions, according to the study, published recently in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.\nCheeky Dolphins\nWorking with animals as intelligent as dolphins was a challenge, Bruck added. The animals loved participating in the experiment so much that they'd often hover over the speaker, blocking the noise. (See \"The Secret Language of Dolphins.\")\nOthers would begin \"whistling directly at me as if I could understand them,\" he said.\nAnd one set of cheeky young dolphins swam up to Bruck and started whistling the names of the dominant males in their group in order of rank, perhaps suggesting the names they wanted to hear, Bruck said.\nMemory Linked to Smarts?\nWhy dolphins\u2014which live an average of 20 years in the wild\u2014need long-term memory is still unknown. But it may have to do with maintaining relationships, since over time dolphin groups often break up and reorganize into new alliances.\nThis sort of social system is called \"fission-fusion,\" and it's also seen in elephants and chimpanzees\u2014two other highly intelligent and social beings. (See pictures of intelligent animals in National Geographic magazine.)\nCoincidence? Bruck suspects not: \"It seems that maybe complex cognition comes from a place of trying to remember who your buddies are,\" he said."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Cetacean intelligence - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacean_intelligence", "text": "Cetacean intelligence is the cognitive ability of the infraorder Cetacea of mammals. This order includes whales, porpoises, and dolphins.\nBrain size [ edit ]\nBrain size was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. However, many other factors also affect intelligence, and recent discoveries concerning bird intelligence have called into question the influence of brain size. Since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. Allometric analysis indicates that in general, mammalian brain size scales at approximately the 2\u20443 or 3\u20444 exponent of body mass. Comparison of actual brain size with the size expected from allometry provides an encephalization quotient (EQ) that can be used as a more accurate indicator of an animal's intelligence.\nSpindle cells (neurons without extensive branching) have been discovered in the brains of the humpback whale, fin whale, sperm whale, killer whale, bottlenose dolphins, Risso's dolphins, and beluga whales. Humans, great apes, and elephants, species all well known for their high intelligence, are the only others known to have spindle cells.: 242 Spindle neurons appear to play a central role in the development of intelligent behavior. Such a discovery may suggest a convergent evolution of these species.\nBrain structure [ edit ]\nElephant brains also show a complexity similar to dolphin brains, and are also more convoluted than that of humans, and with a cortex thicker than that of cetaceans. It is generally agreed that the growth of the neocortex, both absolutely and relative to the rest of the brain, during human evolution, has been responsible for the evolution of human intelligence, however defined. While a complex neocortex usually indicates high intelligence, there are exceptions. For example, the echidna has a highly developed brain, yet is not widely considered very intelligent, though preliminary investigations into their intelligence suggest that echidnas are capable of more advanced cognitive tasks than were previously assumed.\nIn 2014, it was shown for the first time that a species of dolphin, the long-finned pilot whale, has more neocortical neurons than any mammal studied to date including humans. Unlike terrestrial mammals, dolphin brains contain a paralimbic lobe, which may possibly be used for sensory processing. The dolphin is a voluntary breather, even during sleep, with the result that veterinary anaesthesia of dolphins would result in asphyxiation. All sleeping mammals, including dolphins, experience a stage known as REM sleep. Ridgway reports that EEGs show alternating hemispheric asymmetry in slow waves during sleep, with occasional sleep-like waves from both hemispheres. This result has been interpreted to mean that dolphins sleep only one hemisphere of their brain at a time, possibly to control their voluntary respiration system or to be vigilant for predators. This is also given as explanation for the large size of their brains.[citation needed]\nDolphin brain stem transmission time is faster than that normally found in humans, and is approximately equivalent to the speed in rats.[citation needed] The dolphin's greater dependence on sound processing is evident in the structure of its brain: its neural area devoted to visual imaging is only about one-tenth that of the human brain, while the area devoted to acoustical imaging is about 10 times as large. Sensory experiments suggest a great degree of cross-modal integration in the processing of shapes between echolocative and visual areas of the brain. Unlike the case of the human brain, the cetacean optic chiasm is completely crossed,[citation needed] and there is behavioral evidence for hemispheric dominance for vision.[citation needed]\nBrain evolution [ edit ]\nThe evolution of encephalization in cetaceans is similar to that in primates. Though the general trend in their evolutionary history increased brain mass, body mass, and encephalization quotient, a few lineages actually underwent decephalization, although the selective pressures that caused this are still under debate. Among cetaceans, Odontoceti tend to have higher encephalization quotients than Mysticeti, which is at least partially due to the fact that Mysticeti have much larger body masses without a compensating increase in brain mass. As far as which selective pressures drove the encephalization (or decephalization) of cetacean brains, current research espouses a few main theories. The most promising suggests that cetacean brain size and complexity increased to support complex social relations. It could also have been driven by changes in diet, the emergence of echolocation, or an increase in territorial range.\nProblem-solving ability [ edit ]\nSome research shows that dolphins, among other animals, understand concepts such as numerical continuity, though not necessarily counting. Dolphins may be able to discriminate between numbers.\nSeveral researchers observing animals' ability to learn set formation tend to rank dolphins at about the level of elephants in intelligence, and show that dolphins do not surpass other highly intelligent animals in problem solving. A 1982 survey of other studies showed that in the learning of \"set formation\", dolphins rank highly, but not as high as some other animals.\nBehavior [ edit ]\nPod characteristics [ edit ]\nDolphin group sizes vary quite dramatically. River dolphins usually congregate in fairly small groups from 6 to 12 in number or, in some species, singly or in pairs. The individuals in these small groups know and recognize one another. Other species such as the oceanic pantropical spotted dolphin, common dolphin and spinner dolphin travel in large groups of hundreds of individuals. It is unknown whether every member of the group is acquainted with every other. However, large packs can act as a single cohesive unit \u2013 observations show that if an unexpected disturbance, such as a shark approach, occurs from the flank or from beneath the group, the group moves in near-unison to avoid the threat. This means that the dolphins must be aware not only of their near neighbors but also of other individuals nearby \u2013 in a similar manner to which humans perform \"audience waves\". This is achieved by sight, and possibly also echolocation. One hypothesis proposed by Jerison (1986) is that members of a pod of dolphins are able to share echolocation results with each other to create a better understanding of their surroundings.\nResident orcas living in British Columbia, Canada, and Washington, United States, live in extremely stable family groups. The basis of this social structure is the matriline, consisting of a mother and her offspring, who travel with her for life. Male orcas never leave their mothers' pods, while female offspring may branch off to form their own matriline if they have many offspring of their own. Males have a particularly strong bond with their mother, and travel with them their entire lives, which can exceed 50 years.\nRelationships in the orca population can be discovered through their vocalizations. Matrilines who share a common ancestor from only a few generations back share mostly the same dialect, comprising a pod. Pods who share some calls indicate a common ancestor from many generations back, and make up a clan. The orcas use these dialects to avoid inbreeding. They mate outside the clan, which is determined by the different vocalizations. There is evidence that other species of dolphins may also have dialects.\nIn bottlenose dolphin studies by Wells in Sarasota, Florida, and Smolker in Shark Bay, Australia, females of a community are all linked either directly or through a mutual association in an overall social structure known as fission-fusion. Groups of the strongest association are known as \"bands\", and their composition can remain stable over years. There is some genetic evidence that band members may be related, but these bands are not necessarily limited to a single matrilineal line. There is no evidence that bands compete with each other. In the same research areas, as well as in Moray Firth, Scotland, males form strong associations of two to three individuals, with a coefficient of association between 70 and 100. These groups of males are known as \"alliances\", and members often display synchronous behaviors such as respiration, jumping, and breaching. Alliance composition is stable on the order of tens of years, and may provide a benefit for the acquisition of females for mating. The complex social strategies of marine mammals such as bottlenose dolphins, \"provide interesting parallels\" with the social strategies of elephants and chimpanzees.: 519\nComplex play [ edit ]\nDolphins are known to engage in complex play behavior, which includes such things as producing stable underwater toroidal air-core vortex rings or \"bubble rings\". There are two main methods of bubble ring production: rapid puffing of a burst of air into the water and allowing it to rise to the surface, forming a ring; or swimming repeatedly in a circle and then stopping to inject air into the helical vortex currents thus formed. The dolphin will often then examine its creation visually and with sonar. They also appear to enjoy biting the vortex-rings they have created, so that they burst into many separate normal bubbles and then rise quickly to the surface. Certain whales are also known to produce bubble rings or bubble nets for the purpose of foraging. Many dolphin species also play by riding in waves, whether natural waves near the shoreline in a method akin to human \"body-surfing\", or within the waves induced by the bow of a moving boat in a behavior known as bow riding.\nCross-species cooperation [ edit ]\nThere have been instances in captivity of various species of dolphin and porpoise helping and interacting across species, including helping beached whales. Also they have been known to live alongside resident (fish eating) orca whales for limited amounts of time.[citation needed] Dolphins have also been known to aid human swimmers in need, and in at least one instance a distressed dolphin approached human divers seeking assistance.\nCreative behavior [ edit ]\nAside from having exhibited the ability to learn complex tricks, dolphins have also demonstrated the ability to produce creative responses. This was studied by Karen Pryor during the mid-1960s at Sea Life Park in Hawaii, and was published as The Creative Porpoise: Training for Novel Behavior in 1969. The two test subjects were two rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis), named Malia (a regular show performer at Sea Life Park) and Hou (a research subject at adjacent Oceanic Institute). The experiment tested when and whether the dolphins would identify that they were being rewarded (with fish) for originality in behavior and was very successful. However, since only two dolphins were involved in the experiment, the study is difficult to generalize.\nStarting with the dolphin named Malia, the method of the experiment was to choose a particular behavior exhibited by her each day and reward each display of that behavior throughout the day's session. At the start of each new day Malia would present the prior day's behavior, but only when a new behavior was exhibited was a reward given. All behaviors exhibited were, at least for a time, known behaviors of dolphins. After approximately two weeks Malia apparently exhausted \"normal\" behaviors and began to repeat performances. This was not rewarded.\nAccording to Pryor, the dolphin became almost despondent. However, at the sixteenth session without novel behavior, the researchers were presented with a flip they had never seen before. This was reinforced. As related by Pryor, after the new display: \"instead of offering that again she offered a tail swipe we'd never seen; we reinforced that. She began offering us all kinds of behavior that we hadn't seen in such a mad flurry that finally we could hardly choose what to throw fish at\".\nThe second test subject, Hou, took thirty-three sessions to reach the same stage. On each occasion the experiment was stopped when the variability of dolphin behavior became too complex to make further positive reinforcement meaningful.\nThe same experiment was repeated with humans, and it took the volunteers about the same length of time to figure out what was being asked of them. After an initial period of frustration or anger, the humans realised they were being rewarded for novel behavior. In dolphins this realisation produced excitement and more and more novel behaviors \u2013 in humans it mostly just produced relief.\nCaptive orcas have displayed responses indicating they get bored with activities. For instance, when Paul Spong worked with the orca Skana, he researched her visual skills. However, after performing favorably in the 72 trials per day, Skana suddenly began consistently getting every answer wrong. Spong concluded that a few fish were not enough motivation. He began playing music, which seemed to provide Skana with much more motivation.[citation needed]\nAt the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Mississippi, it has also been observed that the resident dolphins seem to show an awareness of the future. The dolphins are trained to keep their own tank clean by retrieving rubbish and bringing it to a keeper, to be rewarded with a fish. However, one dolphin, named Kelly, has apparently learned a way to get more fish, by hoarding the rubbish under a rock at the bottom of the pool and bringing it up one small piece at a time.\nAs of 1984 , scientists have observed wild bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Western Australia using a basic tool. When searching for food on the sea floor, many of these dolphins were seen tearing off pieces of sponge and wrapping them around their rostra, presumably to prevent abrasions and facilitate digging.\nCommunication [ edit ]\nWhale song is the sounds made by whales and which is used for different kinds of communication.\nDolphins emit two distinct kinds of acoustic signals, which are called whistles and clicks:\nClicks \u2013 quick broadband burst pulses \u2013 are used for echolocation, although some lower-frequency broadband vocalizations may serve a non-echolocative purpose such as communication; for example, the pulsed calls of orcas. Pulses in a click train are emitted at intervals of \u224835\u201350 milliseconds, and in general these inter-click intervals are slightly greater than the round-trip time of sound to the target.\nWhistles \u2013 narrow-band frequency modulated (FM) signals \u2013 are used for communicative purposes, such as contact calls, the pod-specific dialects of resident orcas, or the signature whistle of bottlenose dolphins.\nThere is strong evidence that some specific whistles, called signature whistles, are used by dolphins to identify and/or call each other; dolphins have been observed emitting both other specimens' signature whistles, and their own. A unique signature whistle develops quite early in a dolphin's life, and it appears to be created in imitation of the signature whistle of the dolphin's mother. Imitation of the signature whistle seems to occur only among the mother and its young, and among befriended adult males.\nXitco reported the ability of dolphins to eavesdrop passively on the active echolocative inspection of an object by another dolphin. Herman calls this effect the \"acoustic flashlight\" hypothesis, and may be related to findings by both Herman and Xitco on the comprehension of variations on the pointing gesture, including human pointing, dolphin postural pointing, and human gaze, in the sense of a redirection of another individual's attention, an ability which may require theory of mind.[citation needed]\nThe environment where dolphins live makes experiments much more expensive and complicated than for many other species; additionally, the fact that cetaceans can emit and hear sounds (which are believed to be their main means of communication) in a range of frequencies much wider than humans can means that sophisticated equipment, which was scarcely available in the past, is needed to record and analyse them. For example, clicks can contain significant energy in frequencies greater than 110 kHz (for comparison, it is unusual for a human to be able to hear sounds above 20 kHz), requiring that equipment have a sampling rates of at least 220 kHz; MHz-capable hardware is often used.\nIn addition to the acoustic communication channel, the visual modality is also significant. The contrasting pigmentation of the body may be used, for example with \"flashes\" of the hypopigmented ventral area of some species, as can the production of bubble streams during signature whistling. Also, much of the synchronous and cooperative behaviors, as described in the Behavior section of this entry, as well as cooperative foraging methods, likely are managed at least partly by visual means.\nExperiments have shown that they can learn human sign language and can use whistles for 2-way human\u2013animal communication. Phoenix and Akeakamai, bottlenose dolphins, understood individual words and basic sentences like \"touch the frisbee with your tail and then jump over it\" (Herman, Richards, & Wolz 1984)[citation needed]. Phoenix learned whistles, and Akeakamai learned sign language. Both dolphins understood the significance of the ordering of tasks in a sentence.\nA study conducted by Jason Bruck of the University of Chicago showed that bottlenose dolphins can remember whistles of other dolphins they had lived with after 20 years of separation. Each dolphin has a unique whistle that functions like a name, allowing the marine mammals to keep close social bonds. The new research shows that dolphins have the longest memory yet known in any species other than humans.\nSelf-awareness, though not well defined scientifically, is believed to be the precursor to more advanced processes like meta-cognitive reasoning (thinking about thinking) that are typical of humans. Scientific research in this field has suggested that bottlenose dolphins, alongside elephants and great apes, possess self-awareness.\nThe most widely used test for self-awareness in animals is the mirror test, developed by Gordon Gallup in the 1970s, in which a temporary dye is placed on an animal's body, and the animal is then presented with a mirror.\nIn 1995, Marten and Psarakos used television to test dolphin self-awareness. They showed dolphins real-time footage of themselves, recorded footage, and another dolphin. They concluded that their evidence suggested self-awareness rather than social behavior. While this particular study has not been repeated since then, dolphins have since passed the mirror test. However, some researchers have argued that evidence for self-awareness has not been convincingly demonstrated.\nSee also [ edit ]\nReferences [ edit ]\nFurther reading [ edit ]"}

In some instances, one of the animals may be a \u201cbait animal\u201d used for the ostensible purpose of sport or training.\nIn the United States, the three most common types of animal fighting are:\nDogfighting\nIn organized dogfighting cases, two dogs are put into a ring or pit to fight until one cannot continue or dies. In street dogfighting cases, the level of organization is substantially lacking and fights occur, sometimes spontaneously, in secluded spots within city parks, school lots, alleys or other similar locations.\nCockfighting\nHandlers attach a razor or gaff to each rooster\u2019s leg (typically the left leg) and put them into a ring to fight to the death. Attendees often consider the events to be family entertainment.\nHog-dog fighting\n(Also known as \u201chog-dog trials\u201d or \u201chog-dog rodeos\u201d)\nIn a \u201chog-catching\u201d event, dogs are put in a pen and timed for how quickly they can attack and pin a feral hog whose tusks have been cut off. Handlers may use a breaking stick to pry apart the jaws of the biting dogs. The attack on the hog may be fatal. In a \u201chog-baying\u201d event, dogs are timed for how quickly they can corner a hog. Injuries can result from dogs biting hogs or defensive hogs throwing dogs in the air. Attendees consider the events to be family entertainment.\nIssues common to animal fighting cases:\nOrganized animal fighting is usually a secretive industry and very difficult for law enforcement to infiltrate. Accordingly, it is rare for investigators to find a fight in progress.\nAnimal fighting activities attract other serious crimes, such as gambling, drug dealing, weapons offenses and money laundering. Children are commonly present at animal fighting events. Pet theft to acquire bait animals is also a common byproduct crime.\nIn organized animal fighting cases in which law enforcement officers are able to seize the animals in a raid, there are usually a large number of animals who must be catalogued as evidence, provided with medical treatment, and sheltered during the pendency of the court case. Furthermore, security precautions may be necessary at the shelter venue because animals considered to be from \u201cchampion bloodlines\u201d are in danger of being stolen.\nCourts can appoint a guardian/special master to act in the animals\u2019 best interests regarding their final disposition. The special master appointed in the Michael Vick dogfighting case secured the placement of 48 dogs who were not euthanized. Each state has its own court rules regarding the appointment of special masters.\nIssues specific to dogfighting cases:\nCanine victims usually suffer ongoing neglect and cruelty during the \u201ctraining\u201d process. They are often: forced to wear heavy chains and run on treadmills; left outside without shelter; fed steroids to increase muscle mass; fed stimulants to make them aggressive in a fight; fed narcotics so they don\u2019t feel pain in a fight; starved to make them aggressive or so they can \u201cmake weight\u201d in a contract fight; and subjected to cruel amateur ear cropping and treatment for fighting injuries. Females may be confined in \u201crape boxes\u201d for breeding.\nTrainers may viciously kill dogs who refuse to fight or who lose fights. Killing methods include shooting, hanging, drowning and electrocution. In the \u201cdog man\u2019s\u201d world, the credo is \u201cBreed the best and bury the rest.\u201d\nTrainers ruthlessly acquire animals to use as live bait. Acquisition methods include fraudulently acquiring dogs or cats from shelters or via \u201cfree to a good home\u201d ads, setting up a sham rescue organization, or outright pet theft. The bait animals are often attacked and torn apart during training.\nSome handlers may lace their dog\u2019s coat with poison or paralytics to harm the opponent.\nInnocent people may become terrorized, fearing for themselves, their children or their pets because of criminal activity among neighbors and their vicious dogs who might get loose.\nLast revised January 2018"}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Octopus images!\nThe octopus holds the distinction of being the most intelligent of all invertebrate animals.\nWith the highest brain-to-body-mass ratios of all invertebrates \u2013 higher even than those of some vertebrates \u2013 the octopus is regarded as the smartest of all invertebrate animals. These cephalopods are intelligent enough to engage in deceitful activities, including pretending to be \u201cmoving rocks\u201d to outwit predators. More than 300 species of octopus exist, and they are mostly found in tropical and temperate seas around the world. Octopuses are animals that have existed for many millennia; the first known octopus fossil, Pohlsepia, is believed to have lived more than 296 million years ago.\n5 Amazing Octopus Facts\nSome species of octopus engage in what is known as the \u201cmoving rock\u201d trick. An octopus may slowly inch its way across open space, allowing them to mimic the appearance of a rock. They do so at the same speed as the surrounding water, creating the illusion that they aren\u2019t moving at all. This allows them to essentially move while in plain sight of predators.\nMaze and problem-solving experiments have suggested that octopuses have both short- and long-term memory capabilities. They are able to find their way back to their dens without any trouble even after traveling far distances.\nThe deepest living genus of octopus is known as the dumbo octopus. Although it is very small, it lives roughly 13,100 feet below the surface of the water.\nThanks to their highly developed pigment-bearing cells, octopuses are animals that can change the color of their skin significantly and very quickly. This camouflaging is a common defense tactic that is used to help octopuses to evade predators.\nContrary to popular belief, the plural form of the word octopus is octopuses \u2013 not octopi. However, the term octopi is popularly used to describe more than one octopus.\nOctopus Scientific Name\nOctopuses belong to the mollusk order. They fall under the classification of cephalopoda and under the order Octopoda. The term Octopoda was first coined by English biologist William Elford Leach in 1818.\nThe scientific name for the common octopus is Octopus vulgaris. This Latin term is derived from a couple of Ancient Greek words \u2014 okto, which means \u201ceight,\u201d and pous, which means \u201cfoot.\u201d Therefore, the term \u201coctopus\u201d means \u201ceight feet,\u201d which reflects the fact that these creatures have eight \u201cfeet,\u201d which are more commonly referred to as arms.\nOctopus Species: The Types of Octopus\nThere are 13 families in the order Octopoda which contains approximately 300 species. Octopus have are incredible diversity, with some species living in the deepsea, some species reaching 30 feet, and others not even reaching an inch!\nBelow are some of the most fascinating species of octopus.\nGiant Pacific Octopus (Enteroctopus dofleini)\nOctopus don\u2019t get bigger than the giant Pacific octopus! The largest specimen ever weighed a reported 600 pounds and had an arm span of 30 feet! The species ranges along the Pacific\u2019s \u201cring of fire\u201d, stretching from the Gulf of California, into Alaska, and down past Japan and into China\u2019s coastline.\nFlapjack Octopus (Opisthoteuthis californiana)\nFlapjack octopuses are a species of umbrella octopus, which means they have a web of skin between tentacles. In the case of the flapjack octopus, it gets its name because its webbing connects outward to the ends of its tentacles, giving the bottom of its body an almost \u2018flapjack appearance.\u2019 Flapjack octopuses leave up to a mile below the ocean\u2019s and little is known of their behavior. Popularity in flapjack octopuses soared after the character Pearl in Finding Nemo was modeled after the species.\nAtlantic Pygmy Octopus (Octopus joubini)\nThe Atlantic pygmy octopuses\u2019 arms reach just under 4\u2033, making it one of the smaller species of octopus. They\u2019re especially abundant in the Gulf of Mexico and are known for their ability to rapidly change colors to mimic their surroundings.\nBlue-ringed Octopus\nThe blue-ringed octopus isn\u2019t a species, but rather a genus. The species is notable for its color, with blue rings across its body that are extremely bright. In addition, blue-ringed octopus species are extremely venomous and their bite contains the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin. There is no known antidote to this toxin which causes temporary paralysis. If bitten by a blue-ringed octopus paralysis lasts approximately 15 hours and may require intubation for survival. However, blue-ringed octopus are not aggressive and a 2008 study found just 3 known fatalities linked to the species.\nOctopus Appearance and Behavior\nAn octopus is defined as any eight-armed cephalopod mollusk of the order Octopoda. True octopuses belong to the genus Octopus, a massive group of broadly distributed shallow-water cephalopods that also includes squids and cuttlefish.\nThe typical octopus has a saccular body, which means that their head is only slightly defined from their body. They have eight contractile arms, and each one contains two rows of fleshy suckers. Their arms are joined at their bases by a web of tissue that\u2019s known as a skirt; their mouth is found in the center of the skirt and doesn\u2019t contain teeth, but instead has a pair of sharp beaks and a file-like organ known as a radula.\nOctopuses\u2019 soft bodies can change shape rapidly, allowing them to squeeze through very small spaces. Even the largest species of octopus are able to pass through openings as small as 1 inch in diameter. They also have a hollow, bulbous mantle that is fused to the back of their head; it contains most of the creature\u2019s vital organs, including its gills, and it connects to the exterior through a funnel or siphon. Their large, complex eyes are located on the top of their head.\nAs noted earlier, the largest specimen of the giant Pacific octopus on record had a 30-foot arm span and weighed approximately 600 pounds. The smallest octopus species weigh less than one gram and measure only about 1 inch in length.\nOctopuses engage in respiration by drawing water into their mantles through an aperture. It then passes through the gills before being expelled by the siphon. Octopuses\u2019 thin skin also absorbs some oxygen from the water. Another distinctive features is that octopus have three hearts. Two hearts pump blood through their gills while a third pumps blood throughout the body of octopuses.\nThese creatures move in a variety of ways. They crawl using their front two arms, using the other six for foraging. They swim by moving water through their siphons; when doing so, their arms trail behind them. They can also move backwards rapidly by ejecting jets of water from their siphons.\nOctopuses are also known for ejecting ink. They do this to evade predators; the cloud of ink, which is black in color, masks them so that they can move away quickly. In some species, the ink contains a venom that paralyses the sensory organs of the attacker. Only one species of octopus, the blue ringed octopus, is poisonous to humans. In this case, they inject prey with a paralyzing saliva.\nMost octopuses are solitary and spend roughly 40 percent of their time hiding in dens. However, some are social and may live in groups of up to 40 other individuals. They are not territorial, but they typically stay within a defined home range. They aren\u2019t migratory, so they spend their whole lives in the same general area.\nOctopuses also have an excellent sense of touch. Thanks to chemoreceptors on their suction cups, they can taste whatever they touch. Their skin also contains highly developed pigment-bearing cells called chromatophores that allow them to change the color, opacity and even reflectivity of their skin quickly.\nFinally, octopuses are the most intelligent of all invertebrate animals. The veined octopus, Amphioctopus marginatus, was observed in 2009 excavating coconut half shells from the ocean floor and using them as part of its den. This was the first documented use of tools by an invertebrate and is further evidence of how intelligent these creatures are.\nOctopus Habitat\nThe common octopus, O. vulgaris, primarily lives in tropical and temperate seas around the world. These creatures typically live in dens that are found in holes or crevices along the rocky bottom of the sea, which is in line with their retiring and secretive nature. Various species of octopus are found in places like coral reefs, seabeds and pelagic waters. However, some are found in intertidal zones, and others are found in abyssal depths. The dumbo octopus, for example, lives an average of 13,100 feet below the surface.\nDo Octopus Make Good Pets?\nOctopus have become increasingly popular pets for aquarium enthusiasts. However, it needs to be noted that they\u2019re only for experienced hobbyists. There are several challenges for keeping octopuses in tanks that include needing large tanks, feeding them a specialized diet (octopuses can be picky eaters), and maintaining pH levels that don\u2019t harm the skin of any pet octopuses.\nOctopus Diet\nOctopuses are carnivores because they subsist solely off of other creatures. In particular, they mostly feed on crabs and other crustaceans. Lobsters are also popularly consumed, and some species of octopus are known to eat plankton. Predatory, bottom-dwelling species of octopus primarily live off of crustaceans, polychaeta worms and clams and other mollusks. Open-ocean species of octopus primarily consume other cephalopods, prawns and fish. When feeding, they bring prey back to their dens and use their radula to drill shells and rasp away flesh. They use their beaks, which are very sharp, to tear apart prey.\nOctopus Predators and Threats\nAccording to the IUCN, most species of octopus are not endangered. In fact, recent studies have suggested that populations may be booming. However, these creatures do face numerous threats. Considered a delicacy by many cultures, they are hunted regularly by humans. Therefore, humans are among the octopus\u2019s top predators.\nIn the wild, octopuses are preyed upon by many other creatures. A variety of marine fishes are known to consume octopuses, for example. Other common predators include seabirds, other cephalopods and sea otters.\nOctopus Reproduction, Babies and Lifespan\nThere are separate sexes of octopuses. The male octopus has a specialized arm called a hectocotylus. This appendage inserts packets of sperm, which are known as spermatophores, directly into the mantle cavity of female octopuses. During reproduction, the male typically clings to the top or side of the female or hovers beside her. After delivering the spermatophores, males become senescent, which means that they gradually deteriorate before dying. Most die within about two months.\nEggs, which are about 1/8th of an inch long, are laid by female octopuses in holes and under rocks. On average, females lay around 100,000 eggs at one time, and it takes between four to eight weeks for them to hatch. During this period, the female octopus guards the eggs and cleans them with her suckers. She also agitates them with water. Once they hatch, miniature versions of the parents \u2013 tiny octopods \u2013 emerge. They spend several weeks drifting in plankton before taking refuge along the bottom of the sea. No parental care is provided beyond the care that is given by the female while waiting for eggs to hatch, so baby octopuses are on their own.\nMost species of octopus, including the common octopus, mate during the winter. Unless they are mating, they are typically solitary. Octopuses have fairly short lifespans, with some species only living for an average of six months. However, the giant Pacific octopus is known to live for up to five years. These creatures\u2019 lifespans are limited by reproduction since males only live for a few months afterwards and females typically die shortly after eggs are hatched.\nOctopus Population\nUnfortunately, scientists have no precise idea about how many octopuses exist in the world. They aren\u2019t easy to track not only because they can\u2019t be tagged but also because they are so solitary and reclusive in nature. However, it is believed that the population of cephalopods, including octopuses, has boomed significantly since the 1950s. There are various pieces of evidence to support this, but again, specific numbers are not available.\nWhy are cephalopod \u2013 and, by extension, octopus \u2013 populations growing? Researchers believe that a few different factors are at work. For one, these creatures are known to be highly adaptable to changing environments. As climate change occurs and, for example, ocean temperatures rise, they may be better able to cope than other creatures. Human activity is also believed to play a role in population increases. In particular, human fishing removes large numbers of octopuses\u2019 natural predators from the sea. This creates a gap in the food chain that may be advantageous to these eight-armed creatures.\nView all 23 animals that start with O"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Irrawaddy dolphin - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrawaddy_dolphin", "text": "Species of mammal\nThe Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) is a euryhaline species of oceanic dolphin found in scattered subpopulations near sea coasts and in estuaries and rivers in parts of the Bay of Bengal and Southeast Asia. It closely resembles the Australian snubfin dolphin (of the same genus, Orcaella) and was not described as a separate species until 2005. It has a slate blue to a slate gray color. Although found in much of the riverine and marine zones of South and Southeast Asia, the only concentrated lagoon populations are found in Chilika Lake in Odisha, India and Songkhla Lake in southern Thailand.\nTaxonomy [ edit ]\nOne of the earliest recorded descriptions of the Irrawaddy dolphin was by Sir Richard Owen in 1866 based on a specimen found in 1852, in the harbour of Visakhapatnam on the east coast of India. It is one of two species in its genus. It has sometimes been listed variously in a family containing just itself and in the Monodontidae and Delphinapteridae. Widespread agreement now exists to list it in the family Delphinidae.\nEtymology and local names [ edit ]\nThe species name brevirostris comes from the Latin meaning short-beaked. It is very closely related to the Australian snubfin dolphin (Orcaella heinsohni). The two snubfin dolphins were only recognised as separate species in 2005 when a genetic analysis showed that the population found along the coast of northern Australia forms a second species in the genus Orcaella. The Orcaella dolphins are close relatives of the oceanic dolphins in Globicephalinae subfamily.\nVernacular names for the Irrawaddy dolphin include:\nThai: \u0e42\u0e25\u0e21\u0e32\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e23\u0e27\u0e14\u0e35 loma irawadi , \u0e42\u0e25\u0e21\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e27\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e15\u0e23 loma hua bat (\"alms-bowl dolphin\", due to the shape of their heads)\n, \u0e42\u0e25\u0e21\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e27\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e15\u0e23 (\"alms-bowl dolphin\", due to the shape of their heads) Odia: \u0b36\u0b3f\u0b36\u0b41\u0b2e\u0b3e\u0b30 sisum\u0101ra, \u0b2d\u0b41\u0b06\u0b38\u0b41\u0b23\u0b40 \u0b2e\u0b3e\u0b1b bhu\u0101su\u1e47i m\u0101cha (lit. oil-yielding dolphin), lagoon area local name- \u0b16\u0b47\u0b30\u0b3e kher\u0101\n(lit. oil-yielding dolphin), lagoon area local name- \u0b16\u0b47\u0b30\u0b3e Filipino: lampasut\nBengali: \u09b6\u09c1\u09b6\u09c1\u0995 shushuko\nIndonesian: pesut mahakam / ikan pesut\nKhmer: \u1795\u17d2\u179f\u17c4\u178f ph\u2019sout\nLao: \u0e9b\u0eb2\u0e82\u0ec8\u0eb2 pa\u2019kha\nMalay: empesut\nBurmese: \u1027\u101b\u102c\u101d\u1010\u102e \u101c\u1004\u103a\u1038\u1015\u102d\u102f\u1004\u103a eyawadi l\u0103baing\nDescription [ edit ]\n1878 illustration\nThe Irrawaddy dolphin's colour is grey to dark slate blue, paler underneath, without a distinctive pattern. The dorsal fin is small and rounded behind the middle of the back. The forehead is high and rounded; the beak is lacking. The front of its snout is blunt. The flippers are broad and rounded. The finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides) is similar and has no back fin; the humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) is larger, and has a longer beak and a larger dorsal fin. It ranges in weight from 90 to 200 kg (200 to 440 lb) with a length of 2.3 m (7.5 ft) at full maturity. Maximum recorded length is 2.75 m (9.0 ft) of a male in Thailand.\nThe Irrawaddy dolphin is similar to the beluga in appearance, though most closely related to the killer whale. It has a large melon and a blunt, rounded head, and the beak is indistinct. Its dorsal fin, located about two-thirds posterior along the back, is short, blunt, and triangular. Dorsal fin shapes differ from one Irrawaddy dolphin to another. The flippers are long and broad. These dolphins are usually two-toned, with the back and sides being gray to bluish-gray and the belly lighter. Unlike any other dolphin, the Irrawaddy's U-shaped blowhole is on the left of the midline and opens towards the front of the dolphin. Its short beak appears very different from those of other dolphins, and its mouth is known for having 12-19 peg-like teeth on each side of the jaws.\nBehaviour [ edit ]\nCloseup of an Irrawaddy dolphin jumping in the Mekong River\nCommunication is carried out with clicks, creaks, and buzzes at a dominant frequency of about 60 kilohertz, which is thought to be used for echolocation. Bony fish and fish eggs, cephalopods, and crustaceans are taken as food. Observations of captive animals indicate food may be taken into the mouth by suction. Irrawaddy dolphins are capable of squirting streams of water that can reach up to 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in); this distinct behaviour has been known for herding fish into a general area for hunting. They do this sometimes while spyhopping and during feeding, apparently to expel water ingested during fish capture or possibly to herd fish. Some Irrawaddy dolphins kept in captivity have been trained to do spyhopping on command. The Irrawaddy dolphin is a slow swimmer, but swimming speeds of 20\u201325 kilometres per hour (12\u201316 mph) were reported when dolphins were being chased in a boat.\nIrrawaddy dolphins are shy of boats, not known to bow-ride, and generally dive when alarmed. They are relatively slow moving but can sometimes be seen spyhopping and rolling to one side while waving a flipper and occasionally breaching. They are generally found in groups of 2-3 animals, though sometimes as many as 25 individuals have been known to congregate in deep pools. Groups of fewer than six individuals are most common, but sometimes up to 15 dolphins are seen together. Traveling and staying in groups not only enables Irrawaddy dolphins to hunt, but it also creates and maintains social bonds and allows copulation to occur.\nIt surfaces in a rolling fashion and lifts its tail fluke clear of the water only for a deep dive. Deep dive times range from 30 to 150 seconds to 12 minutes. When 277 group dives were timed (time of disappearance of the last dolphin in the group to the emergence of the first dolphin in the group) in Laos, mean duration was 115.3 seconds with a range of 19 seconds to 7.18 minutes.\nInterspecific competition has been observed when Irrawaddy dolphins were forced inshore and excluded by more specialized dolphins. When captive humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) and Irrawaddy dolphins were held together, reportedly the Irrawaddy dolphins were frequently chased and confined to a small portion of the tank by the dominant humpbacks. In Chilika Lake, local fishers say when Irrawaddy dolphins and bottlenose dolphins meet in the outer channel, the former get frightened and are forced to return toward the lake.\nMating [ edit ]\nA female or male dolphin will attempt to pursue a mate for about a few minutes. They intertwine facing their bellies together and begin to copulate for 40 seconds. Once copulation has occurred, the dolphins will break away from each other and set off in different directions.\nReproduction [ edit ]\n1878 illustration of a foetus in the uterus\nIndia Mother with calf from Sundarban\nThese dolphins are thought to reach sexual maturity at seven to nine years. In the Northern Hemisphere, mating is reported from December to June. Its gestation period is 14 months; cows give birth to a single calf every two to three years. Length is about 1 m (3.3 ft) at birth. Birth weight is about 10 kg (22 lb). Weaning is after two years. Lifespan is about 30 years.\nFeeding [ edit ]\nThere are plenty of food items that this dolphin feeds upon. They include fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods. During foraging periods, herds of about 7 dolphins will circle around prey and trap their victim. These prey entrapments occur slightly below the water surface level.\nHabitat and subpopulations [ edit ]\nIrrawaddy Dolphin in Chilika Lake, Odisha\nAlthough sometimes called the Irrawaddy river dolphin, it is not a true river dolphin, but an oceanic dolphin that lives in brackish water near coasts, river mouths, and estuaries. It has established subpopulations in freshwater rivers, including the Ganges and the Mekong, as well as the Irrawaddy River from which it takes its name. Its range extends from the Bay of Bengal to New Guinea and the Philippines, although it does not appear to venture off shore. It is often seen in estuaries and bays in Borneo Island, with sightings from Sandakan in Sabah, Malaysia, to most parts of Brunei and Sarawak, Malaysia. A specimen was collected at Mahakam River in East Kalimantan.\nPresence of the species in Chinese, Taiwanese, and Hong Kong's waters has been questioned as the reported sightings have been considered unreliable, and the easternmost of ranges along Eurasian continent is in Vietnam.\nNo range-wide survey has been conducted for this vulnerable species; however, the worldwide population appears to be over 7,000. In India, Irawaddy dolphins are mostly found in Chilika Lake. Known subpopulations of Irrawaddy dolphins are found in eight places, listed here in order of population, including conservation status.\nInteraction with humans [ edit ]\nIrrawaddy dolphins have a mutualistic relationship of co-operative fishing with traditional fishers. Fishers in India recall when they would call out to the dolphins, by tapping a wooden key also known as a lahai kway, against the sides of their boats, asking the Irrawaddys to drive fish into their nets. In Burma, in the upper reaches of the Ayeyarwady River, Irrawaddy dolphins drive fish towards fishers using cast nets in response to acoustic signals from them. The fishermen attempt to gain the attention of the dolphins through various efforts such as using a cone-shaped wooden stick to drum the side of their canoes, striking their paddles to the surface of the water, jingling their nets, or making calls that sound turkey-like. A herd of dolphins that agrees to work alongside the fisherman will entrap a school of fish in a semicircle, guiding them towards the boat. In return, the dolphins are rewarded with some of the fishers' bycatch. Historically, Irrawaddy River fishers claimed particular dolphins were associated with individual fishing villages and chased fish into their nets. An 1879 report indicated legal claims were frequently brought into native courts by fishers to recover a share of the fish from the nets of a rival fisher that the plaintiff's dolphin was claimed to have helped fill.\nThreats [ edit ]\nFishermen with fishnets in Bangladesh\nIrrawaddy dolphins are more susceptible to human conflict than most other dolphins that live farther out in the ocean. Drowning in gillnets is the main threat to them throughout their range. Between 1995 and 2001, 38 deaths were reported and 74% died as a result of entanglement in gillnets with large mesh sizes. The majority of reported dolphin deaths in all subpopulations is due to accidental capture and drowning in gillnets and dragnets, and in the Philippines, bottom-set crabnets. In Burma, electrofishing, gold mining, and dam building are also serious and continuing threats. Though most fishers are sympathetic to the dolphins' plight, abandoning their traditional livelihood is difficult for them.\nAnother identified threat towards the Irrawaddy dolphins was noise pollution from high-speed vessels. This caused the dolphins to dive significantly longer than usual. The Irrawaddy dolphins always changed directions when they encountered these large vessels.\nLaotians and Cambodians have a common belief that the Irrawaddy dolphins are reincarnations of their ancestors. Some even claim that the dolphins have saved drowning villagers and protected people from attacks by crocodiles. Their beliefs and experiences have led the people of Laos and Cambodia to live peacefully alongside one another for ages until recent years, when the technique of using explosives for fishing has emerged. The government of Laos has made use of such tactics illegal, but few regulations have been made in neighboring Cambodia, where explosives are sold in local markets and the practice of using fishnets has been abandoned. The practice of using explosives instead has become very popular and led to a steady decline of populations of fish, and especially the dolphins swimming in the area. Although Laotians may not use explosives, they do use nylon gillnets, which pose another large threat to the survival of the Irrawaddy. Some dolphins accidentally become entangled in the net. Poor fishermen refuse to cut and destroy their nets because it would result in too great of an economic loss to save one Irrawaddy dolphin.\nIn Laos, a dam across the Mekong River is planned. This could threaten the existence of the endangered Irrawaddy dolphins in downstream Cambodia. Laos's government decision is to forge the dam upstream of the core habitat of the Irrawaddy dolphins. This could precipitate the extinction of this specific species in the Mekong River. The dam builders' proposal is to use explosives to dig out the tons of rock. This will create strong sound waves that could possibly kill the Irrawaddy dolphins due to their highly sensitive hearing structures.[citation needed]\nIn several Asian countries, Irrawaddy dolphins have been captured and trained to perform in public aquaria. Their charismatic appearance and unique behaviors, including spitting water, spyhopping, and fluke-slapping, make them very popular for shows in dolphinaria. The commercial motivation for using this dolphin species is high because it can live in freshwater tanks and the high cost of marine aquarium systems is avoided. The region within and near the species' range has developed economically; theme parks, casinos, and other entertainment venues that include dolphin shows have increased.\nKhmer and Vietnamese fishermen have regarded the Orcaella as a sacred animal. If caught in fishing nets, they release the dolphin from the rest of the catch. In contrast, Khmer-Islam fisherman kill them for food. This has led to the dolphin being reputed to recognize the local languages of the area and approach the Khmer-Islam with caution. In 2002, there were more than 80 dolphinariums in at least nine Asian countries.\nCollateral deaths of dolphins due to blast fishing were once common in Vietnam and Thailand. In the past, the most direct threat was killing them for their oil.\nThe IUCN lists five of the seven subpopulations as endangered, primarily due to drowning in fish nets. For example, the Malampaya population, first discovered and described in 1986, at the time consisted of 77 individuals. Due to anthropogenic activities, this number dwindled to 47 dolphins in 2007. In the Mahakam River in Borneo, 73% of dolphin deaths are related to entanglement in gillnets, due to heavy fishing and boat traffic.\nTourism [ edit ]\nThe Irrawaddy dolphins in Asia are increasingly threatened by tourist activity, such as large numbers of boats circulating the areas in which they live. The development of tours and boats has put a large strain on the dolphins.\nDisease [ edit ]\nCutaneous nodules were found present in various vulnerable populations of Irrawaddy dolphins. A more precise estimate of the affected dolphins is six populations. Although the definite fate of this emergent disease is unknown, the species is at risk.\nConservation [ edit ]\nThe Irrawaddy dolphin's proximity to developing communities makes the effort for conservation difficult. Entanglement in fishnets and degradation of habitats are the main threats to Irrawaddy dolphins. Conservation efforts are being made at international and national levels to alleviate these threats.\nInternational efforts [ edit ]\nProtection from international trade is provided by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Enforcement, though, is the responsibility of individual countries. While some international trade for dolphinarium animals may have occurred, this is unlikely to have ever been a major threat to the species.\nSome Irrawaddy dolphin populations are classified by the IUCN as critically endangered; in Lao PDR, Cambodia, Viet Nam (Mekong River sub-population), Indonesia (Mahakam River sub-population, Borneo), Myanmar (Ayeyarwady/Irrawaddy River sub-population), the Philippines (Malampaya Sound sub-population), and Thailand (Songkhla Lake sub-population). Irrawaddy dolphins in general however, are IUCN listed as an Endangered species, which applies throughout their whole range. In 2004, CITES transferred the Irrawaddy dolphin from Appendix II to Appendix I, which forbids all commercial trade in species that are threatened with extinction.\nThe UNEP-CMS Action Plan for the Conservation of Freshwater Populations of Irrawaddy dolphins notes that multiple-use protected areas will play a key role for conserving freshwater populations. Protected areas in fresh water could be a particularly effective conservation tool and can facilitate management, due to the fidelity of the species to relatively circumscribed areas. The Action Plan provides details on strategies for mitigating by-catch that includes:\n-establishing core conservation areas where gillnetting is banned or severely restricted -promoting net attendance rules and providing training on the safe release of entangled dolphins -initiating programs to compensate fishers for damage caused to their nets by entangled dolphins that are safely released -providing alternative or diversified employment options for gillnet fishers -encouraging the use of fishing gear that does not harm dolphins, by altering or establishing fee structures for fishing permits to make gillnetting more expensive while decreasing the fees for nondestructive gear -experimenting with acoustical deterrents and reflective nets.\nThe Irrawaddy dolphin is listed on both Appendix I and Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). It is listed on Appendix I as this species has been categorized as being in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of their range and CMS Parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals, conserving or restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles to migration and controlling other factors that might endanger them, as well on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organized by tailored agreements.\nThe species is also covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (MoU).\nNational efforts [ edit ]\nSeveral national efforts are resulting in the reduction of threats to local Irrawaddy dolphin subpopulations:\nBangladesh [ edit ]\nSatellite image of the Sundarbans\nPortions of Irrawaddy dolphin habitat in the Sundarbans mangrove forest of Bangladesh are included within 139,700 ha (539 sq mi) of three wildlife sanctuaries, which are part of the Sunderbans World Heritage Site. The Wildlife Conservation Society is working with the Bangladesh Ministry of Environment and Forests to create protected areas for the 6000 remaining dolphins\nCambodia [ edit ]\nIrrawaddy dolphins are fully protected as an endangered species under Cambodian fishery law. In 2005, The World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) established the Cambodian Mekong Dolphin Conservation Project with support from government and local communities. The aim is to support the survival of the remaining population through targeted conservation activities, research, and education. In January 2012, the Cambodian Fisheries Administration, the Commission for Conservation and Development of Mekong River Dolphin Eco-tourism Zone, and WWF signed the Kratie Declaration on the Conservation of the Mekong River Irrawaddy Dolphin, an agreement binding them to work together, and setting out a roadmap for dolphin conservation in the Mekong River. On 24 August 2012, the Cambodian government announced that 180-kilometre-long (110 mi) stretch of the Mekong River from eastern Kratie province to the border with Laos has been stated as limit fishing zone which uses floating houses, fishing cages and gill nets are disallowed, but simple fishing is allowed. This area is patrolled by a network of river guards, specifically to protect dolphins. Between January and February 2006, a dozen Irrawaddy dolphins were found dead. The discovery of 10 new baby dolphins on the coast of Cambodia was a relief and gave hope that the endangered Irrawaddy dolphins would make a comeback in population. Since the endangerment was evident, 66 guards have been posted on the coast of Cambodia to protect these dolphins, and only two deaths have been reported since these efforts. To make more efforts to keep these animals from going extinct, the use of fishing nets on the coast of Cambodia is banned, as well.\nIrrawaddy dolphin in the Sundarbans\nIndia [ edit ]\nThe Irrawaddy dolphin (under the common name of snubfin dolphin, with the scientific name misspelled as Oreaella brevezastris) is included the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, Schedule I, which bans their killing, transport and sale of products. A major restoration effort to open a new mouth between Chilika Lake and the Bay of Bengal in 2000 was successful in restoring the lake ecology and regulating the salinity gradient in the lake waters, which has resulted in increases in the population of Irrawaddy dolphin due to increase of prey species of fish, prawns, and crabs.\nIndonesia [ edit ]\nA conservation program, entitled Conservation Foundation for the Protection of Rare Aquatic Species of Indonesia, focused on protecting the Irrawaddy dolphin population and their habitat, the Mahakam River. The program not only educates and surveys the public, but also monitors the dolphin population and their habitat. A prime example of this is the establishment of patrols in several villages.\nLaos [ edit ]\nSome major concern for the population in the Mekong River has arisen due to numerous threats. In the 1970s, many Irrawaddy dolphins were slaughtered for oil, and soon after, intensive fishing practices with explosives and gillnets began. As of now, the dolphins are protected in Cambodia and Laos Democratic Republic. Now, both explosive fishing and use of gillnets is restricted in many of the Irrawaddy dolphin's habitats. Canadian conservationist Ian Baird set up the Lao Community Fisheries and Dolphin Protection Project to study the Irrawaddy dolphins in the Laotian part of the Mekong. Part of this project compensated fishers for the loss of nets damaged to free entangled dolphins. This project was expanded to include Cambodia, after the majority of the dolphin population was determined to have been killed or migrated to Laos' southern neighbor. The Si Phan Don Wetlands Project has successfully encouraged river communities to set aside conservation zones and establish laws to regulate how and when fish are caught. In April, after a 200-kg Irrawaddy dolphin was found dead on the coast of Laos, the death toll for Irrawaddy dolphins is now five in 2015. Usually, Irrawaddy dolphins are found dead with bruises and scars on their body, being killed by illegal poaching, but this Irrawaddy dolphin was found dead because of old age. She is the oldest and largest Irrawaddy dolphin researchers have discovered. The dolphin was 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) in length and most likely in her late 20s.[citation needed]\nMyanmar [ edit ]\nMyanmar's Department of Fisheries took charge in December 2005, and instituted a protected region in a 74 km (46 mi) segment of the Ayeyarwady River between Mingun and Kyaukmyaung and created multiple provisions, as well. Protective measures in the area include mandatory release of entangled dolphins, prohibition of the catching or killing of dolphins and trade in whole or parts of them, and the prohibition of electrofishing and gillnets more than 91 metres (300 ft) long, or spaced less than 180 metres (600 ft) apart. Mercury poisoning and habitat loss from gold-mining dredging operations in the river have been eliminated\nPhilippines [ edit ]\nIn 2000, Malampaya Sound was proclaimed a protected seascape. This is the lowest possible prioritization given to a protected area. Malampaya Sound Ecological Studies Project was initiated by the WWF. With technical support provided by the project, the municipality of Taytay and the Malampaya park management developed fishery policies to minimize the threats to the Irrawaddy dolphin from bycatch capture. Gear studies and gear modification to conserve the dolphin species were implemented. The project was completed in 2007. In 2007, the Coral Triangle Initiative, a new multilateral partnership to help safeguard the marine and coastal resources of the Coral Triangle, including the Irrawaddy dolphin subpopulation in Malampaya Sound, was launched. In 2006, a new population was discovered in Guimaras island in the Visayas. In 2015, another new population was discovered in Bago in Negros Occidental, part of Negros island in the Visayas.\nThailand [ edit ]\nIn 2002, the Marine and Coastal Resources Department was assigned to protect rare aquatic animals such as dolphins, whales, and turtles in Thai territorial waters. To protect the dolphins, patrol vessels ensure boats stay at least 30 m (98 ft) away from dolphins and no chasing of or running through schools of dolphins occurs. Many fishermen on the Bang Pakong River, Prachinburi Province, have been persuaded by authorities to stop shrimp fishing in a certain area and 30 to 40 fishing boats have been modified so they can offer dolphin sightseeing tours. A total of 65 Irrawaddi dolphins has been found dead along the coast of Trat Province in the past three years. The local fishing industry is blamed for the deaths of the dolphins. In January 2013, over a dozen dead Irrawaddy dolphins were found on the coast of Thailand. These dolphins were said to be dead because of a lack of oxygen. Dolphins are mammals, and unlike other animals that live in the sea, they must come to the surface for air. Many of the dolphins are found dead in the water, and others were washed ashore, said to have been dead for a few days. Also, in the first week of February 2013, as many as four Irrawaddy dolphins were found dead. The Natural Resources and Environment Ministry is studying artificial breeding options in 2022 to try to save the last herd of Irrawaddy dolphins in Songkhla Lake, which is on the verge of extinction after only 14 were found in the most recent survey. They also intend to list dolphins as a protected species, Thailand's highest level of animal protection.\nMalaysia [ edit ]\nIn 2008, the Department of Forestry and Sarawak Forestry Cooperative in Sarawak established a protected area for Irrawaddy dolphins in Santubong and Damai (Kuching Wetland). Furthermore, they plan to establish more beaches in Miri as protected areas for them. The protection measures in the area include prohibition of catching or killing of dolphins and trade in whole or parts of them, and prohibiting the use of gillnets. The government may also start small- and medium-scale research of this species at Sarawak Malaysia University with sponsorship from Sarawak Shell.\nVietnam [ edit ]\nIn 2012 in Vietnam, a group of scientists took in four Irrawaddy dolphins and provided them with medical care to see how they would survive. However, they found this to be the first case they saw of Irrawaddy dolphins having bacterial infections. The bacterial infection, chorioamnionitis, is common in many marine animals, but when these few dolphins were taken in, the scientists discovered this same bacterial infection for the first time in this group of dolphins. This disease mostly affects animals that are pregnant because the infection occurs through the umbilical cord and goes into the maternal bloodstream. One of the dolphins was pregnant and before her death was found circling around the bottom of the pool and was found dead early the next morning. This bacterial infection affects many organs in the body of the animal.\nSee also [ edit ]\nReferences [ edit ]\nBibliography [ edit ]"}

Most of our knowledge about this complex group of species is relatively new and sheds fascinating light on shark behavior and evolution. There are also many things we simply don\u2019t know or don\u2019t have the contributing research to confirm, so more study is needed to unlock all of the secrets of the hammerhead. While we wait for new findings to come in, let\u2019s take a look at 10 incredible hammerhead shark facts!\n1. There are ten different species of hammerhead sharks\nNine hammerhead species occupy the same genus (Sphyrna), and one has its very own genus (Eusphyra). The genus name \u201cSphyrna\u201d actually comes from the Greek word \u201chammer.\u201d Eusphyra is derived from the Greek words \u201cgood\u201d or \u201ctrue\u201d in conjunction with \u201chammer.\u201d The ten species of hammerhead are:\nWinghead shark (Eusphyra blochii)\nScalloped bonnethead (Sphyrna corona)\nWhitefin hammerhead (Sphyrna couardi)\nCarolina hammerhead (Sphyrna gilberti)\nScalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna leweni)\nScoophead (Sphyrna media)\nGreat hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran)\nBonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo)\nSmalleye hammerhead (Sphyrna tudes)\nSmooth hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena)\nA close up of a hammerhead shark! Martin Voeller/Shutterstock.com\n2. The hammerhead portion of the shark is called a cephalofoil, and it\u2019s a seriously cool shark adaption\nThe cephalofoil is responsible for the distinctive shape of the hammerhead group and gives them incredibly effective binocular vision and superior depth perception. Scientists also think the size of the cephalofoil gives hammerheads more electroreceptor organs than other sharks, increasing their ability to navigate vast distances and detect the electrical fields surrounding possible prey.\n3. Some hammerheads use their \u201chammer heads\u201d to aid in hunting\nIn addition to the incredible visual prowess the cephalofoil gives hammerheads, it\u2019s been observed that they actually use their heads to ram into and pin down stingrays, forcing them into the substrate (ocean floor). This repeated action eventually tires out the stingray, making it easier for the sharks to eat them.\nHammerhead shark and school of fish frantisekhojdysz/Shutterstock.com\n4. Hammerheads appear totally unaffected by venomous stingray barbs\nStingray barbs have been known to cause fever, nausea, swelling, and even seizures in humans. The barbs are also incredibly sharp and have resulted in some deaths, including, famously, Steve Irwin\u2019s (the Crocodile Hunter). Hammerheads don\u2019t seem to mind; in fact, many great hammerheads have been found with pieces of stingray barbs embedded in their faces.\n5. The position of the hammerhead\u2019s eyes gives them an outrageous 360 degrees of vision.\nEach eye is positioned at each end of the lateral head extension, meaning they can see nearly everything around them all of the time. The one exception is the large blind spot right in front of their noses. Divers have made claims that some small fish will hide in the hammerhead\u2019s blindspot as if to say, \u201cHa! You can\u2019t see me!\u201d\nHammerhead Shark swimming with other fish Gary J. Wood / Creative Commons\n6. Despite their mean appearance, hammerheads attacks are rare.\nThere have only been 17 recorded attacks globally and zero fatalities. Most attacks occurred when the sharks were provoked or unintentionally caught in fisher nets. Hammerheads also have disproportionately small mouths compared to their other shark brethren.\n7. Hammerheads aren\u2019t nearly as old as many other sharks.\nSome species of sharks have been called dinosaurs since they existed concurrently with them, but not the hammerhead. In the grand scheme of shark presence on earth, they are relatively new, having most likely emerged during the Miocene Epoch (23-5.3 million years ago). The dinosaurs went extinct roughly 65 million years ago.\nHammerhead Shark (Sphyrna Zygaena) \u2013 swimming in ocean HakBak/Shutterstock.com\n8. They can get tans!\nDue to their propensity for hanging out in shallow waters, some hammerheads can actually tan, turning from light brown to nearly all black. There are also zero known cases of skin cancer in the sharks. Further study of how they can tan without getting cancer may be critical in uncovering how to prevent and treat melanoma. Tanning without the risk of melanoma? I\u2019d say that\u2019s a pretty incredible adaption.\n9. Great Hammerhead sharks like to swim sideways!\nTypical sharks have eight fins, the most recognizable of which is the dorsal fin; they also usually have two pectoral fins. In most sharks, the pectoral fins are longer than the first dorsal fin, but that\u2019s not the case for hammerheads, which affects how they move. In a 2016 experiment published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, GoPros were attached to hammerheads to document how they swim. After reviewing the footage, it was found that the sharks spent almost 90% of the time flipped to their side somewhere between 50-75 degrees. Scientists suspect that when hammerheads do this, their dorsal fin acts more like an additional pectoral fin, reducing drag and expanding their wingspan, which increases swim efficiency.\nGreat hammerheads spend the majority of their time swimming sideways Littlegreenman \u2013 Public Domain\n10. The first shark case of virgin birth occurred in a hammerhead.\nPossibly one of the most bizarre facts about hammerheads involves a bonnethead shark in captivity at an Omaha, Nebraska aquarium. The bonnetheads at the aquarium were all female, and in 2001, one of them had a virgin birth, that is to say, birth without the contribution of a male. Testing confirmed that the new shark did not have any paternal DNA. This was the first case of virgin birth observed in sharks. To quote Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park, \u201cLife, uh, finds a way.\u201d\nBonus Fact: Hammerheads are movie stars.\nIf you love 90\u2019s Disney movies, you may remember seeing hammerhead sharks in the movie adaption of the 1960\u2019s show Flipper.

We are, after all, animals ourselves. Beyond that, we share the planet with a remarkable diversity of other animals, we rely on animals, we learn from animals, and we even befriend animals. But do you know the finer points of what makes one organism an animal and another organism something else, such as a plant or a bacterium or a fungus? Below, you'll find out more about animals and why they are unlike the other lifeforms that populate our planet .\n01 of 10 The First Animals Appeared About 600 Million Years Ago Fossil of Dickinsonia costar, an early animal that was part of the Ediacaran biota, primitive animals that lived during the Precambrian Period. De Agostini Picture Library / Getty Images. The oldest evidence of life dates back some 3.8 billion years. The earliest fossils are of ancient organisms called stromatolites. Stromatolites were not animals\u2014animals would not appear for another 3.2 billion years. It was during the late Precambrian that the first animals appear in the fossil record. Among the earliest animals are those of the Ediacara biota, an assortment of tubular and frond-shaped creatures that lived between 635 and 543 million years ago. The Ediacara biota appears to have vanished by the end of the Precambrian.\n02 of 10 Animals Rely on Other Organisms for Food and Energy A frog leaps out of the water in the hopes of making a meal out of an insect. Shikheigoh / Getty Images Animals need the energy to power all aspects of their lives including their growth, development, movement, metabolism, and reproduction. Unlike plants, animals are not capable of transforming sunlight into energy. Instead, animals are heterotrophs, which means they cannot produce their own food and must instead ingest plants and other organisms as a way to get the carbon and energy they need to live.\n03 of 10 Animals Are Capable of Movement Tigers, like all cats, are animals that exhibit highly developed movement skills. Gary Vestal / Getty Images Unlike plants, which are fixed to the substrate in which they grow, most animals are motile (capable of movement) during some or all of their life cycle. For many animals, the ability to move is obvious: fish swim, birds fly, mammals scamper, climb, run, and mosey. But for some animals, the movement is subtle or restricted to a short period of their life. Such animals are described as being sessile. Sponges, for example, are sedentary for most of their life cycle but do spend their larval stage as free-swimming animals. Additionally, it has been shown that some species of sponges can move at a very slow rate (a few millimeters per day). Examples of other sessile animals that move only very minimally include barnacles and corals.\n04 of 10 All Animals Are Multicellular Eukaryotes William Rhamey / Getty Images. All animals have bodies that consist of multiple cells\u2014in other words, they are multicellular. In addition to being multicellular, animals are also eukaryotes\u2014their bodies are composed of eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells are complex cells, inside which internal structures such as the nucleus and the various organelles are enclosed in their own membranes. The DNA in a eukaryotic cell is linear and it is organized into chromosomes. With the exception of the sponges (the simplest of all animals), animal cells are organized into tissues that perform different functions. Animal tissues include connective tissue, muscle tissue, epithelial tissue, and nervous tissue.\n05 of 10 Animals Have Diversified Into Millions of Different Species M.M. Sweet / Getty Images The evolution of animals, since their first appearance 600 million years ago, has resulted in an extraordinary number and diversity of lifeforms. As a result, animals have evolved many different forms as well as a multitude of ways of moving, obtaining food, and sensing their environment. Throughout the course of animal evolution, the numbers of animal groups and species have increased and, at times, decreased. Today, scientists estimate that there are more than 3 million living species.\n06 of 10 The Cambrian Explosion Was a Critical Time for Animals Daniel Daz Santana / EyeEm / Getty Images The Cambrian Explosion (570 to 530 million years ago) was a time when the rate of diversification of animals was both remarkable and rapid. During the Cambrian Explosion, early organisms evolved into many different and more complex forms. During this time period, nearly all of the basic animal body plans developed, body plans that are still present today.\n07 of 10 Sponges Are the Simplest of All Animals Borut Furlan / Getty Images Sponges are the simplest of all animals. Like other animals, sponges are multicellular, but it is where the similarities end. Sponges lack the specialized tissues that are present in all other animals. The body of a sponge consists of cells that are embedded within a matrix. Tiny spiny proteins called spicules are scattered throughout this matrix and form a support structure for the sponge. Sponges have many small pores and channels distributed throughout their body that serve as a filter-feeding system and enables them to sift food from the water current. Sponges diverged from all other animal groups early in the evolution of animals.\n08 of 10 Most Animals Have Nerve and Muscle Cells Sijanto / Getty Images All animals with the exception of the sponges have specialized cells in their bodies called neurons. Neurons, also called nerve cells, send electrical signals to other cells. Neurons transmit and interpret a wide range of information such as the animal's well being, movement, environment, and orientation. In vertebrates, neurons are the building blocks of an advanced nervous system that includes the animal's sensory system, brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. Invertebrates have nervous systems that are made up of fewer neurons than those of vertebrates, but this does not mean the nervous systems of invertebrates are simplistic. Invertebrate nervous systems are efficient and highly successful at solving the problems of survival these animals face.\n09 of 10 Most Animals Are Symmetrical Paul Kay / Getty Images Most animals, with the exception of sponges, are symmetrical. There are different forms of symmetry in various animal groups. Radial symmetry, present in cnidarians such as sea urchins, and also in some species of sponges, is a type of symmetry in which the animal's body can be divided into similar halves by applying more than two planes that pass through the length of the animal's body. Animals that exhibit radial symmetry are disk-shaped, tube-like or bowl-like in structure. Echinoderms such as sea stars exhibit a five-point radial symmetry called pentaradial symmetry. Bilateral symmetry is another type of symmetry present in many animals. Bilateral symmetry is a type of symmetry in which the animal's body can be divided along a sagittal plane (a vertical plane that extends from head to posterior and divides the animal's body into a right and left half)."}

Both two-toed and three-toed species of sloth have a very strong natural grip instinct that allows them to cling to their mother's back or belly as she moves through the trees.\nThe mother sloth gives birth to one pup after about 4 months of pregnancy. The baby is born fully furred, eyes open, and able to climb.\nThe pup clings to its mothers belly most of the first few months of life and begins to munch on leaves at about 2 months old.\nIt's mother may feed it leaves that it has partially chewed directly from her mouth to get things started.\nA baby sloth will stay with it's mother for the first year or two of life, and then will move to it's own territory, usually just a tree or two away.\nSloths are small slow-moving animals that live in the trees of South and Central America. They are specially designed for life in trees, with huge, curved claws that allow them to grip branches.\nLigaments in the claws and limbs lock in place, and allow them to hang effortlessly while they eat or sleep, safe from many predators.\nSloths come in two and three-toed varieties, and are closely related to anteaters which have similar large, curved claws, but while anteaters are insectivores, and exist almost entirely on insects, sloths exist on a diet almost entirely of leaves.\nThe lack of grooming leads the sloths dense coat to actually grow algae during the rainy season, giving them a greenish tinge.\nTheir diet is so low in nutrients, that they have very low energy, and thus move very slowly. Their stomachs are filled with micro bacteria that help breakdown and eventually digest their food, but the process takes so long that a leaf consumed in August might not be eliminated until October.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

They stalk and pounce because they are not able to chase prey a long distance. The territorial male tiger usually travels alone, marking his boundaries with urine, droppings, and scratch marks to warn off trespassers. A tiger can consume as much as 40 kg (88 lbs.) of meat in one feeding. Tigers may drag their prey to water to eat. They are commonly seen in the shade or wading in pools to cool off.Since white tigers have pigmented stripes and blue eyes, they are not albinos. It is estimated that there are less than 3,000 Bengal tigers left in the wild. For more information about tigers, explore the Tiger Info Book.\nEcology and Conservation\nTigers, as with all top-of-the-food-chain predators help balance populations by keeping prey populations in check. When a tiger has eaten its fill, the abandoned prey becomes food for a variety of mammals, birds, and reptiles. Some cultures believe that powdered tiger bones have medicinal values. Unfortunately, tigers are in high demand to supply this market.\nBibliography\nJackson, Peter. Endangered Species: Tigers. Secaucus, NJ: Chartwell Books, 1990.\nMacDonald, David (ed.).

It can reach 4.6 to 5 feet in length and up to 120 pounds of weight. Females are larger than males.\nUpper side of the body is grey in color. Color fades toward the belly, which is white in color.\nEyes of vaquita are encircled with black rings. Lips of vaquita are black in color. Scientists believe that facial coloration may facilitate catching of food.\nVaquita has stocky body and blunt head without clearly visible beak. It has elongated dorsal fin that is slightly curved backwards.\nVaquita is a carnivore (meat-eater). Its diet consists of different types of fish, squids and crustaceans.\nSince vaquita lives in murky waters, it cannot rely on the eyes to find the prey. Instead of eyes, vaquita uses echo-location. It produces high-pitched clicks that travel through the water and bounce off the objects located in front of them. Returned sound brings information about the size and type of objects and helps vaquita decide whether they are edible or not.\nHigh-pitched clicks are also used for communication between vaquitas.\nBesides clicks, vaquita produces very loud and sharp noise that resembles the sound of harbor porpoise.\nVaquitas live in groups composed of up to 3 animals. They are rarely seen in larger groups (up to 8 animals).\nVaquita is very shy creatures that can be rarely seen in the wild. These animals do not jump out of the water, do not swim close to the surface and they avoid contact with boats and humans.\nMating season of vaquitas takes place from April to May. Most babies are born at the beginning of the spring, usually in March.\nPregnancy in females lasts 10 to 11 months and ends with one baby (calf). Baby vaquita has 31 inches and 17 pounds at birth. Young animal depends on the mother during the first year of its life.\nVaquita reaches sexual maturity at the age of three to six years. Females produce offspring every second year.\nInterbreeding is one of the greatest problems that vaquitas are facing today. Remaining animals mate with their close relatives, which leads to increased number of congenital malformations and results in creation of weaker animals."}

Least concern LC NT VU EN CR EW EX Least Concern Extinct Current Population Trend : Stable\nThis large, stocky mammal is a marsupial, or pouched animal, found in Australia and on scattered islands nearby. Like other marsupials, the wombat gives birth to tiny, undeveloped young that crawl into a pouch on their mother's belly. A wombat baby remains in its mother's pouch for about five months before emerging. Even after it leaves the pouch, the young animal will frequently crawl back in to nurse or to escape danger. By about seven months of age, a young wombat can care for itself.\nIt is also called the bare-nosed wombat, to distinguish it from its cousins, the southern and northern hairy-nosed wombats.\nBurrow life\nWombats use their strong claws to dig burrows in open grasslands and eucalyptus forests. They live in these burrows, which can become extensive tunnel-and-chamber complexes. Common wombats are solitary and inhabit their own burrows, while other species may be more social and live together in larger burrow groups called colonies.\nVegetarian diet\nWombats are nocturnal and emerge to feed at night on grasses, roots, and bark. They have two rodentlike incisors that never stop growing. They're kept in check by gnawing on some of their tougher vegetarian fare. For reasons not well understood, their feces is cube-shaped.\nConflict with humans\n1:11\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited. Please be respectful of copyright.

Vertebrates include all animals that have a backbone.\nReptiles and amphibians are vertebrates as well as mammals, birds and fish. They all have a flexible support column to which other body structures are attached.\nThe first vertebrates were primitive fish that account for more than half of all living vertebrate species. Tetrapods are the main core of vertebrates and it was the earliest tetrapods that first developed limbs and left that water to begin life on land. Those who left the water began to populate the land, take to the skies and some even returned to the water.\nOne of the ancestors of all vertebrate species was a small creature called a Pikaia who looked like a small eel with tail-fins and measured around 1.5 inches (5 centimetres) in length. The Pikaia was the first known Chordate (an animal with a stiff supporting rod (notochord) along its back). In later animals, the notochord developed into the backbone.\nFossil remains of the Pikaia were found in the 530 millions years old mudstone deposits of the Burgess Shale in Canada.\nMain Vertebrate Groups\nGnathosomata \u2013 these are vertebrates with jaws and include all land vertebrates and all fish except Lampreys and Hagfish.\nElasmobranchii \u2013 these are cartilaginous fish such as sharks and rays which are jawed fish with a skeleton made from cartilage instead of bone.\nOsteichthyes \u2013 these are bony vertebrates and include all vertebrates with a mineralised skeleton such as mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and most fish.\nTetrapods \u2013 these are bony vertebrates with four limbs or appendages. The first land-living vertebrate tetrapods include the earliest limbed vertebrates and all of its descendants including those that have since lost their limbs such as snakes.\nAmphibians \u2013 these are cold-blooded tetrapods with porous, glandular skin and includes frogs, toads, salamanders and newts who are descendants of early tetrapods that did not develop an amnion (waterproof egg membrane).\nAmniotes \u2013 these are tetrapods whose embryo grows inside a waterproof membrane called an amnion, which enables life outside of the water.\nReptiles \u2013 these are amniotes with thick skin and bony epidermal scales whose eggs have a mineralised shell. This group includes warm-blooded birds and scaly cold-blooded reptiles.\nLepidosaurs \u2013 these are reptiles that shed their skin in either large pieces are as a whole. These include tuataras, snakes, lizards and worm lizards.\nArchosaurs \u2013 these are reptiles whose teeth are sunken into sockets such as birds and crocodiles.\nBirds \u2013 these are archosaurs with symmetrical flight feathers. Many have shared features including a bony, toothless beak/bill and a keeled breastbone.\nMammals \u2013 warm-blooded animals which give birth to their young.

Incubation Sea snakes can be oviparous (egg birth) or ovoviviparous (egg live birth), depending on the species. In ovoviviparous reproduction, the internally fertilized eggs of the female are retained in her body. The embryos soon shed their membrane and develop in the mother's uterus\nClutch Size: Sea snakes usually have 3-4 young at a time. Sexual Maturity No data Life Span No data Range Sea snakes are widely distributed throughout the Indian and Pacific oceans, especially around Australia and New Guinea. Two species, Laticauda colubrina and Pelamis laturus, inhabit the coasts of the Americas. Habitat Found in shallow or coastal water habitats.

Population Global: No data Status IUCN: One species, Crocker's sea snake, Laticauda crockeri, is listed as vulnerable.\nCITES: Not listed\nUSFWS: Not listed\nFun Facts\nSea snakes are front-fanged and highly venomous. A fold in the gums of a sea snake hides the fangs, and the fangs quickly emerge when biting. Sea snake fangs are fragile and may break off and remain in the wounds of their victims. To counter the problem of having weak fangs, sea snakes have potent venom that can easily paralyze, kill, and begin the digestive process of the fish they target.\nEcology and Conservation\nGenerally, sea snakes are not aggressive animals - attacks on humans are extremely rare. Bites occur chiefly to fishermen who try to remove sea snakes from their nets. Also, sea snakes will defend themselves if seized or harassed.\nSea snakes are regarded as a delicacy in the Orient. Sea snakes are attracted by light, which is often the method used by humans to collect them.\nBibliography\nBauchot, Roland (ed.). Snakes a Natural History.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Do Whales Eat Dolphins: Facts Around Various Types Of Whale \u2013 Animal ...", "url": "https://animalqueries.com/do-whales-eat-dolphins/", "text": "Whales are the largest living species on the planet. So, there\u2019s a chance they could consume practically any other creature if they wanted to. Thus, it would be fascinating to note if they eat dolphins.\nWhales do not eat dolphins except for the exception of killer whales. Whales mostly prefer to eat much smaller marine creatures, although toothed whales consume larger fishes and even seals in some cases.\nThe fact that most whales do not eat huge prey is fascinating. Baleen whales, larger than other whales, rely on the school of krill and plankton for food. Baleen whales lack the teeth needed to pursue and capture larger prey, whereas toothed whales prefer to eat medium-sized prey since it is more energy-efficient.\nImage Credit: Beluga premier by Premier.gov.ru (CC BY 4.0) from Wikimedia\nImage Credit: Dolphins from Pxhere\nThe size of a whale\u2019s meal is directly proportional to its size, the size of its mouth, habitat, ecology, and how they interact with its surroundings. As a result, it would be fascinating to investigate whether dolphins may serve as a food source for various whale species.\nTo learn more intriguing facts about the issue, read this post all the way to the end.\nDo humpback whales eat dolphins?\nThe baleen family includes humpback whales. These whales are incredibly fascinating, and their dietary habits are causing new headlines. So let us see if these gentle giants have a preference for dolphins.\nHumpback whales, despite their musicality and grace, do not consume dolphins. Instead, plankton, microscopic crustaceans, and other small schooling fish are the primary dietary sources for these whales. They have a large mouth that allows them to swallow down large mouthfuls of prey and seawater at once.\nOn the other hand, these skilled melodists have made new headlines for eating up birds and even sea lions by accident. However, there has been no word on dolphins being eaten as an unintentional dinner by these gentle giants.\nDo killer whales eat dolphins?\nImage Credit: Killer whales from Pxhere\nKiller whales are not whales and do not act the same way as other whales. Instead, they have a more aggressive personality and behave in a different manner.\nKiller whales are an exception, as they eat smaller dolphins despite being members of the dolphin family. Killer whales, in particular, have been discovered to prey on other dolphin species in transient pods. So, in other words, they eat their own kinds!\nAlthough dolphins are orcas\u2019 meals, they do not hunt them regularly. Also, dolphins are rather fast, and there are plenty of other food sources in the ocean, so it does not make it worth it for orcas to go behind them.\nAnother interesting fact is that some orcas species are the only predators of white-sided dolphins in the northern Pacific.\nHow do killer whales interact with dolphins?\nKiller whales have a reputation for being vicious predators of larger marine creatures. They also go after dolphins. However, it would be fascinating to learn if killer whales communicate with dolphins on any level.\nOrcas, or killer whales, have eerie melodies that consist of intricate whistles and snaps. According to new research, these apex predators have learned \u201cdolphin talk,\u201d or the ability to learn vocalizations from other species. As a result, when orcas communicate with bottlenose dolphins, their vocalizations shift to match their social partners.\nClicks and whistles were more common among killer whales interacting with bottlenose dolphins. One thing to keep in mind is that each orca pod speaks in its own tongue.\nScientists have discovered that killer whales have a high amount of neuronal plasticity, which indicates that their neural pathways can change to accommodate new knowledge. As a result, they can learn the language of their social partners.\nDo false killer whales eat dolphins?\nImage Credit: Pseudoorca Crassidens \u2013 False Killer Whale by Stefan Thiesen Buntrabe (CC BY 3.0) from Wikimedia\nPlayful and social, false killer whales are like other dolphins. They are recognized for their non-aggressive conduct with numerous dolphin species and are highly social. But do they consume other dolphins?\nFalse killer whales feed on small dolphins other than fish and squid and marine mammals, including sperm whales. However, the reason why false killer whales consume other dolphins is unknown. Scientists are still unsure if the hunt is to feast on them or reduce food competition.\nDespite feeding on smaller dolphins, false killer whales hang out with dolphin species like the common bottlenose dolphin, the Pacific white-sided dolphin, the rough-toothed dolphin, the pantropical spotted dolphin, and Risso\u2019s dolphin.\nDo blue whales eat dolphins?\nAlthough blue whales are the largest whales, their principal prey is nearly tiny. Do these whales, on the other hand, ever eat dolphins?\nDespite their size, these goliaths are docile and have not adapted to eat larger whale prey such as dolphins. Instead, the primary food sources for blue whales are krill and plankton. Furthermore, their baleen plates prevent them from hunting and capturing larger marine species. Rather, they function as filter feeders.\nIn this context, it\u2019s important to understand that blue whales require a large amount of food on a daily basis to maintain their massive body weight. As a result, they benefit greatly from feeding on smaller prey, widely available throughout the oceans.\nDo pilot whales eat dolphins?\nImage Credit: Pilot whales by empokmaren from Pixbay\nPilot whales are actually dolphins, even though they are called whales. Pilot whales are toothed whales that eat a variety of foods. Do they, however, eat dolphins?\nPilot whales do not eat dolphins; instead, they eat squid, octopus, and various fish, particularly huge demersal fish such as cod and turbot.\nDo beluga whales eat dolphins?\nBeluga whales are among the ocean\u2019s most noisy species. Also, beluga whales are linked to bottlenose dolphins and are one of the most unusual-looking mammals. Do they, on the other hand, consume dolphins?\nBelugas are opportunistic feeders; therefore, their diet varies seasonally and regionally, but they never eat dolphins. Instead, the food of the beluga whale consists primarily of fatty Coho salmon, cod, smelt, herring, sculpin, and other fish.\nDo fin whales eat dolphins?\nFin whales belong to the baleen family and are the second biggest mammals globally. These whales have baleens instead of teeth.\nFin whales do not feed on dolphins. Instead, they are filter feeders and primarily eat krill, small fish, and crustaceans.\nSummary\nSo to wrap up, we can state that whales do not feed on dolphins, with the exception of killer whales and false killer whales. This is because whales are larger, but their primary food tends to be almost microscopic. One of the main reasons is that smaller prey is abundantly available across the ocean, and whales can eat tons of them to maintain their body weight and lifestyle."}

There are about 350 different types of sharks, but researchers think there are other sharks that haven\u2019t been discovered yet.\nSee the fact file below for more information on Sharks or alternatively download our comprehensive worksheet pack to utilize within the classroom or home environment.\nGeneral Shark Facts\nThe earliest known sharks date back to more than 420 million years ago.\nUntil the 16th century, sharks were known to mariners as \u201csea dogs\u201d.\nSharks do not have a single bone in their body.\nThey are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a skeleton made up of cartilage.\nCartilage is flexible and durable, yet is about half the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton\u2019s weight, saving energy.\nBecause sharks do not have rib cages, they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land\nSharks have five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head.\nSharks have two dorsal fins on their back, one beneath their body, which is called the pectoral fin (all species do not have that), and the tail which is the caudal fin.\nSharks are strong, healthy creatures. No other living thing can take better care of itself than a shark can.\nThe Whale shark is considered the biggest fish in the world, weighing in at about 90,000 pounds.\nThe Basking shark is the second largest. It can be as long as 40 feet.\nThe Pygmy shark is about 11 inches in length while the Dwarf shark is as tiny as a human hand.\nGreat white sharks can grow about 10 inches every year and can grow to be 12 to 14 feet long.\nMost sharks live for about 25 years, while some can live to be 100 years.\nMost kinds of sharks can swim up to 20-40 miles per hour.\nThe Mako shark is said to be able to swim at more than 60 miles per hour.\nNot all species of sharks are required to be in a continuous motion to breathe, however, a shark\u2019s body is heavier than the sea, so if it stops moving it will sink.\nSharks do not sleep in the same way as humans. Even if they seem to be sleeping they are not, instead they are just resting.\nSharks have very good senses. Sometimes a shark is called \u201ca swimming nose\u201d, for its great sense of smell.\nSharks can easily detect prey that is in the sand, as well as at night.\nSharks also have a remarkable sensitivity to vibrations in the water. They can feel the movements made by creatures that are hundreds of feet away.\nThey can also hear sounds from thousands of feet away.\nSharks can also tell the direction from where a sound is coming from, too.\nAnatomy\nMost sharks are \u201ccold-blooded\u201d or, more precisely, poikilothermic, meaning their internal body temperature matches that of their ambient environment.\nLike other fish, sharks extract oxygen from seawater as it passes over their gills.\nUnlike other fish, shark gill slits are not covered but lie in a row behind the head.\nA modified slit called a spiracle lies just behind the eye, which assists the shark with taking in water during respiration and plays a major role in bottom-dwelling sharks.\nWhile the shark is moving, water passes through the mouth and over the gills in a process known as \u201cram ventilation\u201d.\nWhile at rest, most sharks pump water over their gills to ensure a constant supply of oxygenated water.\nA shark\u2019s skin is covered by small, razor-sharp teeth called denticles.\nThese can be removed from the shark\u2019s body and once removed, the remaining skin is made into strong leather.\nUnlike bony fish, sharks do not have gas-filled swim bladders for buoyancy. Instead, sharks rely on a large liver filled with oil, and their cartilage, which is about half the normal density of bone.\nLike other fish, sharks extract oxygen from seawater as it passes over their gills.\nUnlike other fish, shark gill slits are not covered but lie in a row behind the head.\nTeeth\nShark teeth are embedded in the gums rather than directly affixed to the jaw.\nT eeth are constantly replaced throughout life.\nMultiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove on the inside of the jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to a conveyor belt .\nSome sharks lose 30,000 or more teeth in their lifetime.\nThe rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months.\nIn most species, teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row,\nA Whale Shark has more than 4,000 teeth, but each is less than 1/8 inch long.\nThe largest shark teeth found belonged to a Carcharodon Magaloden shark and are 6 inches long. This shark is extinct and lived more than 4.5 million years ago.\nTooth shape depends on the shark\u2019s diet: those that feed on mollusks and crustaceans have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting.\nThe teeth of plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional.\nReproduction and Diet\nWhile most sharks give birth to a small number of well-developed young babies, some sharks lay eggs.\nThe Hammerhead and Tiger shark can have as many as 40 babies at one time, while the others can have six to twelve.\nSharks typically give birth after 11\u201312 months of pregnancy, but some, such as the frilled shark, are pregnant for more than three years.\nBaby sharks are called pups.\nSharks do not care for their babies after they are born, but they do search for a safe place where they can lay their eggs or give birth.\nSharks bite wildly at anything that gets in their way, even each other.\nAlmost all sharks are carnivores or meat-eaters.\nSharks live on a diet of fish and sea mammals (like dolphins and seals) and even such prey as turtles and seagulls.\nSharks even eat other sharks.\nOne good meal is enough to satisfy a shark\u2019s hunger. The meal can last a shark for a long period because it uses very little energy to swim.\nSome sharks hold food in their stomachs without it being digested.\nIf they eat a big meal, it can last three or more months.\nSharks and Humans\nWeird things have been found inside a shark, such as a nail, a bottle of wine, a treasure chest, coats, a suit of armor, a drum, and a torpedo.\nIn 2008, it was estimated that nearly 100 million sharks were being killed by people every year, due to commercial and recreational fishing.\nIn 2021, it was estimated that the population of oceanic sharks and rays had dropped by 71% over the previous half-century.\nSharks are caught by humans for shark meat or shark fin soup.\nMany shark populations are threatened by human activities.\nSince 1970, shark populations have been reduced by 71%, mostly from overfishing.\nSharks never get cancer, so their cartilage is being studied with the hope of developing anti-cancer drugs.\nMore people are killed by bee stings than by shark attacks.\nOut of more than 470 species, only four have been involved in a significant number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans namely bull and tiger sharks, the great white, and the oceanic whitetip. These sharks are large, powerful predators, and may sometimes attack and kill people.\nResearch indicates that when humans do become the object of a shark attack, it is possible that the shark has mistaken the human for species that are its normal prey, such as seals.\nDespite being responsible for attacks on humans they have all been filmed without using a protective cage.\nSharks Worksheets\nThis bundle contains 11 ready-to-use Sharks Worksheets that are perfect for students who want to learn more about the world\u2019s largest fish.

Smaller or young sharks may be cannibalized by other sharks, but the main threat to a shark by far is humans.\nAre shark attacks common?\nWhile there is evidence to suggest they\u2019re on the rise, shark attacks remain incredibly rare. You\u2019re more likely to be hurt in a car accident or struck by lightning than attacked by a shark.\nDo sharks sleep?\nYes, they do. Although not like we do for many hours at a time. Some sleep while moving so they can breathe. Others sleep with their eyes open. Most sleep for just a few minutes at a time.\nDo sharks make a sound?\nNo, there is no evidence of sharks making any kind of noise or vocalization. A New Zealand shark makes a \u201cbarking\u201d noise by expelling water.\nLink/cite this page\nIf you reference any of the content on this page on your own website, please use the code below to cite this page as the original source.\n<a href=\"https://kidskonnect.com/animals/shark/\">Shark Facts & Worksheets: https://kidskonnect.com</a> - KidsKonnect, August 7, 2017\nLink will appear as Shark Facts & Worksheets: https://kidskonnect.com - KidsKonnect, August 7, 2017"}

Just imagine a \"newborn\" that is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds!\nGiraffe mothers are pregnant for 15 months, giving the embryo time to develop to such a large size, and when ready to come out, the baby comes front feet first, with the neck and head stretched out over the front knees in a sort of \"superman\" position.\nThis comes in handy because a mother giraffe gives birth in a standing position, which means the newborn comes into the world falling from a height of over 5 feet.\nThe fall and the impact break the umbilical cord and the natal sac, and the jolt of landing causes the little giraffe to take it's first breath!\nUnharmed by the fall, the infant will take up to an hour to rest where it landed, as the mother licks the infant to stimulate circulation and dry the skin, but Africa's infants must be ready to run with the herd, and remarkably, the newborn giraffe is standing, walking and even running, within about an hour of being born.\nGiraffe babies are born with their eyes open, and look very much like miniature adults, but their little horns, called \"ossicones\" are folded flat against their head while they are inside the mother, and take a few hours to start to stand up straight.\nBoth males and females have horns known as \"occicones\", which are formed from cartilage and covered with skin. Females have thinner occicones, that are tufted with longer hair on top. Males occicones are larger, have knobs on the ends, and become bald on top as they mature.\nbaby giraffe close-up\nThe baby also has a shorter neck, percentage wise than an adult, no doubt to fit more neatly in the womb.\nThe baby giraffe eats only mothers milk for the first four to six months of life, and then begins to sample low growing young shoots and leaves. The leaves of the acacia tree are one of the staples of a giraffes diet. Occasionally, mother giraffes are observed reaching high for a variety of leaves, and bringing them down to their youngster to sample, teaching them what is edible, and where the best feeding is.\nWithin the first year of life, the young giraffe has doubled in height, with quite a bit of this being added neck length, very necessary as they begin to forage and eat on their own.\nFemales share in the raising of young with little \"day-care\" groups of youngsters called creches, that the mothers will take turns supervising.\nnewborn giraffe\nThe female is pregnant for about 15 months, and gives birth standing upright.\nThe newborn hits the ground from a height of 5 or 6 feet, the fall of which breaks the umbilical cord and the natal sac. A newborn baby giraffe stands about 5 or 6 feet at the top of the head, and they can weigh between 140 and up to 200 pounds.\nAt birth, the occicones are folded back against the head, but spring up in a matter of hours. Baby giraffes often have alot of hair on their occicones, and have amazingly long eyelashes too.\nNo doubt because of the difficulties of folding up in the womb, the babies neck is not as long, in proportion to the body, as the neck of an adult. Over the first few weeks and months of life, as the baby grows, its neck gets proportionately longer, and at about 4 months old, the youngster is using its long neck to browse for leaves in branches as high as 10 feet.\nGiraffes stay with their mothers between 18 months and 2 years, and females in particular, may travel with her from time to time throughout their lives.\nYoung males may be sexually mature at 6 years old, but will have to wait, usually until they are in their teens, to compete for an opportunity to mate. Males take no part in the rearing of the young, but any groups traveling together will watch for eachother, keep lookout while others drink, and have been known to defend eachother against predators.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

So what kind of special adaptions must occur in order to make such a unique body function properly?\nTo start with, the giraffe has a 25 pound heart capable of creating the extreme blood pressure required to pump blood 8 feet up to the brain. But when the giraffe lowers its head to eat or drink, the blood rushing down at such high pressure would cause the blood vessels to burst. Pressure sensors along the neck\u2019s arteries monitor the blood pressure and activate contraction of the artery walls (along with other mechanisms) to counter this increase in pressure.\nThe blood leaving the giraffe\u2019s heart has to do more than just reach the level of the head, it has to be at a high enough pressure to pass through all the fine capillaries that supply the brain and other organs. To achieve this, the blood leaves the heart at a pressure of 200-300 mm Hg which is probably the highest blood pressure of any living animal.\nA giraffe\u2019s blood pressure is so high that it would rupture the blood vessels of any other animal, but the arterial walls are much thicker than in other animals, and their skin is so tightly stretched over the body that it acts almost like an anti-gravity suit, keeping the giraffe safely inside the giraffe! - Amazing!\na few more giraffe baby facts\nThe giraffe is the largest ruminant and the worlds tallest animal\nMale giraffes can be 18 feet tall at the top of the horns\nGiraffes have 2 to 5 horns called \"occicones\"\nThe giraffes neck is 6 to 8 feet long and can weigh over 600 pounds\nGiraffes \"chew their cud\" just like cows\nGiraffes defend themselves by kicking\nA giraffes kick can kill a lion!\nThe giraffes tongue is about 18 inches long\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Artiodactyla\nFamily Giraffidae\nGenus Giraffa\nSpecies camelopardalis\nGiraffe Facts - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT bull cow calf herd HOME HABITAT LIFESPAN FAVORITE FOOD Africa Asia savanna 20-25 years acacai leaves ENEMIES GENDER DIFFERENCE AVG.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Facts about whales - Whale & Dolphin Conservation Australia", "url": "https://au.whales.org/whales-dolphins/facts-about-whales/", "text": "How do whales feed?\nBaleen whales and toothed whales feed very differently. Baleen whales extract their prey from seawater as it flows through, or is forced through their baleen plates using their tongues and sometimes their throat muscles. They eat mainly small shrimplike krill, copepods and fish.\nBaleen is made out of keratin, the same protein that makes up our fingernails and hair, and so it is strong and flexible. Hundreds of overlapping baleen plates grow downwards from the roof of the whale\u2019s mouth, like multi-layered curtains. The number, size and colour of the baleen plates are unique for each whale species.\nBaleen whales are all essentially filter feeders but their feeding techniques vary; the humpback and blue whale are gulpers \u2013 they open their mouths wide and gulp enormous mouthfuls of seawater, their prey gets caught amongst the baleen plates as the seawater is pushed back out through them. Bowhead and right whales are skim feeders, they swim along with their mouths half open, allowing sea water to flow through their baleen and trap plankton. Gray whales swim on their sides along the bottom of the ocean floor and suck up mud and water; they use their baleen to filter out tiny crustaceans from this sludge.\nToothed whales (and dolphins and porpoises) all have teeth - the number, size and position of their teeth varies from species to species. They hunt mainly fish, squid and octopus using their sophisticated sonar systems \u2013 echolocation \u2013 to find and target their prey. Toothed whales generally use their teeth to grab and hold on to their prey before swallowing it. Some may also use their teeth for tearing and breaking up prey. Some beaked whales have only two to four teeth, they are squid eaters and are thought to suck in squid and swallow them whole."}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Hector's dolphin - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector%27s_dolphin", "text": "Species of mammal\nHector's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus hectori) is one of four dolphin species belonging to the genus Cephalorhynchus. Hector's dolphin is the only cetacean endemic to New Zealand, and comprises two subspecies: C. h. hectori, the more numerous subspecies, also referred to as South Island Hector's dolphin; and the critically endangered M\u0101ui dolphin (C. h. maui), found off the West Coast of the North Island.\nEtymology [ edit ]\nHector's dolphin was named after Sir James Hector (1834\u20131907), who was the curator of the Colonial Museum in Wellington (now the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa). He examined the first specimen of the dolphin found by cephologists. The species was scientifically described by Belgian zoologist Pierre-Joseph van Beneden in 1881. M\u0101ori names for Hector's and M\u0101ui dolphin include tutumairekurai, tupoupou and popoto.\nDescription [ edit ]\nHector's dolphin has a unique rounded dorsal fin.\nHector's dolphin is the smallest dolphin species. Mature adults have a total length of 1.2\u20131.6 m (3 ft 11 in \u2013 5 ft 3 in) and weigh 40\u201360 kg (88\u2013132 lb). The species is sexually dimorphic, with females being about 5\u20137% longer than males. The body shape is stocky, with no discernible beak. The most distinctive feature is the rounded dorsal fin, with a convex trailing edge and undercut rear margin.\nThe overall coloration appearance is pale grey, but closer inspection reveals a complex and elegant combination of colours. The back and sides are predominantly light grey, while the dorsal fin, flippers, and flukes are black. The eyes are surrounded by a black mask, which extends forward to the tip of the rostrum and back to the base of the flipper. A subtly shaded, crescent-shaped black band crosses the head just behind the blowhole. The throat and belly are creamy white, separated by dark-grey bands meeting between the flippers. A white stripe extends from the belly onto each flank below the dorsal fin.\nAt birth, Hector's dolphin calves have a total length of 60\u201380 cm (24\u201331 in) and weigh 8\u201310 kg (18\u201322 lb). Their coloration is the almost same as adults, although the grey has a darker hue. Newborn Hector's dolphins have distinct fetal fold marks on their flanks that cause a change in coloration pattern of the skin. These changes are visible for approximately six months and consist of four to six vertical light grey stripes against darker grey skin.\nLife history [ edit ]\nData from field studies, beachcast individuals, and dolphins caught in fishing nets have provided information on their life history and reproductive parameters. Photo-ID based observations at Banks Peninsula from 1984 to 2006 show that individuals can reach at least 22 years of age. Males attain sexual maturity between 6 and 9 years old and females begin calving between 7 and 9 years old. Females will continue to calve every 2\u20133 years, resulting in a maximum of 4\u20137 calves in one female's lifetime. Calving occurs during the spring and summer. Calves are assumed to be weaned at around one year of age, and the mortality rate in the first 6 months was estimated to be around 36%.\nThese combined life-history characteristics mean that, like many other cetaceans, Hector's dolphins are only capable of slow population growth. Their maximum population growth rate was previously estimated to be 1.8\u20134.9% per year, based on old demographic information, which was then updated to 3\u20137% per year, based on updated demographic information and a life history invariant observed across all vertebrates\nEcology [ edit ]\nHabitat [ edit ]\nThe species' range includes murky coastal waters out to 100 m (330 ft) depth, though almost all sightings are in waters shallower than 50 m (160 ft). Hector's dolphins display a seasonal inshore-offshore movement; favouring shallow coastal waters during spring and summer, and moving offshore into deeper waters during autumn and winter. They have also been shown to return to the same location during consecutive summers, displaying high foraging site fidelity. The inshore-offshore movement of Hector's dolphins are thought to relate to seasonal patterns of turbidity and the inshore movements of prey species during spring and summer.\nDiet [ edit ]\nHector's dolphins are generalist feeders, with prey selection based on size (mostly under 10 cm in length) rather than species, although spiny species also appear to be avoided. The largest prey item recovered from a Hector's dolphin stomach was an undigested red cod weighing 500 g with a standard length of 35 cm. The stomach contents of dissected dolphins include a mixture of surface-schooling fish, midwater fish, squid, and a variety of benthic species. The main prey species in terms of mass contribution is red cod, and other important prey include Peltorhamphus flatfish, ahuru, New Zealand sprat, Nototodarus arrow squid, and juvenile giant stargazer.\nPredators [ edit ]\nThe remains of Hector's dolphins have been found in the stomachs of broadnose sevengill shark (considered to be their main predator), great white shark and blue shark. Unconfirmed predators of Hector's and M\u0101ui dolphins include killer whales (orca), mako sharks and bronze whaler shark.\nBehaviour [ edit ]\nGroup dynamics [ edit ]\nHector's dolphins preferentially form groups of less than 5 individuals, with a mean of 3.8 individuals, that are highly segregated by sex. The majority of these small groups are single sex. Groups of greater than 5 individuals are formed much less frequently. These larger groups, >5, are usually mixed sex and have been shown to form only to forage or participate in sexual behavior. Nursery groups can also be observed and are usually all female groups of less than 7 mother and young.\nThis species has been found to be show a high level of fluidity with weak inter-individual associations, meaning they do not form strong bonds with other individuals. Three types of small preferential groups have been found: nursery groups; immature and subadult groups; and adult male/female groups. All of these small groups show a high level of sex segregation. Hector's dolphins display a sex-age population group composition, meaning they group by biological sex and age.\nSexual behaviour [ edit ]\nMales of the species have extremely large testes in proportion to body size, with the highest relative weight in one study being 2.9% of body weight. Large testes in combination with males' smaller overall body size suggests a promiscuous mating system. This type of reproductive system would involve a male attempting to fertilize as many females as possible and little male-male aggression. The amount of sexual behavior per individual in the species is observed most when small single sex groups form large mixed sex groups. Sexual behavior in the species is usually non-aggressive.\nEcholocation [ edit ]\nSimilar to the hourglass dolphin, Hector's dolphins use high-frequency echolocation clicks. However, the Hector's dolphin produces lower source-level clicks than hourglass dolphins due to their crowded environment. This means they can only spot prey at half the distance compared to an hourglass dolphin. The species has a very simple repertoire with few types of clicks, as well as little audible signals in addition to these. More complex clicks could be observed in large groups.\nDistribution and population size [ edit ]\nHector's and M\u0101ui dolphins are endemic to the coastal regions of New Zealand. The Hector's dolphin sub-species is most abundant in discontinuous regions of high turbidity around the South Island. They are most abundant off the East Coast and West Coast, most notably around Banks Peninsula, with smaller, more isolated populations off the North Coast and South Coast (notably at Te Waewae Bay). Smaller populations are scattered around the South Island, including: Cook Strait, Kaikoura, Catlins (e.g., Porpoise Bay, Curio Bay), and Otago coasts (e.g.Karitane, Oamaru, Moeraki, Otago Harbour, and Blueskin Bay). M\u0101ui dolphin are typically found on the west coast of the North Island between Maunganui Bluff and Whanganui.\nAn aerial survey of South Island Hector's dolphin abundance\u2014which was commissioned by the Ministry for Primary Industries, carried out the Cawthron Institute, and endorsed by the International Whaling Commission\u2014estimated a total population size of 14,849 dolphins (95% confidence interval = 11,923\u201318,492). This was almost twice the previous, published estimate from earlier surveys (7,300; 95% CI 5,303\u20139,966). This difference was primarily due to a much larger estimated population along East Coast, which was distributed further offshore than previously thought.\nThe latest estimate of the M\u0101ui dolphin subspecies is 63 individuals of age 1 year or older (95% CL = 57, 75).\nMixing of sub-species [ edit ]\nOccasionally, South Island Hector's dolphins (determined from genetics) are found around the North Island, up to Bay of Plenty or Hawke's Bay. In 2012, a genetic analysis of tissue samples from dolphins in the core Maui dolphin range, including historical samples, revealed the presence of at least three South Island Hector's dolphins off the West Coast of the North Island (two of them alive), along with another five South Island Hector's dolphins sampled between Wellington and Oakura from 1967 to 2012.\nPreviously, the deep waters of the Cook Strait were considered to be an effective barrier to mixing between the South Island Hector's and North Island M\u0101ui sub-species for around 15,000 and 16,000 years. This is coincident with the separation of the North and South Islands of New Zealand at the end of the last ice age. To date, there is no evidence of interbreeding between South Island Hector's dolphin and M\u0101ui dolphin, but it is likely they could given their close genetic composition.\nThreats [ edit ]\nFishing [ edit ]\nHector's and M\u0101ui dolphin deaths occur as a direct result of commercial and recreational fishing due to entanglement or capture in gillnets or trawls. Death is ultimately caused by suffocation, although injury and sub-lethal effects can also result from the mechanical abrasion of fins resulting from entanglement. Since the 1970s, gillnets have been made from lightweight monofilament, which is difficult for dolphins to detect. Hector's dolphins are actively attracted to trawling vessels and can frequently be seen following trawlers and diving down to the net, which could result in the unwanted bycatch.\nDeaths in fishing nets were previously considered to be the most serious threat (responsible for more than 95% of the human-caused deaths in M\u0101ui dolphins), with currently lower level threats including tourism, disease, and marine mining. Research of decreases in mitochondrial DNA diversity among hector's dolphin populations has suggested that the number of gill-net entanglement deaths likely far surpasses that reported by fisheries. Population simulations estimated that the current population is 30% of the 1970 population size estimate of 50,000 dolphins, based on their estimated capture rate in commercial gillnet fisheries.\nThe latest government-approved estimates of annual deaths in commercial gillnets (for the period from 2014/15 to 2016/17) was 19\u201393 South Island Hector's dolphins and 0.0\u20130.3 M\u0101ui dolphins annually. The low estimate for M\u0101ui dolphin deaths in gillnets is consistent with the lack of any observed captures in commercial setnets off the West Coast of the North Island since late-2012, despite 100% observer coverage in this fishery across this time period. Annual deaths in commercial trawls were estimated to be 0.2\u201326.6 Hector's dolphins and 0.00\u20130.05 Maui dolphins (from 2014/15 to 2016/17). Based on these levels of mortality, the increased abundance of Hector's dolphins and faster population growth potential than previously thought, the commercial fishery threat (alone) would be unlikely to prevent population recovery to at least 80% of unimpacted levels, for either Hector's or M\u0101ui dolphins. However the threat from commercial fishing was estimated to be higher for some regional populations relative to others, e.g., East Coast South Island, and may have a greater effect on certain smaller populations, e.g., Hector's dolphins along the Kaikoura Coast.\nFishing restrictions [ edit ]\nThe first marine protected area (MPA) for Hector's dolphin was designated in 1988 at Banks Peninsula, where commercial gill-netting was effectively prohibited out to 4 nmi (7.4 km; 4.6 mi) offshore and recreational gill-netting was subject to seasonal restrictions. A second MPA was designated on the west coast of the North Island in 2003. Populations continued to decline due to by-catch outside the MPAs.\nAdditional protection was introduced in 2008, banning gill-netting within 4 nautical miles of the majority of the South Island's east and south coasts, out to 2 nautical miles (3.7 km) offshore off the South Island's west coast and extending the gillnet ban on the North Island's west coast to 7 nmi (13 km; 8.1 mi) offshore. Also, restrictions were placed on trawling in some of these areas. For further details on these regulations, see the Ministry of Fisheries website. Five marine mammal sanctuaries were designated in 2008 to manage nonfishing-related threats to Hector's and M\u0101ui dolphins. Their regulations include restrictions on mining and seismic acoustic surveys. Further restrictions were introduced into Taranaki waters in 2012 and 2013 to protect M\u0101ui dolphins.\nThe Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission has recommended extending protection for M\u0101ui dolphin further south to Whanganui and further offshore to 20 nautical miles from the coastline. The IUCN has recommended protecting Hector's and M\u0101ui dolphins from gill-net and trawl fisheries, from the shoreline to the 100 m depth contour.\nInfectious diseases [ edit ]\nThe unicellular parasiteToxoplasma gondii is considered to be the main non-fishery cause of death. A 2013 study found that seven of 28 beachcast or bycaught Hector's and M\u0101ui dolphins died as a result of toxoplasmosis, which had necrotising and haemorrhagic lesions in the lung (n = 7), lymph nodes (n = 6), liver (n = 4) and adrenals (n = 3). The same study found that approximately two-thirds of dolphins had previously been infected with the toxoplasma parasite. An update to this study found that toxoplasmosis had killed nine out of 38 post-weaning age Hector's and M\u0101ui dolphins found washed up or floating at-sea, and that were not too autolised to determine a cause of death. Of these nine, six were reproductive females, tentatively indicating that this demographic may be more susceptible to infection. In New Zealand, the domestic house cat is the only known definitive host for toxoplasma, and Hector's and Maui dolphins are thought to become infected as a result of their preference for turbid coastal waters near river mouths, where toxoplasma oocyst densities are likely to be relatively high.\nBrucellosis is a notable bacterial disease of Hector's and M\u0101ui dolphins that can cause late pregnancy abortion in terrestrial mammals, and has been found in a range of cetacean species elsewhere. Brucellosis has been determined from necropsies to have killed both Hector's and M\u0101ui dolphins and to have caused reproductive disease, indicating that it may affect the reproductive success of both sub-species.\nLoss of genetic diversity and population decline [ edit ]\nThe high levels of sex segregation and fragmentation of different populations in Hector's dolphin have been discussed as contributing to the overall population decline, as it becomes more difficult for males to find a female and copulate. The Allee effect begins to occur when a low-density population has low reproductive rates leading to increased population decline. In addition, low gene flow between populations may result from this species' high foraging site fidelity. Hector's dolphins have not been found to participate in alongshore migrations, which may also contribute to their lack of genetic diversity.\nSamples from 1870 to today have provided a historical timeline for the species' population decline. Lack of neighboring populations due to fishery-related mortality has decreased gene flow and contributed to an overall loss in mitochondrial DNA diversity. As a result, the populations have become fragmented and isolated, leading to inbreeding. The geographical range has been lessened to the point where gene flow and immigration may no longer be possible between M\u0101ui dolphin and Hector's dolphin.\nPotential interbreeding between Hector's and M\u0101ui dolphins could increase the numbers of dolphins in the M\u0101ui range and reduce the risk of inbreeding depression, but such interbreeding could eventually result in a hybridisation of the M\u0101ui back into the Hector's species and lead to a reclassification of M\u0101ui as again the North Island Hector's. Hybridisation in this manner threatens the Otago black stilt and the Chatham Islands' Forbes parakeet and has eliminated the South Island brown teal as a subspecies. Researchers have also identified potential interbreeding as threatening the M\u0101ui with hybrid breakdown and outbreeding depression.\nSee also [ edit ]\nReferences [ edit ]"}

They are even bigger than the largest dinosaur and it is believed that millions of years ago, whales probably walked upon land. Their back legs disappeared over time and their front legs became flippers. Blue whales can weigh over 150 tons and be over 100 feet in length. Humpback Whales are also big, weighing up to 45 tons. Flippers of the humpback whale can be as long as 15 feet.\nKeep reading for more information on this incredible animal or download our comprehensive worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\nCharacteristics of Whales\nWhales are mammals, so they are warm-blooded, they feed milk to their babies, and breathe air.\nSince whales are not fish, they do not have gills so they cannot breathe underwater, although they can hold their breath for a really long time. For example, a sperm whale can hold its breath for 90 minutes, while the record is held by a Cuvier\u2019s beaked whale that can hold its breath for 220 minutes!\nWhales must eventually come up to the surface to get air. The air is breathed in and out through their \u201cblowhole.\u201d This is basically a nostril and can be found at the top of their head.\nWhales live in groups called \u201cpods.\u201d These can range from small family pods of a mother and her babies to larger pods of 30 individuals. When the conditions are just right, pods of whales can come together to form super pods of hundreds of individuals!\nA baby whale is called a \u201ccalf\u201d, a female whale is called a \u201ccow\u201d, and a male whale is called a \u201cbull\u201d.\nWhales live a long time. A humpback whale can live for 45 years while a Blue whale can live as long as 90 years. They can have babies every two to four years.\nTypes of Whales\nThere are two main types of whales. These are called baleen whales, and toothed whales. Baleen whales have two nostrils, while toothed whales have only one.\nBaleen whales are filter feeders and have baleen plates in their mouths to filter krill. They look like very large bristle brushes and are also called \u201cwhale bone\u201d.\nBaleen is a very hard and strong substance and can be compared with the same substance that makes up the horns on some animals.\nExamples of baleen whales include humpback whales and blue whales that eat krill and small fish. Other species of baleen whale include the fin whale, gray whale, bowhead, Bryde\u2019s, right whale, minke whale, and sei whale.\nToothed whales have teeth in their mouths. Examples of toothed whales include sperm whales that eat giant squid. Other examples include killer whales, beluga whales, and pilot whales.\nThere are 76 species of toothed whale and there are 15 species of baleen whale.\nEnvironment of Whales\nWhales can be found in all the oceans of the world, but some whales prefer specific regions. For example, blue whales and killer whales can be found in every ocean around the world, while southern right whales prefer the southern and Antarctic oceans.\nWhales migrate thousands of miles every year, which is further than any other animal. They do this to follow food and to move to warmer waters to breed and have their babies. Some whale migration routes are between 1,800 and 3,000 miles long!\nWhales generally eat during the summer months to build up layers of blubber or fat to keep them warm in the winter. When the water begins to cool, the whales begin their migration to warmer waters.\nThey do not eat during their migration. All they do is swim and rest for short periods of time.\nBehavior of Whales\nWhales can sometimes be seen close to shore. This is usually when you can see them \u201cblowing\u201d. This is not a spout of water, but mist from them projecting air out of the water.\nWhen whales jump, it is called breaching. They also slap their flippers and tails on the water to communicate with other whales.\nSound travels very far in the water and the oceans are very big, so whales sing to communicate.\nWhales are the loudest animals in the world. Each species has its own songs and voice which can sound like clicks, chirps, whistles, moans, groans and humming to talk to each other. These sounds they make are called \u201cWhale Song\u201d.\nWhale are the loudest animals in the world. They can reach volumes of 180 decibels, which is the same as jet plane.\nWhen whales sleep, they stay at the top of the water, with their blowhole above the surface. The sperm whale sleeps upright with its head pointing up and its tail pointing down.\nWhales need to eat a lot of food \u2013 as much as two tons of krill a day.\nWhales swim by moving their tails up and down and using their flippers, which also help them to turn. Some whales, such as the sei, can swim more than 30 miles per hour.\nWhales and humans\nWhales have been important to humans for thousands of years. Some cultures like those living in Alaska, Greenland, and Siberia traditionally hunted whales for food.\nIn the 18th and 19th century, industrial whaling meant thousands of whales were killed for their blubber which was used in cosmetics, lamp oil, fuel, candles, and soap. The right whale was given its name because it was the right whale to hunt \u2013 it was easy to catch and kill.\nMoby Dick is an 1851 novel by Herman Melville about a sailor obsessed with trying to hunt and kill a huge white sperm whale in revenge for it biting off his leg.\nIntense whaling drove many species to the brink of extinction. So in 1971, the US banned whaling, and the International Whaling Commission banned whaling in 1986 with only a few exceptions allowed.\nSince then, many whale species have started to recover, but their numbers are still too low.\nNow, whales face other dangers such as collisions with ships, noise pollution in the ocean, depleted fish stocks from over fishing, and unstable ecosystems from climate change.\nWhale Worksheets\nThis bundle contains 10 ready-to-use Whale Worksheets that are perfect for students who want to learn more about Whales which are the largest animals that have ever lived on earth and are the largest animals that live in the ocean.\nDownload includes the following worksheets:\nWhale Facts\nColor Me\nThe Ancient Giant\nMeet the Different Species\nSuborder Mysticeti \u2013 Match the Whale\nSuborder Odontoceti \u2013 Word Search\nThe Case of the Whale Shark\nAnatomy of a Whale\nHeavyweight Whales\nWhale Habitat\nWhaling\nLink/cite this page\nIf you reference any of the content on this page on your own website, please use the code below to cite this page as the original source.\n<a href=\"https://kidskonnect.com/animals/whale/\">Whale Facts and Worksheets: https://kidskonnect.com</a> - KidsKonnect, January 16, 2022\nLink will appear as Whale Facts and Worksheets: https://kidskonnect.com - KidsKonnect, January 16, 2022"}

They belong to a group of marine mammals called cetaceans. Marine mammals in the cetacean family include whales, dolphins, and porpoises. These animals are often referred to as \u201csentinels\u201d of ocean health providing insight into marine ecosystem dynamics. Numerous studies have explored the effects of noise and chemical pollution, habitat degradation, and changes in climate on these animals.\nDolphins and porpoises tend to be social and live in groups.

They are also thought to communicate by slapping the water\u2019s surface with their tails or bodies. They range in size from the small, critically endangered vaquita porpoise to the iconic killer whale\u2014the largest member of the Delphinidae, or dolphin family.\nAll dolphins and porpoises are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and some are also listed under the Endangered Species Act.

Sure, we come from different worlds and all, but our ocean-going mammalian counterparts possess many admirable qualities and characteristics that endear them to us like few other species on Earth.\n1. They Like Dogs\nWhile some animals might consider our beloved canine companions to be clumsy, tail-wagging mounds of hair and drool (I'm looking at you, cats), dogs really are like furry gatekeepers to the human heart. It's no wonder then, after learning of the amazing camaraderie shared between a white labrador and a wild dolphin in Ireland, you just might start to look upon those majestic aquatic mammals as a friend of a friend.\n2. They Invent Games to Play With Whales\nIn recent years off the coast of Hawaii, biologists have recorded several incidents of what appears to be wild humpback whales and bottlenose dolphins mutually engaging in playful roughhousing. This rare interspecies play consists of a game wherein the whale hoists the dolphin out of the water, sending the rider happily tumbling down its back. That's right, dolphins have convinced whales to be their Slip 'n Slide.\n3. They're Not Afraid to Ask For Help\nBeing smart is one thing, but it takes wisdom to know when to ask for help. While in the waters off the coast of Hawaii recently, a group of divers were approached by a wild dolphin that was having trouble swimming. As it turns out, the dolphin was tangled in fishing line was looking for a helping hand -- and its persistance paid off. Incredibly, the entire incident of dolphin-human solidarity was captured on film.\n4. They Sometimes Bring Us Gifts\nSure, we might not understand the dolphin language of clicks and squeaks, but no words are necessary when they come bearing gifts. According to a recent study, wild dolphins near a resort in Australia have been observed bringing 'presents', such as dead \"eels, tuna, squid, an octopus\" to wading humans on 23 separate occasions. Although the rare behavior is still shrouded in mystery, it might just prove that some dolphins are as smitten with us as we are with them.\n5. They Help Rescue Other Species\nNautical lore is ripe with tales of dolphins helping humans in the high sea, though sometimes they'll even go out of their way to help other aquatic species, too. When two pygmy sperm whales beached themselves in New Zealand a few years back, beachgoers did their best to usher them back out to sea, but to no avail. That's when a bottlenose dolphin, known as Moko by locals, came to the rescue. Witnesses that after Moko communicated with beached whales, they \"changed their attitude from being quite distressed to following the dolphin quite willingly and directly along the beach and straight out to sea.\"\n6. Even Sperm Whales Seem to Love Them\nwildestanimal / Getty Images\nSperm whales may not have a reputation as the friendliest of sea-faring mammals, but even they are couldn't resist the company of a bottlenose dolphin in need. While on an expedition to the whales in the North Atlantic, researchers ran across one group that had apparently adopted a deformed dolphin into their pod. \"It really looked like they had accepted the dolphin for whatever reason,\" says biologist Alexander Wilson. \"They were being very sociable.\"\n7. They Blow Bubble Rings\nThe development of the blowhole was an essential part of dolphin evolution, allowing the sea-faring mammals to quickly inhale and exhale air at ocean's surface while keeping an eye out for predators and prey in the water below. Oh, and apparently it's really handy for blowing rings too.\n8. They Work With Fishermen to Catch Fish\nAlong a stretch of coastline in Laguna, Brazil, local fishermen and dolphins have formed a partnership in the pursuit of a meal. Researchers, who published a study on this unique behavior, describe how the unlikely allies work as a team to wrangle fish: \"Through highly synchronized behavior with humans, cooperative dolphins in Laguna drive mullet schools towards a line of fishermen and 'signal,' via stereotyped head slaps or tail slaps, when and where fishermen should throw their nets.\"\n9. They Look Out for Their Friends\nBrent Durand / Getty Images\nWhile studying dolphins off the coast of South Korea, biologists were treated to a particularly moving scene of dolphin solidarity. One group of dolphins were observed coming to the aid of their sick or injured counterpart who was struggling to stay afloat. The dolphins formed a 'raft' of sorts with their bodies, propping up their pod-mate to keep her from drowning.\n10. They Know How to Have a Good Time\ngeorgeclerk / Getty Images\nWhile we might have a lot to learn about the intricacies of dolphin emotions, it seems pretty clear when they're having a good time as they leap through the air with utmost precision, or engage in artful displays of underwater acrobatics. Sure, humans and dolphins come from completely different worlds, but there's nothing quite as unifying as the shared joy of being alive."}

They love to explore new territories with their families. These dolphins form long-lasting friendships through hunting, mating, and protecting each other and can swim up to 60 miles per day.\nHow Long Do Bottlenose Dolphins Live in Exploitative Captivity?\nCaptive-born bottlenose dolphins die at about twice the rate those born in their natural habitats. At least 100 dolphins have died at the Miami Seaquarium, many short of their natural life expectancies. In just over a year between 2019 and 2020, six animals died at the facility, including two bottlenose dolphins who died from trauma-related causes and a bottlenose dolphin who drowned after getting caught in a net. Almost 300 dolphins (not counting orcas) have died at SeaWorld parks. Workers at SeaWorld parks also forcibly breed dolphins\u2014sometimes after drugging them\u2014and use them in performances.\nDuncan is just one of the bottlenose dolphins SeaWorld robbed of a natural life. He never got to swim with a pod\u2014or swim freely in the ocean. Employees forced him to perform tricks for food. During his life, SeaWorld transferred him more than half a dozen times to various parks. Duncan died of chronic pneumonia at only 16 years old.\nHow Long Do Orcas Live in Their Natural Habitats?\nFound in every ocean in the world, orcas have an average life expectancy of 30 to 50 years. Their estimated maximum life expectancy is around 60 for males and 80 for females. Orcas can spend their entire lives traveling with their pod families and are able to swim up to 140 miles per day.\nHow Long Do Orcas Live in Exploitative Captivity?\nOnly a handful of the more than 200 orcas who\u2019ve been held in captivity worldwide have lived to the age of 30. More than 40 orcas have died at SeaWorld\u2014many far short of their natural life expectancy. Some deaths were the result of bacterial infections or fractured skulls. Orcas held prisoner at marine parks often show signs of emotional distress such as floating listlessly, banging their heads against glass walls, and continually swimming in circles.\nAmaya was only 6 years old when she died at SeaWorld San Diego. According to the whistleblower reports PETA received, she died just days after SeaWorld workers put all 10 orcas\u2014some with a history of aggression\u2014together. Learn about more ways orcas are suffering at SeaWorld by watching the video below.\nHow Long Do Beluga Whales Live in Their Natural Habitats?\nIn nature, belugas have an average life expectancy of about 20 to 30 years, but they can live up to 60 years. Belugas are the social butterflies of the sea. Dozens of pods often come together to form larger groups of hundreds of whales. They\u2019re also the chattiest of all whales and communicate by singing to each other.\nHow Long Do Beluga Whales Live in Exploitative Captivity?\nEvidence suggests that survival statistics for captive belugas are lower than those for belugas in nature, but their precise life expectancy is unknown. At marine parks, no beluga has come close to living as long as belugas are known to live in the ocean. Dozens of belugas have died at SeaWorld parks, including an infant who died just moments after being born in 2017.\nIn July 2021, a beluga whale named Luna gave birth to one of SeaWorld\u2019s newest victims: her fourth calf.

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "How do animals communicate? | HowStuffWorks", "url": "https://animals.howstuffworks.com/animal-facts/animals-communicate.htm", "text": "\" \" \u00a9 2010 HowStuffWorks.com\nAnimals might not be able to speak or master advanced language techniques, but they certainly have other ways of communicating. Whale song, wolf howls, frog croaks, bird chips -- even the waggle dance of the honeybee or the vigorous waving of a dog's tail -- are among the panoply of ways animals transmit information to each other and to other denizens of the animal kingdom.\nSpecies often rely on verbal and nonverbal forms of communication, such as calls; non-vocal auditory outbursts, like the slap of a dolphin's tail on the water; bioluminescence; scent marking; chemical or tactile cues; visual signals and postural gestures. Fireflies and peacocks are classic examples of brilliant bioluminescence and impressive visual displays, respectively. Ants use chemical cues (in a process called chemoreception) to help guide their foraging adventures, as well as for other activities like telling friend from foe, connecting with new mates and marshalling the colony's defenses.\nAdvertisement\nWhen it comes to acoustic communication, not every member of a species is just alike. Animals in different regions have often been overhead sounding off in different dialects. For example, one study found that blue whales produce different patterns of pulses, tones and pitches depending on where they're from. Some bird species are the same way. And what about those birds that live on the border between territories of differing songsters? They often become bilingual, so to speak, and able to communicate in the singing parlance favored by each of their groups of neighbors.\nCommunication between species can play important roles as well. One study suggested that the reason Madagascan spiny-tailed iguanas have well-developed ears -- despite the fact that they don't communicate vocally -- is so they can hear the warning calls of the Madagascan paradise flycatcher. The two species have nothing in common except for the fact that they share a general habitat and raptors like to snack on them. So when an iguana hears a bird raise the alarm among other birds, it likely knows to be on alert for incoming predators, too.\nHowever, as noise pollution interferes with animal communiqu\u00e9s all across the globe, many animals' ability to communicate effectively comes under fire. Increased shipping traffic over the last century has dramatically affected the transfer of whale song around the ocean basin. Studies have found that songbirds, too, suffer from noisy (albeit terrestrial) urban environs. Some species have had to modify their singing styles, producing songs that are louder and shriller, in order to be heard above the clamor. Pumped up volume usually leads to simpler and somewhat inferior styles of singing that female birds seem to find decidedly less sexy.\nFor more information on all things animal, visit the links on the next page."}

Based on the Linnaeus method, species are arranged grouped based on shared characteristics.\nThis system of animal kingdom classification was developed by Swedish botanist Carolus (Carl) Linnaeus in the 1700\u2019s. The Linnaeus Method, also known as Linnaean Taxonomy, creates a hierarchy of groupings called taxa, as well as binomial nomenclature that gives each animal species a two-word scientific name. This method of giving scientific names to animals is typically rooted in Latin by combining the genus and species. For example, humans are classified as homo sapiens while wolves are canis lupus.\nThe more features that a group of animals share, the more specific that animal classification group is. Every species is defined based on nine branching categories. The primary method of animal classification is:\nDomain Kingdom Phylum Class Order Suborder Animal Families Genus Species\nAnimal Classification Chart for Water snake (Nerodia Sipedon) EreborMountain/Shutterstock.com\nAnimal Classification: The Six Different Animal Kingdoms\nAll living organisms can be placed in one of six different animal kingdom classifications. The characteristics of each animal kingdom are:\nAnimal \u2013 A kingdom of complex multi-celled organisms that do not produce their own food. This kingdom contains all living and extinct animals. Examples include elephants, whales, and humans. Plants \u2013 Complex and multi cellular autotrophic organisms, meaning they produce their own food through photosynthesis. Examples include trees, flowers, and grass. Fungi \u2013 Multi-celled organisms that do not produce their own food, unlike plants. Examples include molds, mushrooms, and yeast. Protista \u2013 Single celled organisms with more complexity than either eubacteria or archaebacteria. Examples include algae and amoebas Eubacteria \u2013 Single celled organisms found in everything from yogurt to your intestines. This kingdom contains all bacteria in the world not considered archaebacteria. Archaebacteria \u2013 The oldest known living organisms. Single-celled and found in hostile and extremely hot areas like thermal vents or hot springs\nAnimal Phylums Explained\nAfter animal kingdom, animal species usually fall into one of seven different phylum, or phyla:\nPorifera \u2013 Marine animals more commonly known as sponges and found in every ocean on earth. Cnidaria \u2013 Mostly marine animals that include over 11,000 species. Examples include coral, jellyfish, and anemones Platyhelminthes \u2013 Typically parasitic flatworms. Lacking in any respiratory or circulatory systems, oxygen pass through their bodies instead in a process known as diffusion. Examples include tapeworms and flukes. Annelida \u2013 More complex than Platyhelminthes, these are segmented and symmetrical worms containing a nervous system, respiratory system, and sense organs. Examples include the common earthworm and leeches. Mollusca \u2013 The second largest phylum by species count, and the largest marine phylum. Invertebrates with soft unsegmented bodies. It is estimated almost a quarter of marine life fall in this category. Examples include clams, mussels, and snails Arthropoda \u2013 Invertebrate animals with an exoskeleton and segmented bodies. Contains insects, crustaceans, and arachnids. This is the largest phylum by species count. Examples include scorpions, butterflies, and shrimp Chordata \u2013 Vertebrates. Animals that develop a notochord, a cartilaginous skeletal rod that supports the body in embryo and can often become a spine. Most animals we are familiar with, including dogs, horses, birds, and humans fall in to this category.\nAnimal Classes\nThe phylum group is then divided into even smaller groups, known as animal classes. The Chordata phylum splits in to these seven animal classes:\nAgnatha (jaw-less fish) Chrondrichtyes (cartilaginous fish) Osteichthyes (bony fish) Amphibia (amphibians) Reptilia (reptiles) Aves (birds) Mammalia (mammals)\nDifferent Animal Orders\nEach class is divided into small groups again, known as orders. There is no universally accepted breakdown for the class Mammalia. Some outline as many as 26 different orders for the class mammalia. Some of the most popular examples include:\nArtiodactyla (even-toed hoofed animals) \u2013 Examples include moose, camels, and giraffes\nCarnivora \u2013 Animals that specialize in mostly eating meat, but also contains some omnivores and herbivores. Characterized as having nonretractable claws and long snouts. Examples include bears.\nRodentia (gnawing mammals) \u2013 Examples include beavers, mice, and squirrels\nChiropptera (bats) \u2013 The only mammals that can fly. Examples include free-tailed and vampire bats\nCetacea (porpoises and whales) \u2013 Examples include killer whales, dolphins, and hump-backed whales\nPrimates \u2013 Includes prehensile hands and feet, commonly with opposable thumbs. Examples include gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans.\nAnimal Families\nIn every order, there are different animal families which all have very similar features. The Carnivora order breaks into animal families that include Felidae (Cats), Canidae (Dogs), Ursidae (Bears), and Mustelidae (Weasels).\nAnimal Genus Types\nEvery animal family is further divided into small groups known as genus. Each genus contains animals that have very similar features and are closely related. For example, the Felidae (Cat) family contains genus including Felis (small Cats and domestic Cats), Panthera (Tigers, Leopards, Jaguars and Lions) and Puma (Panthers and Cougars).\nAnimal Species Names\nEach individual species within the genus is named after its individual features and characteristics. The names of animals are based in Latin and consist of two words. The first word in the name of an animal will be the genus, and the second name indicates the specific species. This method of organizing scientific names of animal species was developed by Carl Linnaeus in the 1700\u2019s. As an example, a dolphin species name is Delphinus Delphis. A red fox is Vulpes vulpes. This animal classification chart of a red fox is an example of Linnaean Taxonomy\nAn animal classification for red fox, based on the Linnaeus Method udaix/Shutterstock.com\nAnimal Classification Example 1 \u2013 Red Fox\n(Vertebrate)\nClass: Mammalia (Mammal)\nOrder: Carnivora (Carnivore)\nFamily: Canidae (Dog)\nGenus: Vulpes\nSpecies: Vulpes vulpes (red fox)\nAnimal Classification Example 2 \u2013 Orang-utan"}

The beluga was wearing a harness that looked like it could carry a camera, the Guardian reports, and \u201cEquipment of St. Petersburg\" was stamped on the inside.\nMarine experts have suggested that the whale was part of a Russian military program that trains cetaceans for operations. It may sound strange, but it's not unheard of.\nIn 2017, Russian state television reported that the country was experimenting with using beluga whales, bottlenose dolphins, and several species of seals to guard entrances to naval bases, assist divers, and possibly kill strangers who entered their territory. Belugas were dropped from the program, however, when it became clear that swimming for long periods in cold, polar waters made the whales sick.\nAnd when Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, it took over a Ukrainian military unit that included bottlenose dolphins, according to news reports. The Ukranian \"combat dolphins,\" based in Sevastopol, were trained to search for and tag underwater mines or unwanted swimmers attempting to access restricted waterways, says RIA Novosti.\nUsing marine mammals for military purposes isn't restricted to Russia\u2014the U.S. Navy has had a similar program since the 1960s. The ability of these animals to detect and find targets at depth or in murky water is something technology can't duplicate yet but which militaries find very valuable.\nThe U.S. Navy trains its marine mammals\u2014including California sea lions and bottlenose dolphins\u2014to find and retrieve equipment lost at sea and to identify intruders swimming into restricted areas. The dolphins are also used to detect mines that are either buried in the seafloor or floating in the water, tethered to an anchor.\nNothing like the real thing\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\n\"[Bottlenose dolphins] are better than any machine as far as detecting mines,\" says Paul Nachtigall, head of the marine mammal research program at the University of Hawaii in Kane'ohe Bay. They can also do it much faster than a machine can.\nDolphins can be especially effective close to shore, where crashing surf and ship traffic generate a lot of noise, Nachtigall says. Mechanical systems can be overwhelmed by all the competing signals, but not dolphins.\nIt's because their sonar is so finely tuned, he explains. Dolphins, and relatives like killer whales, send out a series of sounds that bounce off of objects in the surrounding environment. The mammals pick up the return echoes and form an acoustic picture of their environment, an ability known as echolocation.\nExperiments Nachtigall conducted in the mid-1990s with a resident bottlenose dolphin named BJ demonstrated this sensitive ability. Nachtigall asked BJ to distinguish between metal cylinders made of either stainless steel, brass, or aluminum. Even though he buried the four inch-long objects under two feet of mud, BJ passed with flying colors.\nResearchers still don't know how dolphins do this, Nachtigall says. But it's a topic that has captured the attention of military and civilian scientists for decades.\nOut of place\nCalifornia sea lions, while they don't possess sonar capabilities, have excellent eyesight. \"They're really good at finding things that are out of place,\" such as lost equipment, says Nachtigall.\nThe U.S. Navy uses them to find and retrieve unarmed test ordnance like practice mines. Handlers give a sea lion an attachment system it can hold in its mouth and send the mammal overboard. Once the animal finds its target, it clamps the device to it and handlers in a boat at the surface can bring the object in.\nA 2011 media demonstration in San Diego Bay, California, featured a former U.S. Navy SEAL attempting to infiltrate the harbor with an unarmed mine. The Navy deployed dolphins and sea lions to patrol the area, and both caught the diver on every one of his five attempts. The sea lion even managed to attach a clamp to the diver's leg, and handlers on the surface reeled him in like a fish.\nBoth California sea lions and bottlenose dolphins are fairly hardy, smart, and very trainable, says Nachtigall. Sea lions also have the advantage of being amphibious. That's why the U.S. Navy ended up using them instead of other marine mammals like false killer whales or belugas, which they also initially looked at.

No doubt about that. But do you know what else is awesome? Seeing dolphins! But is it legal to swim with them?\nNew Spinner Dolphin Rules for The Hawaiian Islands!\nOn October 28th, a new rule goes into effect where snorkelers, swimmers, SUPs, drones, boats, canoes, and kayaks can\u2019t be closer than50 yards from Hawaiian spinner dolphins while within 2 nautical miles of shore. This is to protect them since they come closer to shore to rest (they\u2019re nocturnal.)\nThat being said, if they engage with you, and you don\u2019t make an effort to pursue them and are making an effort to move away, it\u2019s ok to be around the dolphins.\nOne of the best ways to see them is on our snorkel tour to Lanai. Spinner dolphins, the type you are most likely to see around Maui, are considered one of the most athletic sea mammals for their amazing aerial leaps. As we navigate to and from our snorkeling areas, it\u2019s ok for dolphins to enjoy the wake of our boat, so long as we don\u2019t change course.\nHere are 10 facts about these beautiful creatures:\nThe scientific name for spinner dolphins is stenella longirostris. There are four sub-species of spinner dolphins and they are often called long-snouted dolphins. The spinners in Maui\u2019s waters are often referred to as Gray\u2019s dolphins (named for John Gray, the researcher who first described them in 1828) or Hawaiian spinner dolphins. Hawaiian spinner dolphins feed mainly on small fish, squids, and shrimps. They feed at night and will often dive over 250 yards to eat. Female spinners reach sexual maturity between 5.5 and 10 years, while the males can reproduce between 10 and 12 years old. The gestation period for the dolphins is 10 months Hawaiian spinners are primarily three colors. The skin on the dorsal area is a deep gray, while its sides are a lighter shade of gray. The bottom portion of the dolphin is white. The dorsal fin area has small white spots. Because dolphins need to consciously think about breathing when they sleep only half of their brain rests at a time. The awake half needs to tell it to breathe and monitor its surroundings. Though the dolphins primarily breathe through their blowholes, Hawaiian spinners have developed a method of breathing without surfacing from the water. They blow a bubble when near the water surface and then quickly draw breath from it. Dolphins are so smart! When spinning, the dolphins can make up to seven complete rotations in the air! Though no one knows for sure, it\u2019s believed the dolphins spin for the following reasons: To clean their bodies of parasites (this is the most common assumption)\nFor courting members of the opposite sex\nTo communicate with other dolphins\nFor fun! Besides spinning, they are also known to do full aerial somersaults(!), head slaps, tail slaps, and spy hops (when they stick their heads out of the water to take a peek).\nWhile we don\u2019t guarantee seeing dolphins on our Lanai Snorkel adventure, rare is the day when we don\u2019t see them. The dolphins love to play in the wake left by the boat and leaping in front of the boat."}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Whales and dolphins in captivity - changeforanimals", "url": "https://www.changeforanimals.org/whales-and-dolphins-in-captivity", "text": "CFAF is a partner organisation of the World Cetacean Alliance (WCA). This alliance brings together NGOs striving for improvements to the lives of cetaceans, as well as whale and dolphin watching businesses and concerned individuals, so that they can campaign with a united and powerful message. CFAF has representation on the WCA\u2019s working group dedicated to ending the keeping of cetaceans in captivity.\nThe captivity working group is developing resources that will strengthen the work of the WCA and its partners on issues concerning the captivity of cetaceans. We add our weight to any campaign or project that is compatible with WCA\u2019s vision and objectives. Specifically we are supporting Orca Network with their campaign to free Lolita from captivity, assisting the Free Morgan Foundation with Morgan\u2019s case, and supporting the Sea Lies campaign run by the Captive Animals Protection Society. The WCA campaigns for changes in policy and legislation where appropriate and when opportunities arise, such as the USA bills to prohibit the keeping of orca in captivity. In addition, the WCA are partners with Responsible Travel in the campaign to end orca circuses.\nThe Issue The worldwide captive marine mammal industry inflicts cruelty and suffering on the thousands of individual animals kept in captivity and continues to threaten wild whale and dolphin populations. There are currently at least 2,360 cetaceans in captivity worldwide - ~2,000 dolphins, 227 beluga and 53 orca (killer whales). However, more than 5,000 cetaceans have died in captivity since the 1950s. The industry is big business and is driven by the attraction for tourists to see these amazing and iconic animals up close and, in many cases, to swim or interact with them. However, life in a marine park is totally unsuitable for these animals. No captive facility can provide for the needs of whales and dolphins - social, intelligent and wide-ranging animals. Captivity presents a lack of the social, visual and auditory stimuli of their natural environment, and many suffer from the stress of confinement, often resulting in increased aggression, illness and death. Out of gallery\nLife in a tank A life in a tank is so far removed from a cetacean\u2019s natural environment that the effect this has on their mental and physical state is almost inconceivable. In the wild, orca have been documented to travel more than 9,400 km in 42 days and reach speeds of 30 miles per hour. The largest tank in the world is only 70m long. The deepest recorded dive for an orca is more than 400 meters, the deepest tank in the world housing an orca is ~12m. Tanks are many times noisier than the ocean, the glass and concrete walls inhibit the natural use of sound by whales and dolphins and the water and cooling pumps are heard underwater 24 hours a day. Naturally cetaceans live in social groups, however in captivity many are kept alone \u2013 for example, Kshamenk is an orca who has lived alone for 21 years in captivity, Lolita has been alone for 34 years out of her 42 years in captivity and mothers and calves are regularly separated. Nothing in their evolution has prepared whales or dolphins for life in captivity. The result is abnormal behaviours, injury, illness, premature death and aggression, not to mention the mental suffering.\nThis thought provoking short film explores the issue of keeping animals in captivity through the eyes of young people. Featuring the inspiring and passionate marine scientist Dr Ingrid Visser.\nWelfare is often considered in terms of the \u20185 Freedoms\u2019, however, these simply can\u2019t be met in captivity 1. Freedom from hunger and thirst: This is not always met, for example gelatine (from the bones of cows) has to be fed to prevent dehydration and animals are often kept hungry so that their food rations can be used in training. 2. Freedom from discomfort: This is impossible to meet when the cetaceans are confined, unable to properly swim without incurring grazes on the sides of the tank. In addition, there is often no escape from the sun, and chemical burns from water treatment solutions are common. 3. Freedom from pain, injury and disease: This can never be met in captivity. Dental disease is common, as are wounds from attacks by other animals sharing the same tank. 4. Freedom to express normal behaviour: This is impossible to ensure because of the size of the tanks and the fact that cetaceans are unable to form their usual social groups. Abnormal behaviours are very common, and drugs are often used to modify behaviour. 5. Freedom from fear and distress: This is impossible to avoid in captive circumstances \u2013 for example, cetaceans are usually kept in inappropriate social groupings, and rape and bullying are common. Welfare is further compromised by their training, excessive noise and the proximity of people and the other cetaceans they are kept with.\nMisconceptions about captivity \u200b Misconception: The marine parks conduct useful research into cetaceans Reality: Actually, there is minimal research output from marine parks compared with academic institutions. Marine scientist Dr Naomi Rose said: \u201cAbout the only thing we have learnt from research of captive cetaceans is that they shouldn\u2019t be in captivity\u201d Misconception: Training is enjoyable for the animals because it involves positive reinforcement (the animals are rewarded with fish) Reality: \u201cPositive reinforcement\u201d is a technical term that means that after performing a \u2018desirable\u2019 behaviour or trick the animals are given a fish to increase the chances of them doing it again. However, being trained this way is not as positive as it seems. The animals have to work for their food (performing behaviours that would not be natural for them to do in that context, or sometimes ever) and so this method of training doesn\u2019t reflect a true desire to enact that behaviour. Food is usually withheld outside training sessions and so there is very little choice in carrying out the behaviours as the animal tries to satisfy its hunger. Misconception: Captive cetaceans are ambassadors for their species \u2013 facilities are \u2018educational\u2019, they create awareness and encourage ocean conservation Reality: Misinformation is reported as facts, and the shows do not create awareness of the real issues faced by wild whale and dolphin populations. Facilities housing cetaceans present an unrealistic vision of these animals and their needs, emphasising the \u2018showmanship\u2019 of the performance rather than providing any educational or conservation value. Misconception: Animals bred in captivity do not suffer, as they do not know any different Reality: All animals suffer when their physical and mental needs are not met. These needs do not change depending on the animal\u2019s previous experience or its birth location. Wild animals kept in captivity are still \u2018wild\u2019 and have the same instincts and desires as those living in their natural environment. Misconception: Cetaceans removed from captivity wouldn\u2019t survive in the wild Reality: As many cetaceans have unfortunately been kept captive for many years they may not be able to be fully released into the wild. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that we should leave them suffering where they are. Retirement plans may include individuals remaining in human care for as long as necessary for their well-being, but they would no longer be forced to endure the daily stresses currently faced and would be relocated to sea-pens to enjoy access to more space than is possible in a land-based tank.\nSolutions \u200b Globally, we are seeing an ever-growing number of countries passing laws prohibiting the capture and/or keeping of marine mammals in captivity. This trend reflects the recognition of the risk the captivity industry poses to animal welfare and conservation. If marine parks were no longer allowed to keep cetaceans in captivity, these animals would not simply be released into the sea to fend for themselves. Retirement plans would include extensive rehabilitation programmes tailored for each individual animal and could be undertaken by marine mammal experts and organisations. Some cetaceans will never be able to be released into the wild, but can be moved to more appropriate \u201csea pens\u201d- usually bays that are closed off from the ocean with nets providing an enclosed area that is more natural than a concrete tank. More than 100 individuals of 13 species of cetacean have been successfully rehabilitated in this way. The WCA would be prepared to work with the marine park industry to create innovative programmes for rehabilitation that could truly educate and inspire people and explain the essential move away from keeping cetaceans in captivity. The WCA will achieve its aims by raising the profile of whale watching in the wild (whilst safeguarding wild animals through responsible practices); working with the marine park industry on innovative modern entertainment facilities (such as virtual holographic whales, 3D immersive experiences); and campaigning for adequate legal protection of cetaceans in the wild. It is encouraging that some countries are introducing bans on the keeping of whales and dolphins in captivity but tragically others are increasing their number of captive cetaceans, with the largest growth in the Caribbean, Russia and Asia. The public in these countries are, in general, unaware of the welfare problems of captive cetaceans. As members of the public, you can help by spreading the word that it is not OK to keep cetaceans in captivity, ensuring that you never attend tourist attractions that involve these animals, and instead support ethical dolphin and whale watching boat trips to see the animals in the wild."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Dolphin drive hunting - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin_drive_hunting", "text": "Method of hunting dolphins\nDolphin drive hunting, also called dolphin drive fishing, is a method of hunting dolphins and occasionally other small cetaceans by driving them together with boats and then usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the open sea or ocean with boats and nets. Dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, dolphins are mostly hunted for their meat; some end up in dolphinariums.\nDespite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the often polluted meat causes, tens of thousands of dolphins are caught in drive hunts each year.\nBy country [ edit ]\nFaroe Islands [ edit ]\nKilled pilot whales on the beach in the village Hvalba on the southernmost Faroese island Su\u00f0uroy , August 2002\nWhaling in the Faroe Islands takes the form of beaching and slaughtering long-finned pilot whales. It has been practiced since about the time of the first Norse settlements on these North Atlantic islands, and thus can be considered aboriginal whaling. It is mentioned in the Sheep Letter, a Faroese law from 1298, a supplement to the Norwegian Gulating law.\nNowadays, it is closely regulated by the Faroese authorities, with around 800 long-finned pilot whales and some Atlantic white-sided dolphins slaughtered annually; mainly during the summer. The hunts, called grindadr\u00e1p in Faroese, are non-commercial and are organized on a community level. Anyone who has a special training certificate on slaughtering a pilot whale with the spinal-cord lance can participate. The police and Grindaformenn are allowed to remove people from the grind area. The hunters first surround the pilot whales with a wide semicircle of boats. The boats then drive the pilot whales into a bay or to the bottom of a fjord. Not all bays are certified, and the slaughter will only take place on a certified beach.\nMany Faroese consider the whale meat an important part of their food culture and history. Animal rights groups criticize the slaughter as being cruel and unnecessary. In November 2008, H\u00f8gni Debes Joensen, chief medical officer of the Faroe Islands and P\u00e1l Weihe, scientist, have recommended in a letter to the Faroese government that pilot whales should no longer be considered fit for human consumption because of the high level of mercury, PCB and DDT derivatives. However, the Faroese government did not forbid whaling. On 1 July 2011 the Faroese Food and Veterinary Authority announced their recommendation regarding the safety of eating meat and blubber from the pilot whale, which was not as strict as the one of the chief medical officer. The new recommendation says only one dinner with whale meat and blubber per month, with a special recommendation for younger women, girls, pregnant women and breastfeeding women. From 2002 to 2009 the PCB concentration in whale meat has fallen by 75%, DDT values in the same time period have fallen by 70% and mercury levels have also fallen.\nIceland [ edit ]\nIn mid-1950s, fishermen in Iceland requested assistance from the government to remove killer whales from Icelandic waters as they damaged fishing equipment. With fisheries accounting for 20% of Iceland's employment at the time, the perceived economic impact was significant. The Icelandic government asked the United States for assistance. As a NATO ally with an air base in Iceland, the US Navy deployed Patrol Squadrons VP-18 and VP-7 to achieve this task. According to the US Navy, hundreds of animals were killed with machineguns, rockets and depth charges.\nIn the late 1970s, after the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and the ban on hunting killer whales in Washington in 1976 as discussed later in this article, the hunting of killer whales in Iceland resumed, this time aiming to capture live animals for the entertainment industry. The first two killer whales captured went to Dolfinarium Harderwijk in the Netherlands. One of these animals was soon after transferred to SeaWorld. These captures continued until 1989, with the additional animals going to SeaWorld, Marineland Antibes, Marineland of Canada, Kamogawa Sea World, Ocean Park Hong Kong, and Conny-Land.\nAlthough commercial whaling does still take place in Icelandic waters today, dolphins are no longer hunted and whale watching is popular amongst tourists.\nJapan [ edit ]\nThe fishing village of Taiji\nThe Taiji dolphin drive hunt captures small cetaceans for their meat and for sale to dolphinariums. Taiji has a long connection to Japanese whaling. The 2009 documentary film The Cove drew international attention to the hunt. Taiji is the only town in Japan where drive hunting still takes place on a large scale. Concern is majority through the methodology of the hunt, as actions are viewed as inhumane. An article by National Geographic refers to The Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums' decision to no longer support the Taiji hunt. In 2015, it was announced that there would be a ban in the buying and selling of dolphins through the means of this hunt.[citation needed]\nKiribati [ edit ]\nSimilar drive hunting existed in Kiribati at least until the mid-20th century.\nPeru [ edit ]\nThough it is forbidden under Peruvian law to hunt dolphins or eat their meat (sold as chancho marino, or sea pork in English), a large number of dolphins are still killed illegally by fishermen each year. To catch the dolphins, they are driven together with boats and encircled with nets, then harpooned, dragged on to the boat, and clubbed to death if still alive. Various species are hunted, such as the bottlenose and dusky dolphin.\nAccording to estimates from local animal welfare organisation Mundo Azul released in October 2013, between 1,000 and 2,000 dolphins are killed annually for consumption, with a further 5,000 to 15,000 being killed for use as shark bait. Sharks are captured both for their meat and for use of their fins in shark fin soup.\nSolomon Islands [ edit ]\nDolphins in a canoe after being killed by locals on the Solomon Islands\nDolphin are hunted in Malaita, in the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific, mainly for their meat and teeth, and also sometimes for live capture for dolphinariums. The hunt on South Malaita Island is smaller in scale than Tajai. After capture, the meat is shared equally between households. Dolphin teeth are also used in jewelry and as currency on the island.\nTaiwan [ edit ]\nOn the Penghu Islands in Taiwan, drive fishing of bottlenose dolphins was practiced until 1990, when the practice was outlawed by the government. Mainly Indian Ocean bottlenose dolphins but also common bottlenose dolphins were captured in these hunts.\nUnited States [ edit ]\nNew England [ edit ]\n1500 pilot whales driven ashore at Cape Cod in 1885, and sold for a considerable sum for their oil\nFrom 1644 at Southampton, New York, on Long Island, the colonists established an organised whale fishery, chasing pilot whales (\"blackfish\") onto the shelving beaches for slaughter. They also processed drift whales they found on shore. They observed the Native Americans hunting techniques, improved on their weapons and boats, and then went out to ocean hunting.[needs update]\nHawaii [ edit ]\nIn ancient Hawaii, fishermen occasionally hunted dolphins for their meat by driving them onto the beach and killing them. In their ancient legal system, dolphin meat was considered to be kapu (forbidden) for women together with several other kinds of food. As of 2008, dolphin drive hunting no longer takes place in Hawaii.\nTexas [ edit ]\nHunting dolphins (at the time still often incorrectly referred to as fish or porpoises), primarily using harpoons and firearms, was considered a form of recreational hunting along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico in Texas in the late 19th and early 20th century. Pleasure dolphin hunting cruises could be booked in Corpus Christi in the 1920s, with a promise to tourists that if no successful dolphin kill was made, the excursion would be free of charge. The brutality of the practice started to spark animal welfare concerns and there is no reference of this practice still occurring in Texas after the Second World War.\nWashington [ edit ]\nDrive hunting methods were used to capture orcas in the Puget Sound in the 1960s and 1970s. These hunts were led by aquarium owner and entrepreneur Edward \"Ted\" Griffin and his partner Don Goldsberry. After Edward purchased an orca that was caught by accident by fishermen in Namu, British Columbia, in 1965, Edward and Don used drive hunting techniques in the Puget Sound area to capture orcas for the entertainment industry. Others followed and despite the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 the practice continued until 1976 when the state of Washington ordered the release of a number of orcas that were being held in Budd Inlet and subsequently banned the practice.\nSee also [ edit ]\nReferences [ edit ]"}

Otters have shown they\u2019re able to use tools from a young age, and that skill was likely acquired much earlier in history than dolphins\u2019 similar skill set, according to a study published Wednesday.\nResearchers analyzed the genes of more than 100 sea otters living along the California Coast. The results, published Monday in the journal Biology Letters, showed that otters\u2019 ancestors have been using tools to accomplish tasks like breaking sea shells and gathering tools for millions of years. Otters have been seen using rocks as hammers to crack open shells in order to access the food inside. In contrast, similar tool-using skills only appeared in dolphins around 200 years ago.\nMeasuring animal intelligence is difficult to do quantitatively because the assessment depends on what they\u2019re being tested on\u2014different animals have different skill sets. But tool usage in otters makes them one of the few mammals, other than primates, who have shown the ability to do so.\n\u201cOrphaned otter pups raised in captivity exhibit rudimentary pounding behavior without training or previous experience,\u201d the researchers wrote in the study. \u201cAnd wild pups develop tool-use behavior before weaning regardless of their mother\u2019s diet type.\u201d\nPhoto: Reuters\nWhile the history of otters' intellect had not previously been thoroughly documented, researchers have long been aware of the marine mammals' intelligence and their relatively advanced methods of eating . A 2009 LiveScience article listed them among the world's smartest animals, citing their ability to \"hammer abalone shells off the rocks and crack the hard shells of prey open.\"\nResearchers have linked tool usage and the evolution of language to the evolution of humans, according to the Behavioral Ecology Research Group at the University of Oxford. That means tool usage in animals like otters have wider implications for the species as a whole. In addition to dolphins and otters, chimpanzees, octopus, elephants and certain types of crows have shown similar skill sets.\nIn 2013, scientists witnessed two crows in Hawaii using sticks to access tools they wouldn't have been able to reach with just their beaks. After some experimenting, researchers noted that 93 percent of captive crows were adept tool users, precisely choosing the right stick for each task.\nBearded capuchin monkeys in Brazil showed similar tactics when using a stone anvil to obtain food. Monkeys were seen placing nuts in a stable position on a stone before smashing the rock repeatedly. Octopuses have been recorded using coconut shells to construct portable homes for themselves, carrying them as they travel until they're in need of protection.\nTool usage is also well documented among elephants. In 2010, a 7-year-old Asian elephant named Kandula was seen using a plastic block to prop himself up just enough so that he could reach a piece of fruit that would have otherwise been too far out of his reach, according to Mental Floss. The one plastic block didn't do the trick, so Kandula went back and added several more blocks to make the stack higher so he could reach the fruit."}

Their bodies are incredibly strong, though this strength is used for multiple purposes.\nSnakes have a close relationship to lizards, which are also reptiles. While snakes have no eyelids or ear holes, they have become a well-loved pet by many eclectic owners. The serpent, a mythical symbol that is broadly known everywhere, is simply another term for it.\n5 Incredible Snake Facts!\nHere are a few interesting facts about these reptiles:\nOut of over 3,800 different types, only 600 have venomous fangs. Snakes like the gopher snake and kingsnakes are nonvenonmous. Only 200 of these snakes have enough potency to harm a human.\nThough they are a reptile, like a lizard is, they have no eyelids or ear holes.\nSnakes do not chew their food, despite the presence of teeth. Instead, they swallow it whole.\nThese reptiles can be found on every continent but Antarctica.\nThe snake to have lived the longest is located in Missouri and she is 62 years old.\nSnake Scientific Name\nThese reptiles go by the scientific name Serpentes and belong to the kingdom Animalia and Phylum Chordata. Their class is called Reptilia and the order is called Squamata. The clade is called Ophidia.\nSerpentes, which is often shortened to the serpent in mythical stories, comes from the Latin word \u201cserp\u014d,\u201d which means \u201ccreep\u201d or \u201ccrawl.\u201d\nSnake Appearance\nSnakes are reptiles, but they noticeably have no legs. However, not every legless reptile is known as a snake. Seemingly, the only components to a snake are their head and their tail, which takes up the entire length of their body. Some snakes are as short as 4.1 inches (like the Barbados thread snake), though the longest snake in the world (which is the reticulated python) is over 20 feet long.\nThe teeth of these reptiles will vary by the species as well. Some species have several needle-sharp teeth, while others have fangs. The snakes with fangs naturally store their venom in the sacs that are behind the eyes. The venom is poisonous, but only about 600 species have it. A snake, sometimes referred to as a serpent, has no earholes, but its ears are internal.\nThese reptiles are covered in scales, though they have skin like humans underneath them. The markings are determined by the species, but there is hardly a color that you won\u2019t see. The color is often a sign of how dangerous the snake is, but the pattern will help differentiate the threats from harmless animals. Often, snakes are found in every color of the rainbow, including red, green, yellow, blue, and black. A high abundance of color means that it is more dangerous, though venomous snakes usually have a triangular head. Read here to know about snakes that change their color to blend it.\nRattlesnakes have a large rattle at the end of their tail, which emits a loud noise to let animals and humans know that they are not to be messed with. It is also important to note that there are some animals that look like snakes, but aren\u2019t.\nThe body of the animal is also indicative of the way that the snake hunts. Animals with long and thin bodies will hunt down their prey by hunting through bushes, while short yet thick snakes will sit and wait for their prey.\nRead here to learn more about the anatomy of snakes. Also, read here to learn about the most colorful snakes in the world.\nSome snakes look like dragons. Read here to find out about them.\nreptiles4all/Shutterstock.com\nSnake Behavior\nWhen it comes to hunting, snakes have an incredible sense of smell that they rely on. As they flick out their tongue, they seek out the chemicals in the air. Other snakes will use their ability to detect body heat. Constriction and venom tend to be the main ways that the prey is overpowered.\nThese reptiles seek out the right environment to keep their body warm since their cold-blooded body is unable to regulate their temperature. Most often, snakes will use natural sunlight to keep their body warm, but they will hide to cool off as well.\nSnakes shed their skin when they grow. Some of them change their eye color when the shedding occurs, becoming paler than their typical color. The shedding process can be rather uncomfortable, but it is harmless to the user.\nThough some species produce venom, the majority do not. Only 600 species have any kind of venom, and only a third of those venomous snakes have the capacity to wound humans at all, and even fewer can fatally kill them. Learn about the toughest animals in the world here.\nThough humans are not a natural part of the reptile\u2019s diet, it will bite if it feels threatened. In certain species, this bite can be fatal. There are scary and dangerous species in the world, the most lethal being the saw-scaled viper, killing more humans than any other species.\nRead about the most dangerous animals on earth to humans here.\nCommon Types of Snakes\nThe following list includes some common types of snakes found around the world:\nPythons \u2013 Pythons are a family of snakes consisting of 42 total recognized species. These reptiles can be found mostly in Asia, Australia, and Africa; however, the Burmese python was introduced in the Florida Everglades and is currently considered an invasive species. Most species in this family are \u201cambush predators\u201d meaning they remain motionless and strike as prey passes by.\n\u2013 Pythons are a family of snakes consisting of 42 total recognized species.

Most species in this family are \u201cambush predators\u201d meaning they remain motionless and strike as prey passes by. Elapids \u2013 Most elapids are commonly referred to as \u201ccobras.\u201d These snakes are characterized by the erect, venomous fangs at the front of their mouths, and species can be terrestrial or aquatic. Elapids are endemic to tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world.\n\u2013 Most elapids are commonly referred to as \u201ccobras.\u201d These snakes are characterized by the erect, venomous fangs at the front of their mouths, and species can be terrestrial or aquatic.

Rattlesnakes \u2013 Rattlesnakes are found on the American continents and are characterized by the rattle at the end of their tails which they use to scare off predators. Although rattlesnakes rarely attack humans unless provoked, rattlesnake bites are the leading cause for snakebite injuries in North America.\n\u2013 Rattlesnakes are found on the American continents and are characterized by the rattle at the end of their tails which they use to scare off predators. Although rattlesnakes rarely attack humans unless provoked, rattlesnake bites are the leading cause for snakebite injuries in North America. Garters \u2013 Garter snakes are generally harmless snakes found throughout North and Central America. These snakes were long believed to be non-venomous, but recent studies have determined that they produce a neurotoxic venom which is too mild to injure or kill a human.\nSnake Habitat\nSnakes are quite versatile, and many types work in the climates of the world. Though the only continent without snakes is Antarctica, there are a few countries that aren\u2019t home to any native snake, including Ireland, New Zealand, and Iceland. Alaska is one of the few states that also has no native species.\nThe typical habitat is just as broad as where they can live. In water-based and land-based environments alike, these reptiles can also be found in tropical areas. While the water moccasin and the water snake commonly live near and in water, most snakes live on land. Based on the species, snakes can live in deserts, grasslands, and the rainforest.\nSnake Diet\nThese reptiles have a carnivorous diet, meaning that their diet entirely consists of other animals. They can choose warm-blooded or cold-blooded animals, seeking out amphibians, insects, and mammals. For the most part, they don\u2019t eat other reptiles, but some of them have been known to go after smaller species.\nThough every snake will consume their prey whole, the way that they render them helpless varies. Boas and pythons will bite their prey to hold onto them, wrapping their body around and squeezing the life from the prey. If the animal has fangs, it will deliver venom to its prey. The venom comes from a sac that is hidden behind the eyes.\nSnake Predators and Threats\nThese reptiles are rather quick and effective predators, but they are also the prey of many different animals. One of the biggest predators of these reptiles is humans. Humans will use them for meat, clothing, and many other purposes, though the animal is largely not considered to be endangered.\nThe population of these reptiles can be negatively impacted by deforestation, hunting, and climate change. Ultimately, the threat that the snake faces is specific to many factors, like the species, where they live, and how much meat that they provide. Learn about some snakes that are endangered here.\nTo learn about some snakes that don\u2019t bite, read here.\nWhat Eats Snakes?\nThese reptiles may be rather impressive hunters, but animals like large birds and coyotes have made these reptiles into a regular part of their diet. They are also hunted by mongooses, wild boars, foxes, raccoons, and other game that can pick them up and consume them. Some snakes eat other snakes. They are called ophiophagus.\nLuckily, each species has its own way to defend itself against threats. Camouflage plays a major role in their defense, hiding for additional coverage. Venomous species will bite as a last resort, but they primarily will try to flee instead.\nWhat Do Snakes Eat?\nSince all of these reptiles are carnivores, there are many small animals that can become their prey. The diet that the animal consumes is based on their species. Insects, amphibians, earthworms, slugs, fish, rodents, rabbits, and birds are all possible foods. Some snakes eat eggs.\nRead here to discover some snakes that eat fish and some snakes that eat birds.\nSnake Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nThe reproduction process of these reptiles is primarily a process of internal fertilization. Most species intertwine their bodies with that of their partner, and the male releases the sperm from one of the two organs it has. The female doesn\u2019t necessarily become pregnant with her young right away; some females can store the male\u2019s sperm for 2-5 years before fertilization.\nThe species will determine the type of birth that the female has. Rattlesnakes and garter snakes will give birth to their babies as live young, which makes them ovoviviparous. However, species like the ball python and the corn snake will lay eggs, which makes them oviparous. In fact, approximately 70% of all these reptiles are oviparous, rather than ovoviviparous.\nThe number of eggs or live young will vary greatly. For snakes that give birth to live young, about 10-30 are born in each litter, though the diamondback water snake can have up to 40 babies in a litter. The live-bearing females often find a sheltered spot where they give birth to the babies. For the species that lay eggs, the clutch size varies significantly. While the ball python may only lay a single egg, some clutches are up to 100 eggs annually.\nThe species of snake will determine their lifespan. While smaller species (like the garter snake) live for less than ten years, the various types of boas can leave for about 25 to 50 years. As of September 2020, the longest living snake is a ball python who is currently 62 years old and lives in the St. Louis Zoo of Missouri.\nSnake Population\nJukka Palm/Shutterstock.com\nWith over 3,000 types of snakes around the world, the total population varies from country to country. Interestingly, there are a few countries that have no known native species of snakes at all, including Ireland and Antarctica. Here is a compilation of pre-historic snakes.\nOf the thousands of snake species, approximately 600 species are venomous. Still, the unpopular nature of this reptile has led many people to believe that this statistic means that they are dangerous, which is not accurate. Of the 600 venomous snakes, only 22 species actually can harm a human.\nThough there are some species with lower populations, snakes (as a whole) are classified as \u201cnot extinct\u201d by the IUCN. Here is a list of the most popular snakes in the world.\nRead about the rarest snakes in the world here. To know more about some prehistoric snakes, read here.\nSnakes In the Zoo\nThese reptiles can be found at nearly every major zoo, allowing the public to become more informed of the types of this reptile that span across the globe. Most often, the zoos will include snakes that are local to their region, so the species will vary from one location to the next.\nWhen visiting this reptile, most species will simply relax in their tank. However, some zoos (like the Virginia Living Museum) features demonstrations outside of the tanks to allow patrons to get a closer look. With more awareness about harmless and dangerous types of snakes, the fear typically associated with these animals can be erased.\nSnakes that live in zoos may not exhibit the same outward symptoms of illness that they show in the wild. Zookeepers are incredibly familiar with the behavior that these snakes show when they are ill, allowing them to get fast treatment when they become sick.\nSome types of snakes can be kept as pets, like the corn snake or the rosy boa.\nRead More\nRead about:\nTypes of Snakes\nList of Snakes\nView all 180 animals that start with S"}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Sea Otter Facts and Information | SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment", "url": "https://seaworld.org/animals/facts/mammals/sea-otter/", "text": "Scientific Classification\nCommon Name sea otter Kingdom Animalia Phylum Chordata Class Mammalia Order Carnivora Family Mustelidae Genus Species Enhydra lutris\nFast Facts\nDescription In appearance, sea otters are stouter and have larger rib cages, smaller tails and blunter muzzles than other species of otters. Yet, sea otters do possess the fine, dense fur coats characteristic of the Mustelidae. Their forefeet are small and dexterous with retractile claws and the flipper-like hind feet are broad and webbed. Juvenile sea otters tend to be a uniform dark-cinnamon brown while adults develop lighter gray or buff coloration on their heads.\nMale: In general, mature male sea otters tend to be slightly larger than females of their respective subspecies. Size Alaskan sea otters are slightly larger than California sea otters\nFemale: Female Alaskan sea otters measure up to 140 cm (55 in.) in length Weight Male: Mature male Alaskan sea otters weigh up to 39 kg (85 lbs.), while California sea otters average 29 kg (64 lbs.)\nFemale: Adult female Alaskan sea otters can reach weights of up to 33 kg (72 lbs.), and female California sea otters weigh on average 20 kg (44 lbs.) Diet A sea otter has a metabolic rate much higher than most mammals of similar size, and must consume large quantities of food. Adult sea otters may eat as much as 9 kg (20 lbs.) of food each day. Among their food preferences are sea urchins, crabs, abalone, clams, mussels, octopus, and fishes. Most sea otters specialize in only a few types of the available food items. Incubation Approximately 4 to 9 months with an average of 6 months; probably includes a 2 to 3 month period of delayed implantation Estral Period The reproductive cycle in California sea otters is about 12 months. If a female's pup doesn't survive, she may experience postpartum estrus. Nursing Duration Approximately 6 to 8 months (wean) Sexual Maturity Male: Approximately 5 to 6 years; usually don't actively breed for several more years\nFemale: Approximately 4 years Life Span On average, 10 to 15 years with some individuals living more than 20 years in zoological parks Range In coastal regions throughout the eastern North Pacific Ocean. Alaskan sea otters inhabit the coast of Alaska, including the Aleutian and Commander Islands. California sea otters are found off the coast of central California, from Half Moon Bay to Pt. Conception. Habitat Typically found in coastal waters no further away than 1 km (0.6 mi.) from shore. The Alaskan sea otter has a greater tendency to haul out (come to shore) than the California sea otter. Population Regional: The California population is still small, roughly 2,200 to 2,800 sea otters Status IUCN: Endangered\nCITES: Appendix II (California subspecies is listed as Appendix I)\nUSFWS: Overall, listed as threatened. The population south of Pt. Conception, CA is listed as Experimental Population/Non-essential\nFun Facts\nThe sea otter's dark brown fur is the finest and densest of any animal fur. On an adult animal, there are an estimated 650,000 hairs per square inch. A sea otter relies on its fur to keep warm because it doesn't have an insulating layer of blubber as other marine mammals do. Natural oils in a sea otter's fur repel water and trap tiny air bubbles, providing a layer of warm air between the otter's skin and the harsh elements of its environment. Sea otters may spend as much as 48% of the daylight hours grooming their fur. Sea otters sleep, rest, and usually swim by paddling with their hind flippers on their backs. California sea otters spend almost all of their time in the water, while Alaska sea otters often sleep, groom, and nurse their young on land. Tool use is an unusual behavioral trait seen only in sea otters and a few other types of animals. An otter may remove an abalone by repeatedly hitting it with a rock. It also may use a flat rock to break open the shells of crustaceans and mollusks. While holding the rock on its chest, the otter pounds the animal on the rock until it breaks or opens. For more information on otters, explore the Otters Infobook.\nEcology and Conservation\nSea otters once were abundant along most of the coastal North Pacific Ocean. That was before fur traders hunted them for their thick, luxurious pelts. By the year 1900, sea otters were nearly extinct. Protected since 1911, Alaska sea otters have made a comeback.\nBecause they rely on their dense fur for insulation from the chilly ocean water, sea otters are particularly vulnerable to the detrimental effects of an oil spill. If a sea otter swims into an oil spill, its fur becomes soiled and loses its insulating qualities, allowing water to penetrate to its skin, causing hypothermia and ultimately, death.\nBibliography\nByrum, J.

Princess Elizabeth II acceded to the throne in February, 1952, when she was just 25 years old, after the death of her father, King George VI.\nHer coronation was held more than a year later, on June 2 1953, due to the tradition of allowing a good amount of time to pass following the death of monarch, before people should celebrate a coronation.\nDuring the service, now-Queen, Elizabeth II, solemnly promised and swore to \u201cgovern the Peoples of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon [now Sri Lanka],\u201d to use her power to ensure \u201claw and justice\u201d would be followed, and promised to \u201cmaintain the Laws of God and the true profession of the Gospel.\u201d You can read the full Coronation Oath from 1953 on the Royal Family website here.\nHer Majesty became the longest-serving British monarch in 2015 and we will celebrate her Platinum Jubilee with a double bank-holiday on Thursday, June 2 and Friday, June 3. There\u2019s lots of events taking place across Wales to celebrate the historic event, whilst the Queen\u2019s Birthday Parade, a Service of Thanksgiving, the Platinum Jubilee Pageant and the Platinum Party at the Palace will all take place in London and be televised across the nation. You can read about the family-friendly events taking place in Wales in a previous article here.\nRead more:Queen\u2019s Jubilee weekend things to do: The best events in Wales to keep the kids entertained\nWhilst we all know the basics: that Queen Elizabeth II became Queen after her father died, that she is Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Commonwealth and has four children: the Prince of Wales (Prince Charles), the Princess Royal (Princess Anne), Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, and Prince Edward, the Earl of Wessex, there\u2019s much more to Her Majesty than meets the eye.\nDid you know she speaks fluent French, having been taught by her French and Belgian governess, or that she has nine royal thrones? And while we all know the Queen technically owns all the swans in England \u2013 did you know she also owns all the dolphins and whales in British waters too?

Her Majesty sent her first email back in 1976, from an Army base. Her Majesty has NINE royal thrones: six of which are at Buckingham Palace, two are at Westminster Abbey and one is at the House of Lords. Queen Elizabeth II is worth \u00a3370m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List 2022. In 1981, she was riding on a horse past crowds of people near Buckingham Palace when she was shot at by a 17-year-old with a replica gun. He was sentenced to five years in prison but was freed from jail in three. Months later, in Australia, another 17-year-old aimed a rifle at the Queen from a fifth-floor building overlooking a parade. Fortunately, he missed. He was sentenced to three years in prison. The first football match the Queen attended was the FA Cup Final in 1953, she saw Blackpool beat Bolton Wanderers 4-3. She has received many unusual gifts over the years, including two black beavers from Canada, jaguars and sloths from Brazil, as well as pineapples, eggs and prawns. Animals gifted to the Queen are often given to London Zoo to be looked after. Queen Elizabeth II once turned down the \u201cOldie of the Year\u201d award from The Oldie, a monthly magazine aimed at older people, and her assistant private secretary reportedly told host Gyles Brandreth: \u201cHer Majesty believes you are as old as you feel\u201d. In Papua New Guinea, the Queen is the \u201cconstitutional monarch\u201d and is referred to in the Tok Pisin language as \u201cMissis Kwin\u201d and \u201cMama belong big family\u201d. Queen Elizabeth II sent a message of congratulations to Apollo 11 astronauts for the first Moon Landing on July 21, 1969. The message was filmed and deposited on the Moon in a metal container. Queen Elizabeth II owns all the dolphins and whales in British waters, under a 1324 statute which gave dolphins and whales the title of \u201cfishes royal\u201d. The Queen successfully sued The Sun newspaper in 1993 after they published her Christmas message two days before it was broadcast. The newspaper issued a front page apology and paid \u00a3200,000 in damages, which was donated to the charity Save The Children. At Balmoral Castle, the Royal Family\u2019s estate in Scotland, the Queen has a cushion in her private sitting room which is embroidered: \u201cIt\u2019s good to be Queen\u201d. The Queen paid income tax for the first time in 1993, following new financial reforms brought in by then Prime Minister, Sir John Major. The oldest person she has written a letter to was a 116-year-old Canadian man in 1984. The Queen was the first British monarch to visit China, in 1986. Her first Corgi dog was called Susan and was given to her as an 18th birthday present \u2013 she loved her so much she even took her on her honeymoon with Prince Philip. She created her own breed of dog \u2013 a \u201cdorgi\u201d \u2013 when one of her corgis mated with Princess Margaret\u2019s dachshund Pipkin. The Queen became the first reigning monarch to win Royal Ascot\u2019s Gold Cup with her thoroughbred horse Estimate in 2013 The Queen has her own currency. Known as \u201cMaundy money,\u201d the Queen donates her silver coins to the elderly on Maundy Thursday each year. She only carries money in her purse on a Sunday to donate it at church. In April, 2013, she was given an honorary BAFTA for her patronage for the film industry \u2013 and was dubbed the \u201cmost memorable Bond girl yet\u201d after he appearance in the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics. The Queen has never needed a driving licence as they are issued in her name, she also doesn\u2019t need a passport to travel abroad as passports are issued on behalf of the Queen Prince George calls the Queen \u201cGan-gan,\u201d a term to mean great-grandma or great-grandmother that has been used in the Royal Family for several generations She has broadcast a Christmas message to the UK and the commonwealth every year of her reign, except for 1969 when a documentary called \u201cRoyal Family\u201d was aired instead. The Queen took part in her first Zoom call in June, 2020, to speak virtually to carers alongside Princess Anne during Carers Week.\nFind images from Wales\u2019s past here:"}

It can reach length of 6.5 feet and weight of up to 550 pounds.\nLargest (ever recorded) specimen of tuna was 21 feet long, weighing 1600 pounds.\nColor of the body provides excellent camouflage in the water. Dorsal (back) side of tuna's body is dark blue and it blends with the ocean floor when observed from the air. Belly of tuna is silver-white and it blends with the surface of the ocean when observed from bellow.\nDespite their large size, tunas are very fast swimmers. They can reach the speed between 44 and 62 miles per hour.\nTuna is able to change the position of its dorsal and pectoral fins to reduce drag and accelerate the swimming speed.\nTuna can swim near the surface or can dive to the depth of 3000 feet while it searches for food.\nTuna is a carnivore. It feeds on different types of fish (mackerel, herring, hake\u2026), squids and crustaceans.\nUnlike other fish, tuna is able to increase and maintain the body temperature few degrees above the temperature of surrounding water. Because of this feature, tuna can be classified as \"warm-blooded\" animal.\nTuna has unique network of small arteries and veins near the muscles called \"rete mirabile\" which facilitates warming of the blood. Warmed blood is essential for fast and strong swimming.\nTuna breathes oxygen from the water and because of that it needs to swim constantly.\nTunas can travel large distances in a short period of time. It can pass across entire Atlantic in 30 days by traveling 16 miles per hours\nBesides humans, natural predators of tunas are orcas and sharks.\nMating season of tunas depends on their geographic location. Tunas in Gulf of Mexico mate from middle of April to middle of June. In Adriatic and Mediterranean Sea, mating takes place from June to August.\nDuring the spawning, one female can release 30 million eggs. Only 2 of those 30 millions will survive until the adulthood. Remaining eggs will be eaten by other marine creatures."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Squid images!\nThe eyeball of a giant squid is about 10.5 inches (26.67 cm) in diameter, about the same size as a soccer ball!\nThere are about 300 different species of squid. They are found in all of the oceans throughout the world, including n the freezing cold Antarctic waters. They eat a range of different foods, including tiny animals such as krill, some fish, and even each other. Squid usually live about 3 to 5 years, but some large squid have been known to live as long as 15 years. Although they have some things in common with octopuses, a squid and an octopus are completely different animals.\n5 Squid Facts\n\u2022 Some squid have special cells in their skin that allows them to change colors.\n\u2022 Most squid have 8 arms and two longer tentacles, but some squids have 10 arms.\n\u2022 Squid have tough beaks that they use to kill and eat their prey.\n\u2022 Many squids that live in deep water have bioluminescent organs that show through their skin.\n\u2022 Squids are one of the few animals that have multiple hearts. In total, squids have three hearts!\nSquid Scientific Name\nBecause so many different kinds of squids exist, there are hundreds of different scientific names for them. All are cephalopods, which means they are members of the scientific class Cephalopoda, along with octopuses and cuttlefish. The class name comes from the Greek words for head and foot. They are members of the superorder Decapodiformes, which is derived from the Greek words for 10 feet. Squids belong to the order Teuthida, a term that comes from the Greek word for fierce.\nSquid Appearance and Behavior\nSquids can look different from one another, depending on the species, but in general all squid have an elongated, tubular body called the mantle which ends at a somewhat flattened head. On either side of the mantle are fins that aid the squid in moving through the water. Depending on the species these fins can be quite large, running the full length of the mantle, or very small, located just at one end. A squid also has relatively large eyes, one on either side of its head, that allow it to see 360 degrees around it.\nAt the lower end of the squid\u2019s body are the arms and tentacles, attached to the head. Each of the arms has suckers on it, as do the tentacles. The suckers of some squids are also armed with sharp hooks that allow them to grip their prey tightly. They don\u2019t have a skeleton as we do, but squid do have a small, internal skeleton made of chitin, which is the same thing you\u2019ll find on the outside of an insect.\nThe shape of the squid allows it to slip quickly through the water. When swimming slowly it uses its fins for propulsion, but if the squid is in a hurry it moves by taking in water through its mantle and then squirting it out through its siphon, jet-propelling it through the water. The siphon can be moved to point in any direction, allowing the squid to quickly move whichever way it chooses.\nSquid are usually black, white, brown, or gray, but many of them can change their appearance at will. The Humboldt squid, for example, can flash red and white, and other squids can match their color to their surroundings or display a colorful pattern on their bodies. They can use color to signal to other squid or to help camouflage themselves to avoid predators.\nDeep-sea squid often have bioluminescent organs, and these lighted body parts can be seen from outside the animal. Typically, squid can also squirt out a cloud of ink in the event they feel threatened. The ink hides them and gives them time to escape to safety. A notable exception to this is the vampire squid, which squirts out a sticky bioluminescent cloud into the water which glows for about 10 minutes, giving the vampire squid time to get away.\nSquid come in many different sizes. The heaviest squid on record was a colossal squid discovered in New Zealand in 2007. This huge animal weighed more than 1,000 pounds (453.6 kg), almost as heavy as a grizzly bear. The longest squid ever found was a giant squid. While not as heavy as a colossal squid, the biggest giant squid was 49 feet (14.9 meters) long, longer than a semitrailer. Most squid are much smaller, with the average being about 2 feet (60 cm) long, the size of an average man. The smallest squid known is the Southern pygmy squid, which is practically invisible at only \u00be of an inch (1.6 cm) long.\nSquid tend to live alone, but they do sometimes gather in groups and some of them have even been known to hunt cooperatively, similar to the way a pack of wolves hunts. When they do gather a group of squid is called either a shoal or a squad, with the exception of the giant squid. A group of giant squid is called a school.\nSquid Habitat\nSquid are found in oceans all around the world. Not all species live in all parts of the world. Some squid prefer warmer, tropical waters while others thrive in the cold seas where krill and other food can be found, but as a species they can be found almost everywhere.\nUnlike octopuses, which live in nooks in rocks and coral reefs, squid are free-swimming and do not seek a place to call home, though some of them do live near the ocean floor, which helps to hide them from their enemies.\nSquid Diet\nFor the most part, squid eat fish such as orange roughy, lantern fish, and hokie, along with other sea creatures such as oysters, crab, and shrimp. Squid are also cannibals and will happily devour other squid, even of their own species, if they are hungry. The size of the prey depends on the size of the squid.\nHumboldt squid are well-known for their aggressive nature, and they will consume anything they can catch. There have even been tales of shoals of them attacking and eating fishermen who are unlucky enough to fall into the water when the squid are present.\nThe vampire squid is different from most other squids because it doesn\u2019t catch and eat live food, nor does it drink blood, as its name might suggest. Instead, it floats through the water waiting to catch detritus that falls through the water. This is made up of tiny dead animals and fecal pellets from other creatures. This squid then rolls everything it has caught into a ball and sticks it together with mucus, then eats the ball it has made.\nSquid Predators and Threats\nBecause squid come in a huge range of sizes and are found almost everywhere, many types of animals eat squid. Small squid are eaten by almost any kind of predator imaginable, but their main predators are penguins, seals, sharks such as the grey reef shark, whales such as the sperm whale, and humans.\nDespite being a popular prey item, squid remain plentiful in the wild. According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), squid are classified as having a status of Least Concern, which means that there are no immediate threats to squid known to exist, and their numbers in the wild are plentiful.\nAt least some types of squid have the ability to regenerate their tentacles, so if one is lost in an attack by a predator or in some other way, the squid can eventually replace the lost part. Scientists do not believe that squids can regenerate their arms. Only their longer tentacles appear to have the ability to regrow.\nSquid Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nBecause there are so many different species of squid, some variation exists in how they reproduce and how long they live. Typically, squids mate in large groups and reproduce when the male places sperm into the female\u2019s mantle. She can then store the sperm until she is ready to use it. When it is time, the female uses the sperm to fertilize her eggs and she will then lay her eggs on the ocean floor or attach them to seaweed. She will not care for them any further.\nWhen the eggs hatch, the babies usually look like tiny copies of the adults and are known as paralarvae. They will grow and change as they mature, ultimately becoming squid that are able to care for themselves. The little squid absorb their egg yolk initially, and this feeds them until they can catch food for themselves.\nThe lifespan of a squid is somewhat uncertain, but scientists think that most squid don\u2019t live longer than 5 years in the wild, and many don\u2019t survive even that long. The exception to this is the larger squid that live deep in the ocean, some of which have been known to live up to 15 years. Most species die after reproducing.\nSquid Population\nThe total population of all of the varieties of squid is impossible to know, but they number in the millions. The IUCN lists them as being of least concern, which means that squid are not considered threatened or endangered in any way. A drop in the squid population could spell disaster for many other species, as so many creatures depend on the squid for survival. One sperm whale, for example, can eat up to 800 squid in a single day, and elephant seals may consume large numbers of squid as an essential part of their diet.\nView all 180 animals that start with S"}

Size up to 112 cm (44 in.) Weight 27 to 41 kg (60 to 90 lbs.) Diet 62 to 66 days Incubation Approximately 24 to 25 days Sexual Maturity 5 to 6 years in males, 5 years in females Life Span 20 to 25 years Range Circumpolar on Antarctic continent Habitat Within the limits of pack ice Population In 2009,46 colonies of about 238,000 breeding pairs were located. More recently, an addition 7 colonies have been identified but the global population has not been updated yet. Status IUCN: Near Threatened\nCITES: Not listed\nUSFWS: Not listed\nFun Facts\nEmperor penguins walk slowly and do not hop. The maximum walking speed for emperors is 2.8 kph (1.7mph). Emperor penguins are also known to toboggan, sliding across ice on their bellies.\nEmperor penguins have been observed swimming 14.4 kph (8.9 mph), though they normally do not exceed 10.8 kph (6.7 mph).\nEmperor penguins breed annually during the Antarctic winter, June through August. During this time, air temperature may drop to -60\u00b0C (-76\u00b0F) and winds may reach up to 200 kph (124 mph).\nEmperor penguins do not build nests. The male penguin stands upright and incubates a single egg on top of its feet under a loose fold of abdominal skin called a brood patch. The male fasts throughout the courtship, nesting, and incubation period. He lives off reserves of body fat which may be 3\u20134 cm (1.2\u20131.6 in.) thick, and loses up to 45% of his body weight. After the female transfers the egg, she goes to sea to feed while the male is incubating. She returns just before the egg is ready to hatch to relieve her mate. If the egg hatches before the female returns, the male is able to produce and secrete a curd-like substance from his esophagus to feed the chick.\nIn 1980, a tiny emperor penguin made international zoological history. The chick was the first to be hatched and raised by its parents inside the Penguin Encounter at SeaWorld San Diego, then the world's only successful emperor penguin breeding facility outside of Antarctica. And in 1982, the first hand-raised emperor penguin hatched. Since then, more than 20 emperor penguins have been hatched and raised at SeaWorld San Diego.\nFor more information about penguins, explore the Penguin InfoBook.\nEcology and Conservation\nAll 18 species of penguin are legally protected from hunting and egg collecting. The Antarctic Treaty of 1959 makes it illegal to harm, or in any way interfere with, a penguin or its eggs. Every penguin specimen collected with a permit must be approved by and reported to the Scientific Committee for Antarctic Research (SCAR). Penguins are vulnerable to habitat destruction, overfishing of primary food sources, ecological disasters such as oil spills, pollution such as trash in the ocean, and human encroachment into nesting areas.\nBibliography\nCoats, Judith.

They grow between 4 and 6 m (12-20 ft.) in length \u2013 a similar size to their relative, the beluga whale.\nBut they are easily distinguished from their beluga kin. Male narwhals possess a great spiraled tooth that projects from their heads. The long, hornlike tooth can reach up to 3 m (10 ft.) in length and grows continually to replace wear. Researchers are unsure of the exact purpose of the tooth. Some believe it serves as an attractive ornament for mating, while others believe it is used as a weapon to fight rivals. One researcher concluded that the tooth has the ability to detect changes in water temperature and pressure.\nNarwhals also have a second tooth that measures about 30 cm (1 ft.) long, but it remains embedded in the skull. Some females have been spotted with a protruding tooth, though not nearly as long as that of the males. There have even been some males with two long protruding teeth.\nNarwhals also differ from belugas in skin color. Narwhals have black and white mottled skin. Appearing to resemble the bodies of drowned soldiers, the name narwhal derives from the old Norse word nar meaning corpse.\nAt birth, narwhals are approximately 1.5 m (5 ft.) in length. At maturity, which is between 6 and 9 years, females grow to about 3.5 m (11.5 ft.) in length, and weigh around 1,000 kg (2,200 lb.). Males reach between 4 and 6 m (13 and 20 ft.) and can weigh 1,600 kg (3,500 lb.).\nOnce they are mature, females will give birth to a calf once every 3 years. The pregnancy lasts for about 14 months, and calves are born in the spring.\nLike many other whales, narwhals travel in groups. Their pods average 15-20 whales. Sometimes multiple pods will meet in social groups of up to 100 whales, although it is hard to get exact numbers. Narwhals have proven difficult for researchers to tag and track, mainly due to the cold and icy water conditions and the fact that narwhals do not come very close to shore.\nNarwhals feed more regularly in the winter, consuming fish like cod and halibut, shrimp, and squid. Preying on creatures primarily on the bottom of the sea, they dive on average 800 m (.5 mi.), but can go twice that. The dives last around 25 minutes. In the summer, narwhals feed rarely, having stored up enough energy during the winter feeding season. They return to the same feeding grounds each year.\nNarwhals are preyed upon by polar bears and walruses if they get trapped by shifting ice. Off shore they are attacked by killer whales (also known as orcas), to whom they are also related. In the summer, narwhals are also hunted by Inuits using kayaks and spears.\nConservation Status\nNarwhals are currently considered a species of least concern by the IUCN Red List, but many of the areas inhabited by narwhals are subject to drilling and mining, which produces waste that is dangerous to all animal populations. Narwhal populations are also negatively impacted by climate change. The reduction of sea ice allows more killer whales into the nearshore areas where narwhals spend their summers.\nWhat You Can Do to Help\nOne way you can help is to get involved with the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society.\nNarwhal Distribution\nNarwhal Resources\nBlog Posts about the Narwhal"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Native Australian Animals Facts, Pictures & Information", "url": "https://nomadsworld.com/australian-animals/", "text": "One thing everyone knows about Australia is that it\u2019s home to some of the most interesting wildlife you\u2019ll ever see. From cuddly and cute to absolutely terrifying, the animals of Australia are certainly fascinating and unique! It\u2019s one of the very few countries where you\u2019ll find marsupials and egg laying mammals! Below is a list of native Australian animals and some introduced species with a few facts thrown in so you can impress people. This list doesn\u2019t include all Australian wildlife (yet) but definitely the most well known and a few you\u2019ve probably never heard of as well.\nA-Z list of Australian Animals!\nA | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z\nUseful Facts about Australian Animals\nWhat is a marsupial? Marsupials are \u2018pouched\u2019 animals meaning that they carry their young in a pouch. Examples include kangaroos, wallabies, possums and wombats.\nEgg laying mammals are incredibly rare in the animal world, in fact Australia and New Guinea are the only places in the world where you\u2019ll find the platypus and the echidna (the only egg laying mammals that exist).\nMany animals in this list are endemic to Australia, meaning they are found only here, i.e. they\u2019re native to Australia.\nNative Australian Animals\n1. Australian Giant Cuttlefish\nA cuttlefish is a Cephalopod, like squid and octopuses. The Australian Giant Cuttlefish is the largest of the species, and can weigh as much as 10kg! It can be found along the southern coast from Shark Bay in WA to Brisbane in Queensland.\n2. Australian Pelican\nThe Australian pelican is one of the many species of pelican. It can be found in the inland and coastal waters of Australia, occupying habitats such as rivers, lakes and swamps. The main features of a pelican are its long beak and massive wingspan. The Australian pelican can have a wingspan up to 2 and a half metres!\n3. Bandicoot\nThere are 20 species of bandicoot. They\u2019re endemic to Australia and they\u2019re marsupials which are nocturnal and also omnivores (they eat both meat and plants). They\u2019re also pretty cute.\n4. Bilby\nThere were 2 species of bilby. The lesser bilby is sadly extinct but the greater bilby can still be found in Australia, although it is endangered. Also known as a rabbit bandicoot, because it\u2019s very similar to the bandicoot but with very long ears, the bilby is native to Australia.\n5. Bottlenose dolphin\nFound in tropical or temperate waters all over the world. If you go near or on the ocean in Australia you\u2019ll be unlucky not to spot bottlenose dolphins at some point during your trip. I highly recommend going on a sea kayaking trip in Byron Bay for a great opportunity to spot dolphins up close.\n6. Brolga\nThe Brolga used to be known as the \u201cNative Australian Crane\u201d. As well as being the largest flying bird in Australia it\u2019s also known for it\u2019s mating dance. You can find Brolga\u2019s in many parts of tropical Australia, especially Queensland. In fact it\u2019s the official bird emblem of Queensland.\n7. Camel\nCamels are not native Australian animals and hopefully that isn\u2019t too much of a shock to you! They\u2019re worth a mention simply because there are so many wild camels in the country (around 1.2 million of them!) especially in the Outback. They were imported to help with transportation and construction back in the 19th century but are now feral. There are so many camels that they\u2019re exported to the Middle East.\n8. Cane toad\nAlso not native to Australia, the cane toad was introduced to Australia in an attempt to control the beetle populations which were destroying sugar cane crops (a major crop for Australia\u2019s economy). The cane toad spread rapidly through Australia and is also spreading disease. You\u2019ll mainly see these large toads dead on the road or being harassed in quite a few pubs during cane toad races.\n9. Cassowary\nA terrifying looking bird in many ways but also quite beautiful because of the colours on its head and neck. You can find the cassowary in Northern Queensland although they\u2019re relatively shy so you might not spot one. Just be aware that even though they\u2019re shy if you do come across one they\u2019re dangerous!\n10. Cockatoo\nCockatoos are fairly common in Australia, they\u2019re intelligent birds that can be very loud! If you visit the Arts Factory Lodge book yourself on a free BushTucker Walk to meet Cockatoo Paul and Mr Pickles.\n11. Crocodile\nThe saltie! Saltwater crocodiles are pretty common in waterways in Australia, especially in the north. If you see warning signs telling you to stay out of the water then stay out of the water! Although salties are pretty massive they manage to hide quite well in the water and they\u2019re quick so you won\u2019t fare well against one. Of all the Aussie animals listed in this article this one might be the most terrifying!\n12. Dingo\nWell you\u2019ll have heard of the dingo which, although endangered, can be easily seen on Fraser Island. Dingoes are protected on Fraser Island so if you visit (and you really must) please adhere to all the rules for keeping yourself and the dingoes safe from harm.\n13. Dugong\nDugongs are similar to manatees in appearance and the only marine mammal which is a herbivore (eats only plants). Dugongs are threatened with extinction so if you do see one you\u2019re very lucky. You\u2019re more likely to see them in Shark Bay in WA or in Queensland. Dugongs are also known as sea cows or the \u201cLady of The Sea\u201d and are thought to be the inspiration behind tales of mermaids.\n14. Echidna\nEchidna\u2019s really are one of the oddest animals of Australia. One of only 2 egg laying mammals that exist in the whole world, it looks a lot like a porcupine but is more closely related to a platypus. After laying a single egg 22 days after mating, the female echidna deposits the egg directly into her pouch where it remains for up to 2 months. Baby echidnas are called puggles which is just the best name for a baby animal! Male echidnas have a four headed penis! Moving on\u2026\n15. Emu\nLarge, terrifying up close and flightless, emu\u2019s are not one of the most popular animals of Australia. Surprising then that they appear on the Australian Coat of Arms alongside the kangaroo. Possibly even more surprising is that they were allowed to remain on the Coat of Arms after they beat the Australian army in the unbelievable, but very real, Great Emu War. Emu\u2019s are endemic to Australia and are it\u2019s largest bird.\n16. Fairy Penguin\nEven 10 years after first seeing penguins in Australia with my very own eyes it still seems strange to me that what is thought of as a very hot country would have an animal that is most well known for living in icy climates. But there we go. Fairy penguins, which are incredibly cute, are quite commonly seen in Australia, most famously on Phillip Island where you can witness for yourself their parade up the beach. I highly recommend doing a tour to see them but please DON\u2019T take pictures using your flash!\n17. Flying Fox\nJust to be confusing this is a bat not a fox. The grey headed flying fox is a mega-bat endemic to Australia. It\u2019s mostly found in the south eastern parts of the country. The little red flying fox is also a native mega-bat but living in north and eastern areas. It\u2019s the smallest of Australia\u2019s flying foxes. Also in the north eastern parts of the country you\u2019ll find the spectacled flying fox (or spectacled fruit bat). Finally you may also see a black flying fox on your travels. A mega bat is larger than usual bats, they\u2019re also known as fruit bats and many do not use echo-location.\n18. Frill Necked Lizard\nFrill necked lizards are fairly hard to spot as their colours help them to stay camouflaged, except when they display their colourful frills of course. These lizards are relatively large but harmless and if you keep your eyes open you might spot one in the northern territories.\n19. Fur Seal\nThe Australian fur seal is the largest of all fur seals and the 4th rarest species of seal in the world, so they\u2019re a protected animal in Australia. Fur seals tend to be found in the south of the country with Seal Rock on Phillip Island being a good place to look for them!\n20. Galah\nA galah is not just an Australian slang word for a stupid person, it\u2019s also an Australian cockatoo with a reputation for not being too bright.\n21. Giant Clam\nIf you plan on doing some underwater exploration of the Great Barrier Reef during your trip to Australia then you\u2019re quite likely to come across a giant clam or two. Giant clams can weigh up to a whopping 200kg and can live for 100 years. They start their lives male but become hermaphrodites (can produce both sperm and eggs).\n22. Goanna\nA Goanna is a type of monitor lizard which varies in size from just 20cm long to 2 metres! Depending on what source you use there are thought to be either 20 or 30 species of monitor lizard, 15 or 25 of which can be found in Australia.\n23. Great White Shark\nThe only reason I didn\u2019t list this as the most terrifying on this list of Australian animals is because Great Whites have had a bit of a raw deal. Yes, they\u2019re scary and yes they can be deadly but the majority of the time they\u2019re not going to bother you. The Jaws films have a lot to answer for with regard to this animals reputation. They can grow up to 6 metres long and are scary looking but my advice? Don\u2019t go in the water during a sharks dinner time!\n24. Humphead Wrasse\nIf you\u2019ve visited the Great Barrier Reef you have more than likely seen a Humphead Wrasse, also known as a Maori Wrasse or Napoleon Wrasse. It\u2019s an endangered species due to overfishing, but if you see one, they\u2019re very friendly, and quite big. Go on a snorkel or scuba diving tour and you will be introduced to Wally the Wrasse.\n25. Ibis (Australian White)\nYou\u2019ll see this fairly large and strange looking bird all over the place. Sadly they have a bad reputation and are known as bin chickens or tip turkeys due to their scavenging behaviour. This is due to the fact that it can be a lot easier for them to feed from rubbish left around by humans than in their normal wetland environment.\n26. Kangaroo\nAlongside the koala, kangaroos are probably the most well known of all the animals of Australia. The red kangaroo is the largest while the grey kangaroo is the one you\u2019re likely to see most often. Appearing on the Coat of Arms beside the emu, the kangaroo is also a popular Aussie food.\n27. Koala\nLooks like a teddy bear but is NOT a bear, don\u2019t even think of referring to them as koala bears near Australians!! Koala\u2019s are fairly common in coastal areas in the south and east of the country but their habitats are being threatened by humans. Koala\u2019s in the north tend to be smaller than their southern counterparts which can be up to twice as heavy. Is this the cutest Australian animal in this list? No, but it\u2019s close\u2026 keep reading for the cutest of all the native Australian animals (in my opinion anyway).\n28. Kookaburra\nKookaburra\u2019s are part of the Kingfisher family and it\u2019s largest member. The native Australian kookaburra\u2019s are probably most well known for their laugh. Their heads are also quite large in comparison to the rest of their bodies.\n29. Lyre Bird\nThe Lyre Bird could also be called a liar bird because it imitates other birds and other sounds so well. I\u2019ll let the incredible Sir David Attenborough tell you more about them!\n30. Magpie\nMagpies can be found all over the place so it might seem strange to mention them here, but the Australian magpies are a bit different to the ones you\u2019ll find in the UK for example. Not only are their colours back to front they are known to be quite vicious. However don\u2019t believe everything you hear about them as magpies are quite intelligent and are even capable of recognising faces. This is not such a great attribute if the magpie decides he doesn\u2019t like you though!\n31. Numbat\nI don\u2019t know why more people haven\u2019t heard of the numbat. They\u2019re native Australian animals (to Western Australia), marsupials and really quite odd looking creatures, although very cute. The numbat resembles an anteater and is in fact known as the banded anteater. They\u2019re endangered due to introduced predators such as cats and foxes so they\u2019re not commonly seen.\n32. Platypus\nAh the platypus, probably one of the strangest animals of Australia and the world. It\u2019s the second egg laying mammal in this list and the oddest looking animal. They look so strange that people originally thought they weren\u2019t real.\n33. Possum\nThere are 23 species of possum in Australia but the common brushtail possum and the common ringtail possum are the ones you\u2019re most likely to see. They\u2019re nocturnal marsupials which happily live in urban areas. Both are about the size of a cat. Male possums are called a Jack, females are known as a Jill and the babies are Joeys.\n34. Pygmy Possum\nA very strong contender for cutest Aussie animal is the pygmy possum. There are 4 different species: Western Pygmy Possum, Eastern Pygmy Possum, Tasmanian (or Little) Pygmy Possum and the Long-tailed Pygmy Possum. They\u2019re tiny! They vary in length from 5cm to only 12cm and that\u2019s from head to tail. They live in trees and help to maintain their own habitat by pollinating it as they\u2019re nectar feeders.\n35. Quokka\nYou made it \u2013 the cutest of all native Australian animals and the happiest creature on the planet. The awesome Quokka! Quokka\u2019s are all over the place on Rottnest Island near Perth in Western Australia and they\u2019re extremely friendly so you just have to go there! Rottnest Island is also a stunning place to visit even if they didn\u2019t have Quokka\u2019s.\n36. Quoll\nHere\u2019s another one of the native Australian animals that I\u2019m surprised more people haven\u2019t heard of because they\u2019re so cute looking. Quoll\u2019s are native to mainland Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea. They spend most of their day in a den and hunt at night. Quoll\u2019s are sadly in decline due to urbanisation and introduced predators. They\u2019re related to the now extinct Thylacine (Tasmanian Tiger).\n37. Snakes\nSnakes are fairly common in Australia and no doubt you\u2019ll be aware that Australia has loads of deadly ones! There are about 140 snake species found in Australia, 32 of which are sea snakes. And although about 100 Australian snakes are venomous only 2 of them could kill you (though it\u2019s highly unlikely!). The ones pictured below are the common tree snake, also known as the yellow-bellied black snake, green tree snake or grass snake. They\u2019re very unlikely to bite, but if they do they aren\u2019t venomous.\n38. Spiders\nOk, I\u2019ll admit it, I\u2019m terrified of spiders but in Australia you will see them, from the massive huntsman which moves disturbingly quickly to the bright red bottom of the redback spider. As you\u2019ll be aware some Aussie spiders can be deadly, but most won\u2019t bother you and even if you are bitten it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll die. Just be careful around these creepy crawlies!\n39. Sugar Glider\nSugar gliders are small marsupials which are fairly common in north and eastern coastal areas. They live in woodlands and glide between the trees at night searching for food.\n40. Tasmanian Devil\nYou look at the cute face of the Tasmanian devil and wonder how on earth it got its name but they\u2019re notorious for their bad temper when they\u2019re defending food, trying to find a mate or when a predator approaches. This carnivorous marsupial is endangered and its population is still decreasing. Sadly they\u2019re suffering with a facial cancer that is contagious.\n41. Thorny Devil\nThe second devil on our list is a glorious looking lizard also known as a thorny dragon. Thorny devils are great at camouflage in the desert and even have a false head to confuse predators. They can also absorb water through any part of their body.\n42. Turtle\nThere\u2019s lots of freshwater and sea turtles that can be seen all around Australia. Heading to The Great Barrier Reef gives you the best chance to swim with wild turtles such as the loggerhead, hawksbill and the rarer green turtle. For an amazing experience head to Bundaberg during turtle hatching season to watch the baby turtles head to the sea for the first time after hatching.\n43. Wallaby\nWallabies are in fact kangaroos but wallaby is the informal name for those that are smaller than the kangaroos mentioned earlier. A group of wallabies is known as a \u2018court\u2019 a \u2018mob\u2019 or a \u2018troupe\u2019, I suppose depending on what they\u2019re up to at the time! Look at that cute face!\n44. Wallaroo\nLike the wallaby a wallaroo is also in the same family as kangaroos. A wallaroo tends to be larger than a wallaby but smaller than a kangaroo.\n45. Water Dragon\nThe Australian water dragon is most commonly found in eastern Australia and very commonly seen in Brisbane. The one pictured below was spotted in Manly near Sydney. Water dragons are semi-aquatic and are therefore found near bodies of water, generally creeks, rivers or lakes with some rocks nearby to hang out on.\n46. Wombat\nWombats are marsupials, but unlike most marsupials their pouch is backwards. They also do square poops. Wombats have strong claws on their short feet and look a bit like a fat gopher. They\u2019re burrowing animals that live across Australia and Tasmania in forests, grasslands and even mountains. Being nocturnal, burrowing animals it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll see any in the wild even though they\u2019re about the size of a medium dog.\n47. Yabby\nYabbies are crayfish (basically small lobsters) that are a very popular seafood in Australia. It\u2019s possible to find marine yabbies and freshwater yabbies. They come in a range of colours including blue, red and yellow. Yabbies can even survive periods of drought for several years by burrowing into riverbeds.\nOut of all the Aussie animals listed which is your favourite and why? What animals of Australia have I missed? I\u2019ll add them in!\nHave you spotted any of Australia\u2019s Big Animals? Like the Giant Koala, or the Big Penguin? No!? Here\u2019s where to find Australia\u2019s Big Things.\nImage copyright info wikimedia commons \u2013 CC BY 1.0, CC BY-SA 2.0, CC BY-SA 2.5, CC BY-SA 3.0, CC BY-SA 4.0"}

There are over 40 species of dolphins, the most common being the Bottlenose dolphin. Did you know these 15 fun facts about dolphins?\nDolphins are found all across the world and are close relatives of whales. Check out the cool facts about these beautiful creatures.\nThey stick with their mothers for a long time\nIt is in the nature of the dolphins to stick with their mothers for a long time before they leave their pack. Some stay with their mothers for 3 or even 8 years!\nDolphins have 2 stomachs\nOne is used for storage of food and the other is used for digestion.\nThey dive up to 1,000 feet\nDolphins are known to be great divers. Being creatures of the sea, they can dive up to 1,000 feet underwater.\nDolphins can live up to 50 years!\nEven though the average lifespan of dolphins is about 17 years, some can even live up to 50 years!\nThere are around 40 species of dolphins\nThere are many types of dolphins, around 40 different species. While the majority of them spend their lives in saltwater, many can survive just fine in freshwater. The smallest of their kind is 3-4 feet long, while the largest is 30 feet!\nDolphins help the sick or injured members\nThese caring creatures are often seen tending to the sick, the old and the injured in their group, which is known as \u2018pod\u2019.\nExtremely intelligent animals\nThey are not only the friendliest or caring creatures but also the most intelligent ones. It is believed by scientists that comparing the ratio size of brain to body, dolphins take the 2nd place right after the humans!\nDolphins never chew their food\nDolphins never chew their food, they swallow it as a whole. Their teeth are used only to catch their prey.\nThey give themselves names\nIt has been proved by scientists that dolphins give themselves names. They develop their own individual whistles and they recognize theirs and other dolphins\u2019 names.\nThey sleep with only half their brain\nWhen they are asleep, one part of their brain remains alert and awake. This keeps them safe from potential predators, and enables them to breathe while sleeping.\nDolphins are very friendly to humans and animals\nThey love to play with members of their pods and are friendly to even humans. They are often seen playing and teasing other animals living underwater.\nKiller whales are the biggest kind of dolphin\nOpposite to their name, Killer Whales belong to the dolphin family. Killer Whales, reaching up to a length of 30 feet, are the biggest of their kind.\nDolphins can migrate if they don\u2019t have enough food\nNot known to many, Dolphins can migrate if their needs of food are not met. Even though they are not migratory animals, they will move to places where they have enough food and the climatic conditions are suitable to their body temperatures.\nThey have delicate skin but heals quickly\nDolphins have very delicate skin, getting injured at the slightest touch of hard surface. However, due to their fast healing attribute, even the deepest of wounds can be healed within a short time.\nSome can swim at 20 miles per hour\nThey can swim at the rate of 3 to 7 miles per hour. Some exceedthat and travel at the speed of 20 miles per hour.\nMeet and swim with dolphins in Cancun or Riviera Maya with Aquaworld\nAquaworld provides many ways through which you can meet, interact and swim with dolphins. You can have a full-day or an hour session with the dolphins in Cancun or Rivera Maya.\nIf you are on a family vacation, then a great way to let the children have fun is to take part in our Dolphin Interactive Program, specially designed for the kids starting from the age of 3.\nBut, if neither of the aforementioned are for you, then do check out our Trainer for a Day program where you can interact with these playful creatures and learn everything about them.\nIn any event swimming with dolphins is really something you would not like to miss on your ideal vacation in Cancun or Riviera Maya!"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Facts about Dolphins Habitat - Animal Good News", "url": "https://animalgoodnews.com/facts-about-dolphins-habitat/", "text": "Dolphins are widely spread all over the world, as they live in many oceans and seas of the planet, except for the Caspian Sea and the Aral Sea.\nMost species are found in temperate and tropical regions, although they can live from the equator to the circumpolar regions. They also live in several major river systems, including the Indus, Ganges, and Amazon.\nObviously, habitat is different for each dolphin species, but generally, these mammals avoid extremely cold waters, so they are not found in polar regions.\nMost of them live in saltwater, but some species thrive in freshwater as well. Dolphin habitats vary depending on environmental factors and food availability. They are intelligent creatures with a high level of intelligence that can change habitats when necessary for survival.\nFor example, common bottlenose dolphins live in all oceans, and they tend to live close to the shoreline. Migration is an important part of the life of some dolphin species. They must migrate to where there is enough food; this is why in some places where dolphins used to be, they either become very scarce or disappear altogether. Even changes in water temperature can cause them to leave the places that once were home to them.\nThe Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, and their seas contain a large number of dolphin species because they have warm waters. Also, some species are distributed over large areas, while others may be endemic exclusively to certain regions of the ocean.\nInteresting Facts About Dolphins Habitat\nThe world\u2019s oceans contain a variety of marine mammals that share the same habitat as dolphins. The warm waters of these regions provide a natural habitat for many species of dolphins. Some dolphins live in coastal areas, while others are found farther offshore. Some are widespread throughout the world, while others are endemic to particular regions. These facts about dolphins\u2019 habitat will help you make informed decisions when planning a vacation.\nCoastal dolphins are found primarily in warm tropical waters, while open ocean species are more likely to migrate farther south. Their small bodies allow them to enter narrow places. While they\u2019re mainly found in coastal regions, many of these species migrate to areas with more food to support their population. However, they\u2019re not endangered and their population is estimated at about 600,000. While their overall numbers are unknown, recent research has revealed that some species live within a relatively small area. These animals are called local residents, and some of them have been found in Georgia and Florida. Also, in southern California and the Gulf of California, South Africa has been identified as residents.\nDolphins breed all year round, and the gestation period can last from nine to 17 months, depending on the species. They generally produce one baby. The mother will often distance herself from the group when she gives birth. During this time, she will often come near the surface of the water. Once the baby is born, the mother will take it to the surface to take its first breath. The newborn calves will nurse for the first two years.\nThe habitat of dolphins is very diverse, ranging from shallow oceans to deep lakes. They live in estuaries, ports, and bays, as well as on the continental shelf. Previously, dolphins were thought to only live in the coastal areas, but recent research has shown they can live in the pelagic zone of the high seas. Regardless of their habitat, these species are extremely fascinating and entertaining to watch.\nCoastal dolphins are generally more adaptable to cold temperatures than their coastal cousins. Coastal dolphins migrate from New Jersey to North Carolina. The coastal populations tend to migrate to areas where there is abundant food. There are two types of habitats: the coastal and the open ocean. Each has different requirements for food and habitat. They both live in the pelagic zone. They prefer warm tropical waters. They migrate between these two locations for different reasons, but they are both important.\nAlthough most species of dolphins live in freshwater, some can survive in both environments. Some of them can be found in many freshwater locations. In the open ocean, the common bottlenose lives in all oceans. These animals usually live near the shore, but they can migrate for different reasons. They may move due to a sudden change in water temperature. A coastal area is also more likely to be a home for coastal dolphins.\nIn the wild, dolphins can live in any area of the world. They can live for up to 60 years. The animals are considered to be highly social animals and will help each other if they encounter an injury. The bottlenose is known to be the most sociable among the species. A river dolphin is pink with a longer snout than its male counterpart. They sleep in the water, often alongside other members of their pod.\nSome dolphin species live in both coastal and open ocean environments. Coastal ones live in warmer, more temperate waters, while inshore ones inhabit the open ocean. Most types of dolphins have a wide range of habitats. Some are found in coastal waters and are also found in rivers. The most common type of inshore bottlenose dolphin lives in rivers. There are more than six species of inshore bottlenose dolphins.\nDolphins mate throughout the year. Gestation lasts nine to 17 months and they typically have one baby. Most of the time, a female will not leave the pod when she gives birth, so she will stay away from the rest of her pod during her pregnancy. The newborn calf will nurse for up to two years and remain with its mother until it reaches the age of three to eight. It is also important to note that dolphins do not reproduce in the same way in the same water."}

This includes taking advantage of others and inflicting harm on creatures.\nOf course, dolphins don't think the way humans do. To them, these dark and disturbing behaviors are likely just fun and normal. They're simply relying on their natural behaviors and instincts in a way that's unsettling for us to comprehend. So, while these facts might ruin your innocent assumptions about dolphins, it's important to remember that they're not \"evil\" in any way.

These rare animals may not look like primates at first glance, but they are related to chimpanzees, apes, and humans.\nColoring and Anatomy\nAye-ayes are dark brown or black and are distinguished by a bushy tail that is larger than their body. They also feature big eyes, slender fingers, and large, sensitive ears. Aye-ayes have pointed claws on all their fingers and toes except for their opposable big toes, which enable them to dangle from branches.\nLife in the Canopy\nAye-ayes spend their lives in rain forest trees and avoid coming down to earth. They are nocturnal, and spend the day curled up in a ball-like nest of leaves and branches. The nests appear as closed spheres with single entry holes, situated in the forks of large trees.\nWhile perched aloft, the aye-aye taps on trees with its long middle finger and listens for wood-boring insect larvae moving under the bark. It employs the same middle finger to fish them out. The digit is also useful for scooping the flesh out of coconuts and other fruits that supplement the animal's insect diet.\nSuperstitions\nMany people native to Madagascar consider the aye-aye an omen of ill luck. For this reason they often have been killed on sight. Such hunting, coupled with habitat destruction, have put aye-aye populations at-risk. Today they are protected by law."}

They have rounded foreheads and no dorsal fin.\nSocial Behavior\nBelugas generally live together in small groups known as pods. They are social animals and very vocal communicators that employ a diversified language of clicks, whistles, and clangs. Belugas can also mimic a variety of other sounds.\nPopulation Range and Migration\nThese whales are common in the Arctic Ocean's coastal waters, though they are found in subarctic waters as well. Arctic belugas migrate southward in large herds when the sea freezes over. Animals trapped by Arctic ice often die, and they are prey for polar bears, killer whales, and for Arctic people. They are hunted by indigenous people of the north, and by commercial fisheries that brought some populations, such as those in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, to near collapse.\nBeluga feed on fish, crustaceans, and worms. The whale is related to the tusked \u201cunicorn\u201d whale known as the narwhal. The beluga is not related to the sturgeon of the same name, which has been heavily fished for its famous caviar.\n1:25"}

Fish are supplemented by crustaceans, snakes, and other river creatures.\nGiant Otter Families\nGiant otters live in family groups which include monogamous parents and the offspring from several breeding seasons. They den by burrowing into banks or under fallen logs, and establish a home territory that they will aggressively defend.\nLike most other otter species, giant otters come ashore to give birth. Females retreat to their underground dens and deliver litters of one to six young. Young otters remain in the den for a month but grow up quickly.

They live in all the earth\u2019s oceans, at depths ranging from the tide line to 15,000 feet. Because they cannot swim, they live on the sea floor. Their main defense against more agile predators like eels and otters is their hard, spiny test, or shell.\n3 Sea Urchin Facts\nSecret weapon: The carrier crab uses a sea urchin like a suit of armor for extra protection from predators.\nThe carrier crab uses a sea urchin like a suit of armor for extra protection from predators. Five-fold symmetry: The bodies of mature sea urchins contain five symmetrical sections unlike mammals, which have two.\nThe bodies of mature sea urchins contain five symmetrical sections unlike mammals, which have two. Shy of the spotlight: They have no detectable eyes, but experts suspect its entire body is a compound eye that is sensitive to light.\nSea Urchin Classification and Scientific Name\nSea urchins are in the Echinodermata phylum. The scientific name is Echinoidia, which is also the name of their class. They are in the Camarodonta order and some belong to the Echinidae family. This family contains genera including Strongylocentrotus and Lytechinus.\nSea Urchin Species\nSome of the more interesting types of the 950 species include:\nStrongylocentrotus purpuratus, the Pacific purple sea urchin, is a key ingredient in uni sushi.\nThe inky black Diadema sea urchin helps keep Caribbean coral reefs health by keeping plant growth down.\nToxopneustes pileolus, whose common name is flower urchin, is among the most toxic. It inhabits the warm oceans of the Western Indo-Pacific region.\nThe giant red sea urchin, or Mesocentrotus franciscanus, is the largest species, with their test averaging about 18 centimeters (seven inches) across and spines eight centimeters (three inches) in length. It inhabits the coastal Pacific waters of North America.\nHeterocentrotus mamillatus, the slate pencil urchin, lives in tropical Indo-Pacific oceans. It has stubby spines with rounded, striped ends that can bore into rock.\nEchinarachnius parma, known by the common names of sand dollar, sea cookie or pansy shell, is a flat sea urchin that has short spines called cilia for burrowing into the sand. It lives in seas throughout the Northern Hemisphere.\nThe green sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, is one of the 18 edible species. Processors harvest the gonads, glands within the shell, primarily for use in Japanese uni sushi. Green sea urchins live in Northern Atlantic waters.\nSea Urchin Appearance\nSea urchins are small sea animals that have spherical tests, or shells, that are typically covered in spines similar to those of a porcupine. Very small tube-shaped feet among the spines help them move slowly along the ocean floor. They come in just about every color, from black to white, red, orange, green, brown, purple, pink, yellow, blue and gray. They range in size from about an inch in diameter up to 14 inches. On average, they weigh about one pound.\nBecause there are nearly one thousand types of sea urchins, these animals can vary significantly in appearance. You can easily identify most of them by their spiny exteriors, but some, like sand dollars, have only short hairs all over their bodies. Others, like pencil sea urchins, have rounded-off spines that are not sharp like typical urchin spines.\nHotFlash/Shutterstock.com\nSea Urchin Distribution, Population and Habitat\nSea urchins live in oceans throughout the world. Arctic or tropic, shoreline or deepest sea trenches, you can find them there. Because they cannot swim, the ocean floor is their home. Some, like the shingle urchin, live in the shallows near beaches where the sun shines. Others, like the ones in the Pourtaleslidae family, live so deep below the surface they are in total darkness.\nBarren underwater areas have dense populations of these creatures, and populations nearer to the shore are the densest by far. While they live throughout the world, the greatest numbers live in temperate and tropical ocean habitats in the shallows up to ten meters down where the plants they eat are plentiful.\nWith so many types and such a wide-ranging habitat, it is impossible to know for sure. However, a recent marine study in Oregon estimated that the purple species population on just one coastal reef numbered around 350 million, a figure that represented a 10,000-fold increase in just a few years, putting them in a least concern conservation category. Researchers attributed the exponential expansion of this Pacific coast class of urchins to a marine ecosystem that is out of balance.\nMeanwhile, in the Mediterranean, the purple sea urchin population is currently in a near threatened state. Factors that have decimated the species include warming sea temperatures and invasive fish that eat algae, depriving the urchins of a diet staple. Again, the underlying cause is an imbalance in the ecosystem.\nHowever, scarcity of food does not necessarily mean the species is headed for extinction. Purple urchins can go dormant and survive with no food for years at a time. With such extraordinary persistence, these populations may ebb but they also flow.\nSea Urchin Predators and Prey\nDespite their inborn resiliency, sea urchins are subject to threats from disease as well as predators. A 1981 bacterial disease nearly wiped out the Hemicentrotus pulcherimus and Pseudocentrotus depressus species in Japan. Bald sea urchin disease, another bacterial illness, threatens some sea urchin populations, causing the animals\u2019 spines to fall out and leaving them defenseless against predators.\nWhat Eats Sea Urchin?\nShellfish like crabs and lobsters are among these creatures\u2019 natural predators. Triggerfish and wrasse are two fish that prey on them. The wolf eel is specially equipped to hunt and eat those in the Northern Hemisphere. Sea otters in regions like British Columbia help maintain ecological balance by keeping urchins from overpopulating.\nAlthough they are slow-moving, sea urchins do have some means of protecting themselves. Their sharp spines are often enough to discourage some predators. A few urchin species are venomous too.\nWhat Do Sea Urchin Eat?\nSea urchin mainly eat marine vegetation like algae and kelp. The also prey on sessile, or immobile, sea creatures such as coral and sea sponges.\nSea Urchin Reproduction and Lifespan\nFemales of the species produce eggs. Most release these eggs into the sea for fertilization by the sperm that males have released. The females of a few species hold their eggs among their spines rather than let them float freely.\nOnce fertilization occurs, it takes only about 12 hours for the egg to become an embryo. Soon thereafter, the embryo becomes a larva with cilia that can collect microscopic food to nurture its growth. It takes several months for the larva to transform into a fully developed sea urchin. It will grow for a few more years to reach adulthood. Depending on the species, they live a number of years. For example, the purple species has a life expectancy of around 20 years.\nSea Urchins in Fishing and Cooking\nIn many international cuisines, from Alaska to New Zealand, the gonads, or roe, are a delicacy. Typically, people eat them raw with lemon juice or olive oil. In other regions, chefs incorporate the roe in gourmet sauces, omelettes and soups.\nThe Japanese enjoy the roe in uni sushi. They consume about 50,000 tons of urchin roes per year, which amounts to approximately 80 percent of the world\u2019s commercially processed supply.\nView all 180 animals that start with S"}

Critically endangered LC NT VU EN CR EW EX Least Concern Extinct Current Population Trend : Increasing\nBoth black and white rhinoceroses are actually gray. They are different not in color but in lip shape. The black rhino has a pointed upper lip, while its white relative has a squared lip. The difference in lip shape is related to the animals' diets. Black rhinos are browsers that get most of their sustenance from eating trees and bushes. They use their lips to pluck leaves and fruit from the branches. White rhinos graze on grasses, walking with their enormous heads and squared lips lowered to the ground.\nBehavior\nExcept for females and their offspring, black rhinos are solitary. Females reproduce only every two and a half to five years. Their single calf does not live on its own until it is about three years old.\nBlack rhinos feed at night and during the gloaming hours of dawn and dusk. Under the hot African sun, they take cover by lying in the shade. Rhinos are also wallowers. They often find a suitable water hole and roll in its mud, coating their skin with a natural bug repellent and sun block.\nRhinos have sharp hearing and a keen sense of smell.

Females use their horns to protect their young, while males use them to battle attackers.\nThe prominent horn for which rhinos are so well known has also been their downfall. Many animals have been killed for the hard, hairlike growth, which is revered for medicinal uses in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. The horn is also valued in North Africa and the Middle East as an ornamental dagger handle.\nThe black rhino once roamed most of sub-Saharan Africa, but today is on the verge of extinction due to poaching fueled by commercial demand for its horn."}

These magnificent marine mammals rule the oceans at up to 100 feet long and upwards of 200 tons. Their tongues alone can weigh as much as an elephant. Their hearts, as much as an automobile.\nDiet of krill\nBlue whales reach these mind-boggling dimensions on a diet composed nearly exclusively of tiny shrimplike animals called krill. During certain times of the year, a single adult blue whale consumes about 4 tons of krill a day.\nBlue whales are baleen whales, which means they have fringed plates of fingernail-like material, called baleen, attached to their upper jaws. The giant animals feed by first gulping an enormous mouthful of water, expanding the pleated skin on their throat and belly to take it in. Then the whale's massive tongue forces the water out through the thin, overlapping baleen plates. Thousands of krill are left behind\u2014and then swallowed.\nColoring and appearance\nBlue whales look true blue underwater, but on the surface their coloring is more a mottled blue-gray. Their underbellies take on a yellowish hue from the millions of microorganisms that take up residence in their skin. The blue whale has a broad, flat head and a long, tapered body that ends in wide, triangular flukes.\nVocalization and behavior\nBlue whales live in all the world's oceans, except the Arctic, occasionally swimming in small groups but usually alone or in pairs. They often spend summers feeding in polar waters and undertake lengthy migrations towards the Equator as winter arrives.\nThese graceful swimmers cruise the ocean at more than five miles an hour, but accelerate to more than 20 miles an hour when they are agitated. Blue whales are among the loudest animals on the planet. They emit a series of pulses, groans, and moans, and it\u2019s thought that, in good conditions, blue whales can hear each other up to 1,000 miles away. Scientists think they use these vocalizations not only to communicate, but, along with their excellent hearing, to sonar-navigate the lightless ocean depths.\nBlue whale calves\nCalves enter the world already ranking among the planet's largest creatures. After about a year inside its mother's womb, a baby blue whale emerges weighing up to 3 tons and stretching to 25 feet. It gorges on nothing but mother's milk and gains about 200 pounds every day for its first year.\nLongevity\nBlue whales are among Earth's longest-lived animals. Scientists have discovered that by counting the layers of a deceased whale's waxlike earplugs, they can get a close estimate of the animal's age. The oldest blue whale found using this method was determined to be around 110 years old. Average lifespan is estimated at around 80 to 90 years.\nConservation\nAggressive hunting in the 1900s by whalers seeking whale oil drove them to the brink of extinction. Between 1900 and the mid-1960s, some 360,000 blue whales were slaughtered. They finally came under protection with the 1966 International Whaling Commission, but they've managed only a minor recovery since then.\nBlue whales have few predators but are known to fall victim to attacks by sharks and killer whales, and many are injured or die each year from impacts with large ships."}

Its liver accounts for a quarter (or about 25% of its body mass). For comparison, the human liver accounts for 2% of body mass! This large liver helps skate fish stay near the ocean floor.\nThorn-like defense: While stingrays utilize a barbed tail for defense, the body of skates is made of a \u201cthorn-like\u201d material that helps defend them.\n\u201cMermaid pouches:\u201d Unlike stingrays which have live births, skates lay eggs. The pouches that contain these eggs are called \u201cmermaid pouches\u201d and can commonly be found washed up on beaches across the world!\nSkate Fish Classification and Scientific Name\nSkate fish are cartilaginous fish that are part of the class Chondrichthyes, which also includes sharks, rays, and chimeras. While fish in this class lack bones, and thus leave behind limited fossil evidence, it\u2019s believed modern skates began evolving during the Jurassic Period (200 to 145 million years ago).\nSkate fish belong to the Rajiformes, which contain more than 200 species spread across four families. Other families include smooth skates, softnose skates, and pygmy skates.\nThe largest skate fish family is Rajidae, which as of late 2020 contains 159 described species spread out across 16 genera. An example of a specific skate species\u2019 scientific name would be the big skate, which is named Raja binocular.\nWhile approximately 159 species have been identified in Rajidae as of late 2020, knowledge of skates taxonomy continues to grow. With these bottom-dwellers often living to depths of up to 8,900 feet, new species and genera may continue to be discovered in the years to come.\nIn fact, during the past decade (2011 to 2020), six new species of skates were discovered!\nSkate Fish Species\nMost skate fish species have relatively narrow geographic regions. For example, there are eight different skate fish species that are endemic (only found in) the water surrounding New Zealand.\nSome notable skate fish species include:\nBig skate: Found from Baja California all the way into Alaska, the big skate is one of the largest species of skates and can reach 8 feet in length and 200 pounds.\nDeepsea skate: A species of skate that lives at the bottom of continental slopes and has been discovered living at depths reaching reaching 8,900 feet!\nArctic skate: A skate with a wide geographic distribution and lives in cold waters off Greenland and the frigid waters off Antarctica.\nCommon skate: contrary to its name, the common skate is now critically endangered.\nSkate Fish Appearance and Anatomy\nSkate fish species can possess extremely unique body shapes, colors, and even sizes! While big skate have reached 8 feet in length and weigh up to 200 pounds, most skate fish species measure less than 3 feet and weigh in at 10 pounds or less.\nA Cotton Photo/Shutterstock.com\nWith approximately 200 species, skate fish appearance can vary dramatically. The most common color is a \u201cbrownish\u201d tint that helps the species blend in with the bottom of the ocean, however certain skate species have dots or other markings. In addition, skates tend to have more of a \u2018diamond\u2019 or even circular body shape than stingrays, which tend to have longer and more pronounced \u2018wings\u2019 on their sides.\nSkate Fish vs. Stringrays\nSkates and rays look very similar, but have key differences that set them apart into different families.\nEggs vs. live births: Skates produce eggs that they place in a protective pouch known as a \u201cmermaid pouch\u201d whereas ray species have live births of offspring.\nDifferent tails: Rays have sharp barbs at the end of their tails that are used for defense. Skate tails lack this barb, and they instead use \u201cthorn-like\u201d skin as their main defense against predators.\nDorsal fins: Skates generally have either one or two dorsal fins (fins used for stabilization). Rays either lack dorsal fins or have small remnant fins.\nSize: Skates are generally smaller than rays. The largest ray species \u2014 the giant manta ray \u2014 can reach a wingspan of 29 feet and weight 3,600 pounds. Compare that to the largest skate species which weighs only about 200 pounds!\nBeyond these differences, rays and skate fish also have key differences in their teeth and habitat (skates generally prefer living in deeper waters).\nSkate Fish Distribution and Habitat\nSkate fish are found in oceans across the world. Different skate species inhabit environments that range from the shallow mouths of river deltas all the way to outer continental shelves that can reach 8,900 feet in depth. However, the majority of skate species live at depths that are further out than rays.\nSkates are found in both cold and temperate climates. Species can be found near the equator all the way to off Antarctica in the Southern Hemisphere and Greenland in the Norther hemisphere. As skate fish lay on ocean floors, they breath through spiracles which are positioned behind their eyes. These specially evolved opening allow skate fish to breath oxygenated water while buried in sand near the ocean floor.\nSkate Fish Reproduction, Eggs, and Lifespan\nSkate fish reproduce with eggs that are placed in \u201cmermaid pouches.\u201d\nMermaid pouches are made of collagen proteins and give skate eggs additional protection from predators on the bottom of the oceans. Skate embryos generally live in these pouches for about 3 months (12 weeks) before breaking free. Adolescents grow to about double the size of the pouch (generally about 4\u2033 to 6\u2033) by the time they\u2019re ready to leave its protection.\nAs skates mostly live in deeper environments and are difficult to observe, it\u2019s a challenge estimating their exact longevity. However, scientists have placed the common skate fish\u2019s lifespan at 50 to 100 years (Luna, 2009; Dulvy et al., 2006; Neal et al., 2008). Other species may live for shorter periods. For example, estimates of Winter skate lifespan are listed at about 20 years.\nThis long lifespan of some skate fish species means it can take 10 or more years to reach maturity, which can make repopulation challenging. Most skate species lay many eggs (common skates will lay approximately 40), but few of these eggs will lead to skate fish that reaches maturity.\nSkate Fish in Cooking\nMany skate fish species are abundant and often caught as \u2018byproduct\u2019 by trawlers. Traditionally, skate fish haven\u2019t been cooked nearly as commonly as other fish species in the home, but its use in cooking is growing.\nOne of the challenges of cooking skate fish is that like other cartilaginous fish (like sharks), skates carry urea in their tissues. This can lead to an ammonia\u2013like taste when not prepared properly. Most skate that carries this unpleasant odor is the result of poor storage and mishandling.\nSkate is now found on the menu at Michelin starred restaurants like New York City\u2019s Le Bernardin. In addition, skate fish is seen as a delicacy in other cultures under different preparations. In South Korea, the city of Mokpo has become famous for its skate dishes, which has a \u2018pungent\u2019 odor that results from fermenting the fish.\nSkate Fish Conservation Status\nMost species of skate fish are considered abundant, however trawling has led to a decrease in the estimated biomass of a number of skate species.\nThe common skate is now listed as critically endangered, and is offered protections in the European Union. In the United States, the population of thorny skates is declining, but in 2017 the fisheries service ruled it didn\u2019t warrant protections under the Endangered Species Act. Although the species\u2019 numbers are declining, the final report on its status noted thorny skate populations are still estimated to number in the hundreds of millions.\nView all 180 animals that start with S"}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Coyote images!\n\u201cThe coyote is one of the most common species of mammals in North America\u201d\nCoyotes are animals that have traditionally served many different roles in human culture simultaneously as a pest and a mystical creature with various magical attributes. Their melancholic howls at night have seized the human imagination for many thousands of years. Although still hunted in large numbers, this nocturnal species has adapted to modern human societies and thrived as never before.\nIncredible Coyote Facts!\nAlternate names for this species include the prairie wolf and the brush wolf.\nThe coyote was an important figure in North American folklore. It was often viewed as a symbol of craftiness and deceit, sometimes donning various guises to trick people. In Mesoamerica, it was a cosmological symbol of military strength.\nCoyotes are incredibly mobile animals that will roam around their natural territory for several miles every day. If they are facing stiff competition for food and resources, then it may travel more than a hundred miles in search of a new home.\nCoyotes are animals that are agile on both land and water, but they are relatively poor climbers.\nCoyote Scientific Name\nThe scientific name of the coyote is Canis latrans. The rough Latin translation of this term is barker or barking dog. The actual name coyote was adapted by the Spanish from the Nahuatl word (the language of the Aztecs) for the animal in Mesoamerica.\nThere are 19 recognized types, all varying by the geographic range and physical appearance. These types include the plains -, Mexican -, Honduras -, northern -, California Valley coyote and many more. The coyote belongs to the same genus as the wolves, dogs, dingos, and jackals. More distantly, it is part of the same family, Canidae, as the foxes and raccoon dogs.\nCoyote Appearance and Behavior\nThe coyote has a lean, wolf-like appearance with yellow eyes, a floppy tail, and very large ears in relation to body size. The luxurious coat consists of soft under fur and longer, tougher outer hairs. This fur has an unusual mixture of color: gray, brown, and almost yellow on the upper parts of the body, white around the stomach and throat, and red-brown around the muzzle and feet. The exact color of the fur may vary based on the geographical range of the subspecies in question. These animals shed around once a year in the summer, replacing its fur with an entirely new coat.\nThe typical coyote measures up to 37 inches long from the head to the rear end, plus another 16 inches along the tail. The entire body weighs up to 50 pounds, although females are slightly smaller on average than males. The coyote is about the same size as a medium dog like the bearded collie.\nOne interesting fact about their behavior is a highly fluid social arrangement. Although large packs are not usually the norm, this species does seek out comfort and cooperation in pairs or family units with established dominance hierarchies. This very plastic and changeable social behavior means that the coyote is comfortable hunting alone or with the pack. If it hunts with the pack, then they may target larger animals that require teamwork to bring down.\nIn order to communicate, the coyote has a truly massive repertoire of sounds, body language, and scent signals. It is believed to be one of the most vocal mammals in all of North America. These vocalizations serve as a way to signal alarm, convey a greeting, or announce the animal\u2019s presence to other members of the pack. These animals sounds much like a dog or wolf with an array of different barks, howls, and growls.\nCoyotes demonstrate aggression with an arched back and a threatening growl. This show of strength is particularly important when fighting with other members for dominance within the pack. On the other hand, a low body posture and yelping sounds can also signal submission to a more dominant member.\nScent is another important aspect of their communication. The species has a specialized gland located right around the tail as a signaling device to other members. The coyote will also mark its territories on rocks, bushes, or other objects.\nThe coyotes is a highly intelligent and resourceful animal. Unlike dogs, they probably lack the ability to follow human commands. But their cleverness has been a much remarked upon feature for many centuries, and modern studies suggest that coyotes are capable of planning out hunting strategies in advance.\nBecause of their long claws, they are very good diggers, and yet they prefer to find abandoned dens, usually created by badgers, woodchucks, or other animals, and then enlarge it. These burrows provide homes and a natural base for their hunting range for years at a time. Coyotes are nocturnal hunters that sleep during the day and come out at night. Their most active hours are the late evening and early morning.\nWarren Metcalf/Shutterstock.com\nCoyote vs. Wolf\nThe main difference between these species is their size. The coyote is much smaller than a wolf, which can easily measure 4 to 6 feet and weigh well over 100 pounds, depending on the sex. The coyote is also less likely to form large packs. However, they generally exhibit the same degree of intelligence. Sometimes you can tell the difference just through vocalizations. The coyotes will make a frequently yipping sound for which they\u2019re well-known.\nCoyote Evolution\nBased on fossil evidence, the evolution of coyotes probably occurred within the last million years or so. By comparison, the evolution of modern humans occurred sometime around 150,000 to 200,000 years ago. It is believed that modern coyotes appeared sometime after the latest extinction of large animals during the ice age. Forced to compete with wolves, they may have adapted by becoming smaller in size.\nBecause of their genetic similarities, coyotes are capable of producing viable hybridizations with wolves and even domesticated dogs. These hybrids, sometimes called a coywolf or coydog, are relatively rare in the wild because of the few opportunities to mate with other species. Some of the reasons for this rare hybridization may include differences in geographical range, different breeding seasons, and hostility between species in the wild.\nCoyote Habitat\nThe coyote has an extensive range across most of North America, from as far south as Panama to as far north as Canada and Alaska, though it occurs in greatest density across the Great Plains. This highly adaptable animal has evolved to live in mountains, swamps, forests, plains, deserts, and even tropical rainforests. As coyotes become even more common, they have learned to live alongside humans in urban and suburban settings. The range sometimes overlaps with wolves, but as wolf populations have fallen, these animals have benefited by taking over these ranges.\nCoyote Diet\nMany people don\u2019t know that the coyote is an omnivorous species. The vast majority of this animal\u2019s diet consists of small mammals such as rabbits, squirrels, and mice, plus sometimes large mammals such as deer. The rest of the diet consists of birds, snakes, insects, and even sometimes fruits and vegetables. These animals play an important ecological role by keeping these abundant animal populations in check. However, this can be problematic to local wildlife diversity if coyotes hunt down threatened species.\nCoyotes prefer to hunt live animals, sometimes relying on the teamwork of the pack and sometimes sneaking up on prey alone, but they certainly won\u2019t pass up a feast of dead carrion when available. Some coyotes have learned how to cleverly eat human food or leftover garbage.\nCoyote Predators and Threats\nBecause of its size, speed, and ferociousness, the coyote only has a few natural predators in the wild. Wolves, bears, cougars, alligators, and other large predators have been known to prey on them, but the coyote is rarely their first choice of prey. It\u2019s easier for predators to opportunistically pick off a young, aging, or wounded coyote than an adult one.\nMore commonly, these animals face stiff competition from bears, wolves, and big cats for space and food. They can easily be muscled out of prime hunting locations by dint of their smaller size compared with the largest apex predators. This is not helped by the fact that the diet of coyotes and wolves often converge.\nLike all species, these animals are affected by human activity. Hunting is probably the most potent threat to the coyotes\u2019 survival. According to National Geographic, humans kill approximately 400,000 coyotes a year. Many of these deaths occur as a result of retaliation following a coyote attack on livestock such as sheep and cattle. These animals are also commonly hunted for sport or fur.\nCoyote Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nThe coyote\u2019s breeding season usually lasts for a short period of time between January and March of every year. Males and females may pair up for several years at a time, though not always for life. The female is only in heat for a few days of the year, so they have a short span of time to produce offspring.\nAfter carrying her pups for approximately two months, the female will give birth to about six pups on average within the confines of the den. The maximum litter size is an astounding 19 pups. Because the young are born small, blind, and almost completely helpless, both parents play a role in feeding and caring for the children, though the mother is responsible for most nursing duties. It takes slightly more than a month to fully wean the pups, after which they are fed regurgitated food by the parents.\nThe young coyotes will achieve full independence from their parents around six to nine months of life. Males will often wander off to find their own fortune, but females will remain with the pack for much longer, sometimes helping to raise and feed the subsequent young. These animals reach their full size and sexual maturity within their first year. The typical coyote can live up to 10 years in the wild and 18 or 20 years in captivity. Hunting, disease, and car accidents are common killers of the coyote.\nCoyote Population\nAccording to the IUCN Red List, which tracks the conservation status of many known animals, the coyote is a species of least concern. Despite the number of coyotes hunted and killed every year, population numbers are actually increasing throughout most of their natural range. This is because these animals have adapted extraordinarily well to human civilization. The depletion of local wolf, bear, and cougar number may have also helped boost coyote numbers. However, the exact population numbers are not fully estimated.\nCoyotes in the Zoo\nThe coyote is a very common sight in American zoos. The Minnesota Zoo contains a coyote den along its Minnesota Trail. The Akron Zoo showcases coyotes in the Grizzly Ridge near the red wolves and grizzly bears. And the Jacksonville Zoo has coyotes at the Wild Florida exhibit. Coyotes are also found at the Cameron Park Zoo in Waco, Texas, and the Buttonwood Park Zoo in New Bedford, Massachusetts.\nView all 153 animals that start with C"}

They have coarse and short hair and are known to be social animals. They can survive in captivity for about 11.5 years.\nThe males and females live in their separate groups and come together to mate after which the babies live with their mothers in the group of females.\nThe Xerus has four subspecies \u2013 cape ground squirrel, striped ground squirrel, mountain ground squirrel, and unstriped ground squirrel.\nThese animals are diurnal and are usually known to be herbivores in nature and usually eat nuts, roots, and seeds. However, sometimes they also eat eggs and other small animals.\n5 Amazing Xerus Facts\nMature male Xerus are animals that like to form their own groups, which are separate from the females. These groups often consist of about 20 members each.\nThese squirrels are not known to hide food like other squirrels. Instead, they go out hunting for food daily and don\u2019t keep steady storage.\nThey don\u2019t live in trees, creating more comfortable habitats in burrows in the desert.\nThese squirrels mate throughout the year, rather than during a single season. The males and females have multiple mating partners.\nThe female Xerus live in groups of one to four with their babies, also known as pups.\nXerus Scientific Name\nCommonly known as the Xerus, these animals go by the scientific name of Xerus erythropus and belong to the family Sciuridae and phylum Chordate. They come from the Mammalia animal class.\nThe Xerus has four subspecies. The first, the cape ground squirrel (scientific name: Xerus inauris), primarily lives in South Africa, Botswana, and Namibia, seeking out drier areas to call home. The striped ground squirrel (scientific name: Xerus erythropus), however, is found primarily in the southwestern area of Morocco, Mauritania, and Senegal.\nThe mountain ground squirrel (scientific name: Xerus Princeps) lives in the western region of South Africa and Namibia, as well as the southwestern side of Angola. Finally, the unstriped ground squirrel (scientific name: Xerus rutilus) can be found in the grasslands, woodlands, and rocky areas of the northeastern areas of both Sudan and Tanzania.\nXerus Appearance and Behavior\nThese squirrels are covered in fur from head to toe which is often the light-brownish color of the soil. However, it can also be found in reddish-grey or yellowish-grey fur. However, their feet have relatively lesser hair than the rest of their bodies. While the pads of their feet have minimum to no hair, the foot itself has some hair.\nIn the case of the striped ground squirrel, the body has a white stripe running on both sides and shoulders. The tail is usually flat and is a darker shade than the body fur. The ears of the animal are usually small and the claws are long and curved. However, these claws do not allow the creature to climb trees.\nTheir height can be anywhere between 17 to 18 inches, excluding the tail. The tail is about 7.5 to 10.2 inches long, making it approximately one-third of the Xerus\u2019 full length. However, the size of the squirrel usually and mostly depends on the subspecies in question as all four could have some differences.\nThey usually weigh about 14 ounces. These squirrels use their tails as protection from the scorching heat.\nThe Xerus is known to be a social animal who lives in groups. Adult males form their groups that have around 19 to 20 members each. Females, on the other hand, usually live in a group of one to four along with their offspring.\nClose-up of Xerus eating a seed\nXerus Habitat\nThe Xerus are known to live in open areas, especially woodland, desert, or grassland. However, they can be found throughout Africa. One of the subspecies even makes its home in rocky regions, including the mountains.\nWhile they are terrestrial, their diurnal habits allow them to explore much of the area that they reside in for food.\nThough many other squirrels and similar animals are known to live in trees, Xerus make their home in burrows instead. To find any of these animals in the wild, check out certain areas of the desert in South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, and Botswana. The squirrels are not known to migrate, so the odds of seeing one are fairly high.\nXerus Diet\nXerus dines on a variety of foods like nuts, roots, and seeds. The cape ground squirrel particularly likes shrubs and bulbs as well. They also will consume yams, cotton, cassava, peanuts, and sweet potatoes when they find them. Though the Xerus is primarily an herbivore, there are several animal-based sources of protein that they will seek out during their diurnal treks for food. When available and needed, their diet will also consist of insects, eggs, and small animals (in small amounts).\nXerus Predators and Threats\nLike all the other animals, Xerus also eat and are eaten by other living creatures, holding their own in the food chain. The largest threat to the life of Xerus is the jackal, though the black-backed jackal seeks it out the most. Xerus is also pursued by snakes, lizards, and the puff adder.\nXerus is known to be a fast animal, which is necessary to beat the animals that prey on them. However, it is unclear how quickly that they may move, since their quick sprints are often short-lived.\nOn another front, the industrial activities that humans carry out also pose a threat to the lives of Xerus as it may lead to the degeneration of their natural habitat. The Xerus population is plenty around the globe and the IUCN has declared it as \u201cnot extinct.\u201d\nXerus Reproduction, Babies and Lifespan\nThere is no known breeding period in the case of Xerus. However, the male and female Xerus mate throughout the year despite having only single mating partners. It is said that they sometimes give birth through July and October. The gestation period in Xerus is about 48 days after which the young ones are weaned for about 52 days.\nFemale Xerus reach sexual maturity at 10 months of age while the sexual maturity in males usually happens when they are eight months old. The female Xerus can breed all year long, but very few of them produce more than one little annually. Usually, females produce about one to three babies per litter.\nThe babies that are called pups are born hairless, with their eyes closed. They are known to open their eyes around 35 days of age and are looked after by their mothers for about 45 days. The pups are known to reach adulthood at about 150 to 153 days.\nWhile in captivity, the Xerus can survive up to 11.5 years, but there are no known records of their lifespan in the wild.\nXerus Population\nVery little is known about the population of these animals. However, there are enough African ground squirrels and the IUCN has declared them as \u2018not extinct\u2019.\nView all 3 animals that start with X"}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Hamster images!\nHamsters are small-sized rodents. They are very commonly kept as house pets. However, unlike other rodents, they have short tails.\nTheir legs are stubby with widely-spaced feet, and their ears are small. Hamsters are found in a variety of colors using grey, yellow, black, white, brown, golden, and red. They exist in a mixture of several colors. They are usually 2 to 6 inches long and weigh about 6.2 oz on average.\nThere are several types of hamsters including dwarf hamster, golden dwarf, Syrian hamster which are also known as the teddy bear hamster. They go by the scientific name Cricetinae.\nIncredible Hamster Facts!\nHamsters make good house pets because they are very gentle and are said to take care of. Some common names of pet hamsters include Cheeks, Chomper, Chewy, Harry, and Fuzzy.\nHamsters bite when they are scared or are disturbed during their sleep time.\nHamsters have very poor eyesight, and their feet are wide apart.\nTheir teeth keep growing all the time and are short only because they keep chewing on things.\nHamster mothers are very protective and keep their babies in pouches inside their mouths if they sense danger.\nHamster Scientific Name\nHamsters go by the scientific name Cricetinae. They belong to the kingdom Animalia and Phylum Chordata and the class is Mammalia. The hamsters belong to order Rodentia and suborder Myomorpha.\nThe family is Cricetidae and the subfamily is Cricetinae. The lower classification of the hamsters includes the subphylum which is Vertebrata. Meanwhile, the superfamily is Murodiea.\nThe name Cricetinae can be broken down into two words \u2013 cricetus and -inae (a suffix). Cricetus is rooted in New Latin, though it may come from the Czech word \u201ck\u0159e\u010dek.\u201d\nHamster Appearance\nHamsters are small rodents that have stout bodies. Their legs are stubby and stocky legs, and their ears are small. Hamsters have short tails that are even shorter than the length of their bodies. Their ears are furry, and their feet are wide.\nThough most species have fairly similar bodies, each one has identifying markings and sizes that determine which species they are. The dwarf hamster, much like their name, is a very tiny rodent. They are about 2 to 4 inches long.\nOn the other hand, the Syrian hamster is quite different. It also referred to as a teddy bear hamster or golden hamster, growing to approximately 6 inches long as an adult. On average, a hamster weighs about 6.2 ounces, making it rather small with very little muscle.\nIn general, hamsters have thick and silky fur, and it could be long or short depending from hamster to hamster. This fur comes in a variety of colors, including black, grey, yellow, red, brown, and white. Some hamsters also have fur that is a blend of several different colors, but the combination will be determined by the breed.\nThese rodents have a scent gland that is located in the middle of their bodies. In the case of a dwarf hamster, the scent gland is located in the hamster\u2019s stomach, allowing them to mark their territory. However, the Syrian hamster (aka the teddy bear hamster) has scent glands on their hips instead.\nInterestingly, hamsters have a natural way to get out of trouble when they need to escape \u2013 their skeletons. The flexibility of their rib cage allows them to flatten their body under small crevices. Anyone that owns such a pet will need to have a secure cage to keep them from escaping.\nAn13nA/Shutterstock.com\nHamster Behavior\nMost wild hamsters are active during dusk time and night and need plenty of space to play at night time. Some of them can easily run up to 5 miles during this time. When hamsters are kept as pets, they maintain this natural routine.\nTheir waking hours take up the nighttime, whether in the wild or in captivity, which means that they are awake during the night. They prefer to be undisturbed, so wild hamsters will avoid other wildlife and people during this time. Any unwarranted disturbance in their sleep could very well lead to a bite from these tiny rodents.\nThey survive best in rooms where the lights are not kept on till very late. In the wild, many hamsters dig burrows, and several others are solitary creatures, which is why they need plenty of areas to conceal themselves. Wild hamsters hibernate during the cold weather months. These rodents get up during their hibernation periods only to eat occasionally.\nA loner hamster, it is said, should never be put in a cage with other hamsters as it can bite and harm it and, in some cases, even kill it. The only time that these animals are especially friendly towards other hamsters when they are young (i.e., under three months old). They will even eat their young if they so desire.\nThe dwarf hamster is an exception. They are surprisingly social, and they enjoy having multiple friends around in their family.\nIn captivity, hamsters can sometimes flinch, grimace, and raises its hand towards the owners. This simple motion is an indication that the hamster may be ready to attack, showing exactly how they feel about the person infiltrating their safe space.\nIf a human earns the trust of a hamster as a pet, the animal will gently move towards their hand and even crawl into it. They are fairly expressive animals, and there will be no doubt how they feel about their owner or surrounding animals.\nHamster Habitat\nThe first of this small rodent was found in Syria. However, they are also found in Belgium, northern China, Romania, and Greece. In the wild, hamsters prefer living in warm and dry areas. They like living in steppes, edges of deserts, and sand dunes.\nHamsters have also become an incredibly popular pet, and there are many toys and hideaways that can be added to their home to recreate their natural surroundings.\nHamster Diet\nThe primary diet of Hamsters includes seeds, nuts, grains, fruits, vegetables, and cracked corn. Apart from that, hamsters also eat small insects, lizards as well as other small animals.\nInterestingly, hamsters have pouches on the inside of their cheeks, and they carry food in these pouches to store and eat later.\nHamster Predators and Threats\nHamsters are known to defend themselves against these predators by using their incisors which are large in size. The mother hamsters also carry their children to safety by putting them in the pouches in their mouths.\nThe predators of this small animal are numerous since they are small and easy to pick up. However, they are quite fast and spritely.\nWhat Eats Hamsters?\nThe common predators of hamsters include snakes, birds, and other predatory mammals. That doesn\u2019t mean that a hamster won\u2019t put up a good fight. Instead, they use their naturally long incisors to bite. If the hamster is a new mother, she will keep her young safe within her mouth\u2019s pouches.\nInterestingly, the most likely cause of death in hamsters isn\u2019t being hunted \u2013 it is heart disease.\nWhat Do Hamsters Eat?\nHamsters, in turn, feed on seeds, grains, fruits, nuts, cracked corn, small insects, lizards, and other animals. They are herbivores, so they do not seek out any other animal as prey.\nThese animals should never eat kidney beans, tomato leaves, or unwashed produce. All of these sources of nutrients are incredibly toxic.\nHamster Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nBoth male and female hamsters are known to be fast maters. They are known to waste no time in the process of reproduction, and it is often said that if hamsters from two separate genders are locked in a cage, the female can very quickly conceive.\nThe gestation period in hamsters is about 15 to 20 days. A group of hamster babies, known as a litter, is born shortly after. The hamster babies are blind till about two weeks after their birth. They have to be weaned when they are about three to four weeks old. However, these animals should be watched carefully, as they are one of many animals that may eat their young.\nIt is said that female hamsters give birth to two to three litters of hamster babies annually. The lifespan of these small rodents is about on to two years. In captivity, they can survive up to three years.\nHamsters vs. Mice\nWhen comparing a hamster vs. a mouse, hamsters are generally larger than mice. In addition, hamsters generally are found in a wider variety of colors than mice. Mice are also more opportunistic eaters while hamsters are known to hoard food and even store it in their mouths.\nHamsters vs. Guinea Pigs\nAnother popular pet rodent that hamsters are often compared with is guinea pigs. Guinea pigs are generally larger than hamsters and weigh several pounds whereas hamsters weigh less than a pound. In addition, hamsters are omnivores while guinea pigs are strict herbivores.\nHamster Population\nWhile it is not known how many hamsters live in the wild all over the world, it has been said that the pet-population of hamsters is around 57 million. About 11 million households have hamsters as pets.\nHamsters in the Zoo\nLittle is known about hamsters living in zoos. However, it is said that they multiply quickly and find their way into parks, universities, and zoos. For anyone that wants to learn more about hamsters in an up-close way, most pet stores will carry at least a few different species.\nView all 71 animals that start with H"}

They have changed very little over the eons.\nShark don't have vocal cords. They communicate through body language, such as head butts, shaking their heads, or even hunching their backs.\nScientists recently discovered a new species of shark that is just 5 1/2 inches long: the aptly named American Pocket Shark. Not only is it tiny, it also glows in the dark.\nSharks belong to a group of fish known as the elasmobranchs , or cartilaginous fishes. Rays and skates, which may have evolved from sharks, also belong to this group.\nBecause sharks very rarely get cancer, scientists study their cartilage in the hopes of finding a cure for the disease.\nThe first written account of a shark attack is found in Herodotus\u2019 (c. 484\u2013425 B.C.) description of hordes of \u201cmonsters\u201d devouring the shipwrecked sailors of the Persian fleet.\nSome scientists suggest women stay out of the water while menstruating\nWhile blood likely does not provoke a shark to attack, a shark in the vicinity likely can detect the blood. Without any conclusive proof of how sharks might respond, some scientists suggest women stay out of the water while menstruating.\nWhen a shark eats food that it can\u2019t digest (like a turtle shell or tin can), it can vomit by thrusting its stomach out its mouth then pulling it back in.\nA shark\u2019s jaw is not attached to its cranium. Because its mouth is situated on the underside of its head, a shark can temporarily dislocate its jaw and jut it forward to take a bite.\nBefore sandpaper was invented, people used the rough skin of sharks, called shagreen , to smooth and polish wood. Japanese warriors wrapped the skin around the handles of their swords to keep the swords from slipping out of their hands.\nThe first pup to hatch inside the sand tiger shark mother devours its brothers and sisters until there are only two pups left, one on each side of the womb. This form of cannibalism is called oophagy .\nThe first use of the word \u201cshark\u201d in English occurred in 1569. Previously, English sailors and fishermen used the term \u201csea dog\u201d or the Spanish tibur\u00f3n. It could possibly be from the German Schorck, which is a variant of Schurke (\u201cscoundrel villain\u201d) from sh\u00fcrgen (\u201cto poke, stir\u201d).\nWeird things that have been found in shark stomachs include shoes, chairs, the rear half of a horse, a box of nails, a torpedo, drums, and bottles of wine.\nIn 1977, Happy Days\u2019 Arthur \u201cFonzie\u201d Fonzarelli jumped over a penned-in shark while on water skis, giving birth to the expression \u201cjumping the shark\u201d to describe a desperate dramatic measure by a TV show.\nThere are at least 400 species of sharks that can be placed into eight groups, and new ones are being identified all the time. Of this large number, only about 30 species are known to attack humans\u2014particularly the Great White, Tiger, Bull, Mako, and Hammerhead sharks. Most sharks are completely harmless.\nThe blockbuster film Jaws dramatically increased shark killings\nFor every human killed by a shark, humans kill two million sharks.\nSharks do not have a single bone in their bodies.\nThe most bizarre feeding technique of all sharks is that of the Cookiecutter (cigar or luminous) shark. It attaches its mouth onto its victim and carves out a hunk of flesh, leaving a distinctive circular wound in its prey, like a pastry cutter. Its body has a series of holes called \u201cphotophores\u201d that glow in the dark water. In fact, its scientific genus name is Isistius , from Isis, the Egyptian goddess of light.\nThe Grey Reef shark ( Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos ) has been called the \u201cgangster shark\u201d because of its highly aggressive nature.\nSharks can be found in all of Earth\u2019s oceans.\nAngel sharks were once called monkfish or bishop fish because their fins look like flowing robes.\nThe frilled shark, or eel shark, is called a \u201cliving fossil\u201d because it is so much like some extinct sharks that are found preserved in rocks. Parts of its skeleton resemble those of sharks that became extinct 350 million years ago.\nPortuguese sharks live at depths of 12,000 feet, which is over two miles deep.\nAs long as a shark\u2019s back is mostly under water, it can swim easily. A nine-foot-long bull shark can swim in just two feet of water.\nAbout two-thirds of shark attacks on humans have taken place in water less than six feet deep.\nMore people are killed by bee stings and lightning than by shark attacks\nMost shark attacks occur less than 100 feet from the shore. Shark attacks happen all over the world, but mainly around popular beaches in North America (especially Florida and Hawaii), Australia, and South Africa.\nMore people are killed by bee stings and lightning than by shark attacks. Worldwide about 30 people die each year from shark attacks, which means a person has a one in 300 million chance of being killed by a shark. A shark attack most often occurs when a shark mistakes a person for a seal or other animal.\nSharks will often give warning signs before they attack, by arching their backs, raising their heads, and pointing their pectoral fins down.\nMany species of sharks have a movable, transparent nictitating membrane that covers and protects their eyes when they are attacking and eating.\nUnlike fish, sharks do not have a swim bladder to keep them afloat\u2014for this, sharks instead have a large oil-filled liver. Sharks that spend a lot of time on the surface, such as whale and basking sharks, have a massive liver.\nShark liver oil used to be the main source of vitamin A for humans. The liver of a basking shark can weigh over 1,800 pounds and contain 600 gallons of oil.\nContrary to popular belief, the stomach is not the largest organ inside a shark\u2019s body. The liver is the largest organ and can be 25% of the shark\u2019s weight.\nMany Greenland sharks ( Somniosus microcephalus ) have small parasites on their eyes that glow in dark water. Scientists think these glowing parasites attract prey into the sharks\u2019 mouths. These sharks also have poisonous flesh that must be boiled three times before eating.\nA female blue shark\u2019s skin is three times thicker than a blue male\u2019s to survive courtship bites.\nAt birth, a hammerhead shark's head is soft\nHammerhead sharks\u2019 heads are soft at birth so they won\u2019t jam the mothers\u2019 birth canals.\nIn the 1980s, the efficiency of a shark was compared to that of a submarine and, weight for weight, the shark required six times less driving power. This discovery has led to remarkable new experiments for racing yachts, submarines, and bathing suits that explore \u201crough\u201d rather than smooth surfaces in the water.\nRecent research indicates that when a shark plies surface waters (when the dorsal fin cuts through the sea\u2019s surface), it could be detecting pressure waves associated with a struggling animal nearby.\nThe largest fish caught with a rod and reel was a Great White shark. It weighed 2,664 pounds and was almost 17 feet long.\nA bull shark can live in both salt and fresh water by regulating salt and other substances in its blood. A bull shark may have been responsible for a 1916 shark attack that happened in a creek in New Jersey. They have also been found in the Mississippi River.\nThe world\u2019s most unusual shark, the megamouth ( Megachasma pelagios ), wasn\u2019t discovered until 1976. Its mouth can reach up to three feet across, while the rest of the body is about 16 feet long. Only 14 megamouths have ever been seen.\nThe shark that lives the longest is the spiny or piked dogfish ( Acanthias ). They usually live up to 70 years of age, but some may live until they are 100. Dogfish sharks are named for their tendency to attack prey like a pack of wild dogs would.\nMost sharks cannot pump water over the gills as most fish are able to do. They must constantly swim to force water through their mouths and over their gills. A few exceptions to this are sharks that lie flat on the bottom of the ocean, such as the angel shark (which takes in water through a hole behind its eye called a spiracle) and the nurse shark (which opens and closes its mouth to move water over its gills).\nApproximately 100 million sharks are killed every year. Shark teeth are used to make necklaces; cartilage is used to make fertilizers; skin is used to make leather; liver is used to make face cream, sap, and fuel; and fins are used to make soup. The mass killing of sharks creates a negative, cascading effect in the global environment.\nAll living creatures emit small electrical signals as they breathe or move. Some sharks, particularly hammerheads, can use electricity to help them catch their prey\u2014they pick up very small electrical impulses through hundreds of tiny holes in their faces, called Ampullae of Lorenzini.\nSometimes sharks attack metal objects. This might be because metal gives off weak electric signals in salt water that may confuse sharks.\nAlmost 90% of shark attacks have involved men\nEven though almost equal numbers of men and women spend time in the ocean, no one knows why sharks seem to prefer to attack men. In fact, nearly 90% of shark attacks have happened to men.\nThe smallest shark is the dwarf lantern shark, which is only seven inches long. The longest shark is the whale shark, which can grow to a whopping 50 feet long and weigh more than 40,000 pounds. These behemoths are usually gentle and get all their food by sifting small animals out of the water.\nThe empty egg cases of some sharks (such as the dogfish shark) that wash up on seashores are called \u201cmermaid purses.\u201d\nMost sharks are born alive (viviparous). There are two ways a pup can grow inside the mother. In some sharks, the embryos feed on the yolk attached to their bellies. Other species have an umbilical cord that connects to a mother\u2019s blood supply. A mother shark can give birth to up to 48 pups in one litter. The pups are usually born tail first and might rest beside their mother for a while before swimming away to fend for themselves.\nWhale sharks give birth to the greatest number of pups. They can produce several hundred in a litter.\nBasking sharks are pregnant for more than two years, while other sharks, such as the bonnet head shark, are pregnant for only a few months. The longest gestation period of any mammal is the elephant, at 22 months.\nWhen it comes time to give birth, the female shark loses her appetite so she won\u2019t be tempted to eat her own pups.\nThe 1975 movie Jaws fueled widespread fear and hatred of sharks, and the shark has been intensely hunted since. It is so endangered that many countries have taken steps to protect it. Ironically, the late Peter Benchley, the author of the book, supported shark conservation.\nDreaming has been observed in bony fish, but not yet in sharks.\nThere are some things a shark cannot eat, such as a small fish called the Moses sole and the puffer fish. When a shark bites a sole, it releases a chemical in the shark\u2019s mouth that makes the shark release it. Scientists are trying to duplicate this chemical so it can be used to keep sharks away from people.\nA shark fin is often removed from the shark while it is still alive\nSometimes when fishermen catch a shark, they will cut off its fins for soup and throw the shark back into the sea\u2014still alive. The mutilated shark is unable to swim or breathe and eventually dies.\nSharks do not have scales. Instead their skin is covered with denticles, which give the skin its roughness. As sharks grow, the denticles fall off and are replaced by larger ones.\nNative Americans in Florida used the teeth of Great White sharks as arrowheads.\nA pair of shoes made of shark leather can last four times longer than shoes made with regular leather.\nSome sharks\u2014such as the Great White, Porbeagle, and Mako\u2014have crescent-shaped tail fins and can swim very fast. Two researchers calculated a three-foot Shortfin Mako reached an amazing speed of 68 miles per hour, though generally the shark has been more reliably clocked at 46 mph. Both the Mako and the Great White can leap up out of the water.\nSome sharks, like the wobbegong and angel sharks, are so flat that they look like they\u2019re part of the sea floor.\nDiscovered in Japan in 1898, the goblin shark has a long snout, beady eyes, and pink-gray flabby skin. Some scientists call it \u201cFrankenshark\u201d because it looks so ugly. Its bizarre beak may be a step in evolution toward something like a saw shark or hammerhead shark.\nHearing is probably the best of all of a shark\u2019s senses. Some sharks can hear prey in the water from 3,000 feet away. They are better at detecting low frequency sounds, so they can\u2019t detect the high-frequency sounds dolphins make.\nNurse sharks are probably the laziest sharks, spending much of the day resting on the sandy sea floor, sometimes stacked on top of each other. When they get hungry, they are like giant vacuum cleaners, sucking prey off the sea floor or from between rocks.\nSharks have been called \u201cswimming noses\u201d because their sense of smell is so good (they smell with their nostrils but don\u2019t breath through them). Some sharks can smell one part of blood in 100 million parts of water and can tell which direction that smell is coming from.\nSharks tend to look scarier as they age because their new teeth are typically longer than their old teeth\nSharks don\u2019t get cavities probably because they are constantly shedding teeth. Sharks have 40-45 teeth, with up to seven rows of replacement teeth behind them. When a front tooth breaks or falls out, it takes only about one day for a replacement tooth to move forward to the front row. Sharks can go through more than 30,000 teeth in a lifetime. Newer teeth are always larger, so sharks can look scarier as they age.\nSharks do not have ears on the outside of their body, but rather on the inside of their heads.\nSharks have rows of small holes on the sides of their bodies called lateral line organs that are sensitive to small movements in the water...which is how they know when other fish swim near them.\nSome sharks can bite hard enough to cut through a thick piece of steel. Like lions and other predators, sharks usually kill only when they are hungry, which isn\u2019t very often. Some sharks can live a year without eating, living off the oil they stored in their bodies.\nAn ancient shark called Carcharodon Megalodon (\u201crough tooth, big tooth\u201d) had the largest shark teeth ever found, measuring more than six inches long. Its jaws were big enough to swallow an entire car, and it was the same length as the dinosaur T-Rex. Some people believe this shark may still exist in deep water.\nHumans stand little chance of surviving a shark attack. One of the most startling incidents of a shark attack occurred in Tasmania, Australia, in 1993. Terri Cartwright died instantly when a 15-foot Great White bit her in half as her horrified family watched from a boat. She was last seen in its mouth. Part of her leg and a piece of her wet suit were later found.\nSharks may have evolved from jawless fish, such as lampreys.\nThe thrasher (fox, slasher, or swingle-tail) shark uses its long tail to fish. Its tail can be half the length of its whole body\u2014up to 10 feet. It uses its tail like a bat or whip that either smacks or stuns its prey.\nGreat White sharks are the only fish that poke their head out of the water to \"investigate\" the surface\nThe largest and strongest known predatory fish in the sea, the Great White shark (also called White Death), can grow up to 30 feet long and is the only fish that lifts its head out of the water as if to investigate surface objects. Its jaw is six times stronger than a wolf\u2019s and has about two-thirds the biting strength of a Tyrannosaurus Rex\u2019s jaw. The Great White is responsible for 30-50% of all deadly attacks on humans.\nThe second-most dangerous shark in the world, the tiger shark, is sometimes called the \u201cgarbage can of the sea\u201d because it will eat anything, including animal carcasses, tin cans, car tires, and other garbage. One was even found having a chicken coop with the remains of bones and feathers inside its stomach.\nSharks may use the Earth\u2019s magnetic field with special organs that act as a compass to navigate the oceans.\nUntil the nineteenth century, some inhabitants of the islands in the South Pacific considered sharks to be gods and offered human sacrifices to them.\nIn Borneo, to stop babies from crying, the saw from a sawfish shark is covered in cloth and hung over the cradle.\nSolomon Islanders believed that when people died, their ghosts inhabited the bodies of sharks.\nShipwrecked sailors or ditched airman may sometimes use what is called a shark screen bag that disguises the person\u2019s shape and keeps telltale scents from reaching cruising sharks.\nAlthough there are about 400 different types of sharks, fewer than 20% of them are larger than adult humans."}

The killer whale is easy to identify by its size and its striking coloration: jet black on top and pure white below with a white patch behind each eye, another extending up each flank , and a variable \u201csaddle patch\u201d just behind the dorsal fin. Despite the fact that this cetacean is a powerful carnivore , there is no record of its having killed humans in the wild. Dozens of killer whales have been kept in captivity and trained as performers, a practice that in the 21st century was increasingly viewed as unethical.\nNatural history\nThe largest males attain a length of more than 10 metres (32.8 feet) and a weight of about 9,800 kg (about 10 metric tons or 11 short [U.S.] tons), whereas females reach about 8.5 metres (27.8 feet) and weigh significantly less than males. Males also have proportionally larger appendages, with flippers up to 2 metres (6.6 feet) long\u2014approximately 20 percent of the body length\u2014and almost 1 metre (3.3 feet) wide. Flipper length among females is 11\u201313 percent of body length. The dorsal fin of older males is very tall (up to 1.8 metres [5.9 feet]) and straight; females and young males have a dorsal fin that is about half that size and distinctly sickle-shaped (falcate). The skull is a metre or more in length and holds the largest brain of all the dolphins, averaging 5.6 kg (12.3 pounds). The muscles that close the mouth are enormous, and within the jaws is a set of more than 40 interlocking curved teeth. Most of the teeth are large, measuring about 10 cm (4 inches) long and 4 cm (1.6 inches) wide.\nBritannica Quiz Know Your Mammals Quiz Where can you find a capybara?

Other food sources are squids, sea lions, penguins, whales, and porpoises. In the North Pacific several populations live along the Alaskan coast, in the intracoastal waterways of British Columbia and Washington, and off the coast of Baja California. In the North Atlantic they can be found from the waters off Newfoundland and Labrador to Iceland, Norway, and the British Isles. In the Southern Hemisphere killer whales can be seen off the coasts of Argentina, South Africa, New Zealand, and the Galapagos Islands.\nkiller whale (Orcinus orca) distribution The killer whale (Orcinus orca) has a patchy distribution in all oceans, from the polar ice caps to the Equator, where large prey such as tuna, salmon, and seals are abundant. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc./Kenny Chmielewski\nKiller whales live in small groups, usually called pods, that number fewer than 40 individuals each. Resident pods and transient pods have been differentiated within the populations of British Columbia and Washington. Sound production and diet differ between them, with resident pods (that is, those that inhabit Puget Sound and nearby coastal waters) eating fish (primarily salmon) and transients (that is, those that range over larger areas of coastal waters) eating other cetaceans, seabirds, and seals. Echolocation is used by killer whales in feeding and communication.\nkiller whale A pod of killer whales (Orcinus orca)\u2014a species with a patchy distribution in all oceans\u2014swimming at the surface off the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia, 2012. \u00a9 Martin Hale\u2014FLPA/REX/Shutterstock.com\nKnown to be highly intelligent, killer whales are among the few nonhuman animals to be able to recognize themselves in a mirror. Killer whales are also one of the small number of species\u2014along with human beings (Homo sapiens), short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus), false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens), belugas (Delphinapterus leucas), and narwhals (Monodon monoceros)\u2014that experience menopause (that is, the stoppage of ovulation prior to the end of their natural lives). The circumstances under which menopause evolved in killer whales are a matter of debate, but it may have emerged in response to increases in the mortality of offspring from older generations during times when mothers and their daughters bred simultaneously. Some scientists argue that younger females in the pod tend to focus on the success of their own offspring and may be more competitive for food resources than older females (see competition). Killer whale pods are extended families that have matriarchal hierarchies (see also dominance hierarchy). The older females, tending to focus on the success of the overall pod, may be more willing to share food with the rest of the pod, thereby reducing the amount of food that could be given to their own offspring."}

They live in sub-Saharan Africa, northeast Africa, Central Asia, India, and China. However, many of their populations are endangered, especially outside of Africa.\nYou can identify most leopards by their light color and distinctive dark spots. Those spots are called rosettes, because they resemble the shape of a rose. These patterns camouflage their bodies as they move through the grass and trees. Black leopards, which appear to be almost solid in color because their spots are hard to distinguish, are commonly called black panthers.\nUnlike lions, leopards are solitary creatures. Males are almost entirely solitary and females only break their solitude when they are raising cubs. But, like lions, leopards roar. Male leopards defend their territory by roaring and scent marking, while females use their roar to attract mates and call their cubs. A leopard roar is a rough rasp, like a handsaw cutting wood.\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\nLeopard cubs are born with barely visible spots. The mother hides her cubs and moves them from one safe location to the next until they are old enough to begin playing and learning to hunt. When the cubs are about two years old, they live on their own. But the maternal bonds are strong, and offspring sometimes have reunions with their mothers."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Macaws | National Geographic", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/birds/facts/macaws", "text": "Common Name : Macaws Scientific Name : Psittacidae Type : Birds Diet : Omnivore Group Name : Flock Average Life Span In The Wild : Up to 60 years Size : 11.8 to 39.5 inches Weight : 4.5 ounces to 3.75 pounds Size relative to a 6-ft man :\nMacaws are beautiful, brilliantly colored members of the parrot family.\nAdaptations for the Rain Forest\nMany macaws have vibrant plumage. The coloring is suited to life in Central and South American rain forests, with their green canopies and colorful fruits and flowers. The birds boast large, powerful beaks that easily crack nuts and seeds, while their dry, scaly tongues have a bone inside them that makes them an effective tool for tapping into fruits.\nMacaws also have gripping toes that they use to latch onto branches and to grab, hold, and examine items. The birds sport graceful tails that are typically very long.\nBehavior\nMacaws are intelligent, social birds that often gather in flocks of 10 to 30 individuals. Their loud calls, squawks, and screams echo through the forest canopy. Macaws vocalize to communicate within the flock, mark territory, and identify one another. Some species can even mimic human speech.\nFlocks sleep in the trees at night, and in the morning they may fly long distances to feed on fruit, nuts, insects, and snails. Some species also eat damp soil, which may help to neutralize chemicals in their fruity diet and ease their stomachs.\nReproduction\nMacaws typically mate for life. They not only breed with, but also share food with their mates and enjoy mutual grooming. In breeding season, mothers incubate eggs while fathers hunt and bring food back to the nest.\nMacaw Species\nThere are at least 17 species of macaws, and several are endangered. These playful birds are popular pets, and many are illegally trapped for that trade. The rain forest homes of many species are also disappearing at an alarming rate.\nRed-fronted and blue-throated macaws are seriously at-risk. The glaucous macaw and Spix's macaw may already be extinct in the wild.\n1:18"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Krill | National Geographic", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/invertebrates/facts/krill", "text": "Common Name : Krill Scientific Name : Euphausiacea Type : Invertebrates Diet : Herbivore Group Name : Swarm Size : 2.4 inches Weight : 0.035 ounces Size relative to a paper clip :\nThe lowly krill averages only about two inches in length, but it represents a giant-sized link in the global food chain. These small, shrimp-like crustaceans are essentially the fuel that runs the engine of the Earth\u2019s marine ecosystems.\nRole in the Food Chain\nKrill feed on phytoplankton, microscopic, single-celled plants that drift near the ocean\u2019s surface and live off carbon dioxide and the sun\u2019s rays. They in turn are the main staple in the diets of literally hundreds of different animals, from fish, to birds, to baleen whales.\nSimply put, many oceanic life forms depend on krill.\nImportance to the Antarctic Ecosystem\nPink and opaque, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are among the largest of the 85 known krill species. Their estimated numbers range from 125 million tons to 6 billion tons in the waters around Antarctica. During certain times of year, krill congregate in swarms so dense and widespread that they can be seen from space.\nAntarctic krill can live up to 10 years, an amazing longevity for such a heavily hunted creature. They spend their days avoiding predators in the cold depths of the Antarctic Ocean, some 320 feet below the surface. During the night, they drift up the water column toward the surface in search of phytoplankton.\nAlarmingly, there are recent studies that show Antarctic krill stocks may have dropped by 80 percent since the 1970s. Scientists attribute these declines in part to ice cover loss caused by global warming. This ice loss removes a primary source of food for krill: ice-algae."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Eel images!\nThe body of an eel has a slimy coating, hence the phrase, \u201cSlippery as an eel.\u201d\nThe most dangerous eel species is the conger. Although these fish are very snakelike in appearance, they are actually fish. They are ray-finned fishes of the order Anguilliformes, with the term \u201ceel\u201d referring to snake-like fish such as electric, ribbon, wolf eels, lampreys, and morays along with true eels for a total of 800 species. The eel fish can be anywhere from a few inches to 13 feet or more in length. A few freshwater species have become endangered due to human over-consumption.\n5 Incredible Eel Facts!\nEel fish can swim backwards.\nThe slender giant moray is the longest species at 13 feet.\nThe largest eel ever recorded was a European conger that reportedly reached 350 pounds!\nThe gulper (pelican) has an incredibly large mouth resembling a pelican\u2019s pouch.\nOnejaws have no upper jaw but unusually large mouths, and none of the 15 species exceed 7 inches in length.\nEel Classification and Scientific Name\nAnguilliforms include freshwater as well as saltwater fish such as marine morays. There are 19 families, 111 genera, and approximately 800 species. They are further classed from the Phylum Chordata into the Actinopterygii Class. They are also Teleosts, or members of the infraclass Teleostei, which contains 96% of all currently existing fish species.\nConger or true eels (Conger conger) are members of the family Congridae which includes both congers and garden eels. Only members of the order Anguilliformes are true eels. The electric eel is not a true eel but a knifefish, related to carp and catfish, and a member of the order Gymnotiformes and the genus Electrophorus. It is also an air-breather and, unlike true species, lives in freshwater. The wolf eel\u2018s scientific name is Anarrhichthys ocellatus. The scientific name of the ribbon eel, also known as the leaf-nosed moray or bernis, is Rhinomuraena quaesita. Morays are of the family Muraenidae; however, the ribbon eel is sometimes classed in its own family Rhinomuraenidae. Lampreys are jawless fish of the class Hyperoartia, order Petromyzontiformes, and superclass Cyclostomata.\nEel Species\nThere are over 800 species, including snake-like fish and true eels. Conger, electric, fire, and muraena are the most dangerous species. The conger and muraena have powerful jaws with sharp teeth strong enough to drag people, while several shocks from an electric eel can cause respiratory or heart failure in people with underlying heart issues. The fire eel has toxic skin.\nEel Appearance\nDifferent species vary in appearance by their length, color, mouth, and fins. For example, wolf eels are a species of wolffish that differs from true species with their paired gill slits and pectoral fins, while the lamprey has a toothed, funnel-shaped mouth. However, all have long snakelike or wormlike bodies that end in a modified tail fin that is really the fusion of the dorsal and anal fins. They are also characterized by strong jaws and small, sharp teeth. These fish have no pelvic fins and many lack pectoral fins. The larvae are called glass eels, so named due to their transparency. The term does not refer to a fish species but the larval stage referring to the fish\u2019s life stage after hatching up to adulthood\nVladimir Wrangel/Shutterstock.com\nEel Distribution, Population, and Habitat\nThe population of all 800 species worldwide is unknown. It is possible for them to inhabit a small or large range because each species has its own unique distribution. Eel fish can inhabit many types of habitat including oceans, rivers, lakes, and smaller bodies of water. They live deep underwater so as to burrow into the floor or find shelter in coral reefs, rock fissures, muddy or pebbly water. Fish of the family Anguillidae typically inhabit freshwater.\nEel Predators and Prey\nAmerican and European species are threatened by habitat destruction and climate change. Overconsumption by humans is responsible for endangering American and Japanese species and critically endangering the European species.\nWhat eats eels?\nThere are several types of predators depending on the species and its size. Generally, larger fish, seabirds (including herons and storks), and mammals (including raccoons and humans), eat these fish.\nWhat do eels eat?\nThese are primarily predatory fish with carnivorous diets, sometimes cannibalistic. They eat smaller fish, invertebrates, crustaceans, shrimp, crabs, sea urchins. Those in freshwater habitats also consume insect larvae, including that of mosquitos, and worms. Freshwater species eat carrion in addition to live prey.\nEel Reproduction and Lifespan\nThese fish reproduce with a large mating group in which they dance around each other to spawn, after which the eggs hatch into larvae, called glass eels. After the adults spawn, they die. Freshwater species will go to marine waters to mate. However, not much else is known about their reproduction.\nThe lifespan of these fish generally ranges from 32-88 years depending on the species. On the low end, the short-finned species lives 32 years. The American species lives 43 years and the European species is the longest living at 88 years.\nEel in Fishing and Cooking\nThe main commercial types and the scientific names of each species are the American (Anguilla rostrata), European (Anguilla anguilla), Japanese (Anguilla japonica), and the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis). All of them are freshwater fish (family Anguillidae). A popular saltwater species in Japanese cuisine is the white-spotted conger (Conger myriaster).\nEel Population\nDetermining this fish\u2019s population is dependent on each species, as a worldwide assessment of all 800 species has not been done. The IUCN status of the American and Japanese species are both Endangered, while the European species is Critically Endangered. The short-finned species has not yet been assessed.\nView all 68 animals that start with E"}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Evolution of cetaceans - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_cetaceans", "text": "Species of the infraorder Cetacea\nThe evolution of cetaceans is thought to have begun in the Indian subcontinent from even-toed ungulates 50 million years ago (mya) and to have proceeded over a period of at least 15 million years. Cetaceans are fully aquatic marine mammals belonging to the order Artiodactyla and branched off from other artiodactyls around 50 mya. Cetaceans are thought to have evolved during the Eocene or earlier and to share a relatively recent closest common ancestor with hippopotami. Being mammals, they surface to breathe air; they have 5 finger bones (even-toed) in their fins; they nurse their young; and, despite their fully aquatic life style, they retain many skeletal features from their terrestrial ancestors. Research conducted in the late 1970s in Pakistan revealed several stages in the transition of cetaceans from land to sea.\nThe two modern parvorders of cetaceans \u2013 Mysticeti (baleen whales) and Odontoceti (toothed whales) \u2013 are thought to have separated from each other around 28-33 mya in a second cetacean radiation, the first occurring with the archaeocetes. The adaptation of animal echolocation in toothed whales distinguishes them from fully aquatic archaeocetes and early baleen whales. The presence of baleen in baleen whales occurred gradually, with earlier varieties having very little baleen, and their size is linked to baleen dependence (and subsequent increase in filter feeding).\nEarly evolution [ edit ]\nCladogram showing the position of Cetacea within Artiodactylamorpha\nEvolution of cetaceans Indohyus ( Raoellidae cca 49\u201348 Ma) Pakicetus ( Pakicetidae cca 49\u201348 Ma) Ambulocetus ( Ambulocetidae cca 49\u201348 Ma) Kutchicetus ( Remingtonocetidae cca 48 Ma) Remingtonocetus ( Remingtonocetidae cca 48 Ma) Rodhocetus ( Protocetidae cca 45 Ma) Dorudon ( Basilosauridae cca 35 Ma) Squalodon ( Squalodontidae , Odontoceti cca 25 Ma) Kentriodon ( Kentriodontidae .

Archaeoceti is an extinct parvorder of Cetacea containing ancient whales. The traditional hypothesis of cetacean evolution, first proposed by Van Valen in 1966, was that whales were related to the mesonychids, an extinct order of carnivorous ungulates (hoofed animals) that resembled wolves with hooves and were a sister group of the artiodactyls (even-toed ungulates). This hypothesis was proposed due to similarities between the unusual triangular teeth of the mesonychids and those of early whales. However, molecular phylogeny data indicates that whales are very closely related to the artiodactyls, with hippopotamuses as their closest living relative. Because of this observation, cetaceans and hippopotamuses are placed in the same suborder, Whippomorpha. Cetartiodactyla (formed from the words Cetacea and Artiodactyla) is a proposed name for an order that includes both cetaceans and artiodactyls. However, the earliest anthracotheres, the ancestors of hippos, do not appear in the fossil record until the Middle Eocene, millions of years after Pakicetus, whereas the first known whale ancestor appeared during the Early Eocene; this difference in timing implies that the two groups diverged well before the Eocene. Molecular analysis identifies artiodactyls as being very closely related to cetaceans, so mesonychids are probably an offshoot from Artiodactyla, and cetaceans did not derive directly from mesonychids, but the two groups may share a common ancestor.\nThe molecular data are supported by the discovery of Pakicetus, the earliest archaeocete. The skeletons of Pakicetus show that whales did not derive directly from mesonychids. Instead, they are artiodactyls that began to take to the water soon after artiodactyls split from mesonychids. Archaeocetes retained aspects of their mesonychid ancestry (such as the triangular teeth) which modern artiodactyls, and modern whales, have lost. The earliest ancestors of all hoofed mammals were probably at least partly carnivorous or scavengers, and today's artiodactyls and perissodactyls became herbivores later in their evolution. Whales, however, retained their carnivorous diet because prey was more available and they needed higher caloric content in order to live as marine endotherms (warm-blooded). Mesonychids also became specialized carnivores, but this was likely a disadvantage because large prey was uncommon. This may be why they were out-competed by better-adapted animals like the hyaenodontids and later Carnivora.\nIndohyus [ edit ]\nIndohyus was a small chevrotain-like animal that lived about 48 million years ago in what is now Kashmir. It belongs to the artiodactyl family Raoellidae, which is believed to be the closest sister group of Cetacea. Indohyus is identified as an artiodactyl because it has two trochlea hinges, a trait unique to artiodactyls. Approximately the size of a raccoon or domestic cat, this omnivorous creature shared some traits of modern whales, most notably the involucrum, a bone growth pattern which is the diagnostic characteristic of any cetacean; this is not found in any other species. It also showed signs of adaptations to aquatic life, including dense limb bones that reduce buoyancy so that they could stay underwater, which are similar to the adaptations found in modern aquatic mammals such as the hippopotamus. This suggests a similar survival strategy to the African mousedeer or water chevrotain which, when threatened by a bird of prey, dives into water and hides beneath the surface for up to four minutes.\nThe first fossils of the Indohyus were unearthed by Indian geologist A. Ranga Rao. He discovered a few teeth and a jawbone amongst rocks that he had collected. After his death, his widow Leelavathi Rao donated the rocks to professor Hans Theweissan. His technician accidentally broke open a couple of the donated rocks and discovered additional Indohyus fossils.\nPakicetidae [ edit ]\nThe pakicetids were digitigrade hoofed mammals that are thought to be the earliest known cetaceans, with Indohyus being the closest sister group. They lived in the early Eocene, around 50 million years ago. Their fossils were first discovered in North Pakistan in 1979, located at a river not far from the shores of the former Tethys Sea. After the initial discovery, more fossils were found, mainly in the early Eocene fluvial deposits in northern Pakistan and northwestern India. Based on this discovery, pakicetids most likely lived in an arid environment with ephemeral streams and moderately developed floodplains millions of years ago. By using stable oxygen isotopes analysis, they were shown to drink fresh water, implying that they lived around freshwater bodies. Their diet probably included land animals that approached water for drinking or some freshwater aquatic organisms that lived in the river. The elongated cervical vertebrae and the four, fused sacral vertebrae are consistent with artiodactyls, making Pakicetus one of the earliest fossils to be recovered from the period following the Cetacea/Artiodactyla divergence event.\nPakicetids are classified as cetaceans mainly due to the structure of the auditory bulla (ear bone), which is formed only from the ectotympanic bone. The shape of the ear region in pakicetids is highly unusual and the skull is cetacean-like, although a blowhole is still absent at this stage. The jawbone of pakicetids also lacks the enlarged space (mandibular foramen) that is filled with fat or oil, which is used in receiving underwater sound in modern cetaceans. They have dorsal orbits (eye sockets facing up), which are similar to crocodiles. This eye placement helps submerged predators observe potential prey above the water. According to a 2009 study, the teeth of pakicetids also resemble the teeth of fossil whales, being less like a dog's incisors, and having serrated triangular teeth, which is another link to more modern cetaceans. It was initially thought that the ears of pakicetids were adapted for underwater hearing, but, as would be expected from the anatomy of the rest of this creature, the ears of pakicetids are specialized for hearing on land. However, pakicetids were able to listen underwater by using enhanced bone conduction, rather than depending on the tympanic membrane like other land mammals. This method of hearing did not give directional hearing underwater.\nPakicetids have long thin legs, with relatively short hands and feet which suggest that they were poor swimmers. To compensate for that, their bones are unusually thick (osteosclerotic), which is probably an adaptation to make the animal heavier to counteract the buoyancy of the water. According to a 2001 morphological analysis by Thewissen et al., pakicetids display no aquatic skeletal adaptation; instead they display adaptations for running and jumping. Hence pakicetids were most likely aquatic waders.\nAmbulocetidae [ edit ]\nAmbulocetus, which lived about 49 million years ago, was discovered in Pakistan in 1994. They were vaguely crocodile-like mammals, possessing large brevirostrine jaws. In the Eocene, ambulocetids inhabited the bays and estuaries of the Tethys Sea in northern Pakistan. The fossils of ambulocetids are always found in near-shore shallow marine deposits associated with abundant marine plant fossils and littoral mollusks. Although they are found only in marine deposits, their oxygen isotope values indicate that they consumed a range of water with different degrees of salinity, with some specimens having no evidence of sea water consumption and others that did not ingest fresh water at the time when their teeth were fossilized. It is clear that ambulocetids tolerated a wide range of salt concentrations. Hence, ambulocetids represent a transition phase of cetacean ancestors between fresh water and marine habitat.\nThe mandibular foramen in ambulocetids had increased in size, which indicates that a fat pad was likely to be housed in the lower jaw. In modern toothed whales, this fat pad in the mandibular foramen extends posteriorly to the middle ear. This allows sounds to be received in the lower jaw, and then transmitted through the fat pad to the middle ear. Similar to pakicetids, the orbits of ambulocetids are on the top of the skull, but they face more laterally than in pakicetids.\nAmbulocetids had relatively long limbs with particularly strong hind legs, and they retained a tail with no sign of a fluke. The hindlimb structure of Ambulocetids shows that their ability to engage in terrestrial locomotion was significantly limited compared to that of contemporary terrestrial mammals, and likely did not come to land at all. The skeletal structures of the knee and ankle indicates that the motion of the hindlimbs was restricted into one plane. This suggests that, on land, propulsion of the hindlimbs was powered by the extension of dorsal muscles. They probably swam by pelvic paddling (a way of swimming which mainly utilizes their hind limbs to generate propulsion in water) and caudal undulation (a way of swimming which uses the undulations of the vertebral column to generate force for movements), as otters, seals and modern cetaceans do. This is an intermediate stage in the evolution of cetacean locomotion, as modern cetaceans swim by caudal oscillation (a way of swimming similar to caudal undulation, but is more energy efficient).\nRecent studies suggest that ambulocetids were fully aquatic like modern cetaceans, possessing a similar thoracic morphology and being unable to support their weight on land. This suggests that complete abandonment of the land evolved much earlier among cetaceans than previously thought.\nRemingtonocetidae [ edit ]\nRemingtonocetids lived in the Middle-Eocene in South Asia, about 49 to 43 million years ago. Compared to family Pakicetidae and Ambulocetidae, Remingtonocetidae was a diverse family found in north and central Pakistan and western India. Remingtonocetids were also found in shallow marine deposits, but they were obviously more aquatic than ambulocetidae. This is demonstrated by the recovery of their fossils from a variety of coastal marine environments, including near-shore and lagoonal deposits. According to stable oxygen isotopes analysis, most remingtonocetids did not ingest fresh water, and had hence lost their dependency on fresh water relatively soon after their origin.\nThe orbits of remingtonocetids faced laterally and were small. This suggests that vision was not an important sense for them. The nasal opening, which eventually becomes the blowhole in modern cetaceans, was located near the tip of the snout. The position of the nasal opening had remained unchanged since pakicetids. One of the notable features in remingtonocetids is that the semicircular canals, which are important for balancing in land mammals, had decreased in size. This reduction in size had closely accompanied the cetacean radiation into marine environments. According to a 2002 study done by Spoor et al., this modification of the semicircular canal system may represent a crucial \u2018point of no return\u2019 event in early cetacean evolution, which excluded a prolonged semi-aquatic phase.\nCompared to ambulocetids, remingtonocetids had relatively short limbs. Based on their skeletal remains, remingtonocetids were probably amphibious cetaceans that were well adapted to swimming, and likely to swim by caudal undulation only.\nProtocetidae [ edit ]\nThe protocetids form a diverse and heterogeneous group known from Asia, Europe, Africa, and North America. They lived in the Eocene, approximately 48 to 35 million years ago. The fossil remains of protocetids were uncovered from coastal and lagoonal facies in South Asia; unlike previous cetacean families, their fossils uncovered from Africa and North America also include open marine forms. They were probably amphibious, but more aquatic compared to remingtonocetids. Protocetids were the first cetaceans to leave the Indian subcontinent and disperse to all shallow subtropical oceans of the world. There were many genera among the family Protocetidae. There were different degrees of aquatic adaptations in this group, with some able to support their weight on land, and others not. The discovery of the southeastern Pacific Peregocetus indicates they crossed the Atlantic and achieved circumstances-equatorial distribution by 40 mya. Their amphibious nature is supported by the discovery of a pregnant Maiacetus, in which the fossilised fetus was positioned for a head-first delivery, suggesting that Maiacetus gave birth on land. If they gave birth in the water, the fetus would be positioned for a tail-first delivery to avoid drowning during birth.\nUnlike remingtonocetids and ambulocetids, protocetids have large orbits which are oriented laterally. Increasingly lateral-facing eyes might be used to observe underwater prey, and are similar to the eyes of modern cetaceans. Furthermore, the nasal openings were large and were halfway up the snout. The great variety of teeth suggests diverse feeding modes in protocetids. In both remingtonocetids and protocetids, the size of the mandibular foramen had increased. The large mandibular foramen indicates that the mandibular fat pad was present. However the air-filled sinuses that are present in modern cetaceans, which function to isolate the ear acoustically to enable better underwater hearing, were still not present. The external auditory meatus (ear canal), which is absent in modern cetaceans, was also present. Hence, the method of sound transmission that were present in them combines aspects of pakicetids and modern odontocetes (toothed whales). At this intermediate stage of hearing development, the transmission of airborne sound was poor due to the modifications of the ear for underwater hearing while directional underwater hearing was also poor compared to modern cetaceans.\nSome protocetids had short, wide fore- and hindlimbs that were likely to have been used in swimming, but the limbs gave a slow and cumbersome locomotion on land. It is possible that some protocetids had flukes. However, it is clear that they were adapted even further to an aquatic life-style. In Rodhocetus, for example, the sacrum (a bone that, in land-mammals, is a fusion of five vertebrae that connects the pelvis with the rest of the vertebral column) was divided into loose vertebrae. However, the pelvis was still connected to one of the sacral vertebrae. The ungulate ancestry of these archaeocetes is still underlined by characteristics like the presence of hooves at the ends of the toes in Rodhocetus.\nThe foot structure of Rodhocetus shows that protocetids were predominantly aquatic. A 2001 study done by Gingerich et al. hypothesized that Rodhocetus locomoted in the oceanic environment similarly to how ambulocetids pelvic paddling, which was supplemented by caudal undulation. Terrestrial locomotion of Rodhocetus was very limited due to their hindlimb structure. It is thought that they moved in a way similar to how eared seals move on land, by rotating their hind flippers forward and underneath their body.\nBasilosauridae [ edit ]\nBasilosaurus) had a Archaeocetes (like this) had a heterodont dentition\nBasilosaurids and dorudontines lived together in the late Eocene around 41 to 33.9 million years ago, and are the oldest known obligate aquatic cetaceans. They were fully recognizable whales which lived entirely in the ocean. This is supported by their fossils usually found in deposits indicative of fully marine environments, lacking any freshwater influx. They were probably distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical seas of the world. Basilosaurids are commonly found in association with dorudontines, and were closely related to one another. The fossilised stomach contents in one basilosaurid indicates that it ate fish.\nAlthough they look very much like modern cetaceans, basilosaurids lacked the 'melon organ' that allows toothed whales to use echolocation. They had small brains; this suggests they were solitary and did not have the complex social structures of some modern cetaceans. The mandibular foramen of basilosaurids covered the entire depth of the lower jaw as in modern cetaceans. Their orbits faced laterally, and the nasal opening had moved even higher up the snout, closer to the position of the blowhole in modern cetaceans. Furthermore, their ear structures were functionally modern, with the insertion of air-filled sinuses between ear and skull. Unlike modern cetaceans, basilosaurids retained a large external auditory meatus.\nBoth basilosaurids have skeletons that are immediately recognizable as cetaceans. A basilosaurid was as big as the larger modern whales, with genera like Basilosaurus reaching lengths of up to 60 ft (18 m) long; dorudontines were smaller, with genera like Dorudon reaching about 15 ft (4.6 m) long. The large size of basilosaurids is due to the extreme elongation of their lumbar vertebrae. They had a tail fluke, but their body proportions suggest that they swam by caudal undulation and that the fluke was not used for propulsion. In contrast, dorudontines had a shorter but powerful vertebral column. They too had a fluke and, unlike basilosaurids, they probably swam similarly to modern cetaceans, by using caudal oscillations. The forelimbs of basilosaurids were probably flipper-shaped, and the external hind limbs were tiny and were certainly not involved in locomotion. Their fingers, however, retained the mobile joints of their ambulocetid relatives. The two tiny but well-formed hind legs of basilosaurids were probably used as claspers when mating. The pelvic bones associated with these hind limbs were not connected to the vertebral column as they were in protocetids. Essentially, any sacral vertebrae can no longer be clearly distinguished from the other vertebrae.\nBoth basilosaurids and dorudontines are relatively closely related to modern cetaceans, which belong to parvorders Odontoceti and Mysticeti. However, according to a 1994 study done by Fordyce and Barnes, the large size and elongated vertebral body of basilosaurids preclude them from being ancestral to extant forms. As for dorudontines, there are some species within the family that do not have elongated vertebral bodies, which might be the immediate ancestors of Odontoceti and Mysticeti. The other basilosaurids became extinct.\nEvolution of modern cetaceans [ edit ]\nBaleen whales [ edit ]\nEobalaenoptera pursued by the giant shark Otodus megalodon Artistic impression of twopursued by the giant shark\nAll modern baleen whales or mysticetes are filter-feeders which have baleen in place of teeth, though the exact means by which baleen is used differs among species (gulp-feeding within balaenopterids, skim-feeding within balaenids, and bottom plowing within eschrichtiids). The first members of both groups appeared during the middle Miocene. Filter feeding is very beneficial as it allows baleen whales to efficiently gain huge energy resources, which makes the large body size in modern varieties possible. The development of filter feeding may have been a result of worldwide environmental change and physical changes in the oceans. A large-scale change in ocean current and temperature could have contributed to the radiation of modern mysticetes. The earlier varieties of baleen whales, or \"archaeomysticetes\", such as Janjucetus and Mammalodon had very little baleen and relied mainly on their teeth.\nThere is also evidence of a genetic component of the evolution of toothless whales. Multiple mutations have been identified in genes related to the production of enamel in modern baleen whales. These are primarily insertion/deletion mutations that result in premature stop codons. It is hypothesized that these mutations occurred in cetaceans already possessing preliminary baleen structures, leading to the pseudogenization of a \"genetic toolkit\" for enamel production. Recent research has also indicated that the development of baleen and the loss of enamel-capped teeth both occurred once, and both occurred on the mysticete stem branch.\nGenerally it is speculated the four modern mysticete families have separate origins among the cetotheres. Modern baleen whales, Balaenopteridae (rorquals and humpback whale, Megaptera novaengliae), Balaenidae (right whales), Eschrichtiidae (gray whale, Eschrictius robustus), and Neobalaenidae (pygmy right whale, Caperea marginata) all have derived characteristics presently unknown in any cetothere and vice versa (such as a sagittal crest).\nToothed whales [ edit ]\nThe adaptation of echolocation occurred when toothed whales (Odontoceti) split apart from baleen whales, and distinguishes modern toothed whales from fully aquatic archaeocetes. This happened around 34 million years ago in a second cetacean radiation. Modern toothed whales do not rely on their sense of sight, but rather on their sonar to hunt prey. Echolocation also allowed toothed whales to dive deeper in search of food, with light no longer necessary for navigation, which opened up new food sources. Toothed whales echolocate by creating a series of clicks emitted at various frequencies. Sound pulses are emitted, reflected off objects, and retrieved through the lower jaw. Skulls of Squalodon show evidence for the first hypothesized appearance of echolocation. Squalodon lived from the early to middle Oligocene to the middle Miocene, around 33\u201314 million years ago. Squalodon featured several commonalities with modern toothed whales: the cranium was well compressed (to make room for the melon, a part of the nose), the rostrum telescoped outward into a beak, a characteristic of the modern toothed whales that gave Squalodon an appearance similar to them. However, it is thought unlikely that squalodontids are direct ancestors of modern toothed whales.\nThe first oceanic dolphins such as kentriodonts, evolved in the late Oligocene and diversified greatly during the mid-Miocene. The first fossil cetaceans near shallow seas (where porpoises inhabit) were found around the North Pacific; species like Semirostrum were found along California (in what were then estuaries). These animals spread to the European coasts and Southern Hemisphere only much later, during the Pliocene. The earliest known ancestor of arctic whales is Denebola brachycephala from the late Miocene around 9\u201310 million years ago. A single fossil from Baja California indicates the family once inhabited warmer waters.\nAncient sperm whales differ from modern sperm whales in tooth count and the shape of the face and jaws. For example, Scaldicetus had a tapered rostrum. Genera from the Oligocene and Miocene had teeth in their upper jaws. These anatomical differences suggest that these ancient species may not have necessarily been deep-sea squid hunters like the modern sperm whale, but that some genera mainly ate fish. Contrary to modern sperm whales, most ancient sperm whales were built to hunt whales. Livyatan had a short and wide rostrum measuring 10 feet (3.0 m) across, which gave the whale the ability to inflict major damage on large struggling prey, such as other early whales. Species like these are collectively known as killer sperm whales.\nBeaked whales consist of over 20 genera. Earlier variety were probably preyed upon by killer sperm whales and large sharks such as megalodon. In 2008, a large number of fossil ziphiids were discovered off the coast of South Africa, confirming the remaining ziphiid species might just be a remnant of a higher diversity that has since gone extinct. After studying numerous fossil skulls, researchers discovered the absence of functional maxillary teeth in all South African ziphiids, which is evidence that suction feeding had already developed in several beaked whale lineages during the Miocene. Extinct ziphiids also had robust skulls, suggesting that tusks were used for male-male interactions.\nSkeletal evolution [ edit ]\nModern cetaceans have internal, rudimentary hind limbs, such as reduced femurs, fibulas, and tibias, and a pelvic girdle. Indohyus has a thickened ectotympanic internal lip of the ear bone. This feature compares directly to that of modern cetaceans. Another similar feature was the composition of the teeth, which contained mostly calcium phosphate which is needed for eating and drinking by aquatic animals, though, unlike modern day toothed whales, they had a heterodont (more than one tooth morphology) dentition as opposed to a homodont (one tooth morphology present) dentition. Although they somewhat resembled a wolf, the fossils of pakicetids showed the eye sockets were much closer to the top of their head than that of other terrestrial mammals, but similar to the structure of the eyes in cetaceans. Their transition from land to water led to reshaping of the skull and food processing equipment because the eating habits were changing. The change in position of the eyes and limb bones is associated with the pakicetids becoming waders. The ambulocetids also began to develop long snouts, which is seen in current cetaceans. Their limbs (and hypothesized movement) were very similar to otters.\nThe skeleton of a bowhead whale with the hind limb and pelvic bone structure circled in red. This bone structure stays internal during the entire life of the species.\nLimblessness in cetaceans does not represent a regression of fully formed limbs nor the absence of limb bud initiation, but rather arrest of limb bud development. Limb buds develop normally in cetacean embryos. Limb buds progress to the condensation phase of early skeletogenesis, where nerves grow into the limb bud and the apical ectodermal ridge (AER), a structure that ensures proper limb development, appears functional. Occasionally, the genes that code for longer extremities cause a modern whale to develop miniature legs (atavism).\nPakicetus attocki skeleton skeleton\nPakicetus had a pelvic bone most similar to that of terrestrial mammals. In later species, such as Basilosaurus, the pelvic bone, no longer attached to the vertebrae and the ilium, was reduced. Certain genes are believed to be responsible for the changes that occurred to the cetacean pelvic structure, such as BMP7, PBX1, PBX2, PRRX1, and PRRX2. The pelvic girdle in modern cetaceans were once thought to be vestigial structures that served no purpose at all. The pelvic girdle in male cetaceans is different in size compared to females, and the size is thought to be a result of sexual dimorphism. The pelvic bones of modern male cetaceans are more massive, longer, and larger than those of females. Due to the sexual dimorphism displayed, they were most likely involved in supporting male genitalia that remain hidden behind abdominal walls until sexual reproduction occurs.\nEarly archaeocetes such as Pakicetus had the nasal openings at the end of the snout, but in later species such as Rodhocetus, the openings had begun to drift toward the top of the skull. This is known as nasal drift. The nostrils of modern cetaceans have become modified into blowholes that allow them to break to the surface, inhale, and submerge with convenience. The ears began to move inward as well, and, in the case of Basilosaurus, the middle ears began to receive vibrations from the lower jaw. Today's modern toothed whales use their melon organ, a pad of fat, for echolocation.\nOngoing evolution [ edit ]\nCulture [ edit ]\nResearchers pushed a pole with a conical sponge attached along the substrate to simulate sponging behavior by dolphins. They videotaped this experiment to learn what prey was available on the seafloor and why a sponge would be beneficial to foraging rather than echolocation\nCulture is group-specific behavior transferred by social learning. Tool use to aid with foraging is one example. Whether or not a dolphin uses a tool affects its eating behavior, which causes differences in diet. Also, using a tool allows a new niche and new prey to open up for that particular dolphin. Due to these differences, fitness levels change within the dolphins of a population, which further causes evolution to occur in the long run. Culture and social networks have played a large role in the evolution of modern cetaceans, as concluded in studies showing dolphins preferring mates with the same socially learned behaviors, and humpback whales using songs between breeding areas. For dolphins particularly, the largest non-genetic effects on their evolution are due to culture and social structure.\nBased on a 2014 study, the population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) around Shark Bay of Western Australia can be divided into spongers and nonspongers. Spongers put sea sponges on their snouts as protection against abrasions from sharp objects, stingray barbs, or toxic organisms. The sponges also help the dolphins target fish without swim bladders, since echolocation cannot detect these fish easily against a complex background. Spongers also specifically forage in deep channels, but nonspongers are found foraging in both deep and shallow channels. This foraging behavior is mainly passed on from mother to child. Therefore, since this is a group behavior being passed down by social learning, this tool use is considered a cultural trait.\nResearchers in a 2014 study in Shark Bay found the fatty acid analyses between the West and East Gulf populations to differ, which is due to the two areas having different food sources. However, when comparing data from within the West Gulf, the spongers vs. the nonspongers in the deep channels had very different fatty acid results even though they are in the same habitat. Nonspongers from deep and shallow channels had similar data. This suggests that sponging was the cause of the different data and not the deep vs. shallow channels. Sponging opened up a new niche for the dolphins and allowed them access to new prey, which caused long-term dietary changes. By producing different food sources within a population, there is less intrapopulation competition for resources, showing character displacement. As a result, the carrying capacity increases since the entire population does not depend on one food source. The fitness levels within the population also change, thus allowing this culture to evolve.\nSocial structure [ edit ]\nSocial structure forms groups with individuals that interact with one another, and this allows for cultural traits to emerge, exchange, and evolve. This relationship is especially seen in the bottlenose dolphin populations in southwestern Australia, which have been known to beg for food from fishermen. This begging behavior was spread through the population due to individual (dolphins spending time around boats) and social (dolphins spending time with other dolphins who express begging behavior) learning.\nCulture can, however, impact social structure by causing behavior matching and assortive mating. Individuals within a certain culture are more likely to mate with individuals using the same behaviors rather than a random individual, thus influencing social groups and structure. For example, the spongers of Shark Bay preferentially stick with other spongers. Also, some bottlenose dolphins in Moreton Bay, Australia followed prawn trawlers to feed on their debris, while other dolphins in the same population did not. The dolphins preferentially associated with individuals with same behavior even though they all lived in the same habitat. Later on, prawn trawlers were no longer present, and the dolphins integrated into one social network after a couple of years.\nSocial networks can still affect and cause evolution on their own by impending fitness differences on individuals. According to a 2012 study, male calves had a lower survival rate if they had stronger bonds with juvenile males. However, when other age and sex classes were tested, their survival rate did not significantly change. This suggests that juvenile males impose a social stress on their younger counterparts. In fact, it has been documented that juvenile males commonly perform acts of aggression, dominance, and intimidation against the male calves. According to a 2010 study, certain populations of Shark Bay dolphins had varying levels of fitness and calf success. This is either due to social learning (whether or not the mother passed on her knowledge of reproductive ability to the calves), or due to the strong association between mother dolphins in the population; by sticking in a group, an individual mother does not need to be as vigilant all the time for predators.\nGenetic studies conducted on Clymene dolphins (Stenella clymene) focused on their natural histories, and the results show that the origin of the species was actually an outcome of hybrid speciation. Hybridization between spinner dolphins (Stenella longirostris) and striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) in the North Atlantic was caused by constant habitat sharing of the two species. Relationships between these three species had been speculated according to notable resemblances between anatomies of the Clymene and the spinner dolphins, resulting in the former being regarded as subspecies of the latter until 1981, and the possibility of the Clymene dolphin as a hybrid between the spinner and the striped dolphins have come to question based on anatomical and behavioral similarities between these two species.\nEnvironmental factors [ edit ]\nGenome sequences done in 2013 revealed that the Yangtze river dolphin, or \"baiji\" (Lipotes vexillifer), lacks single nucleotide polymorphisms in their genome. After reconstructing the history of the baiji genome for this dolphin species, researchers found that the major decrease in genetic diversity occurred most likely due to a bottleneck event during the last deglaciation event. During this time period, sea levels were rising while global temperatures were increasing. Other historical climate events can be correlated and matched with the genome history of the Yangtze river dolphin as well. This shows how global and local climate change can drastically affect a genome, leading to changes in fitness, survival, and evolution of a species.\nThe European population of common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) in the Mediterranean have differentiated into two types: eastern and western. According to a 2012 study, this seems to be due to a recent bottleneck as well, which drastically decreased the size of the eastern Mediterranean population. Also, the lack of population structure between the western and eastern regions seems contradictory of the distinct population structures between other regions of dolphins. Even though the dolphins in the Mediterranean area had no physical barrier between their regions, they still differentiated into two types due to ecology and biology. Therefore, the differences between the eastern and western dolphins most likely stems from highly specialized niche choice rather than just physical barriers. Through this, environment plays a large role in the differentiation and evolution of this dolphin species.\nThe divergence and speciation within bottlenose dolphins has been largely due to climate and environmental changes over history. According to research, the divisions within the genus correlate with periods of rapid climate change. For example, the changing temperatures could cause the coast landscape to change, niches to empty up, and opportunities for separation to appear. In the Northeast Atlantic, specifically, genetic evidence suggests that the bottlenose dolphins have differentiated into coastal and pelagic types. Divergence seems most likely due to a founding event where a large group separated. Following this event, the separate groups adapted accordingly and formed their own niche specializations and social structures. These differences caused the two groups to diverge and to remain separated.\nTwo endemic, distinctive types of short-finned pilot whale, Tappanaga (or Shiogondou) the larger, northern type and Magondou the smaller, southern type, can be found along the Japanese archipelago where distributions of these two types mostly do not overlap by the oceanic front border around the easternmost point of Honshu. It is thought that the local extinction of long-finned pilot whales in the North Pacific in the 12th century could have triggered the appearance of Tappanaga, causing short-finned pilot whales to colonize the colder ranges of the long-finned variant. Whales with similar characteristics to the Tappanaga can be found along Vancouver Island and northern USA coasts as well.\nSee also [ edit ]\nReferences [ edit ]"}

Click to download the free sample version Download sample\nDragons are mythological creatures that have existed in folklore of cultures all over the world for thousands of years. In Western culture, the imaginary creature is typically described as a giant four-legged reptile covered in scales that is able to breathe fire and able to fly with powerful bat-like wings. In Eastern cultures, the dragon is represented as a highly intelligent serpent-like creature without wings. They can be either benevolent or malevolent. In symbolism, dragons represent luck, power and strength, but can also represent greed. See the fact file below or download our BUMPER Dragon worksheet collection which includes over 20 pages of worksheets and activities for the classroom or home environment.\nThe origins of dragons\nThe English word \u2018dragon\u2019 emerged in the 13th century and comes from the Latin word \u2018draconem\u2019, meaning \u2018huge serpent\u2019. The Greek word \u2018drakon\u2019 also means \u2018serpent\u2019 or \u2018giant seafish\u2019.\nBecause dragons don\u2019t really exist, anthropologists suggest that the idea of dragons came from ancient discoveries of dinosaur fossils and an evolutionary fear of snakes and other dangerous reptiles.\nDragons across cultures\nIn ancient Mesopotamia, dragons, as we know them today occurred in literature as either benevolent (doing good) or malevolent (doing bad) creatures. It was depicted as a mixture of lion, eagle and scorpion and associated with weather gods.\nFor the ancient Egyptians, the god of chaos, Apep, was depicted as a giant serpent and lived in the underworld. Thunderstorms and earthquakes were believed to be his roar.\nThe ancient Greeks and Romans believed dragons had supernatural powers. The first mention of a dragon was in Homer\u2019s Iliad. Dragons in their literature generally brought death and chaos and slayed by gods and demigods.\nIn Germanic and Norse mythology, dragons are depicted as giant sea serpents. They encircled the realm and the sea around it.\nFor the Old English, dragons were depicted as greedy hoarders and, in the epic poem Beowulf, a sleeping dragon is awakened when a cup is stolen from its pile of treasure. It then goes on a rampage.\nIn Medieval Europe, the idea of dragons reached its height and they were believed to be living creatures, like other mythological creatures such as unicorns. Dragons were malevolent and pillaged sheep flocks and mercilessly destroyed villages. St George and the Dragon is arguably the most famous narrative of dragons of this time.\nDragons have existed in Chinese culture and folklore for centuries. It is the highest-ranking animal in Chinese animal hierarchy. It is typically snake-like with four legs.\nChinese dragons are symbols of luck, power and strength, but only to those who deserve it. They are believed to have control over rainfall, typhoons and floods.\nIn Chinese culture, people of excellence and outstanding achievement are likened to dragons, while the opposite are likened to worms.\nThe number nine in Chinese culture is very lucky, linked to heaven as well as dragons.\nFor the ancient Japanese, dragons were regarded as water deities similar in appearance to Chinese dragons. They were bringers of destruction, however. In Japanese lore, dragons could be appeased with precious metals and also killed with metal.\nDragons in literature and film\nDragons in modern times are popular creatures of the fantasy genre. They are generally portrayed as malevolent creatures.\nSome of the most famous modern depictions of dragons in literature include Lewis Carroll\u2019s Jabberwocky from Through the Looking Glass (1872), who was a helper.\nJ.R.R. Tolkien created one of the most famous dragons in literature, Smaug, who appeared in The Hobbit (1937) and The Lord of the Rings (1937-1949). Smaug is depicted as a powerful, fearsome and greedy dragon who takes over a dwarf kingdom.\nDragons are used as transport for ringwraiths in J.K. Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter fantasy series.\nDragons also feature in the books and TV adaptations of George R.R. Martin\u2019s Game of Thrones. They are Drogon, Rhaegal and Viserion.\nThe popular animated film How to Train your Dragon (2010), based on the book series by Cressida Cowell (2003-2015), features a menagerie of dragons, including Toothless, a night fury dragon. Here, because of ignorance, dragons are initially believed to be destructive pests until Hiccup teaches the villagers or their benefits and true character.\nFrom the Eragon movie (2006), the animators of Saphira were inspired by various animals, such as puppies, wildebeests and eagles.\nFrom the Pete\u2019s Dragon movie (2016), Eliot is an invisible dragon and a friendly protector to Pete\nOther animated films with dragon characters are:\no Dragonheart in 1996\no Reign of Fire in 2002\no Sleeping Beauty in 1959\no Beowulf in 2007\no Ghidorah, The Three-Headed Monster in 1964\no Dragonslayer in 1981\no The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad in 1958\no Spirited Away in 2002\no Kung Fu Panda in 2008\nAdditional dragon information\nThe Welsh flag depicts a red dragon on a green and white background.\nA flower called a snapdragon is named because its shape resembles a snapping head of a dragon.\nDragons in French history were used to represent the victory of Christianity over paganism.\nIn Feng Shui, the dragon is a powerful symbol of yang/male energy.\nIn China, the dragon dance is performed by a team of people who move a long, curving dragon through the streets in celebration of the Chinese New Year.\nDragon Worksheets\nThis bundle contains 20 ready-to-use Dragon Worksheets that are perfect for students who want to learn more about Dragons who are a much-loved mythological animal that are gigantic, powerful snake or reptile-like creatures.

The animal inches toward its prey. But as the fish closes in, the snack starts to dart away. So the shark thrusts its jaw three inches out of its mouth! (The jaw is connected to three-inch-long flaps of skin that can unfold from its snout.) The predator then grabs the squid in its teeth. After scarfing down the meal, the shark fits its jaw back into its mouth and swims off.\nSLOW GOING\nGoblin sharks are a species of fish that usually live at the bottom of the ocean along continental shelves (or a continent's edges). These pink animals can grow 12 feet long and weigh up to 460 pounds. They have narrow snouts and fanglike teeth. Spotted mostly off the coast of Japan, they\u2019re named for their likeness to mythical goblins that appear in Japanese folklore.\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\nScientists don\u2019t know much about the behavior of these rarely seen animals. But they believe that goblin sharks are solitary, just like many other shark species. They also think the fish are most active in the morning and evening. These animals are likely sluggish creatures, which can make it hard to chase food. Luckily for the slowpokes, their special extendable jaws give them some extra bite.\nBIG MOUTH\n1:58\nA goblin shark\u2019s top and bottom teeth are attached to ligaments, or bands of skin tissue, tucked into its mouth. When prey is just out of reach, the shark extends the elastic tissue out of the mouth to nab the grub. This allows the animal to chow down on snacks such as teleost fish and squid. It also makes the shark one jaw-dropping fish!"}

{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "1,500 animal species practice homosexuality - Medical News", "url": "https://www.news-medical.net/news/2006/10/23/1500-animal-species-practice-homosexuality.aspx", "text": "Homosexuality is quite common in the animal kingdom, especially among herding animals. Many animals solve conflicts by practicing same gender sex.\nFrom the middle of October until next summer the Norwegian Natural History Museum of the University of Oslo will host the first exhibition that focuses on homosexuality in the animal kingdom.\n\"One fundamental premise in social debates has been that homosexuality is unnatural. This premise is wrong. Homosexuality is both common and highly essential in the lives of a number of species,\" explains Petter Boeckman, who is the academic advisor for the \"Against Nature's Order?\" exhibition.\nThe most well-known homosexual animal is the dwarf chimpanzee, one of humanity's closes relatives. The entire species is bisexual. Sex plays an conspicuous role in all their activities and takes the focus away from violence, which is the most typical method of solving conflicts among primates and many other animals.\n\"Sex among dwarf chimpanzees is in fact the business of the whole family, and the cute little ones often lend a helping hand when they engage in oral sex with each other.\"\nLions are also homosexual. Male lions often band together with their brothers to lead the pride. To ensure loyalty, they strengthen the bonds by often having sex with each other.\nHomosexuality is also quite common among dolphins and killer whales. The pairing of males and females is fleeting, while between males, a pair can stay together for years. Homosexual sex between different species is not unusual either. Meetings between different dolphin species can be quite violent, but the tension is often broken by a \"sex orgy\".\nHomosexuality is a social phenomenon and is most widespread among animals with a complex herd life.\nAmong the apes it is the females that create the continuity within the group. The social network is maintained not only by sharing food and the child rearing, but also by having sex. Among many of the female apes the sex organs swell up. So they rub their abdomens against each other,\" explains Petter Bockman and points out that animals have sex because they have the desire to, just like we humans.\nHomosexual behaviour has been observed in 1,500 animal species.\n\"We're talking about everything from mammals to crabs and worms. The actual number is of course much higher. Among some animals homosexual behaviour is rare, some having sex with the same gender only a part of their life, while other animals, such as the dwarf chimpanzee, homosexuality is practiced throughout their lives.\"\nAnimals that live a completely homosexual life can also be found. This occurs especially among birds that will pair with one partner for life, which is the case with geese and ducks. Four to five percent of the couples are homosexual. Single females will lay eggs in a homosexual pair's nest. It has been observced that the homosexual couple are often better at raising the young than heterosexual couples.\nWhen you see a colony of black-headed gulls, you can be sure that almost every tenth pair is lesbian. The females have no problems with being impregnated, although, according to Petter Boeckman they cannot be defined as bisexual.\n\"If a female has sex with a male one time, but thousands of times with another female, is she bisexual or homosexual? This is the same way to have children is not unknown among homosexual people.\"\nIndeed, there is a number of animals in which homosexual behaviour has never been observed, such as many insects, passerine birds and small mammals.\n\"To turn the approach on its head: No species has been found in which homosexual behaviour has not been shown to exist, with the exception of species that never have sex at all, such as sea urchins and aphis. Moreover, a part of the animal kingdom is hermaphroditic, truly bisexual. For them, homosexuality is not an issue.\"\nPetter Bockman regrets that there is too little research about homosexuality among animals.\n\"The theme has long been taboo. The problem is that researchers have not seen for themselves that the phenomenon exists or they have been confused when observing homosexual behaviour or that they are fearful of being ridiculed by their colleagues. Many therefore overlook the abundance of material that is found. Many researchers have described homosexuality as something altogether different from sex. They must realise that animals can have sex with who they will, when they will and without consideration to a researcher's ethical principles.\"\nOne example of overlooking behaviour noted by Petter Bockman is a description of mating among giraffes, when nine out of ten pairings occur between males.\n\"Every male that sniffed a female was reported as sex, while anal intercourse with orgasm between males was only \"revolving around\" dominance, competition or greetings.\nMasturbation is common in the animal kingdom.\n\"Masturbation is the simplest method of self pleasure. We have a Darwinist mentality that all animals only have sex to procreate. But there are plenty of animals who will masturbate when they have nothing better to do. Masturbation has been observed among primates, deer, killer whales and penguins, and we're talking about both males and females. They rub themselves against stones and roots. Orangutans are especially inventive. They make dildos of wood and bark,\" says Petter Boeckman of the Norwegian Natural History Museum."}

Click to download the free sample version Download sample\nLizards are one of the biggest, most diverse and widespread groups of reptiles found on Earth. They are found on all continents, except Antarctica.\nSee the fact file below for more information on the lizard or alternatively, you can download our 27-page Lizard worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\nKey Facts & Information\nLIZARD FACTS\nClass: Reptilia\nReptilia Higher classification: Scaled reptiles\nScaled reptiles Kingdom: Animalia\nAnimalia Order: Squamata\nSquamata Phylum: Chordata\nChordata Lizard (suborder Sauria) refer to any of the more than 5,500 species of reptiles belonging in the order Squamata (which also includes snakes). They feature in a wide variety of colors, appearance, and size.\nIt comprises 40 different families. According to the San Diego Zoo, there are currently over 4,675 lizard species, including iguanas, chameleons, geckos, Gila monsters, monitors, and skinks. Their ancestors appeared on Earth over 200 million years ago.\nLizards are scaly-skinned reptiles that are usually distinguished from snakes by the possession of legs, movable eyelids, and external ear openings. However, some traditional (that is, non-snake) lizards lack one or more of these features.\nDue to their smooth and shiny appearance, some lizards can appear slimy or slippery. However, their skin \u2013 like all reptiles \u2013 is actually very dry due to a lack of pores to excrete water and oils.\nMOBILITY\nAll lizards are capable of swimming, and a few are quite comfortable in aquatic environments. Many are also good climbers and fast sprinters. Some can even run on two legs, such as the Collared Lizard and the Spiny-Tailed Iguana.\nLIZARDS AND HUMANS\nMost lizard species are harmless to humans. Only the very largest lizard species pose any threat of death. The chief impact of lizards on humans is positive, as they are the main predators of pest species. Humans also keep many lizards as pets and some species are even eaten as food.\nHABITAT AND DIET\nLizards can be found in every continent except Antarctica, and they live in all habitats except extremely cold areas and oceans. Most lizards live on the ground, but others can be found making their home in a tree, in a burrow, or in water. Different lizard species eat different types of food. They feed on wide variety of foods including fruits and vegetation, insects, small mammals, birds, and amphibians, carrion and even (in the cases of large predator lizards) large prey such as deer and other big animals.\nBEHAVIOR\nMost lizards are active during daylight hours, when their acute binocular vision can be used to its greatest advantage.\nVision is necessary for most non burrowing species. The family Gekkonidae, however, is composed predominantly of species that are most active from dusk to dawn. In conjunction with night activity, geckos are highly vocal and communicate by sound, whereas most other lizards are essentially mute.\nLizards spend considerable time obtaining food, usually insects. Some of them, like Iguanian lizards, tend to perch motionless at familiar sites and wait for prey.\nThey detect their prey using visual cues, dash from their perches to where the prey item is, and capture it with their tongue in a process known as lingual prehension (in some cases, their tongues can extend to twice their body length).\nIguanian lizards are typically referred to as \u201csit-and-wait\u201d predators. In contrast, autarchic gloss lizards (the non-gecko scleroglossa lizards such as amphisbaenians, skinks, whiptails, and others) actively search for prey by probing and digging, using their well-developed chemosensory system in a process called vomero olfaction, as well as visual cues. These lizards do not use the tongue to capture prey; rather, they grab their prey in their jaws.\nTERRITORIALITY\nSocial interactions among lizards are best understood for the species that respond to visual stimuli. Many lizards defend certain areas against intruders of the same or closely related species.Territorial defense does not always involve actual combat. These often involve the erection of crests along the back and neck and the sudden increase in the size of an individual through puffing and posturing.\nMany species display bright colours by extending a throat fan or exposing a coloured patch of skin and engage in stereotyped movements such as push-ups, head bobbing, and tail waving.\nLarge, colourful horns and other forms of conspicuous head and body ornamentation are often restricted to males, but females of many species defend their territories by employing stereotyped movements similar to those of males. However, this is evidently advantageous and has evolved through natural selection.\nTerritories are usually associated with limited resources (such as nest sites, food, and refuges from predators), and a male that possesses a territory will likely attract females.\nFAMILY LIFE\nMale lizards use a variety of methods to attract a female\u2019s attention. They bob their head vigorously or display their brightest colors or best features.\nThe green anole lizard, for example, inflates a rust-colored throat sack to win over the female of his choice, sometimes keeping up this display for hours. But when the male needs to make sure others see him, his head turns fiery red and his body and tail change to a bright, shiny blue.\nOther males may fight with each other until the weaker one gives up.\nMost female lizards lay soft, leathery eggs \u2014 they don\u2019t stick around to protect the eggs from harm or keep them warm.\nThe tokay gecko lays soft eggs that harden in the dry air and stick to the surface on which they were laid.\nThe sandstone gecko lays eggs in rocky crevices, so these eggs have a tough cover.\nThe Nile monitor lizard lays her eggs in termite mounds. No matter what the circumstances of their start in life, baby lizards look like tiny versions of their parents.\nVENOMOUS VARIETIES\nOnly three lizard species are clinically venomous: the Komodo Dragon, Mexican Beaded Lizard, and the Gila Monster.\nBeaded Lizards are found along the western coast of Mexico and the Gila Monster in southwestern US into northern Mexico.\nEven though myths and legends surround these two creatures because their bite can cause serious injury, no human fatalities have ever been reliably recorded.\nRecent research has also shown that Komodo Dragons are in fact venomous. This large species of lizard can be found in the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, Gili Motang, and Padar.\nSPECIES OF LIZARDS\nAgamas Males in some species of Agamids develop dramatically colorful markings on the body during breeding season. This color change plays a part in communication and reproductive behavior.\nAnoles Some species of anoles are very territorial. Some have even been witnessed showing aggressive behavior to their reflections in mirrors. Anoles are also used as native pest control, as they eat spiders, cockroaches, and other bugs. Anoles changes colors based on its mood and surroundings.\nCasquehead Lizards The basilisk lizard, also known as Jesus Christ lizard, has large hind feet with flaps of skin between each toe, this allows them to run fast on the surface of water.\nChameleons Chameleons are uniquely adapted for climbing and visual hunting. They have the most distinctive eyes of any reptile, they can focus separately to observe two different objects simultaneously. The spiral tail helps in balancing and grasping branches.They are known for the ability to change their body color to blend in with the environment. The slow movements and the accurate aim of the long tongue makes them successful hunters.\nDesert Horned Lizard Desert Horned Lizards have spikes on the body for defense against predators. These lizards use a camouflage and ambush style of hunting.\nFrilled Dragon The frilled lizard is fairly large species of lizard that can grow to nearly a meter in length. The long tail and sharp claws of the frilled lizard help the frilled lizard when it is climbing around in the trees. Like many other species of lizard, the frilled lizard is an omnivorous animal and it will therefore eat almost anything it can find.\nGecko The most well-known species of gecko is the leopard gecko \u2013 it is commonly kept as a pet. Leopard geckos always appear to be smiling, this is not because they are always happy, but because of the way their head and mouth is shaped.\nGila Monsters & Beaded Lizards Gila monsters don\u2019t need to eat very often as they can store fat in their large tails. They are able to go months and even a year between meals. They are venomous lizards, however the venom is only used in defense and not for subduing prey.\nIguanas & Spinytail Iguanas Green iguanas are one of the most popular reptile pets in the United States and are also among the largest lizards in the Americas, averaging around 6.5 feet (2 meters) long and weighing about 11 pounds (5 kilograms). Its average lifespan in the wild is 20 years.\nKomodo Dragons Komodo dragons are the biggest and heaviest lizards on Earth. The largest Komodo dragon ever found was 10.3 feet (3.1 meters) long and weighed 366 pounds (166 kilograms).\nLegless Lizards They are often mistaken to be snakes because of their appearance. If observed closely they have eyelids, which distinguishes them from snakes.\nMexican Beaded Lizards The beaded lizard is an animal to admire from a safe distance, not one to handle casually. Long-term captive beaded lizards often become sluggish and seemingly tame, but they should never be fully trusted to not administer a lightning fast, bulldog-like bite.\nNeotropical Ground Lizards When fighting for a mate, these lizards stand high on all fours, usually sideways to their opponent to maximize their apparent size while bobbing up and down.\nTegus & Whiptails Some species of whiptail lizards have all-female or nearly all-female populations. This lizard reproduces by parthenogenesis (process of asexual reproduction).\nTrue or Wall Lizards Most species of wall lizards are sexually dimorphic, which means that males and females have different patterns.\nLizard Worksheets\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about lizards across 27 in-depth pages.

Eudyptula derives from Greek and means \u201cgood little diver.\u201d Minor refers to the animal\u2019s petite stature.\nSome folks in Australia call them \u201cfairy penguins,\u201d whereas many Kiwis use \u201clittle blue penguins.\u201d The native M\u0101ori word for little penguin is \u201ckoror\u0101.\u201d\nLittle Penguin Subspecies\nMarine biologists clash over little penguin taxonomy. Some scientists believe white-flippered penguins are a subspecies of these animals, others think it\u2019s a different species altogether, and a third group insists they\u2019re color-morphed little penguins.\nSimilar questions linger about the eastern rockhopper penguin.\nLittle Penguin Appearance and Behavior\nLittle Penguin Appearance\nAs you may have guessed, in comparison to other Spheniscidae species, these animals are tiny. Exact measurements vary by subspecies and population, but generally speaking, their average height is 13 inches, and they weigh about 3.3 pounds \u2014 the same as a two-slice toaster.\nLittle penguin feathers are a vibrant cerulean blue. Slate-grey plumage covers their ears, and their undersides are white. Beaks typically reach between three and four centimeters long, and their black-soled feet are webbed.\nHow can you distinguish between females and males on sight? Notice the beak size: females have thinner ones.\nAs is the case with all species in the family, these animals are flightless birds \u2014 and their \u201cwings\u201d function as flippers.\nLittle Penguin Behavior\nLike humans, these animals are diurnal, meaning they\u2019re most active during the day. They rise with the sun and immediately head out for a day of swimming and food foraging. At dusk, they return home to feed the chicks and sleep.\nLittle penguins are cooperative animals that groom each other. Specifically, they remove parasites from each other\u2019s hard-to-reach places. As both hosts and predators of these minuscule critters, these animals play a vital role in their ecosystems.\nSpeaking of grooming, they spend lots of time preening their feathers with oils produced in a gland above their tails. The process helps keep their plumage waterproof. Additionally, once a year, colonies land themselves for about 17 days of molting. During this period, their old feathers fall off, and new ones emerge. The annual shedding is a critical part of their waterproofing physiology.\nLittle penguins also have glands above their eyes that filter salt from the sea.\nWhen coming ashore, they work in groups. As a defensive strategy, they move from the water to land in ranks \u2014 like an army \u2014 and communicate with squeals and trills.\nAs their scientific name suggests, these animals are super divers and swimmers who spend 80 percent of their time doing both. On average, they swim two to four kilometers per hour, but researchers have clocked individuals speeding along at 6.4 kilometers per hour. Diving-wise, they can reach the seafloor, and the average plunge lasts 21 seconds. To date, the longest recorded little penguin dive was 90 seconds.\nNot only are these animals great divers and swimmers, but they\u2019re also impressive travelers who can migrate to far-off places. In 1984, researchers tracked one from Gabo Island to Victoria Harbor \u2014 a distance of 4,739 miles (7,628 kilometers)!\nLittle blue penguin on the rock Khoroshunova Olga/Shutterstock.com\nLittle Penguin Habitat\nLittle penguins primarily live in coastal New Zealand and island-studded southern Australia. People have claimed to see the species in Chile and South Africa, but experts are divided on the topic. Some believe the witnesses misidentified another animal; others think they may be vagrant populations introduced by humans. The debate is ongoing.\nWhen they\u2019re not in the water, fairy penguins live in coastal burrows. They\u2019re always in sandy and rocky areas, and they make good use of caves, rock crevices, logs, and even man-made structures to build their homes.\nSome breeding colonies are managed by conservation groups and operate as tourist destinations. If you go, though, stash your camera! Visitors can\u2019t take pictures or videos of the little penguins because it stuns the animals and can even blind them.\nLittle Penguin Diet\nThese animals dine on a smorgasbord of small fish, including:\nahuru\nanchovies\ncod\ncrayfish\ncuttlefish\ncrab larvae\nherring\njellyfish\noctopus\nprawns\nsardines\nseahorses\nshads\nshrimp\nsquid\nSince little penguins are petite, they typically hunt younger, smaller prey.\nLittle Penguin Predators and Threats\nAs a species, these animals are not endangered. However, individual populations face challenging obstacles. Due to climate change, human population growth, and pollution, experts are sounding alarms early and urging communities to support conservation efforts.\nNatural Predators of Little Penguins\nThe natural predators of these animals include:\nUnnatural Threats to Little Penguins\nCats, rats, and foxes aren\u2019t natural penguin predators \u2014 nor are they endemic to the Antipodes. But since being introduced by humans, the three \u201cintruders\u201d have decimated regional penguin populations.\nBut there\u2019s good news! And it\u2019s all thanks to a chicken farmer named Swampy Marsh who suggested using sheepdogs to protect penguin colonies. At first, people ignored his idea. But when only six penguins remained near his home, the powers that be gave in and employed Mr. Marsh\u2019s pups to scare away the foxes. It worked! Today, the sheepdog method is being used where non-native predators pose a threat to indigenous species.\nHumans are also a huge hazard to these animals. For starters, the human population is skyrocketing. To frame the situation, approximately one billion people occupied the planet in 1800. In 2020, 7.8 billion of us walked the Earth.\nOur growth, unfortunately, is demolishing hundreds of habitats. After all, people take up room! In Australia, new housing developments are encroaching on wildlife, and the whizzing of Skidoos and powerboats is driving penguin populations from their historical homes. Vehicle strikes, bycatch, plastic pollution, and land-management fires also pose big problems for the little penguins.\nLittle Penguin Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nReproduction\nThe breeding season is mainly dependent on location and ocean temperatures. Generally speaking, males start building and renovating burrows sometime between May and September for mating season. Their goal is to create the best nest to attract the top females.\nExcept in rare circumstances, partners remain monogamous for the breeding season. To mate, pairs typically isolate themselves or form small colony offshoots from the larger group.\nThe standard clutch consists of one to four eggs laid one to four days apart. At first, they weigh about .12 pounds (55 grams) \u2014 the same as four jellybeans \u2014 and grow larger over a 36-day incubation period. Female fairy penguins are capable of laying more than one clutch per season, but few do.\nThese animals return to the same breeding spots year after year \u2014 changing only occasionally.\nBabies\nBoth parents help incubate and rear chicks. Once born, mom and dad work overtime to keep the nestlings warm and comfortable for 18 to 38 days. When a baby reaches 7 or 8 weeks old, their feathers grow in and fledge out on their own!\nMales reach sexual maturity at three years old, whereas females develop by two years old.\nLifespan\nThe average lifespan of these animals in the wild is about 6.5 years. Individuals living in captivity can make it to 20.\nLittle Penguin Population\nExperts place the worldwide population of these animals between 350,000 and 600,000. Some estimates go as high as 1,000,000. Resultantly, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature considers them an animal of Least Concern.\nBut that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\nColonies in New Zealand have been steadily declining since the 1960s. Conservationists estimate a 70 percent downtown. Southern Australia and mainland Tasmanian populations are also struggling under the weight of human encroachment.\nThankfully, despite the absence of an IUCN alarm, both Australia and New Zealand have instituted laws addressing potential problems before it\u2019s too late.\nWhite-flippered penguins, which some scientists consider a little penguin subspecies, are considered endangered in New Zealand.\nLittle Penguins In U.S. Zoos\nMany U.S. zoos care for these animals, including:\nThis list isn\u2019t exhaustive.

Yet more than 45 species live in coastal waters around the globe. Scientists have learned their basic biology, but much remains unknown about these charismatic animals.\nPhysical description\nIts head may resemble a horse\u2019s, but each seahorse has a look all its own. Most are spotted, speckled, or striped, and some are decked out in skin frills, spikes, and crowns. Colors vary and can change with the twitch of a muscle to offer camouflage or to signal a foe or potential mate.\nSeahorses have flesh-covered bony plates instead of scales, eyes that work independently of each other, and prehensile tails\u2014used to grip holdfasts on the seafloor to avoid drifting and, during courtship, to link to each other.\nThe tiniest species is no bigger than a lima bean; the largest can reach more than a foot from head to tail tip.\nHabitat and movement\nPreferring calm, shallow waters, seahorses thrive in seagrass beds, mangroves, estuaries, and coral reefs in temperate and tropical waters around the world. Relatively inept swimmers, the fish get around with frantic beats (up to 70 times per second) of a dorsal (back) fin and rely on tiny pectoral fins for stability and steering. Easily exhausted, many are swept away in heavy currents or killed in storm-roiled seas.\nDiet\nSeahorses are ambush predators: They hold still and wait for krill, copepods, fish larvae, and other tiny edibles to float by and then nab them with remarkable speed. Toothless and lacking a stomach for food storage, the animals use their long snouts like vacuum cleaners to suck up plankton nearly continually.\n7:39\nPlease be respectful of copyright.

Photograph by Danny Bergeron, National Geographic Your Shot\nCourtship\nSeahorses are dancers at heart, circling one another or a floating object, flashing colors, and intertwining tails during a sometimes days-long courtship. Said to mate for life, a pair\u2019s commitment may actually be fragile: If the two are separated for a time, or if the male\u2019s health declines, a female may switch partners rather than stick with her original choice.\nReproduction\nIn a reproductive role reversal unique to seahorses and others in the family Syngnathidae (which also includes pipefish and sea dragons), males experience pregnancy. During mating a female uses a tube called an \u201covipositor\u201d to place her eggs into the male\u2019s frontal \u201cbrood pouch.\u201d He then incubates, nourishes, and carries the young to term\u2014usually two to four weeks. With powerful contractions he\u2019ll give birth to fully developed fry, from dozens to more than a thousand depending on the species. Newborn seahorses, set adrift, are immediately vulnerable to predators, and few survive their early days.\n0:33\nThreats\nPollution and coastal development harm seahorses, but the top threat is rampant overfishing. Commercial fishermen scoop up millions of seahorses a year as bycatch. There is also targeted fishing of seahorses to supply tourist demand for dried trinkets and an unregulated traditional-medicine market in Asia.\nPopulation data for many seahorse species is sparse, but scientists believe the vast majority are threatened and some populations in rapid decline. How warming seas due to climate change will affect seahorses long term is unknown.\nSaving seahorses\nProtecting seahorses will require protecting their shallow-water habitats from pollution and destructive development, enforcing commercial-fishing laws aimed at stemming the bycatch problem, and reducing demand for these animals as trinkets and supposed medicinal supplements."}

Freshwater eels are known to travel as far as 4,000 miles to breed. Despite its name, the electric eel is not an eel but a knife fish. Eel is a delicacy in some cultures, but its blood is toxic, so it needs to be cooked thoroughly. Keep reading for more interesting facts about eels.\nGeneral Facts about Eels\nEels belong to the order Anguilliformes (aka cousin of the fish).\nEven though the eel looks like a snake it is really a fish.\nThey have long, narrow bodies with long dorsal and anal fins.\nMost eels have no scales.\nThe eel\u2019s backbone is made up of over 100 vertebrae which makes it very flexible.\nEels have gills and very sharp teeth .\nEels live in both saltwater and freshwater.\nThere are about 800 species.\nAs marine animals and unlike reptiles , eels breathe underwater with their gills and fins, and therefore cannot survive outside of water.\nThe European eel is normally around 60\u201380 cm (2.0\u20132.6 ft) and rarely reach more than 1 m (3 ft 3 in), but can reach a length of up to 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) in exceptional cases.\nThe European eel is a critically endangered species.\nSince the 1970s, the number of eels reaching Europe is thought to have declined by around 90% (possibly even 98%).\nSeveral projects have been started to prevent them from becoming endangered.\nIn 1997, Innovatie Netwerk in the Netherlands initiated a project where they attempted to get European eels to breed in captivity\nWhile the species\u2019 lifespan in the wild has not been determined, captive specimens have lived over 80 years. A specimen known as \u201cthe Brantevik Eel \u201d lived for 155 years in the well of a family home in Brantevik , a fishing village in southern Sweden.\nThe largest species, the slender giant moray eel, can grow to 13 feet in length.\nThe electric eel is a South American freshwater fish found mainly in the Amazon River basin.\nThe electric charge is produced by special organs along the sides of the eel\u2019s body.\nThe electric discharge from an electric eel can be stronger than 500 volts.\nThe eel uses the electric charge against its predators and to catch its prey.\nThe electric eel is a carnivorous hunter, meaning that it eats other animals. It\u2019s a toothless fish and must swallow its food whole.\nLife Cycle\nMuch of the European eel\u2019s life history was a mystery for centuries, as fishermen never caught anything they could identify as a young eel.\nEels undergo considerable development from the early larval stage to the eventual adult stage, and most are predators.\nUnlike many other migrating fish, eels begin their life cycle in the ocean and spend most of their lives in fresh inland water, or brackish coastal water, returning to the ocean to spawn and then die.\nIn the early 1900s, Danish researcher Johannes Schmidt identified the Sargasso Sea as the most likely spawning grounds for European eels.\nThe larvae ( leptocephali ) undergo considerable development from the early larval stage to the eventual adult stage, and most are predators.\nThey drift towards Europe in a 300-day migration.\nWhen approaching the European coast, the larvae metamorphose into a transparent larval stage called \u201cglass eel\u201d, enter estuaries, and many start migrating upstream.\nAfter entering their continental habitat, the glass eels metamorphose into elvers , miniature versions of the adult eels.\nAs the eel grows, it becomes known as a \u201cyellow eel\u201d due to the brownish-yellow color of its sides and belly.\nAfter 5\u201320 years in fresh or brackish water, the eels become sexually mature, their eyes grow larger, their flanks become silver, and their bellies are white in color. In this stage, the eels are known as \u201csilver eels\u201d, and they begin their migration back to the Sargasso Sea to spawn.\nSilvering is important in an eel\u2019s development because it allows for increased levels of the steroid hormone cortisol, which is needed for their migration from freshwater back to the sea.\nCortisol plays a role in the long migration because it allows for the mobilization of energy during migration.\nAlso playing a key role in silvering is the production of the steroid 11-Ketotestosterone (11-KT), which prepares the eel for structural changes to the skin to endure the migration from freshwater to saltwater.\nAfter the eel breeds, it dies.\nIt takes a young eel three years to become an adult.\nHabitat and Feeding\nEels are found throughout the world.\nEels are bottom dwellers, which means that they usually can be found on the muddy or sandy floor of the river or ocean where they live.\nMost eels hide and live in caves and rock crevices.\nThey also burrow in the sand.\nThese behaviors allow them to surprise and attack their prey.\nSome eels will actually chase their prey and the rocks provide protection for the eel.\nEels eat insects, fish, and crustaceans as part of their carnivorous diet.\nThey also eat mollusks\nThey are carnivorous predators that eat a very diverse diet, including just about any marine creature that is smaller than them.\nEels typically eat everything they can fit into their mouth. They won\u2019t go for animals of the same size.\nHuman Uses for Eels\nEels have been important sources of food both as adults (including jellied eels of East London ) and as glass eels .\nGlass-eel fishing using basket traps has been of significant economic value in many river estuaries on the western seaboard of Europe.\nEels\u2019 blood is poisonous, which discourages other creatures from eating them.\nA very small amount of eel blood is enough to kill a person, so raw eel should never be eaten.\nTheir blood contains a toxic protein that cramps muscles, including the most important one.\nAs long as the eel is appropriately prepared and cooked all the way through, it is safe for eating.\nDuring the preparation process, the eel is filleted and drained of its blood, and then the heat from cooking kills the harmful toxins in the meat.\nEel Worksheets\nThis bundle contains 9 ready-to-use Eel Worksheets that are perfect for students who want to learn more about Eels which may look like a snakes, but they are actually fish. There are over 800 different species of eel.

Like sharks, they don't have bony skeleton. Their skeleton is made of cartilage, same material that builds our nose and ears.\nTheir flattened body ends with long tail that usually contains spine and venom. Spine can be serrated in some species.\nThey use spine and venom to protect against predators. Stingrays can kill a lot of different animals, including humans.\nAncient Greek dentists used stingray's venom as anesthetic.\nPeople that live in the areas where stingrays can be found use their spines to make a weapon (daggers). Venom remains deadly even if it is extracted from a dead stingray.\nTheir eyes are located on the top of the head, but they don't use eyes to find prey. Stingrays have electro-sensors which help them detect electrical charges that prey emits.\nMouths are located on the bottom side of their body. When they catch clams, shrimps, and mussels, they will crash and eat them using their powerful jaws.\nBesides mouth, they have gill slides and nostrils on the bottom side of their body.\nThey swim by moving flippers up and down. These movements are similar with movements of the wings in birds and it is sometimes said that stingrays \"fly\" through the water.\nThey are usually solitary, but they sometimes swim in the groups. Group of stingrays is called \"school\".\nMost of their time, they will be hidden on the ocean floor. Shape and color of their body allow them to slip under the sand and become invisible for enemies.\nStingrays give birth to 2-6 young stingrays each year.\nBaby stingrays are born fully developed; they look like miniature versions of adult animals. Babies take care of themselves from the moment of birth."}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "What Is Animal Testing? Facts and Humane Alternatives | PETA", "url": "https://www.peta.org/features/animal-testing-facts-questions-answers/", "text": "What is animal testing? Every year in the U.S., tens of millions animals suffer and die in chemical, drug, food, and product tests. Animals are used in medical training exercises and in huge numbers in government- and taxpayer-funded curiosity-driven experiments at universities. They also suffer and die for classroom biology experiments and dissection, even though modern, non-animal methods have repeatedly been shown to have more educational value and save schools money.\nStudies published in prestigious medical journals have repeatedly shown that experiments on animals waste animals\u2019 lives and precious resources because they aren\u2019t even relevant to human health. They don\u2019t contribute meaningfully to medical advances, and many are performed simply so that experimenters have something to publish about, offering no promise for curing illnesses.\nCheck out these facts about animal testing to learn more:\nWhat Is Animal Testing?\nAnimal testing refers to the practice of performing unnatural and often painful experiments on animals held captive in stressful laboratory settings, often in the misguided belief that the results of the tests will be applicable to humans. At the conclusion of most experiments, the subjects\u2014millions of them per year\u2014are killed.\nWhich Animals Are Used in Tests?\nRight now, millions of mice, rats, rabbits, monkeys, cats, dogs, fish, and other animals used in tests are locked inside cages in laboratories across the country. They languish in pain, suffer from extreme frustration, ache with loneliness, and long to be free.\nExact numbers aren\u2019t available, because mice, rats, birds, and cold-blooded animals\u2014who make up more than 99% of animals used in experiments\u2014are not protected under the federal Animal Welfare Act and their numbers don\u2019t even have to be reported. These sentient beings aren\u2019t even defined as \u201canimals\u201d under this act, which is the only federal law offering any sort of protection for animals.\nIs Animal Testing Cruel?\nExperimenting on animals is not only cruel but also completely unnecessary and unethical. The unnatural and stressful conditions of captivity make it even more unlikely that the results of animal tests can be applied to humans.\nPublished studies show that 90% of our fellow primates who are used in laboratories exhibit abnormal behavior patterns caused by the psychological stress, social isolation, and confinement to barren enclosures that they\u2019re forced to endure. Many go insane, rocking back and forth, pacing endlessly inside cages, and doing repetitive motions such as back-flipping. They even engage in acts of self-mutilation, including tearing out their own hair and biting their own flesh.\nBigotry begins when categories such as race, age, gender, disability, sexual orientation, or species are used to justify discrimination. Join the Movement\nExperiments on Animals at Colleges and Universities\nThe federal government and many health charities waste billions of dollars\u2014including money from U.S. taxpayers\u2014on animal experiments at universities and private laboratories, instead of supporting promising non-animal studies that could actually benefit humans.\nRight now, animals in university laboratories are being mutilated, poisoned, deprived of food and water, immobilized in restraint devices, infected with painful and deadly diseases, burned, electrocuted, irradiated, addicted to drugs, and psychologically tortured. None of the thousands of experiments conducted on animals every year at universities are required by law.\nYou can join PETA in opposing these cruel and useless tests by taking action today:\nAre Tests on Animals Legal?\nYes. U.S. law allows for animals to be burned, shocked, poisoned, isolated, starved, drowned, addicted to drugs, and brain-damaged. No experiment, no matter how painful or trivial, is prohibited\u2014and painkillers are often not required. Even when alternatives to the use of animals are available, the law doesn\u2019t require that they be used\u2014and often, they aren\u2019t.\nHow Does PETA Help Animals Used in Experiments?\nPETA\u2019s vivid demonstrations and undercover investigations alert the public to wasteful, cruel, and useless experiments on animals, often ones occurring right under their noses. We actively campaign to get animals out of laboratories\u2014and win. Check out a list of our latest victories.\nThe PETA International Science Consortium Ltd. works with agencies around the world to reduce the number of animals used in tests. PETA\u2019s scientists are at the forefront of humane and modern methods, promoting groundbreaking non-animal tests and eliminating requirements for experiments on animals by sharing existing research and data with companies and governments.\nPETA scientists sat in as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency made the historic announcement that it would end toxicity tests on mammals\u2014something we\u2019ve pushed the agency to do for nearly 20 years.\nUSEPA photo by Eric Vance\nWhich Cosmetics and Personal-Care Companies Don\u2019t Conduct Tests on Animals?\nNeither the U.S. Food and Drug Administration nor the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission requires that cosmetics be tested on animals. There are already sufficient safety data and many non-animal methods available to make animal testing obsolete for these products.\nThankfully, most cosmetics companies have already banned tests on animals as a result of PETA\u2019s campaigns and consumer pressure. However, some sell products in countries where tests on animals are required. PETA\u2019s searchable Global Beauty Without Bunnies list makes it easy to find cruelty-free companies that have committed to never testing their cosmetics or household cleaning products on animals\u2014here or abroad.\nPETA also works with large food and beverage companies to end the practice of testing ingredients on animals in order to make health claims about products. Dozens of companies have banned all tests on animals for this purpose. You can rest assured knowing that the delicious vegan foods you\u2019ll find recommended in our Living section come from such companies.\nWhat Percentage of Animal Tests Fail?\nStudies published in prestigious medical journals have repeatedly shown that animal experimentation wastes precious resources and lives. More than 90% of basic research, most of which involves animals, fails to lead to treatments for humans. And more than 95% of new drugs that test safe and effective in animals go on to fail in human clinical trials. Yet around the world, millions of animals continue to be used in experiments and then killed.\nHistory of Animal Testing and Animal-Free Medical Advances\nBetween 1900 and 2000, life expectancy in the U.S. increased from 47 to 77 years. Although animal experimenters are often credited with this progress, medical historians report that improved nutrition and sanitation as well as other behavioral and environmental factors\u2014rather than anything learned from tormenting animals\u2014are responsible for this increased longevity.\nEpidemiological studies have led to some of the most important breakthroughs, including the discovery of the relationship between cholesterol and heart disease and between smoking and cancer, the development of X-rays, and the isolation of the AIDS virus.\nWhile experiments on animals have been conducted during the course of some important discoveries, this doesn\u2019t mean that they were vital to the discovery of human-health treatments or that the same discoveries wouldn\u2019t have been made anyway without using animals.\nTake a trip through time using PETA\u2019s interactive timeline, \u201cWithout Consent,\u201d to learn about almost 200 stories of twisted animal experiments from the past century.\nWithout Consent: A Century of Animal Experiments\nAnimal Testing Alternatives: Can Science Progress Without Tests on Animals?\nToday\u2014because experiments on animals are cruel and expensive and their results are generally inapplicable to humans\u2014the world\u2019s most forward-thinking scientists are developing and using methods for studying diseases and testing products that replace animals and are actually relevant to human health.\nAlternatives to animal testing include sophisticated tests using human cells and tissues (also known as in vitro methods), organs-on-chips, advanced computer-modeling techniques (often referred to as in silico models), and studies with human volunteers. These and other non-animal methods are humane, and they aren\u2019t hindered by species differences that make applying animal test results to humans difficult or impossible. Also, they usually take less time and money to complete.\nWhy Should Animal Testing Be Banned?\nIn addition to the many reasons listed above, testing on animals is wasteful, violent, unproductive, and speciesist. Animals are not ours to use for experiments. They have their own wants, interests, needs, and feelings\u2014independent of what purpose they might serve humans. In short, they are their own people and they don\u2019t consent to being tortured and killed in laboratories.\nHuman wellness is more likely to be advanced by devoting resources to the development of non-animal test methods, which have the potential to be cheaper, faster, and more relevant to our bodies and health.\nSupport PETA\u2019s Efforts to Help Animals in Laboratories\nPETA makes it easy to take action to help animals suffering in experiments.

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Falcon images!\nThe falcon is faster than any other animal on earth, both on land and in the air!\nKnown for its precision and speed, the falcon bird seeks out its food like a bird of prey. Falcons, rather than being one species of bird, actually include 40 different species with specific traits that make each one unique. Even with many different types of falcons, the family of birds is wholly considered to be the fastest living animal.\nFalcon birds have a close relationship to hawks, possessing the same ferocity and quick reactions. Their streamlined bodies display slender, pointed wings. With their agility, these birds can often snatch their prey while they are in mid-flight.\nFalcon vs. Hawks\nAs close as falcons may be to hawks, there are many characteristics to distinctly tell them apart. Falcon birds may have broad and long wings, but the hawk has significantly shorter wings, which is the easiest way to tell them apart in the air. Despite their wingspan, hawks tend to be larger than falcons.\nSpeed is another major difference between falcons and hawks. Falcon birds have incredible speed, while hawks can\u2019t match up. They are not nearly as fast, preventing them from gliding through the air in the same way.\nCatching prey is also different between the birds. While falcons go after their prey with their beak, the hawk will catch it with their claws.\nAn Amazing Bird: Falcon Facts!\nThe fastest animal on earth is the peregrine falcon, which reaches speeds of up to 242 mph. It is nearly four times the speed of the fastest land animal (which is the cheetah).\nThese birds can catch their food while they are in mid-flight with their beaks.\nFalcons have incredible eyesight, which is why they are able to capture their food so easily. They can seek both regular color and ultraviolet color, exceeding the range of humans.\nThe cardiovascular system of the bird allows them to beat their wings at a rate of 5 m/s.\nWhere to Find Falcons\nThese birds seem to be spread across the world, including areas from the United States to the Tundra. Each species seems to have its own area that it prefers to reside in. For example, the American kestrel will migrate throughout the contiguous United States, sharing this home with peregrine falcons. They will also travel as far as Alaska and Hawaii.\nPeregrine falcons like to travel even further to every continent, and even feel comfortable in the desert. However, as well-accustomed as they are to extreme temperatures, the only area that this bird will not go to is Antarctica.\nIn these locations, the birds will make their nest from tree holes, as well as on cliffs and natural ledges.\nFalcon Scientific Name\nFalcons go by the scientific name Falconiformes. They belong to the kingdom Animalia and Phylum Chordata. Their class is called Aves and the order is called Falconiformes. Their genus is called Falco.\nThe name \u201chawk\u201d has French and English origins, coming from the word \u201cfaucon.\u201d The Latin word for the bird \u2013 falconem \u2013 comes from the word falx, named for the similarity that their physical characteristics \u2013 like their talons, beak, and wings \u2013 to a curved blade.\nFalcon: The Bird\u2019s Size, Appearance, and Behavior\nThese birds can range from 13 to 23 inches, weighing approximately 1.5 to 3.3 pounds. Most of these prey birds ultimately range from a small to medium size, and their head is adorned with a black crown of feathers. This blackness extends to their nap and wedge as well, connecting the colors to loos like a helmet over the bird\u2019s head.\nWith long and pointed wings, these features are typically slate grey, creating a distinct contrast with the head. Along their throat, the feathers are white to nearly cream in color, and the sides of the abdomen feature both brown and black bars.\nThese birds tend to be solitary, primarily coming together during the mating season and no other times of the year. During the rest of the time, these birds will spend the days either resting at the tops of tall trees or hunting down food. The majority of species will hunt in the daytime, taking any opportunity with the sunlight (even at dusk and dawn) to hunt.\nThese birds will migrate seasonally, seeking out a milder region when the weather is increasingly cold during the winter. The migratory species will often go to Central or South America, though some will only journey to the southern United States. Interestingly, some of them do not migrate at all.\nWhen it comes to their home, falcons are incredibly territorial. They will fight and attack to defend their resting place, protecting themselves and their youth from humans, birds, and other animals.\nNeal Cooper/Shutterstock.com\nFalcon Diet\nThese birds are carnivorous, meaning that they primarily consume meat in their diet. The sources of nutrients that they prefer will vary from species to species, but they are not picky; most often, they will just seek out food that is easy to catch without much work.\nFalcons don\u2019t often go after big game. Rodents, small reptiles, and small amphibians are the most common sources of nutrients.\nFalcon Predators and Threats\nLike many living creatures, these birds tend to have their own slew of predators and other threats to their life. Though their predatory characteristics keep them rather high on the food chain, humans and wolves are both dangers to the falcon population.\nLarge owls will seek out the birds that are still young and inexperienced in their defenses. However, more often than not, animals that prey on falcons will consume their eggs and young for a smaller challenge, as they cannot protect themselves without the help of their parents yet.\nThough these birds are considered to be at the \u201cleast concern\u201d on the endangered species list, there are still many laws that protect these birds (along with hawks and eagles) from being hunted as meat.\nWhat Does a Falcon Eat?\nThe food sources that these birds eat is entirely dependent on what they can lift and what they can catch. As speedy as most rodents are, falcons will seek out mice, rats, and even rabbits. If another bird is small enough to be caught in the sharp beak of the falcon, these birds will seek them out as well.\nAdditionally, they consume snakes and frogs, despite the defenses that these animals may have against predators.\nWhat Eats Falcons?\nAs stated above, wolves and large owls have been known to go after falcons as food. However, they are not often the prey in the wild.\nEven though humans are a threat, most sources say that it is not good to eat them. Their bodies do not often have any fat, due to their physical activity, making the meat rather dry. Furthermore, the primary concern with consuming falcon meat is due to the legal issues around hunting the birds.\nFalcon: The Bird\u2019s Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nMost of the falcon species are monogamous which means that they have one mating partner. They usually mark territories around their nesting sites at the time of mating.\nFemale falcons take full responsibility for the incubation of babies that are known as chicks. They take care of the babies while the male falcons hunt for food.\nEach cluster contains about two to four eggs. The incubation of falcon babies lasts about a month. However, different species of falcon babies take different amounts of time to start flying.\nOn average, falcons live for about 13 years. At most, they live for about 16 to 20 years.\nFalcon: The Bird\u2019s Population\nThe total number of falcons around the world is currently unknown, but their conservations status is considered to be \u201cleast concern\u201d overall. The most recent estimates suggest that there are about 140,000 falcons in the world.\nThe peregrine falcon, however, was formerly considered endangered when certain pesticides were used over 50 years ago, killing much of the population. Since DDT \u2013 one of the deadliest pesticides \u2013 was banned, peregrine falcons have flourished, and their nesting areas are now protected.\nView all 62 animals that start with F"}

In fact, they are largely vegetarian birds. Most of their diet is composed of acorns, nuts, and seeds\u2014though they also eat small creatures such as caterpillars, grasshoppers, and beetles. Blue jays sometimes store acorns in the ground and may fail to retrieve them, thus aiding the spread of forests.\nBehavior and Migration\nCommon in much of eastern and central North America, blue jays are gradually extending their range to the Northwest. They are fairly social and are typically found in pairs or in family groups or small flocks. Most northern birds head south for the winter and join in large flocks of up to 250 birds to make the long journey. However, this migration is a bit of a mystery to scientists. Some birds winter in all parts of the blue jay's range, and some individual birds may migrate one year and not the next. It is unclear what factors determine whether each blue jay or family decides to migrate."}

They walk, trot, canter and gallop like horses, but do not move as quickly.\nZebras are African equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats.\nThere are three living species of zebra, namely the Plains Zebra, which is the most common one, the Mountain Zebra, and the Grevy Zebra.\nThe three groups are the only living members of the Equidae family.\nZebras share the genus Equus with horses and asses horses and asses.\nZebra stripes come in different patterns that are unique to each individual.\nZebras inhabit southern and eastern Africa and can be found in a variety of habitats such as shrublands, grasslands, savannahs, and mountainous areas.\nZebras are primarily grazers and can subsist on lower-quality vegetation.\nZebras communicate with various vocalizations, body postures, and facial expressions.\nZebras\u2019 dazzling stripes make them among the most recognizable mammals.\nZebras are preyed on mainly by lions leopards , and hyenas . Occasionally, a cheetah will hunt a young zebra.\nThey typically flee when threatened but can also bite and kick.\nIdentifying Features\nZebra are identified by: bold black-and-white striping patterns barrel-chested bodies tufted tails elongated faces long necks long, erect manes slender, elongated legs which end in a single spade-shaped toe covered in a hard hoof.\nThey are odd-toed ungulates, which means they have an odd number of toes on each hoof \u2013 ungulate means a hoofed mammal.\nThe eyes of zebras are at the sides and far up the head, which allows them to see above the tall grass while grazing and they have a wide field of vision for spotting danger.\nTheir long, erect ears are movable and can locate the source of a sound.\nZebra front limbs are longer than their back limbs.\nTheir muzzle is dark and the skin underneath the coat is uniformly black.\nThe general pattern is a line that extends from the forehead to the tail. From there, the stripes stretch downward except on the rump, where they develop species-specific patterns that may include brown or gray stripes, and near the nose where they curve toward the nostrils.\nStripes split above the front legs, creating shoulder stripes.\nThe stripes on the legs, ears, and tail are separate and horizontal.\nZebras also have complex patterns around the eyes and the lower jaw.\nStriping patterns are unique to an individual.\nAlbino zebras have been recorded in the forests of Mount Kenya, with the dark stripes being blonde.\nBiologist believe that the reason zebras evolved stripes was to break up the shape of an individual within a herd. The pattern makes it more difficult for predators to keep focused on one animal, especially when they are running in a group.\nDifferences in Species\nGr\u00e9vy\u2019s Zebra\nGr\u00e9vy\u2019s zebra, also known as the imperial zebra, is the largest living wild equid and the most threatened of the three species of zebra.\nNamed after Jules Gr\u00e9vy, it is found in Ethiopia and Kenya.\nCompared with other zebras, it is tall, has large ears, and its stripes are narrower.\nThe Gr\u00e9vy\u2019s zebra lives in semi-arid grasslands where it feeds on grasses and legumes.\nIt can survive up to five days without water.\nIt differs from the other zebra species in that it does not live in harems and has few long-lasting social bonds.\nStallion territoriality and mother\u2013foal relationships form the basis of the social system of the Gr\u00e9vy\u2019s zebra.\nThis zebra is considered to be endangered as the population declined from 15,000 to 2,000 since the 1970s. In 2016 the population was reported to be stable.\nThe Plains Zebra\nThe plains zebra, also known as the common zebra, is the most common and geographically widespread species of zebra.\nIts range spans much of southern and eastern Africa south of the Sahara. They make some of the longest migrations of land mammals, traveling up to 500 km (310 mi) between Namibia and Botswana\nThe plains zebra is intermediate in size between the larger Gr\u00e9vy\u2019s zebra and the smaller mountain zebra and tends to have broader stripes than both.\nThe plains zebra\u2019s habitat is generally treeless grasslands and savanna woodlands, both tropical and temperate.\nThey generally avoid deserts, dense rainforests, and permanent wetlands.\nThe plains zebra is a highly social species, forming harems with a single stallion and several mares and their recent offspring.\nBachelor groups also form and groups come together to form herds.\nThe animals keep watch for predators; they bark or snort when they see a predator and the harem stallion attacks predators to defend his harem.\nThe plains zebra remains common in game reserves but is threatened by human activities such as hunting for its meat and hide.\nThe species population is stable and not endangered, though populations in most countries have declined.\nThe quagga was a subspecies of the plains zebra. It lived in South Africa and was hunted to extinction in the late 1900s. In 1987, a special breeding project began to bring the subspecies back through selective breeding. By 2006, third and fourth-generation animals looked just like their predecessors. Critics claim that they only look like quagga and are not the same in DNA.\nThe Mountain Zebra\nThe mountain zebra is native to southwestern Africa.\nThere are two subspecies, the Cape mountain zebra found in South Africa and Hartmann\u2019s mountain zebra found in south-western Angola and Namibia.\nThe mountain zebra has a dewlap, (a fold of loose skin hanging from the neck or throat).\nMountain zebras are boldly striped in black or dark brown, and no two individuals look exactly alike.\nThe whole body is striped except for the belly.\nIn the Cape mountain zebra, the ground color is effectively white, but the ground color in Hartmann\u2019s zebra is slightly buff.\nMountain zebras form small family groups consisting of a single stallion and one to five mares, together with their recent offspring.\nBachelor males live in separate groups, and mature bachelors attempt to capture young mares to establish a harem.\nDiet and Habitat of Zebras\nZebras mostly eat grasses but may also consume bark, leaves, buds, fruits, and roots if their preferred foods are scarce.\nZebras have a simpler and less efficient digestive system than ruminants and they can subsist on lower-quality vegetation.\nZebras may spend 60\u201380% of their time feeding, depending on the availability and quality of vegetation.\nZebras also spend up to seven hours a day sleeping.\nDuring the day, they sleep standing up while at night they lie down to sleep.\nThey like to rub against rocks and trees.\nThey also like to roll around in dust for protection against flies.\nBiting and kicking are a zebra\u2019s defense tactics.\nReproduction\nMale zebras reach sexual maturity at age 1 to 2 years old.\nFemale zebras can come into their first mating seasons as soon as they are 1 year old and while still nursing from their mothers. However, they will usually not get pregnant until they are at least 2 years old.\nThe length of gestation is roughly 11\u201313 months.\nFoals (baby zebra) are born with brown and white coats, and the brown darkens with age.\nUsually, a single foal is born, which is capable of running within an hour of birth.\nWithin a few weeks, foals attempt to graze, but may continue to nurse for eight to thirteen months.\nIf a foal is threatened by pack-hunting hyenas or dogs, the entire group works together to protect all the young foals by forming a protective front with the foals in the center, and the stallion will rush at predators that come too close.\nDid You Know?\nZebras have been featured in African art and culture for millennia. They are depicted in rock art in Southern Africa dating from 28,000 to 20,000 years ago.\nThe question of how the zebra got its stripes is part of folklore. Some stories suggest they were caused by being scorched by fire. Rudyard Kipling , the author of The Jungle Book , suggested that the black stripes came from a zebra standing in the shade of a tree and its slippery shadows fell on the back of the zebra to make stripes.\nZebras look very exotic and have been desired by exotic animal collectors for centuries. It\u2019s not been possible to domesticate them.\nZebras have been trained and tamed throughout history. In Rome, zebras are recorded to have pulled chariots during gladiator games. Zebras have also been kept in captivity since at least the Roman Empire.\nZebra Worksheets\nThis bundle contains 11 ready-to-use Zebra Worksheets that are perfect for students who want to learn more about Zebras, which are several species of African equids (part of the horse family) distinguishable by their distinctive black and white striped coats.

Get ready to be amazed by these bizarre facts you're about to read about dolphins!\nHave you ever thought a cute creature like a dolphin could have dark secrets buried inside the deep water?\nThese bizarre facts we are about to share with you will change your view about this cute, adorable, and best friend of human creatures at sea.\nLet's take it from the scary facts to the scariest facts about Dolphins\n1) Your cute little friend is actually a Mega-predator\nWe are all aware that there's no word like mega-predator, but what these dolphins do falls into one such group. Seemingly, they feed on a large amount of fish, shrimps, and squids. Their weight is around 260 lbs but eat over 33lbs a day. They organize their hunts and attack prey in groups.\n2) They claim their own territory\nDolphins have their own territory and their hierarchy within the group is organized. They are divided into several groups for different missions like raiding other dolphins in order to steal their females. Just like a political party, dolphins are so thoughtful and organized.\n3) This is the sea's most dangerous dolphin\nThe most dangerous animal at the sea, the insane killing machine and mistook as a Killer whale is indeed a species of dolphin. These species of dolphins have savage muscle, coupled with the intelligence of a dolphin. This is why humans have been looking for ways to train these species.\n4) The purpose of their sexual organ is not only for mating\nIt finishes the job of a hand as well. Doing different things with it, like, feeling and touching things. So many times they have been seen performing dirty stuff on dead objects which include trying to impose themselves on human beings.\n5) Dolphins can stay up for five days without sleeping\nThey have the ability to stay up all night for five days without losing physical stamina or mental ability. Surprisingly, they don't make up for their lost sleep at all.\nAlso Read: Lonely Dolphin Learns To Speak Porpoise For His Friends\n6) They take advantage of other animals for pleasure\nAre you shocked? Dolphins have proven to be huge predators harassing female dolphins. Bottlenose dolphins team up with 5 other dolphins and estrange a female dolphin, mating with her roughly for a few weeks.\nThey even spank the female dolphin and make strange noises to scare her and keep her in line.\n7) Cases of human groping\nAre you feeling embarrassed? Same here. If the facts above did not give you horror, this surely would. Dolphins are sexually aggressive and have assaulted human divers many times.\n8) They use poor eels for pleasure\nDolphins have high libido, to the point that they also pleasure themselves just like humans, particularly bottlenose dolphins by wrapping an eel around their organs to derive pleasure.\n9) They are not just rapists but murderers too\nDolphins have a murdering smudge in their body, leading to the killing of baby porpoises. Baby porpoises having internal injuries were found dead on the beaches of Scotland. At first, scientists thought they were harmed by some weapon testing but later they discovered dolphins' tooth marks.\n10) They kill their own babies\nImagine, how on earth would they do such a thing?\nMale dolphins kill their babies in order to mate with their mothers. it is believed that the mother becomes ready for mating if their children are killed.\nRelated Article: 86 Dolphins Founds Dead in a Beach of Hottentots Bay Namibia\nFor more news, updates about dolphins and similar topics don't forget to follow Nature World News!"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Are Dolphins Mammals? - AZ Animals", "url": "https://azanimal.easterndns.com/blog/are-dolphins-mammals/", "text": "Playful, agile, sleek, and compassionate: dolphins have both fascinated and confused people for thousands of years. The Roman author Pliny the Elder, writing around 77 AD, referred to dolphins and whales as fish in his \u201cNatural History\u201d book. While the confusion still runs rampant today, it is actually a wonderful testament to the diversity of the natural world.\nCetaceans are one of the few mammals, along with manatees, that spend their entire lives immersed in the water, never coming up on land. To the extent they resemble fish at all, it\u2019s due to the fact that the torpedo-shaped body, complete with fins and flippers, is one of the fastest and easiest ways to move around in the water. This is an example of convergent evolution: two separate lineages evolving similar characteristics in response to similar environmental pressures.\nThe dolphin family encompasses a large number of different species, including oceanic dolphins, river dolphins, killer whales, false killer whales, and pilot whales. Today, the closest living relatives of all cetaceans are thought to be the semi-aquatic hippos.\nBut cetaceans actually evolved from a small amphibious mammal around 50 million years ago. The earliest known cetacean ancestor, called the Indohyus, looked a bit like a modern-day mouse deer or chevrotain with long, slender legs and hooves. It also had exceptionally thick bones, which made it possible to wade out into the water and walk on the bottom, where most land animals would struggle to move. By around 40 million years ago, the first fully marine cetaceans evolved. They began to develop streamlined bodies, fins instead of limbs, thick layers of blubber, and other aquatic adaptations. The first true members of the dolphin family emerged some 11 million years ago.\nThese ancestral origins are enough to classify all dolphins as mammals. But this relationship goes much deeper, all the way down to the dolphin\u2019s anatomy and genes. They bear clear physical hallmarks of the mammalian class, including lungs and milk production. So without further introduction, this article will delve into the top eight characteristics that unite dolphins and other mammals together.\nDolphins breathe through their lungs\nIf there is a single defining feature that almost all fish, and indeed most marine organisms, share in common (even the so-called lungfish), it\u2019s the gills. These respiratory organs enable them to filter oxygen from the water in order to fully breathe. Dolphins, by contrast, breathe exclusively through their airways and lungs like any land animal. While dolphins have several adaptations to help them hold their breaths for long periods of time in high-pressure underwater environments (including oxygen-rich blood, collapsible lungs, and the ability to slow their heart rates), they must eventually return to the surface after about 10 minutes on average to draw in more oxygen. If they fail to reach the surface in time, then they\u2019ll drown.\nThe blowhole on the back (which leads to the nasal passage) is the main breathing mechanism. It allows them to expel stale air upward in a gigantic column and then draw in fresh oxygen. When the warm air from the body meets the cold air outside, it condenses into a cloud, which combines with some mucus from the body and the seawater around the hole to form a kind of jet. Since dolphins breathe exclusively through their blowholes, they never have to worry about drawing water into their lungs as they swallow prey. The dolphin\u2019s lungs are also remarkable for their ability to exchange gases. Whereas humans can only exchange 17% of the air in the lungs with every breath, dolphins can exchange a more efficient 80%.\nBottle Nose Dolphin Clearing Blow Hole. These clever creatures can open this hole when inhaling and exhaling out of the water, and close it when below the ocean surface. JoshuaDaniel/Shutterstock.com\nDolphins have a placenta\nWhile internal embryonic development isn\u2019t exclusive to mammals (some fish reproduce this way as well), dolphins have a uniquely mammalian feature that no one else has: the placenta. This temporary organ draws nutrients from the mother\u2019s bloodstream and delivers them to the unborn child. This is an elegant way to ensure the survival of the developing young, but it also places a lot of stress on the mother\u2019s body.\nWhen the mammalian young is finally born after a relatively long gestation period, it is almost always highly developed and partially grown (with the exception of marsupial mammals, which keep their undeveloped young in a pouch). The parents (usually just the mother, but sometimes the father as well) devote a large amount of time and resources into the care of the young, both before and after birth.\nDolphins can produce milk\nLike just about all mammals, female dolphins have mammary glands that produce milk for their young. Since the calves have no lips, many of them have to form a water-tight seal by rolling their tongues into a straw-like shape in order to consume the milk while keeping out the seawater. Suckling can often last a few years before the calf is fully weaned from its mother\u2019s milk. Because of the high-calorie content, the milk helps the dolphin build up the blubber it needs to survive in the water.\nCalves are born with hair\nIt\u2019s almost universally true that mammals will grow hair at some point in their lives. Hair provides both warmth and insulation against the surrounding environment. It\u2019s also true that dolphins don\u2019t actually have much need for hair; their blubber beneath the skin provides a nice replacement for the hair\u2019s insulation (as well as buoyancy and protection).\nNevertheless, dolphin calves are born with small follicles or hair protruding from their snouts. This is probably an evolutionary relic without any actual purpose (besides perhaps helping them feel their mother) because most dolphins lose these hairs quickly after birth and never grow a single strand for the rest of their lives. However, the Amazon River dolphin is an exception. It retains the whisker-like hairs into adulthood, perhaps because they provide a useful sensory instrument while the dolphin is foraging in the river mud for something to eat.\nA mother dolphin with her baby swimming in the blue ocean over the coral reef. The average baby dolphin will nurse on its mother\u2019s milk for several years. They eventually wean off their mother\u2019s milk as they learn how to survive off catching fish. wildestanimal/Shutterstock.com\nDolphins are warm-blooded\nThe terms \u201cwarm-blooded\u201d and \u201ccold-blooded\u201d have long fallen out of favor among biologists (endothermic and ectothermic are now the preferred terms) because they paint a misleading picture of the actual biology. Nevertheless, dolphins are endothermic to their core. They have the ability to maintain and control a healthy body temperature internally, regardless of the outside temperature, via several different mechanisms. \u201cWarm-blooded\u201d organisms have both higher metabolic base rates to produce heat and better means of retaining heat within the body. This is a useful trait shared by modern-day mammals and birds.\nDolphin backbones naturally bend up and down\nMany people may not realize that the dolphin\u2019s swimming motion shows clear ancestry with land-based mammals, whose limbs extend underneath their bodies. To increase the length of their gate, land mammals have spines that naturally flex up and down. Whereas fish can bend their tails from side to side, dolphins have evolved the mammal\u2019s natural up and down motion to swim. This also means the tail fin is positioned horizontally instead of vertically. Dolphins have multiple uses for their vertical tail. It\u2019s thought to slap their tails on the water to stun prey and communicate with each other.\nDolphins have a mammalian skeletal structure\nWhile the skeletal structure of a dolphin obviously differs in many respects from your typical land mammal, they also retain many common characteristics, including the presence of three middle ear bones and a vestigial pelvic bone that may play a minor role in supporting the reproductive organs.\nMost remarkably of all, the bones of the dolphin\u2019s pectoral (side) fins are roughly analogous to a human arm: they have a humerus bone (with full ball and socket joint) on the upper arm, the ulna and radius of the lower arm, and a complete hand structure with carpal bones and five phalanges (the digits). Of course, the actual shape of these bones is highly modified (the arms are much smaller and the fingers longer), but given the fact that they\u2019re used for completely different reasons and in different environments, the similarities are all the more remarkable.\nAnother interesting fact about dolphin morphology is that the embryos briefly develop hind limb buds before they\u2019re then absorbed back into the body. This is due to an important limb-forming gene (interestingly, called Sonic Hedgehog, like the video game character) becoming suddenly inactive in the hind limbs during development, which causes them to regress. On very rare occasions, though, the hind limb does not regress, and the dolphin retains two little stubs into adulthood.\nDolphins have larger brains and complex social organizations\nWhile intelligence is hardly an exclusive feature of mammals, they do have a relatively large brain to body size, which, it\u2019s theorized, enables them to form complex social organizations, communicate in all kinds of complex ways, and solve complex problems. The dolphin is widely regarded as one of the most intelligent forms of life on the planet.\nNext Up: The Sea Bunny: 3 Facts You Won\u2019t Believe"}

In lieu of escape, pufferfish use their highly elastic stomachs and the ability to quickly ingest huge amounts of water (and even air when necessary) to turn themselves into a virtually inedible ball several times their normal size. Some species also have spines on their skin to make them even less palatable.\nToxicity\nA predator that manages to snag a puffer before it inflates won\u2019t feel lucky for long. Almost all pufferfish contain tetrodotoxin, a substance that makes them foul tasting and often lethal to fish. To humans, tetrodotoxin is deadly, up to 1,200 times more poisonous than cyanide. There is enough toxin in one pufferfish to kill 30 adult humans, and there is no known antidote.\nAs Food\nAmazingly, the meat of some pufferfish is considered a delicacy. Called fugu in Japan, it is extremely expensive and only prepared by trained, licensed chefs who know that one bad cut means almost certain death for a customer. In fact, many such deaths occur annually.\nPopulation\nThere are more than 120 species of pufferfish worldwide. Most are found in tropical and subtropical ocean waters, but some species live in brackish and even fresh water. They have long, tapered bodies with bulbous heads. Some wear wild markings and colors to advertise their toxicity, while others have more muted or cryptic coloring to blend in with their environment.\nThey range in size from the 1-inch-long dwarf or pygmy puffer to the freshwater giant puffer, which can grow to more than 2 feet in length. They are scaleless fish and usually have rough to spiky skin. All have four teeth that are fused together into a beak-like form.\nDiet\nThe diet of the pufferfish includes mostly invertebrates and algae. Large specimens will even crack open and eat clams, mussels, and shellfish with their hard beaks. Poisonous puffers are believed to synthesize their deadly toxin from the bacteria in the animals they eat.\nTheats to Survival\nSome species of pufferfish are considered vulnerable due to pollution, habitat loss, and overfishing, but most populations are considered stable.\n1:49"}

There are some 1,250 known species, and many of these animals are indeed shaped like soft-bodied cucumbers. All sea cucumbers are ocean dwellers, though some inhabit the shallows and others live in the deep ocean. They live on or near the ocean floor\u2014sometimes partially buried beneath it.\nFeeding\nSea cucumbers feed on tiny particles like algae, minute aquatic animals, or waste materials, which they gather in with 8 to 30 tube feet that look like tentacles surrounding their mouths. The animals break down these particles into even smaller pieces, which become fodder for bacteria, and thus recycle them back into the ocean ecosystem. Earthworms perform a similar function in terrestrial ecosystems.\nAs Prey and Food\nSea cucumbers, particularly eggs and young larvae, are prey for fish and other marine animals. They are also enjoyed by humans, especially in Asia, and some species are farmed as delicacies.\nDefensive Adaptations\nWhen threatened, some sea cucumbers discharge sticky threads to ensnare their enemies. Others can mutilate their own bodies as a defense mechanism. They violently contract their muscles and jettison some of their internal organs out of their anus. The missing body parts are quickly regenerated.\nReproduction\nSea cucumbers can breed sexually or asexually. Sexual reproduction is more typical, but the process is not very intimate. The animals release both eggs and sperm into the water and fertilization occurs when they meet. There must be many individuals in a sea cucumber population for this reproductive method to be successful. Indeed, many parts of the deep ocean host large herds of these ancient animals, grazing on the microscopic bounty of marine waters."}

Photograph by David Doubilet, Nat Geo Image Collection\nTurtle journeys\nSea turtles make incredibly long migrations between feeding and breeding areas. The leatherback travels an average of 3,700 miles each way. Sea turtles mate at sea, then come ashore on beaches to lay their eggs. Females dig a hole in the sand, then deposit their clutch of eggs (up to 100, in the leatherback\u2019s case), cover it back up, then return to the sea.\nAfter about 60 days, the eggs hatch and tiny hatchlings make their way from the nest to the water at night, often a deadly ordeal as seabirds, crabs, and other predators prey on the young turtles. Another threat comes from coastal development. Natural light at the horizon guides the hatchings to the ocean. Lights from hotels, homes, and other buildings can confuse the turtles into heading the wrong way.\nExtreme threats\nSix of the seven sea turtle species are classified as threatened, endangered, or critically endangered, due largely to human impact in the form of hunting, bycatch in fishing nets, pollution, and climate change. Climate change affects the turtles by warming the temperature of the sand that sea turtle eggs are laid in, which in turn affects the outcome of the hatchlings\u2019 sex."}

Vulnerable LC NT VU EN CR EW EX Least Concern Extinct\nManta rays\u2014highly intelligent and highly threatened\u2014are the largest rays in the world.\nThe sea creatures live in tropical, subtropical, and temperate ocean waters across the globe. \u201cManta\u201d means blanket or cloak in Spanish, describing the look of the animals\u2019 large, flat, diamond-shaped bodies, which are characterized by triangular pectoral fins. Manta rays have two horn-shaped fins protruding from the front of their heads, which has also given them the nickname \u201cdevil fish.\u201d\nFor decades, scientists thought there was just one species of manta ray. In 2008, researchers discovered that there are actually two distinct species: the reef manta ray, which tends to live along coastlines in the Indo-Pacific, and the giant oceanic manta ray, which lives in all the world\u2019s major oceans, spending most of its life far from land.\nWhile the smaller reef manta has an impressive wingspan of about 11 feet wide on average, the giant oceanic manta ray\u2014the largest species of ray\u2014can have a wingspan of up to 29 feet.\nHabitat and feeding\nBoth species of manta ray are filter feeders: they swim with their mouths wide open, drawing in zooplankton and krill, which they sift through rows of tiny rakes that line their mouths called gill plates. They use creative techniques when feeding, often doing repeated somersaults to stay in a single spot that is packed with krill, or chain-feeding\u2014following each other in a circle, mouths open, to create a cyclone effect, trapping food in a spiral.\nGiant manta rays live alone or in small groups, typically congregating to feed. They\u2019re considered predators and hunt deep below the surface of the sea.\nManta rays make regular visits to cleaning stations\u2014spots on a coral reef where sea animals go to be cleaned by smaller creatures\u2014where they stay still for several minutes while cleaner fish remove parasites and dead skin. Many individual manta rays return to the same stations over and over.\nIntelligence\nManta rays have the largest brain-to-size ratio of any cold-blooded fish. Studies have shown that manta rays may recognize themselves in the mirror, an ability indicative of high cognitive function, also shown by dolphins, primates, and elephants.\nStudies have also shown that manta rays are able to create mental maps of their environment, through smell and visual cues, indicating highly developed long-term memory.\nReproduction\nFemale manta rays hit sexual maturity at around eight to 10 years old and tend to give birth once every couple of years, usually to one pup, or occasionally two. Pregnancy lasts about 12 to 13 months and manta rays give birth to live pups. Babies look like smaller version of adult manta rays when born and can immediately survive without parental care.\nManta rays can live for 50 years.\nThreats\nBoth sub-species of manta ray are classified as vulnerable by the IUCN. Their greatest threat is overfishing. Because they\u2019re long-living and slow to reproduce, localized populations have a difficult time bouncing back when fished. Manta rays are fished for their meat, and, increasingly, their gill plates. In demand for Chinese medicine, they\u2019re said to help with everything from increasing blood circulation to curing chickenpox, despite a lack of scientific evidence. They\u2019re also considered by some to be a delicacy. Thousands of manta rays are killed each year for their plates, in a trade estimated to be worth $30 million.\nSince 2011, manta rays have been protected in international waters by the Convention on Migratory Species, an international treaty that protects migrating wild animals. In addition, several countries including Ecuador, Peru, Mexico, the Philippines, and New Zealand have fishing bans in place.\nIn 2014, Indonesia, home to the world\u2019s largest manta ray fishery, banned fishing and trade of the creatures, pointing to a far more lucrative reason to keep them alive: tourism. Swimming with rays, one study estimates, generates so much revenue for local economies that a single ray in a tourist hotspot can generate up to one million dollars in its lifetime\u2014but is worth only $500 dead."}

Vulnerable LC NT VU EN CR EW EX Least Concern Extinct Current Population Trend : Decreasing\nGiraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humans\u2014about 6 feet . These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances.\nBehavior\nTypically, these fascinating animals roam the open grasslands in small groups of about half a dozen.\nBulls sometimes battle one another by butting their long necks and heads. Such contests aren't usually dangerous and end when one animal submits and walks away.\nHeight and Size\nGiraffes use their height to good advantage and browse on leaves and buds in treetops that few other animals can reach (acacias are a favorite). Even the giraffe's tongue is long! The 21-inch tongue helps them pluck tasty morsels from branches. Giraffes eat most of the time and, like cows, regurgitate food and chew it as cud. A giraffe eats hundreds of pounds of leaves each week and must travel miles to find enough food.\nThe giraffe's height also helps it to keep a sharp lookout for predators across the wide expanse of the African savanna.\nThe giraffe's stature can be a disadvantage as well\u2014it is difficult and dangerous for a giraffe to drink at a water hole. To do so they must spread their legs and bend down in an awkward position that makes them vulnerable to predators like Africa's big cats. Giraffes only need to drink once every several days; they get most of their water from the luscious plants they eat.\nFemale giraffes give birth standing up. Their young endure a rather rude welcome into the world by falling more than 5 feet to the ground at birth. These infants can stand in half an hour and run with their mothers an incredible ten hours after birth.\nPopulation\nGiraffes have beautiful spotted coats. While no two individuals have exactly the same pattern, giraffes from the same area appear similar.\nUp until recently, the consensus has been there is only one species of giraffe with multiple subspecies. In 2016, some scientists released a study that claims genetic differences among giraffe populations indicate the existence of four distinct giraffe species.\n8:30"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Possums, facts and photos - Animals", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/possums-gliders", "text": "Common Name : Possums Scientific Name : Phalangeriformes Type : Mammals Average Life Span In The Wild : Up to 15 years Weight : From less than an ounce to over 20 pounds\nPossums are a suborder of 70 tree-living marsupial species native to Australia and the Indonesian islands of New Guinea and Sulawesi. While their names are similar and both are marsupials, possums and opossums are different creatures. Opossum typically refers to the Virginia opossum and its cousins in the genus Didelphis, all of which live in North and South America.\nBoth of the English words possum and opossum come from aposoum, which means \u201cwhite animal\u201d in Powhatan, a Native American language.\nKinds of possums\nBrushtail possums are the most widespread marsupial in Australia and perhaps the most well-known possums. As their name suggests, brushtails have long, thick tails with a prehensile tip and a furless patch on the underside, both of which help them hang onto tree branches.\nUnlike many other possum species, these solitary, nocturnal creatures are highly adapted to living near humans, even in urban areas such as Sydney. And like koalas, they have evolved the ability to feed on plants that would be poisonous for other animals. Possums may also prey on insects, small invertebrates, and eggs.\nAnother group of possums is the ringtails, which reside in communal nests called dreys. Found in tree branches and hollows, dreys often contain an adult female and male, as well as two sets of twins\u2014one that is still nursing and another that is slightly older, but still dependent on the adults.\nCuscuses are less of a household name, but these animals are among some of the largest possums. For instance, the Sulawesi bear cuscus (Ailurops ursinus), named for its coat of thick, dark fur, can weigh up to 22 pounds.\nOn the other end of the spectrum is the smallest possum, the Tasmanian pygmy possum, a mouse-size creature that weighs less than a pencil.\nThe Phalangeriformes suborder also includes various species of glider, including the sugar glider, squirrel glider, and yellow-bellied glider. These curious marsupials have evolved flaps of skin between their arms and legs, called patagia, that allow them to launch themselves out of the canopy and soar to tree branches below.\nOne species, the feathertail glider, can \u201cfly\u201d up to 65 feet.\nMating and reproduction\nMating systems among the Phalangeriformes vary widely. For instance, the rock-haunting possums from tropical Australia appear to choose just one mate, which scientists call monogamy. Some gliders take multiple mates, which is called polygamy, while others are monogamous, and still more are variants in between. One study found that mountain brushtail possums will change their mating system depending on how much food is available.\nLike all marsupials, possums have pouches and give birth to live young. These newborns are no bigger than honeybees and are typically blind and deaf.\nTo complete their development, young possums must crawl from the birth canal into their mother\u2019s pouch, where they will compete for a teat. Milk is critical to the babies\u2019 growth, which means that any young that cannot find and latch onto a nipple will perish. The lips of baby possums and other marsupials will actually fuse shut around the teat, ensuring that they are not easily separated from the lifeline between mother and offspring.\nThe amount of time varies for how long each species will spend drinking their mother\u2019s milk, but after this period, possums will usually stay with their mother for a while. Even after they have weaned, the young of many marsupial species will still duck into the female\u2019s pouch to stay warm and safe from predators.\nConservation status\nWhile some species, like the common brushtail possum, are doing well, many possum species are in danger of extinction. Thanks to fires, logging, and climate change, the fairy possum, or Leadbeater\u2019s possum, is considered critically endangered. Likewise, the mahogany glider is listed as endangered due to the rapid rate at which its habitat is being cleared for agriculture, livestock, and timber. Many of the same threats imperil the critically endangered western ringtail possum.\nJust in Australia, up to one-quarter of the country\u2019s 27 species of possums and gliders are listed as threatened."}

They live in sub-Saharan Africa, northeast Africa, Central Asia, India, and China. However, many of their populations are endangered, especially outside of Africa.\nHunting Skills\nThe leopard is so strong and comfortable in trees that it often hauls its kills into the branches. By dragging the bodies of large animals aloft it hopes to keep them safe from scavengers such as hyenas. Leopards can also hunt from trees, where their spotted coats allow them to blend with the leaves until they spring with a deadly pounce. These nocturnal predators also stalk antelope, deer, and pigs by stealthy movements in the tall grass. When human settlements are present, leopards often attack dogs and, occasionally, people.\nLeopards are strong swimmers and very much at home in the water, where they sometimes eat fish or crabs.\nBreeding\nFemale leopards can give birth at any time of the year. They usually have two grayish cubs with barely visible spots. The mother hides her cubs and moves them from one safe location to the next until they are old enough to begin playing and learning to hunt. Cubs live with their mothers for about two years\u2014otherwise, leopards are solitary animals.\nLeopard Spots\nMost leopards are light colored with distinctive dark spots that are called rosettes, because they resemble the shape of a rose. Black leopards, which appear to be almost solid in color because their spots are hard to distinguish, are commonly called black panthers.\n4:14"}

A lone wolf howls to attract the attention of his pack, while communal howls may send territorial messages from one pack to another. Some howls are confrontational. Much like barking domestic dogs, wolves may simply begin howling because a nearby wolf has already begun.\nPopulation and conservation\nWolves are the largest members of the dog family. Adaptable gray wolves are by far the most common and were once found all over the Northern Hemisphere. But wolves and humans have a long adversarial history. Though they almost never attack humans, wolves are considered one of the animal world's most fearsome natural villains. They do attack domestic animals, and countless wolves have been shot, trapped, and poisoned because of this tendency.\nIn the lower 48 states, gray wolves were hunted to near extinction, though some populations survived and others have since been reintroduced. Few gray wolves survive in Europe, though many live in Alaska, Canada, and Asia.\nWolf pack behavior\nWolves live and hunt in packs of around six to ten animals. They are known to roam large distances, perhaps 12 miles in a single day. These social animals cooperate on their preferred prey\u2014large animals such as deer, elk, and moose. When they are successful, wolves do not eat in moderation. A single animal can consume 20 pounds of meat at a sitting. Wolves also eat smaller mammals, birds, fish, lizards, snakes, and fruit.\nWolfpacks are established according to a strict hierarchy, with a dominant male at the top and his mate not far behind. Usually this male and female are the only animals of the pack to breed.

Elephants are known for their large ears, tusks made of ivory and their trunks \u2013 which are actually a fusion of their nose and upper lip.\n2) Elephants are the world\u2019s largest land animal! Male African elephants can reach 3m tall and weigh between 4,000 -7,500kg. Asian elephants are slightly smaller, reaching 2.7m tall and weighing 3,000\u2013 6,000kg.\nLove animals? You\u2019d love our magazine! Ask your parents to check out Nat Geo Kids magazine!\n(AD)\n3) There\u2019s an easy way to tell the African elephants apart from their Asian cousins \u2013 their ears! African elephants have large ears shaped like the continent of Africa! Asian elephants\u2019 ears are smaller and shaped like India. Cool, huh?\n4) You can tell a lot about an elephant by looking at their tusks! Elephant tusks never stop growing, so enormous tusks can be a sign of an old elephant. Both male and female African elephants grow tusks, but only male Asian elephants grow them. A tusk-less adult elephant is likely to be a female Asian elephant.\n5) Until recently, African Forest elephants were thought to be a subspecies of the African elephant, but new research discovered that they are actually a separate species entirely. These elephants live in the tropical forests of Africa\u2019s Congo Basin. They have straighter tusks and more rounded ears than Savannah elephants.\n6) These magnificent mammals spend between 12 to 18 hours eating grass, plants and fruit every single day! They use their long trunks to smell their food and lift it up into their mouth \u2013 yum!\n7) All that eating means one thing, gang, an awful lot of poo! Each elephant creates about one tonne of poo per week, which keeps the soil fertile and disperses tree seeds. Elephants also dig waterholes and create footpaths, literally changing the landscape around them!\n8) In Mount Elgon National Park in Kenya, a group of elephants use their tusks to mine for salt in underground caves! They feel their way around with their trunks and eat the salts by breaking them off with their tusks.\n9) Elephants have created their very own sunscreen! After a river or swamp bath, they\u2019ll throw mud and sand up and over themselves to protect their skin from the hot, burning sun. Clever!\n10) Sadly, elephants are in trouble. Many are killed by humans for their ivory tusks, because they\u2019ve come into conflict with communities or simply for sport. There are far fewer Asian elephants (which are categorised as Endangered) than there are African elephants (listed as Vulnerable \u2013 at risk of becoming Endangered). Asian elephants also face threats from tourist attractions where people pay to ride on their backs or watch them paint pictures using their trunks.\nClick here to learn more about threats to the Asian elephant and what is being done to help.\nWhat did you think of our elephant facts?

They have sharp, highly serrated teeth and powerful jaws that allow them to crack the shells of sea turtles and clams. The stomach contents of captured tiger sharks have included stingrays, sea snakes, seals, birds, squids, and even license plates and old tires.\nPopulation\nTiger sharks are common in tropical and sub-tropical waters throughout the world. Large specimens can grow to as much as 20 to 25 feet in length and weigh more than 1,900 pounds.\nThreats to Survival\nThey are heavily harvested for their fins, skin, and flesh, and their livers contain high levels of vitamin A, which is processed into vitamin oil. They have extremely low repopulation rates, and therefore may be highly susceptible to fishing pressure. They are listed as near threatened throughout their range.\n1:36"}
{"animal": "dolphin", "title": "Bull Shark | National Geographic - Animals", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/facts/bull-shark", "text": "Common Name : Bull Shark Scientific Name : Carcharhinus leucas Type : Fish Diet : Carnivore Group Name : School, shoal Average Life Span In The Wild : 16 years Size : 7 to 11.5 feet Weight : 200 to 500 pounds Size relative to a 6-ft man : IUCN Red List Status : ? Near threatened LC NT VU EN CR EW EX Least Concern Extinct Current Population Trend : Unknown\nBull sharks are aggressive, common, and usually live near high-population areas like tropical shorelines. They are not bothered by brackish and freshwater, and even venture far inland via rivers and tributaries.\nHuman Encounters\nBecause of these characteristics, many experts consider bull sharks to be the most dangerous sharks in the world. Historically, they are joined by their more famous cousins, great whites and tiger sharks, as the three species most likely to attack humans.\nCharacteristics\nBull sharks get their name from their short, blunt snout, as well as their pugnacious disposition and a tendency to head-butt their prey before attacking. They are medium-size sharks, with thick, stout bodies and long pectoral fins. They are gray on top and white below, and the fins have dark tips, particularly on young bull sharks.\nHunting\nThey are found cruising the shallow, warm waters of all the world\u2019s oceans. Fast, agile predators, they will eat almost anything they see, including fish, dolphins, and even other sharks. Humans are not, per se, on their menus. However, they frequent the turbid waters of estuaries and bays, and often attack people inadvertently or out of curiosity.\nThreats to Survival\nBull sharks are fished widely for their meat, hides, and oils, and their numbers are likely shrinking. One study has found that their average lengths have declined significantly over the past few decades."}
