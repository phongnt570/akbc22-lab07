Check out our ten elephant-astic elephant facts!\nElephant facts\n1) There are three different species of elephant \u2013 the African Savannah elephant, the African Forest elephant and the Asian elephant. Elephants are known for their large ears, tusks made of ivory and their trunks \u2013 which are actually a fusion of their nose and upper lip.\n2) Elephants are the world\u2019s largest land animal! Male African elephants can reach 3m tall and weigh between 4,000 -7,500kg. Asian elephants are slightly smaller, reaching 2.7m tall and weighing 3,000\u2013 6,000kg.\nLove animals? You\u2019d love our magazine! Ask your parents to check out Nat Geo Kids magazine!\n(AD)\n3) There\u2019s an easy way to tell the African elephants apart from their Asian cousins \u2013 their ears! African elephants have large ears shaped like the continent of Africa! Asian elephants\u2019 ears are smaller and shaped like India. Cool, huh?\n4) You can tell a lot about an elephant by looking at their tusks! Elephant tusks never stop growing, so enormous tusks can be a sign of an old elephant. Both male and female African elephants grow tusks, but only male Asian elephants grow them. A tusk-less adult elephant is likely to be a female Asian elephant.\n5) Until recently, African Forest elephants were thought to be a subspecies of the African elephant, but new research discovered that they are actually a separate species entirely. These elephants live in the tropical forests of Africa\u2019s Congo Basin. They have straighter tusks and more rounded ears than Savannah elephants.\n6) These magnificent mammals spend between 12 to 18 hours eating grass, plants and fruit every single day! They use their long trunks to smell their food and lift it up into their mouth \u2013 yum!\n7) All that eating means one thing, gang, an awful lot of poo! Each elephant creates about one tonne of poo per week, which keeps the soil fertile and disperses tree seeds. Elephants also dig waterholes and create footpaths, literally changing the landscape around them!\n8) In Mount Elgon National Park in Kenya, a group of elephants use their tusks to mine for salt in underground caves! They feel their way around with their trunks and eat the salts by breaking them off with their tusks.\n9) Elephants have created their very own sunscreen! After a river or swamp bath, they\u2019ll throw mud and sand up and over themselves to protect their skin from the hot, burning sun. Clever!\n10) Sadly, elephants are in trouble. Many are killed by humans for their ivory tusks, because they\u2019ve come into conflict with communities or simply for sport. There are far fewer Asian elephants (which are categorised as Endangered) than there are African elephants (listed as Vulnerable \u2013 at risk of becoming Endangered). Asian elephants also face threats from tourist attractions where people pay to ride on their backs or watch them paint pictures using their trunks.\nClick here to learn more about threats to the Asian elephant and what is being done to help.\nWhat did you think of our elephant facts?

Lion attacks are rare. Top Speed: 30 Kph (15.5 Mph) No. of Species:\n3 Conservation Status:\nAfrican elephants are listed as vulnerable, while Asian elephants are endangered.\nElephants are herbivorous and live in various areas, including savannahs, rainforests, deserts, and marshes. They tend to stay close to water sources.\nElephants are known for their trunks, which are actually a long nose used for smelling, breathing, trumpeting, drinking, and also for picking up things, like a meal.\nElephants can also have tusks, which are present for both male (bulls) and female (cows) African elephants, and Asian male elephants. Asian females either have very small tusks, or no tusks at all.\nElephant Species\nThere are three recognised species of elephants \u2013 The African bush elephant (also known as the Savanna elephant), the African forest elephant and the Asian elephant.\nThe African elephants used to be considered one species, until genetic studies concluded that they were separated between 2-7 million years ago.\nAfrican elephants are typically significantly larger than their Asian elephant cousins, with bulls growing up to 13 feet (4 meters) tall and weigh between 4,000-7,500 kg, while Asian elephants reach no more than 11.5 feet (3.5 meters), and weigh less, between 3000-6,000 kg.\nAfrican elephants ears are larger, and reach up and cover the neck, while their skin is also more wrinkled. Asian elephants have a twin-domed head with an indent in the middle (known as \u2018dorsal bumps\u2019), whereas African elephants have fuller, more rounded heads. African elephants also have concave backs, while Asian elephants have convex or level backs.\nThe African elephant is on the left, in comparison to the Asian elephant, on the right.\nBoth Asian and African elephants migrate, and generally follow the same migratory routes annually in search of favoured climate for water, and food.\nSadly, the elephant population has slowly decreased since the turn of the 20th century. At that time, African elephants numbered in the millions, and Asian elephants totaled about 100,000. Currently, the African elephant population is down to an estimated 300,000 and are considered vulnerable by the IUCN. Asian elephant\u2019s numbers range from 40,000 to 50,000 and are listed as endangered.\nElephant Behavior\nElephants form deep, intimate family bonds and live in groups, known as a herd. These herds have a matriarchal head, which means the oldest, and usually largest, female in the group will lead the herd. She is referred to as the matriarch. A family usually includes the mother, her sisters, daughters and their babies.\nThe size of the herd will depend entirely on the size of the family and the terrain they have chosen to live on. Normally a herd of elephants can number between 8 and 100, however there have been recorded aggregations of up to 1,000 around watering holes.\nThe entire matriarchal herd will protect a newborn calf, and help to raise it. Males have a very different behavior pattern. They usually leave the herd between the ages of 12 and 15 after reaching puberty. Males who have left the family unit will either live temporarily with other males, or may just be alone for the rest of their lives. Even after pursuing and selecting a female mate, a male elephant will then resume his predominantly nomadic and solitary life, to roam alone.\nElephants typically eat leaves, grasses, bark, roots and bamboo and can spend 16 hours a day collecting food. They will also eat various ground crops, including sugar cane and bananas. The average adult elephant can consume between 300 and 400 pounds of food daily.\nInteresting Elephant Facts\n1. Elephants are the largest living land animals on earth.\nThe African bull elephant can grow as large as 13 feet (4 meters) tall, weigh between 4,000-7,500 kg and can have tusks as long as 6.5 feet (2 meters) in length weighing 100 pounds each (45 kg).\n2. Elephants have the largest brain in all of the animal kingdom, and are smart too.\nTheir brains can weigh up to a whopping 5.4kg. Size doesn\u2019t necessarily equate directly to intelligence, however evidence suggests that elephants are some of the most intelligent, social and empathic animals on the planet.\n3. Elephants can hear and communicate through the ground.\nThey can communicate long distances by foot stomping, and creating a low-frequency rumble that generates seismic waves in the ground that can travel nearly 20 miles. The sensitive skin in an elephant\u2019s trunk and feet helps them to pick up the message, and interpret them as a warning, or distant danger.\n4. Elephants can hear the sound of approaching clouds. Their hearing allows them to sense low-frequency rumbles, and communicate in \u2018infrasounds\u2019, which are sounds with pitches below the range of human hearing.\nThese infrasounds are produced in the same way as humans speak, via the larynx. The frequencies are as low as the lowest notes of a pipe organ, which cannot be heard by humans.\n5. An elephants graveyard is a mythical place, where legend says elephants walk to die alone at a certain age or time.\nHowever, these so-called elephant graveyards are entirely natural and often result from environmental factors, like drought or poisoning.\n6. Elephants are the strongest animals alive, and can lift up to 770 pounds (350 kg) with their trunks.\nElephants have long been used to transport people and goods, and they have been heavily utilised in the logging industry. There are reports that elephants have lifted as much as 1,100 pounds (500 kg) of tree logs, by leaning back and using it\u2019s weight for more power.\n7. Elephants can\u2019t use their trunks right away.\nA newborn elephant calf trunk has no muscle tone. This means that it will have to suckle through its mouth. Although the calf will eventually gain full control of its trunk, it won\u2019t happen until it is several months old. It takes calves time to learn to use them, and at first they often tread on their own trunks.\n8. An elephants tusks are modified second incisors in the upper jaw, which replace their milk teeth between 6-12 months old.\nThe visible, ivory part of the tusk is made of dentine with an outer layer of enamel and are essentially no different to other teeth.\n9. Both female and male African elephants have tusks, but only male Asian elephants have tusks.\nAn elephants tusks are used for digging, debarking trees, moving trees and branches when clearing a path and for attacking and defending when fighting.\n10. When on the move, a heard of elephants often walk in single file.\nThe matriarch elephant leads the herd, while her siblings and their offspring follow behind. Calves will follow mothers obediently, sometimes holding onto their mothers tails with their trunks to keep up.\n11. Elephants are the only animals that have an in-built snorkel.\nBy raising the tips of their trunks above the water\u2019s surface, elephants can cross rivers totally submerged walking on the river bed.\n12. There have been many observations of elephants showing altruism and empathy towards other species.\nThey are known to become friendly with humans, dogs and other animals. There have also been reports of elephants rescuing other animals from wild predators.\n13. Elephants can sleep standing up and only need a couple of hours of sleep each day.\nBut not always, they do lay down every few nights to sleep.\n14. Elephants can curl up together and sleep.\nThis elephant family was captured sleeping together by a drone.\n15. Elephants use mud as sunscreen to protect their sensitive skin from ultraviolet light.\nWhile it\u2019s skin is 2.5cm (1 inch) thick and generally tough, it\u2019s extremely sensitive, and requires protection from the sun and insect bites.\n16. Elephants are emotional creatures, that mourn the dead and grieve. They can also shed tears, and often try and bury their dead.\nElephants have been observed staying with the dead in apparent mourning, and appear to experience grief similar to that of humans at the loss of a relative.\n17. Elephants are strong swimmers and have been recorded swimming up to 50 kilometers across water, and can swim for six hours continuously without rest.\nExperts believe that elephants swam from Southern India to Sri Lanka where they settled.\n18. Wild elephants walk between 3.2 to 12.0 kilometers a day, in comparison to elephants in captivity in American zoos, which walk on average of 5.3 kilometers each day.\nHow far an elephant will walk depends on the age, sex, season, availability of food and much more.\n19. Female elephants have the longest pregnancy of any mammal at 22-months, and give birth to BIG babies.\nA litter for the average elephant family consists of one calf. Although twins are born, it is rare. The newborn calf will weigh between 200 and 250 pounds (90 to 115 kg).\n20. The saying \u2018an Elephant never forgets\u2019, holds some truth. Elephants have incredible memories.\nTwo elephants were observed seemingly recognising each other, after crossing each others paths at a circus, some 23 years earlier.\n21. Elephants have \u2018fingers\u2019 on the end of their trunks. An African elephant has two trunk tip fingers, where as the Asian elephant only has one finger on the tip of its trunk.\nDue to this, the African elephant is able to pick up objects delicately, while the Asian elephant can only scoop up objects by using its entire trunk.\n22. The Asian elephant population has declined by over 50% in the last three generations.\nThe main threats to the Asian elephant today are habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation, largely due to an expanding human population. Poaching is also a threat, due to their valuable tusks and other body parts for leather or meat.\n23. Poaching sadly continues to impact elephant populations.\nAlthough it is illegal and in some countries and the penalties are stiff, poaching for ivory has continued to contribute to the drop in numbers of wild elephants in the world.\nElephant Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification\nKingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Vertebrata Order: Mammalia Family: Elephantidae\nSpecies & Subspecies List"}

Check out our list of 115 elephants to learn more about these wonderful creatures! Most of us are well aware of elephants and have even seen at least one of them in person at a zoo or circus. There are many great facts about the elephant though that you should learn about, and this is the place to do so.\nElephants are the largest of all land animals in the world. It takes a female 22 months from conception to have a baby. This is longer than any other animal in the world. A newborn elephant can stand up shortly after being born. They can weigh up to 260 pounds. The average life span for an elephant in the wild is from 50 to 70 years. They oldest known elephant in the world lived to be 82 years of age. The heaviest elephant in the world weighed 26,000 pounds. It is only a myth that elephants are afraid of mice. Movies such as \u201cDumbo\u201d and pretty much any cartoon containing an elephant have perpetutated this myth for many decades, however the origin dates far further back in time (perhaps even as early as A.D. 77). The trunk of an elephant has more than 150,000 muscles and tendons in it. Elephants are herbivores. They eat a lot of different types of plants, mostly eating leaves, bark, fruits of trees and shrubs. Elephants have an excellent sense of smell and hearing but poor eyesight. Generally one tusk will be shorter than the other. This is because the elephant will use it more often for things. Just like people are either right or left handed it is believed that these animals rely upon a dominant tusk. The tusks of an elephant can weigh up to 200 pounds and can grow up to 10 feet in length. At 11 pounds, the elephant has a brain that is larger than any other animal in the world. For up to 16 hours a day elephants can be found feeding on a variety of plant life. They can consume from 300 to 600 pounds of food every single day. Baby elephants are blind at birth and rely upon their trunks and their mothers to help them. Most elephants in zoos, working, and in the circus are females as they seem to be easier to control. Males tend to go through cycles where they are instinctively aggressive. Males enter stages referred to as must where they are in a state of madness for a short period of time. Females can continue to have offspring until they are about 50 years old. They tend to have a new baby every 2 \u00bd to 4 years. Twins are extremely rare for elephants. Elephants are known to have a type of tuberculosis which can be transferred to humans. This is why those that work closely with them have to get a vaccination to prevent it. Reproduction can take place any time of the year for elephants. As long as they feel secure and they have plenty of food it is something that will regularly occur. Elephants can hold up to 4 gallons of water in their trunks at one time. The back part of the elephants ears is called its \u201cknuckles\u201d and it\u2019s known as the softest part of their body. There are only three species of elephants; the African Savannah elephant, African Forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. African elephants have large ears shaped like the continent of Africa. African elephants are usually around 10 feet tall, weighing 8,000 to 16,000 pounds. Asian elephants are slightly smaller, around 9 feet tall and weighing 6,000 to 13,000 pounds. When elephants greet each other, they twine their trunks together. African elephants can weigh up to 14,000 pounds, which is about the weight of three cars. An elephants heart weighs between 27 and 46 pounds. Male elephants leave their family around the age of 14 years old. Female elephants live tight-knit lives with their families, while male elephants are more on the introverted side and live most of their lives by themselves. Elephants are the only mammal incapable of jumping or leaving the ground. Elephants can run up to 25 miles per hour, which is amazing for such a large creature. Elephants drink up to 160 liters of water a day. Elephants eat up to 50 tons of food each year. Elephants are able to hear sound waves way below the human hearing range, as they can hear sounds as low as 9 Hz. An elephant trunk is also called a proboscis. Baby elephants, or calves, sometimes suck their trunks just like human babies suck their thumbs. Check out some videos of cute baby elephants here. Elephants will throw mud and sand over themselves to protect themselves from the hot sun. Elephants dig waterholes and create footpaths for themselves. An elephants dominant tusk is called the master tusk. Female elephants can have babies until they are in their 50\u2019s. Newborn babies can quickly stand up after they are born. Baby elephants usually weigh around 48 pounds. When elephants swim, they use their trunk as a snorkel. Having baby elephant twins is highly uncommon. Elephants only sleep for 2 to 3 hours a day. Elephant families are led by the oldest female in the group. Asian elephants have one more toenail on each foot than African elephants. Asian elephants have five toenails on the front feet and four on the back, while African elephants have four on the front and three on the back feet. Asian elephants have smaller tusks than African elephants. Elephants eyelashes are pretty long. In fact, they can measure up to five inches in length. Elephants making purring noises, much like cats do. Check out this video as a good example. Elephants skin is highly sensitive and over an inch thick, loaded with nerve endings. Elephant\u2019s life expectancy is 60 to 70 years old. The oldest elephant to live was an Asian elephant named Lin Wang that died at 86 years old. Elephants show similar emotions like humans do. If a member of their herd dies, they show sadness and grieve the loss of their family members long after they have passed away. An elephants tusk can weigh up to 22 pounds each. Elephants do not have the best eyesight, but they have an amazing sense of smell. Elephants have four molars, two on top and two on the bottom of their mouth. Each molar weighs about five pounds each. They can only grow six sets of molars over their lifetime. An elephant\u2019s tusks continues to grow throughout their life. An adult males tusk grows about 7 inches each year. Elephants wave their trunks to help them smell better. Elephants are able to identify themselves in a mirror, The most expensive coffee brands in the world make coffee from the droppings of Thai elephants. Elephants are actually very terrified of bees. Elephants use their ears to radiate excess heat away from their bodies. Elephants use their trunks to make loud noises, or \u201ctrumpet\u201d to scare away enemies. An elephant\u2019s trunk is sensitive enough to pick up a blade of grass but strong enough to rip branches off a tree. The word elephant comes from the Greek word \u201celephas\u201d which means \u201civory\u201d. Elephants don\u2019t like peanuts. Male elephants usually leave the matriarch group when they are 12 to 15, but not all male elephants are loners. Some will live in all male groups. Elephants can detect sounds with their feet. They can detect deep pitched sounds that vibrate through the ground. African elephants can detect water sources from up to 12 miles away. Research studies have been done where they found out that elephants can identify a person\u2019s gender and age based on the sound of their voice. Elephants can identify others based on how they smell. Elephants take regular mud baths to protect their skin from the hot sun and insect bites. Elephants sometimes comfort their distressed friends by stroking them with their trunks. Elephants usually do not have any predators besides lions that will attack elephants sometimes, if they are young or weak. The African elephant is labeled as a vulnerable species while Asian elephants are endangered species. Elephants brains have more complex folds that other animals, which makes them one of the most intelligent animals on the planet. Elephants have a developed hippocampus, which is the region in the brain that controls emotions and spatial awareness. An elephant in a zoo in Korea has learned to mimic commands zoo keepers gave it, and it has learned eight words and their context. Elephants have been known to induce their own labor by self-medicating with plants. Male elephants court female elephants by using rituals involving different affectionate gestures and nuzzles. Once a baby is born, mothers will have several \u201cbabysitters\u201d to take care of the calf so she has time to eat and produce enough milk for her baby. To protect their babies, adult elephants will cover baby elephants in sand as they sleep to protect them from the sun. If an elephant herd comes across a lone elephant who has died, they will still grieve or show respects to it. Elephants sleep standing up. African elephants will avoid eating a type of acacia tree because many ants live in these trees and they don\u2019t want to get ants in their sensitive trunks. Female and male African elephants have tusks, but only the male Asian elephants have tusks. Elephants can recognize other elephant carcasses. Elephants breathe through their trunks 80% of the time. Elephants sweat glands are between their toenails. Asian elephants have fairly smooth skin. African elephants have darker, wrinkled skin. When an elephant loses their last set of molars, they will eventually die because they cannot eat. Elephants feet are covered in a soft padding that helps support their weight. This padding helps them walk almost silently, even though they are huge. Elephants can lift up to 770 pounds with their trunk. Baby elephants can\u2019t use their trunk right away, because they have no muscle tone. A herd of elephants often walk in single file. Some elephants can swim for six hours without rest. Elephants are considered the strongest mammal on the planet. Elephants have \u201cfingers\u201d on the end of their trunks. An African elephant has two trunk tip fingers and the Asian elephant has only one finger on the tip of its trunk. Elephants can hear each others calls from 5 miles away. Elephants can only give birth once every 5 years. Some baby elephants may continue to take milk from their mother for up to three years. Elephants become fully independent by age eight. Asian elephants are usually found in Southeast and South Asia. African elephants are found in sub-Saharan Africa. A matriarch of a herd will usually teach young ones how to behave with other elephants. Matriarchs are also responsible for remembering where the best places are to shelter and find food and water. Male elephants usually take no responsibility in raising their young ones. Elephants have saggy or loosely fit skin. This helps keep moisture trapped underneath the skin, allowing the body to stay cool. There are 8 major muscles on each side of an elephants trunk. Elephants hair growth reduces over time. Herds of African elephants roam through 37 different countries in the continent. Herds of elephants may contain up to 100 family members.\nWe hope you enjoyed our list of the top 115 facts about elephants.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephant Facts - Elephant Aid International", "url": "https://elephantaidinternational.org/elephant-facts/", "text": "Elephants have one of the most closely knit societies of any living species, organized into birth families, bond groups, clans and independent bulls. Their society is fission-fusion: groups come together to socialize and exchange information, then disperse.\nElephants\u2019 ability to form lifelong bonds extends to their relationships with other species. Elephants who are separated from their family as calves will bond with their caregivers and other species of animals.\nThe Elephant Matriarch\nThe female who leads elephant family groups is called the matriarch, She is usually the oldest, most respected female, and has proven her wisdom and leadership abilities over time. She is usually also the daughter of the previous matriarch, indicating that leadership abilities pass from generation to generation.\nThe matriarch is the hub of a complex social network and is crucial to the wellbeing and success of her family. She nurtures strong bonds among her family members, balancing the needs of the group with the need to travel to food and water resources. This cohesiveness is crucial in crises, such as droughts, when the other elephants rely on her to make life-and-death decisions about when and where they\u2019ll migrate.\nA wise, experienced matriarch gives her extended family a survival advantage over families led by younger, less experienced females. She determines who is in her family\u2019s social network, keeps her family out of danger and teaches the females how to care for their offspring.\nWhen the matriarch dies, her oldest daughter usually succeeds her.\nThe Bull\nMale elephants are born into a matriarchal society, a female-dominated world of mothers and maternal helpers.\nFrom a young age, male elephants seem to gravitate toward other males of similar ages. As they play, they test their strength, build self-knowledge and acquire skills they will need as they age.\nMales leave their birth families at an average age of 14, but they don't leave family life altogether. Instead, they move off and join another family, or move from family to family.\nBulls spend 80% of their time with family groups until the age of about 25. Each new herd is less welcoming to the newcomer than his birth family\u2019s herd. The bull eventually leaves family herds altogether and moves into the loosely held social network of bulls, which are likely to be composed of elephants who are genetically related to each other.\nAlthough the bonds between males are looser and more random than those of females, bulls also have friends and serve as leaders and teachers.\nThe oldest males seem to have the strongest influence on the cohesion of the herd. Younger males go off on their own for long periods of time, exploring and going from one bachelor herd to another. The older bulls, however, are more likely to encourage interactions among the younger bulls who are with them.\nOlder bulls also act as teachers and leaders within the herd. For example, older bulls will often get down on their knees to play-fight with the younger males, demonstrating their understanding that adolescents are learning and acquiring life skills from their interactions\nElephant Family\nElephants have one of the most closely knit societies of any living species, based on the birth family. Birth families belong to bond groups and extended clans.\nAsian family groups usually number 6 to 7; African, 8 to 10. An elephant family consists of one or more related adult females and immature offspring, led by the matriarch, who is usually the oldest and most respected female. Mothers, daughters and sisters usually stay together all their lives. Males leave the family group when they are about 10 years old, cycling in and out of loosely held bachelor herds.\nFamily members show extraordinary teamwork and are highly cooperative in group defense, resource acquisition, offspring care and decision-making.\nClose family ties are crucial to birth and childcare. A pregnant elephant\u2019s mother and sisters support her during the birth and help raise the calf. Younger female family members act as allomothers, practicing their nurturing skills by babysitting the calf.\nLike humans, elephants form deep, long-lasting bonds with their friends and families. Elephants who are separated from their family as calves and forced into captivity will also bond with their human caregivers and other species of animals.\nElephant Bond Groups\nAs tight-knit as they are, if an elephant family gets too large, it can split in two. It\u2019s smart because both families can forage more effectively if they split up and explore different territories.\nTypically, such a split would take place between cousins, and usually not sisters or mothers and daughters. These split families, or \u201cbond groups\u201d may include as many as five or more families, and up to 50 or more individuals. The related groups will continue to associate and occupy the same home range, staying within a mile of each other and keeping in touch through rumbling calls.\nAlthough the ties between individuals across the bond group are weaker than those within a family, bond group members also have close and friendly ties, form alliances against aggressors, assist in the care of another's offspring, defend one another in times of danger and greet one another in a special way.\nThe cohesiveness of these groups is dependent on the personalities of the individual members and how closely related they are. Most important, the strength of the matriarch's leadership will influence the nature of the relationships among members of the bond group.\nThe Elephant Clan\nThe elephant clan is defined as those families who share the same dry season home range (foraging areas when resources are in scarce supply). A clan can include several hundred elephants and can be identified by how its members interact with each other. During times of plenty, several clans may gather to share bountiful food and a lively social life.\nAfrican savanna elephants typically live in larger family groups than either of the two other elephant species (African Forest and Asian), and they are more often found in large aggregations."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephant - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant", "text": "Large terrestrial mammals with trunks from Africa and Asia\nThis article is about a paraphyletic group. For close extinct relatives, see Elephantidae . For other uses, see Elephant (disambiguation)\nElephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are an informal grouping within the proboscidean family Elephantidae. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of proboscideans; extinct members include the mastodons. Elephantidae also contains several extinct groups, including the mammoths and straight-tusked elephants. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs. The distinctive features of all elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk is used for breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. The pillar-like legs carry their great weight.\nElephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats, including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and they stay near water when it is accessible. They are considered to be keystone species, due to their impact on their environments. Elephants have a fission\u2013fusion society, in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Females (cows) tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups, which do not include bulls, are usually led by the oldest cow, known as the matriarch.\nMales (bulls) leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate. They enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance over other males as well as reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness, and appear to show empathy for dying and dead family members.\nAfrican bush elephants and Asian elephants are listed as endangered and African forest elephants as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as working animals in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in circuses. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture.\nEtymology\nThe word \"elephant\" is based on the Latin elephas (genitive elephantis) (\"elephant\"), which is the Latinised form of the Greek \u1f10\u03bb\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03c2 (elephas) (genitive \u1f10\u03bb\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (elephantos), probably from a non-Indo-European language, likely Phoenician. It is attested in Mycenaean Greek as e-re-pa (genitive e-re-pa-to) in Linear B syllabic script. As in Mycenaean Greek, Homer used the Greek word to mean ivory, but after the time of Herodotus, it also referred to the animal. The word \"elephant\" appears in Middle English as olyfaunt (c.1300) and was borrowed from Old French oliphant (12th century).\nTaxonomy and phylogeny\nAfrotheria Afroinsectiphilia Tubulidentata Orycteropodidae Afroinsectivora Macroscelidea Macroscelididae Afrosoricida Chrysochloridae Tenrecidae Paenungulata Hyracoidea Procaviidae Tethytheria Proboscidea Elephantidae Sirenia Dugongidae Trichechidae A cladogram of the elephants within Afrotheria based on molecular evidence\nElephants belong to the family Elephantidae, the sole remaining family within the order Proboscidea which belongs to the superorder Afrotheria. Their closest extant relatives are the sirenians (dugongs and manatees) and the hyraxes, with which they share the clade Paenungulata within the superorder Afrotheria. Elephants and sirenians are further grouped in the clade Tethytheria.\nThree species of elephants are recognised; the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana) and forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) of sub-Saharan Africa, and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) of South and Southeast Asia. African elephants have larger ears, a concave back, more wrinkled skin, a sloping abdomen, and two finger-like extensions at the tip of the trunk. Asian elephants have smaller ears, a convex or level back, smoother skin, a horizontal abdomen that occasionally sags in the middle and one extension at the tip of the trunk. The looped ridges on the molars are narrower in the Asian elephant while those of the African are more diamond-shaped. The Asian elephant also has dorsal bumps on its head and some patches of depigmentation on its skin.\nAmong African elephants, forest elephants have smaller and more rounded ears and thinner and straighter tusks than bush elephants and are limited in range to the forested areas of western and Central Africa. Both were traditionally considered a single species, Loxodonta africana, but molecular studies have affirmed their status as separate species. In 2017, DNA sequence analysis showed that L. cyclotis is more closely related to the extinct Palaeoloxodon antiquus, than it is to L. africana, possibly undermining the genus Loxodonta as a whole.\nEvolution and extinct relatives\nOver 180 extinct members and three major evolutionary radiations of the order Proboscidea have been recorded. The earliest proboscids, the African Eritherium and Phosphatherium of the late Paleocene, heralded the first radiation. The Eocene included Numidotherium, Moeritherium, and Barytherium from Africa. These animals were relatively small and aquatic. Later on, genera such as Phiomia and Palaeomastodon arose; the latter likely inhabited forests and open woodlands. Proboscidean diversity declined during the Oligocene. One notable species of this epoch was Eritreum melakeghebrekristosi of the Horn of Africa, which may have been an ancestor to several later species. The beginning of the Miocene saw the second diversification, with the appearance of the deinotheres and the mammutids. The former were related to Barytherium and lived in Africa and Eurasia, while the latter may have descended from Eritreum and spread to North America.\nThe second radiation was represented by the emergence of the gomphotheres in the Miocene, which likely evolved from Eritreum and originated in Africa, spreading to every continent except Australia and Antarctica. Members of this group included Gomphotherium and Platybelodon. The third radiation started in the late Miocene and led to the arrival of the elephantids, which descended from, and slowly replaced, the gomphotheres. The African Primelephas gomphotheroides gave rise to Loxodonta, Mammuthus, and Elephas. Loxodonta branched off earliest around the Miocene and Pliocene boundary while Mammuthus and Elephas diverged later during the early Pliocene. Loxodonta remained in Africa while Mammuthus and Elephas spread to Eurasia, and the former reached North America. At the same time, the stegodontids, another proboscidean group descended from gomphotheres, spread throughout Asia, including the Indian subcontinent, China, southeast Asia, and Japan. Mammutids continued to evolve into new species, such as the American mastodon.\nAt the beginning of the Pleistocene, elephantids experienced a high rate of speciation. The Pleistocene also saw the arrival of Palaeoloxodon namadicus, the largest terrestrial mammal of all time. Loxodonta atlantica became the most common species in northern and southern Africa but was replaced by Elephas iolensis later in the Pleistocene. Only when Elephas disappeared from Africa did Loxodonta become dominant once again, this time in the form of the modern species. Elephas diversified into new species in Asia, such as E. hysudricus and E. platycephus; the latter the likely ancestor of the modern Asian elephant. Mammuthus evolved into several species, including the well-known woolly mammoth. Interbreeding appears to have been common among elephantid species, which in some cases led to species with three ancestral genetic components, such as the Palaeoloxodon antiquus. In the Late Pleistocene, most proboscidean species vanished during the Quaternary glaciation which killed off 50% of genera weighing over 5 kg (11 lb) worldwide.\nProboscideans experienced several evolutionary trends, such as an increase in size, which led to many giant species that stood up to 500 cm (16 ft 5 in) tall. As with other megaherbivores, including the extinct sauropod dinosaurs, the large size of elephants likely developed to allow them to survive on vegetation with low nutritional value. Their limbs grew longer and the feet shorter and broader. The feet were originally plantigrade and developed into a digitigrade stance with cushion pads and the sesamoid bone providing support. Early proboscideans developed longer mandibles and smaller craniums while more derived ones developed shorter mandibles, which shifted the head's centre of gravity. The skull grew larger, especially the cranium, while the neck shortened to provide better support for the skull. The increase in size led to the development and elongation of the mobile trunk to provide reach. The number of premolars, incisors and canines decreased.\nThe cheek teeth (molars and premolars) of proboscideans became larger and more specialized, especially after elephants started to switch from C3-plants to C4-grasses, which caused their teeth to undergo a three-fold increase in teeth height as well as substantial multiplication of lamellae after about five million years ago. Only in the last million years or so did they return to a diet mainly consisting of C3 trees and shrubs. The upper second incisors grew into tusks, which varied in shape from straight, to curved (either upward or downward), to spiralled, depending on the species. Some proboscideans developed tusks from their lower incisors. Elephants retain certain features from their aquatic ancestry, such as their middle ear anatomy.\nSeveral species of proboscideans lived on islands and experienced insular dwarfism. This occurred primarily during the Pleistocene when some elephant populations became isolated by fluctuating sea levels, although dwarf elephants did exist earlier in the Pliocene. These elephants likely grew smaller on islands due to a lack of large or viable predator populations and limited resources. By contrast, small mammals such as rodents develop gigantism in these conditions. Dwarf elephants are known to have lived in Indonesia, the Channel Islands of California, and several islands of the Mediterranean.\nAnatomy and morphology\nSize\nAfrican bush elephant skeleton\nElephants are the largest living terrestrial animals. African bush elephants are the largest species, with males being 304\u2013336 cm (10 ft 0 in \u2013 11 ft 0 in) tall at the shoulder with a body mass of 5.2\u20136.9 t (5.7\u20137.6 short tons) and females standing 247\u2013273 cm (8 ft 1 in \u2013 8 ft 11 in) tall at the shoulder with a body mass of 2.6\u20133.5 t (2.9\u20133.9 short tons). Male Asian elephants are usually about 261\u2013289 cm (8 ft 7 in \u2013 9 ft 6 in) tall at the shoulder and 3.5\u20134.6 t (3.9\u20135.1 short tons) whereas females are 228\u2013252 cm (7 ft 6 in \u2013 8 ft 3 in) tall at the shoulder and 2.3\u20133.1 t (2.5\u20133.4 short tons). African forest elephants are the smallest species, with males usually being around 209\u2013231 cm (6 ft 10 in \u2013 7 ft 7 in) tall at the shoulder and 1.7\u20132.3 t (1.9\u20132.5 short tons). Male African bush elephants are typically 23% taller than females, whereas male Asian elephants are only around 15% taller than females.\nBones\nThe skeleton of the elephant is made up of 326\u2013351 bones. The vertebrae are connected by tight joints, which limit the backbone's flexibility. African elephants have 21 pairs of ribs, while Asian elephants have 19 or 20 pairs.\nHead\nAn elephant's skull is resilient enough to withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction. The skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce the weight of the skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy. Because of the size of the head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support. Lacking a lacrimal apparatus, the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist. A durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe. The animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are considered dichromats and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light.\nAfrican bush elephant with ears spread in a threat or attentive position; note the visible blood vessels\nEars\nElephant ears have thick bases with thin tips. The ear flaps, or pinnae, contain numerous blood vessels called capillaries. Warm blood flows into the capillaries, helping to release excess body heat into the environment. This occurs when the pinnae are still, and the animal can enhance the effect by flapping them. Larger ear surfaces contain more capillaries, and more heat can be released. Of all the elephants, African bush elephants live in the hottest climates, and have the largest ear flaps. Elephants are capable of hearing at low frequencies and are most sensitive at 1 kHz (in close proximity to the Soprano C).\nTrunk\nAfrican bush elephant with its trunk raised, a behaviour often adopted when trumpeting Asian elephant drinking water with trunk\nThe trunk, or proboscis, is a fusion of the nose and upper lip, although in early fetal life, the upper lip and trunk are separated. The trunk is elongated and specialised to become the elephant's most important and versatile appendage. It contains up to 150,000 separate muscle fascicles, with no bone and little fat. These paired muscles consist of two major types: superficial (surface) and internal. The former are divided into dorsals, ventrals, and laterals while the latter are divided into transverse and radiating muscles. The muscles of the trunk connect to a bony opening in the skull. The nasal septum is composed of tiny muscle units that stretch horizontally between the nostrils. Cartilage divides the nostrils at the base. As a muscular hydrostat, the trunk moves by precisely coordinated muscle contractions. The muscles work both with and against each other. A unique proboscis nerve \u2013 formed by the maxillary and facial nerves \u2013 runs along both sides of the trunk.\nElephant trunks have multiple functions, including breathing, olfaction, touching, grasping, and sound production. The animal's sense of smell may be four times as sensitive as that of a bloodhound. The trunk's ability to make powerful twisting and coiling movements allows it to collect food, wrestle with other elephants, and lift up to 350 kg (770 lb). It can be used for delicate tasks, such as wiping an eye and checking an orifice, and is capable of cracking a peanut shell without breaking the seed. With its trunk, an elephant can reach items at heights of up to 7 m (23 ft) and dig for water under mud or sand. Individuals may show lateral preference when grasping with their trunks: some prefer to twist them to the left, others to the right. Elephants are capable of dilating their nostrils at a radius of nearly 30%, increasing the nasal volume by 64%, and can inhale at over 150 m/s (490 ft/s) which is around 30 times the speed of a human sneeze. Elephants can suck up food and water both to spray in the mouth and, in the case of the later, to sprinkle on their bodies. An adult Asian elephant is capable of holding 8.5 L (2.2 US gal) of water in its trunk. They will also spray dust or grass on themselves. When underwater, the elephant uses its trunk as a snorkel.\nThe African elephant has two finger-like extensions at the tip of the trunk that allow it to grasp and bring food to its mouth. The Asian elephant has only one and relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth. Asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks. Losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant's survival, although in rare cases, individuals have survived with shortened ones. One elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising on its hind legs and taking in grass with its lips. Floppy trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis in African bush elephants caused by the degradation of the peripheral nerves and muscles beginning at the tip.\nTeeth\nCloseup of the cheek teeth of a dead juvenile bush elephant Asian elephant eating tree bark, using its tusks to peel it off.\nElephants usually have 26 teeth: the incisors, known as the tusks, 12 deciduous premolars, and 12 molars. Unlike most mammals, which grow baby teeth and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are polyphyodonts that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in at the back of the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. The second set of chewing teeth falls out at four to six years old. The third set falls out at 9\u201315 years of age and set four lasts until 18\u201328 years of age. The fifth set of teeth falls out at the early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in African elephants.\nTusks\nThe tusks of an elephant are modified second incisors in the upper jaw. They replace deciduous milk teeth at 6\u201312 months of age and grow continuously at about 17 cm (7 in) a year. A newly developed tusk has a smooth enamel cap that eventually wears off. The dentine is known as ivory and its cross-section consists of crisscrossing line patterns, known as \"engine turning\", which create diamond-shaped areas. As a piece of living tissue, a tusk is relatively soft; it is as hard as the mineral calcite. Much of the tusk can be seen outside; the rest is in a socket in the skull. At least one-third of the tusk contains the pulp and some have nerves stretching to the tip. Thus it would be difficult to remove it without harming the animal. When removed, ivory begins to dry up and crack if not kept cool and moist. Tusks serve multiple purposes. They are used for digging for water, salt, and roots; debarking or marking trees; and for moving trees and branches when clearing a path. When fighting, they are used to attack and defend, and to protect the trunk.\nLike humans, who are typically right- or left-handed, elephants are usually right- or left-tusked. The dominant tusk, called the master tusk, is generally more worn down, as it is shorter with a rounder tip. For the African elephants, tusks are present in both males and females, and are around the same length in both sexes, reaching up to 300 cm (9 ft 10 in), but those of males tend to be thicker. In earlier times, elephant tusks weighing over 200 pounds (more than 90 kg) were not uncommon, though it is rare today to see any over 100 pounds (45 kg).\nIn the Asian species, only the males have large tusks. Female Asians have very small tusks, or none at all. Tuskless males exist and are particularly common among Sri Lankan elephants. Asian males can have tusks as long as Africans', but they are usually slimmer and lighter; the largest recorded was 302 cm (9 ft 11 in) long and weighed 39 kg (86 lb). Hunting for elephant ivory in Africa and Asia has led to natural selection for shorter tusks and tusklessness.\nSkin\nAn African forest elephant covering its skin with mud\nAn elephant's skin is generally very tough, at 2.5 cm (1 in) thick on the back and parts of the head. The skin around the mouth, anus, and inside of the ear is considerably thinner. Elephants typically have grey skin, but African elephants look brown or reddish after wallowing in coloured mud. Asian elephants have some patches of depigmentation, particularly on the forehead and ears and the areas around them. Calves have brownish or reddish hair, especially on the head and back. As elephants mature, their hair darkens and becomes sparser, but dense concentrations of hair and bristles remain on the end of the tail as well as the chin, genitals and the areas around the eyes and ear openings. Normally the skin of an Asian elephant is covered with more hair than its African counterpart. Their hair is thought to be for thermoregulation, helping them lose heat in their hot environments.\nAn elephant uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting its skin from ultraviolet light. Although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive. Without regular mud baths to protect it from burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is many times smaller than that of a human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.\nLegs, locomotion, and posture\nAn Asian elephant walking\nTo support the animal's weight, an elephant's limbs are positioned more vertically under the body than in most other mammals. The long bones of the limbs have cancellous bone in place of medullary cavities. This strengthens the bones while still allowing haematopoiesis. Both the front and hind limbs can support an elephant's weight, although 60% is borne by the front. Since the limb bones are placed on top of each other and under the body, an elephant can stand still for long periods of time without using much energy. Elephants are incapable of rotating their front legs, as the ulna and radius are fixed in pronation; the \"palm\" of the manus faces backward. The pronator quadratus and the pronator teres are either reduced or absent. The circular feet of an elephant have soft tissues or \"cushion pads\" beneath the manus or pes, which distribute the weight of the animal. They appear to have a sesamoid, an extra \"toe\" similar in placement to a giant panda's extra \"thumb\", that also helps in weight distribution. As many as five toenails can be found on both the front and hind feet.\nElephants can move both forwards and backwards, but cannot trot, jump, or gallop. They use only two gaits when moving on land: the walk and a faster gait similar to running. In walking, the legs act as pendulums, with the hips and shoulders rising and falling while the foot is planted on the ground. With no \"aerial phase\", the fast gait does not meet all the criteria of running, although the elephant uses its legs much like other running animals, with the hips and shoulders falling and then rising while the feet are on the ground. Fast-moving elephants appear to 'run' with their front legs, but 'walk' with their hind legs and can reach a top speed of 25 km/h (16 mph). At this speed, most other quadrupeds are well into a gallop, even accounting for leg length. Spring-like kinetics could explain the difference between the motion of elephants and other animals. During locomotion, the cushion pads expand and contract, and reduce both the pain and noise that would come from a very heavy animal moving. Elephants are capable swimmers. They have been recorded swimming for up to six hours without touching the bottom, and have swum as far as 48 km (30 mi) at a stretch and at speeds of up to 2.1 km/h (1 mph).\nOrgans\nAfrican elephant heart in a jar\nThe brain of an elephant weighs 4.5\u20135.5 kg (10\u201312 lb) compared to 1.6 kg (4 lb) for a human brain. While the elephant brain is larger overall, it is proportionally smaller. At birth, an elephant's brain already weighs 30\u201340% of its adult weight. The cerebrum and cerebellum are well developed, and the temporal lobes are so large that they bulge out laterally. The throat of an elephant appears to contain a pouch where it can store water for later use. The larynx of the elephant is the largest known among mammals. The vocal folds are long and are attached close to the epiglottis base. When comparing an elephant's vocal folds to those of a human, an elephant's are longer, thicker, and have a larger cross-sectional area. In addition, they are tilted at 45 degrees and positioned more anteriorly than a human's vocal folds.\nThe heart of an elephant weighs 12\u201321 kg (26\u201346 lb). It has a double-pointed apex, an unusual trait among mammals. In addition, the ventricles separate near the top of the heart, a trait they share with sirenians. When standing, the elephant's heart beats approximately 30 times per minute. Unlike many other animals, the heart rate speeds up by 8 to 10 beats per minute when the elephant is lying down. The blood vessels in most of the body are wide and thick and can withstand high blood pressures. The lungs are attached to the diaphragm, and breathing relies mainly on the diaphragm rather than the expansion of the ribcage. Connective tissue exists in place of the pleural cavity. This may allow the animal to deal with the pressure differences when its body is underwater and its trunk is breaking the surface for air, although this explanation has been questioned. Another possible function for this adaptation is that it helps the animal suck up water through the trunk. Elephants inhale mostly through the trunk, although some air goes through the mouth. They have a hindgut fermentation system, and their large and small intestines together reach 35 m (115 ft) in length. The majority of an elephant's food intake goes undigested despite the process lasting up to a day.\nA male elephant's testes are located internally near the kidneys. The elephant's penis can reach a length of 100 cm (39 in) and a diameter of 16 cm (6 in) at the base. It is S-shaped when fully erect and has a Y-shaped orifice. The female has a well-developed clitoris at up to 40 cm (16 in). The vulva is located between the hind legs instead of near the tail as in most mammals. Determining pregnancy status can be difficult due to the animal's large abdominal cavity. The female's mammary glands occupy the space between the front legs, which puts the suckling calf within reach of the female's trunk. Elephants have a unique organ, the temporal gland, located in both sides of the head. This organ is associated with sexual behaviour, and males secrete a fluid from it when in musth. Females have also been observed with secretions from the temporal glands.\nBody temperature\nElephants are homeotherms, and maintain their average body temperature at ~ 36 \u00b0C, with minimum 35.2 \u00b0C during cool season, and maximum 38.0 \u00b0C during hot dry season. Sweat glands are absent in the elephant's skin, but water diffuses through the skin, allowing cooling by evaporative loss. Other physiological or behavioral features may assist with thermoregulation such as flapping ears, mud bathing, spraying water on the skin, seeking shade, and adopting different walking patterns. In addition, the interconnected crevices in the elephant's skin is thought to impede dehydration and improve thermal regulation over a long period of time.\nBehaviour and life history\nEcology and activities\nAn Asian elephant feeding on grass in Sri Lanka An African bush elephant using its prehensile trunk for foraging\nThe African bush elephant can be found in habitats as diverse as dry savannahs, deserts, marshes, and lake shores, and in elevations from sea level to mountains above the snow line. Forest elephants mainly live in equatorial forests but will enter gallery forests and ecotones between forests and savannahs. Asian elephants prefer areas with a mix of grasses, low woody plants, and trees, primarily inhabiting dry thorn-scrub forests in southern India and Sri Lanka and evergreen forests in Malaya. Elephants are herbivorous and will eat leaves, twigs, fruit, bark, grass and roots. They are born with sterile intestines and require bacteria obtained from their mother's feces to digest vegetation. African elephants are mostly browsers while Asian elephants are mainly grazers. They can consume as much as 150 kg (330 lb) of food and 40 L (11 US gal) of water in a day. Elephants tend to stay near water sources. Major feeding bouts take place in the morning, afternoon and night. At midday, elephants rest under trees and may doze off while standing. Sleeping occurs at night while the animal is lying down. Elephants average 3\u20134 hours of sleep per day. Both males and family groups typically move 10\u201320 km (6\u201312 mi) a day, but distances as far as 90\u2013180 km (56\u2013112 mi) have been recorded in the Etosha region of Namibia. Elephants go on seasonal migrations in search of food, water, minerals, and mates. At Chobe National Park, Botswana, herds travel 325 km (202 mi) to visit the river when the local waterholes dry up.\nBecause of their large size, elephants have a huge impact on their environments and are considered keystone species. Their habit of uprooting trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into grasslands; when they dig for water during drought, they create waterholes that can be used by other animals. They can enlarge waterholes when they bathe and wallow in them. At Mount Elgon, elephants excavate caves that are used by ungulates, hyraxes, bats, birds and insects. Elephants are important seed dispersers; African forest elephants ingest and defecate seeds, with either no effect or a positive effect on germination. The seeds are typically dispersed in large amounts over great distances. In Asian forests, large seeds require giant herbivores like elephants and rhinoceros for transport and dispersal. This ecological niche cannot be filled by the next largest herbivore, the tapir. Because most of the food elephants eat goes undigested, their dung can provide food for other animals, such as dung beetles and monkeys. Elephants can have a negative impact on ecosystems. At Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda, the overabundance of elephants has threatened several species of small birds that depend on woodlands. Their weight can compact the soil, which causes the rain to run off, leading to erosion.\nForest elephant in habitat. It is considered to be an important seed disperser.\nElephants typically coexist peacefully with other herbivores, which will usually stay out of their way. Some aggressive interactions between elephants and rhinoceros have been recorded. At Aberdare National Park, Kenya, a rhino attacked an elephant calf and was killed by the other elephants in the group. At Hluhluwe\u2013Umfolozi Game Reserve, South Africa, introduced young orphan elephants went on a killing spree that claimed the lives of 36 rhinos during the 1990s, but ended with the introduction of older males. The size of adult elephants makes them nearly invulnerable to predators. Calves may be preyed on by lions, spotted hyenas, and wild dogs in Africa and tigers in Asia. The lions of Savuti, Botswana, have adapted to hunting elephants, mostly calves, juveniles or even sub-adults, during the dry season, and a pride of 30 lions has been normally recorded killing juvenile individuals between the ages of four and eleven years, and a young bull of about 15 years in an exceptional case. There are rare reports of adult Asian elephants falling prey to tigers. Elephants appear to distinguish between the growls of larger predators like tigers and smaller predators like leopards (which have not been recorded killing calves); they react to leopards less fearfully and more aggressively. Elephants tend to have high numbers of parasites, particularly nematodes, compared to other herbivores. This is due to lower predation pressures that would otherwise kill off many of the individuals with significant parasite loads.\nSocial organisation\nA family of African bush elephants\nFemale elephants spend their entire lives in tight-knit matrilineal family groups, some of which are made up of more than ten members, including three mothers and their dependent offspring, and are led by the matriarch which is often the eldest female. She remains leader of the group until death or if she no longer has the energy for the role; a study on zoo elephants showed that when the matriarch died, the levels of faecal corticosterone ('stress hormone') dramatically increased in the surviving elephants. When her tenure is over, the matriarch's eldest daughter takes her place; this occurs even if her sister is present. One study found that younger matriarchs are more likely than older ones to under-react to severe danger. Family groups may split after becoming too large for the available resources.\nThe social circle of the female elephant does not necessarily end with the small family unit. In the case of elephants in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, a female's life involves interaction with other families, clans, and subpopulations. Families may associate and bond with each other, forming what are known as bond groups which typically made of two family groups. During the dry season, elephant families may cluster together and form another level of social organisation known as the clan. Groups within these clans do not form strong bonds, but they defend their dry-season ranges against other clans. There are typically nine groups in a clan. The Amboseli elephant population is further divided into the \"central\" and \"peripheral\" subpopulations.\nSome elephant populations in India and Sri Lanka have similar basic social organisations. There appear to be cohesive family units and loose aggregations. They have been observed to have \"nursing units\" and \"juvenile-care units\". In southern India, elephant populations may contain family groups, bond groups and possibly clans. Family groups tend to be small, consisting of one or two adult females and their offspring. A group containing more than two adult females plus offspring is known as a \"joint family\". Malay elephant populations have even smaller family units and do not have any social organisation higher than a family or bond group. Groups of African forest elephants typically consist of one adult female with one to three offspring. These groups appear to interact with each other, especially at forest clearings.\nLone bull: Adult male elephants spend much of their time alone or in single-sex groups\nThe social life of the adult male is very different. As he matures, a male spends more time at the edge of his group and associates with outside males or even other families. At Amboseli, young males spend over 80% of their time away from their families when they are 14\u201315. When males permanently leave, they either live alone or with other males. The former is typical of bulls in dense forests. Asian males are usually solitary, but occasionally form groups of two or more individuals; the largest consisted of seven bulls. Larger bull groups consisting of over 10 members occur only among African bush elephants, the largest of which numbered up to 144 individuals. Bulls only return to the herd to breed or to socialize, they do not provide prenatal care to their offspring but rather play a fatherly role to younger bulls to show dominance.\nMale elephants can be quite sociable when not competing for dominance or mates, and will form long-term relationships. A dominance hierarchy exists among males, whether they range socially or solitarily. Dominance depends on the age, size and sexual condition, and when in groups, males follow the lead of the dominant bull. Young bulls may seek out the company and leadership of older, more experienced males, whose presence appears to control their aggression and prevent them from exhibiting \"deviant\" behaviour. Adult males and females come together for reproduction. Bulls associate with family groups if an oestrous cow is present.\nSexual behaviour\nMusth\nBull in musth\nAdult males enter a state of increased testosterone known as musth. In a population in southern India, males first enter musth at the age of 15, but it is not very intense until they are older than 25. At Amboseli, bulls under 24 do not go into musth, while half of those aged 25\u201335 and all those over 35 do. Young bulls appear to enter musth during the dry season (January\u2013May), while older bulls go through it during the wet season (June\u2013December). The main characteristic of a bull's musth is a fluid secreted from the temporal gland that runs down the side of his face. He may urinate with his penis still in his sheath, which causes the urine to spray on his hind legs. Behaviours associated with musth include walking with the head held high and swinging, picking at the ground with the tusks, marking, rumbling and waving only one ear at a time. This can last from a day to four months.\nMales become extremely aggressive during musth. Size is the determining factor in agonistic encounters when the individuals have the same condition. In contests between musth and non-musth individuals, musth bulls win the majority of the time, even when the non-musth bull is larger. A male may stop showing signs of musth when he encounters a musth male of higher rank. Those of equal rank tend to avoid each other. Agonistic encounters typically consist of threat displays, chases, and minor sparring with the tusks. Serious fights are rare.\nMating\nBull mating with a member of a female group\nElephants are polygynous breeders, and copulations are most frequent during the peak of the wet season. A cow in oestrus releases chemical signals (pheromones) in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate. A bull will follow a potential mate and assess her condition with the flehmen response, which requires the male to collect a chemical sample with his trunk and bring it to the vomeronasal organ. The oestrous cycle of a cow lasts 14\u201316 weeks with a 4\u20136-week follicular phase and an 8- to 10-week luteal phase. While most mammals have one surge of luteinizing hormone during the follicular phase, elephants have two. The first (or anovulatory) surge, could signal to males that the female is in oestrus by changing her scent, but ovulation does not occur until the second (or ovulatory) surge. Fertility rates in cows decline around 45\u201350 years of age.\nBulls engage in a behaviour known as mate-guarding, where they follow oestrous females and defend them from other males. Most mate-guarding is done by musth males, and females actively seek to be guarded by them, particularly older ones. Thus these bulls have more reproductive success. Musth appears to signal to females the condition of the male, as weak or injured males do not have normal musths. For young females, the approach of an older bull can be intimidating, so her relatives stay nearby to provide support and reassurance. During copulation, the male lays his trunk over the female's back. The penis is very mobile, being able to move independently of the pelvis. Before mounting, it curves forward and upward. Copulation lasts about 45 seconds and does not involve pelvic thrusting or ejaculatory pause. Elephant sperm must swim close to 2 m (6.6 ft) to reach the egg. By comparison, human sperm has to swim around only 76.2 mm (3.00 in).\nHomosexual behaviour is frequent in both sexes. As in heterosexual interactions, this involves mounting. Male elephants sometimes stimulate each other by playfighting and \"championships\" may form between old bulls and younger males. Female same-sex behaviours have been documented only in captivity where they are known to masturbate one another with their trunks.\nBirth and development\nAn African forest elephant mother bathing with her calf\nGestation in elephants typically lasts around two years with interbirth intervals usually lasting four to five years. Births tend to take place during the wet season. Calves are born 85 cm (33 in) tall and weigh around 120 kg (260 lb). Typically, only a single young is born, but twins sometimes occur. The relatively long pregnancy is maintained by five corpus luteums (as opposed to one in most mammals) and gives the foetus more time to develop, particularly the brain and trunk. As such, newborn elephants are precocial and quickly stand and walk to follow their mother and family herd. A new calf is usually the centre of attention for herd members. Adults and most of the other young will gather around the newborn, touching and caressing it with their trunks. For the first few days, the mother is intolerant of other herd members near her young. Alloparenting \u2013 where a calf is cared for by someone other than its mother \u2013 takes place in some family groups. Allomothers are typically two to twelve years old.\nFor the first few days, the newborn is unsteady on its feet and needs the support of its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.\nFor its first three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition, after which it begins to forage for vegetation and can use its trunk to collect water. At the same time, improvements in lip and leg coordination occur. Calves continue to suckle at the same rate as before until their sixth month, after which they become more independent when feeding. By nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's abilities to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. It still needs its mother for nutrition and protection from predators for at least another year. Suckling bouts tend to last 2\u20134 min/hr for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or older. Suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate, body condition and reproductive ability.\nPlay behaviour in calves differs between the sexes; females run or chase each other while males play-fight. The former are sexually mature by the age of nine years while the latter become mature around 14\u201315 years. Adulthood starts at about 18 years of age in both sexes. Elephants have long lifespans, reaching 60\u201370 years of age. Lin Wang, a captive male Asian elephant, lived for 86 years.\nCommunication\nTouching is an important form of communication among elephants. Individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition. Older elephants use trunk-slaps, kicks, and shoves to discipline younger ones. Individuals of any age and sex will touch each other's mouths, temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during meetings or when excited. This allows individuals to pick up chemical cues. Touching is especially important for mother\u2013calf communication. When moving, elephant mothers will touch their calves with their trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf is behind them. If a calf wants to rest, it will press against its mother's front legs and when it wants to suckle, it will touch her breast or leg.\nLow frequency rumble visualised with acoustic camera\nVisual displays mostly occur in agonistic situations. Elephants will try to appear more threatening by raising their heads and spreading their ears. They may add to the display by shaking their heads and snapping their ears, as well as throwing dust and vegetation. They are usually bluffing when performing these actions. Excited elephants may raise their trunks. Submissive ones will lower their heads and trunks, as well as flatten their ears against their necks, while those that accept a challenge will position their ears in a V shape.\nElephants produce several vocalisations, usually through the larynx, though some may be modified by the trunk. These include trumpets, roars, barks, snorts, growls and rumbles which may be produced for either short or long range communication. Elephants may produce infrasonic rumbles. For Asian elephants, these calls have a frequency of 14\u201324 Hz, with sound pressure levels of 85\u201390 dB and last 10\u201315 seconds. For African elephants, calls range from 15 to 35 Hz with sound pressure levels as high as 117 dB, allowing communication for many kilometres, with a possible maximum range of around 10 km (6 mi).\nElephants are known to communicate with seismics, vibrations produced by impacts on the earth's surface or acoustical waves that travel through it. An individual running or mock charging can create seismic signals that can be heard at travel distances of up to 32 km (20 mi). Seismic waveforms produced from predator alarm calls travel 16 km (10 mi).\nIntelligence and cognition\nElephant rolling a block to allow it to reach food\nElephants exhibit mirror self-recognition, an indication of self-awareness and cognition that has also been demonstrated in some apes and dolphins. One study of a captive female Asian elephant suggested the animal was capable of learning and distinguishing between several visual and some acoustic discrimination pairs. This individual was even able to score a high accuracy rating when re-tested with the same visual pairs a year later. Elephants are among the species known to use tools. An Asian elephant has been observed modifying branches and using them as flyswatters. Tool modification by these animals is not as advanced as that of chimpanzees. Elephants are popularly thought of as having an excellent memory. This could have a factual basis; they possibly have cognitive maps to allow them to remember large-scale spaces over long periods of time. Individuals appear to be able to keep track of the current location of their family members.\nScientists debate the extent to which elephants feel emotion. They appear to show interest in the bones of their own kind, regardless of whether they are related. As with chimpanzees and dolphins, a dying or dead elephant may elicit attention and aid from others, including those from other groups. This has been interpreted as expressing \"concern\"; however, others would dispute such an interpretation as being anthropomorphic; the Oxford Companion to Animal Behaviour (1987) advised that \"one is well advised to study the behaviour rather than attempting to get at any underlying emotion\".\nConservation\nStatus\nA family of African forest elephants in the Dzanga-Sangha Special Reserve wetlands, This species is considered to be critically endangered.\nAfrican bush elephants were listed as Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2021, and African forest elephants were listed as Critically Endangered in the same year. In 1979, Africa had an estimated minimum population of 1.3 million elephants, with a possible upper limit of 3.0 million. By 1989, the population was estimated to be 609,000; with 277,000 in Central Africa, 110,000 in eastern Africa, 204,000 in southern Africa, and 19,000 in western Africa. About 214,000 elephants were estimated to live in the rainforests, fewer than had previously been thought. From 1977 to 1989, elephant populations declined by 74% in East Africa. After 1987, losses in elephant numbers accelerated, and savannah populations from Cameroon to Somalia experienced a decline of 80%. African forest elephants had a total loss of 43%. Population trends in southern Africa were mixed, with anecdotal reports of losses in Zambia, Mozambique and Angola while populations grew in Botswana and Zimbabwe and were stable in South Africa. Conversely, studies in 2005 and 2007 found populations in eastern and southern Africa were increasing by an average annual rate of 4.0%. The IUCN estimated that total population in Africa is estimated at around to 415,000 individuals for both species combined as of 2016.\nAfrican elephants receive at least some legal protection in every country where they are found, but 70% of their range exists outside protected areas. Successful conservation efforts in certain areas have led to high population densities. As of 2008, local numbers were controlled by contraception or translocation. Large-scale cullings ceased in 1988 when Zimbabwe abandoned the practice. In 1989, the African elephant was listed under Appendix I by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), making trade illegal. Appendix II status (which allows restricted trade) was given to elephants in Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe in 1997 and South Africa in 2000. In some countries, sport hunting of the animals is legal; Botswana, Cameroon, Gabon, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe have CITES export quotas for elephant trophies. In June 2016, the First Lady of Kenya, Margaret Kenyatta, helped launch the East Africa Grass-Root Elephant Education Campaign Walk, organised by elephant conservationist Jim Nyamu. The event was conducted to raise awareness of the value of elephants and rhinos, to help mitigate human-elephant conflicts, and to promote anti-poaching activities.\nIn 2020, the IUCN listed the Asian elephant as endangered due to an almost 50% population decline over \"the last three generations\" Asian elephants once ranged from Syria and Iraq (the subspecies Elephas maximus asurus), to China (up to the Yellow River) and Java. It is now extinct in these areas, and the current range of Asian elephants is highly fragmented. The total population of Asian elephants is estimated to be around 40,000\u201350,000, although this may be a loose estimate. Around 60% of the population is in India. Although Asian elephants are declining in numbers overall, particularly in Southeast Asia, the population in the Western Ghats appears to be increasing.\nThreats\nThe poaching of elephants for their ivory, meat and hides has been one of the major threats to their existence. Historically, numerous cultures made ornaments and other works of art from elephant ivory, and its use rivalled that of gold. The ivory trade contributed to the African elephant population decline in the late 20th century. This prompted international bans on ivory imports, starting with the United States in June 1989, and followed by bans in other North American countries, western European countries, and Japan. Around the same time, Kenya destroyed all its ivory stocks. CITES approved an international ban on ivory that went into effect in January 1990. Following the bans, unemployment rose in India and China, where the ivory industry was important economically. By contrast, Japan and Hong Kong, which were also part of the industry, were able to adapt and were not badly affected. Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Malawi wanted to continue the ivory trade and were allowed to, since their local elephant populations were healthy, but only if their supplies were from elephants that had been culled or died of natural causes.\nThe ban allowed the elephant to recover in parts of Africa. In January 2012, 650 elephants in Bouba Njida National Park, Cameroon, were killed by Chadian raiders. This has been called \"one of the worst concentrated killings\" since the ivory ban. Asian elephants are potentially less vulnerable to the ivory trade, as females usually lack tusks. Still, members of the species have been killed for their ivory in some areas, such as Periyar National Park in India. China was the biggest market for poached ivory but announced they would phase out the legal domestic manufacture and sale of ivory products in May 2015, and in September 2015, China and the United States said \"they would enact a nearly complete ban on the import and export of ivory\" due to causes of extinction.\nOther threats to elephants include habitat destruction and fragmentation. The Asian elephant lives in areas with some of the highest human populations and may be confined to small islands of forest among human-dominated landscapes. Elephants commonly trample and consume crops, which contributes to conflicts with humans, and both elephants and humans have died by the hundreds as a result. Mitigating these conflicts is important for conservation. One proposed solution is the protection of wildlife corridors which gave the animals greater space and maintain the long term viability of large populations.\nAssociation with humans\nWorking animal\nWorking elephant as transport\nElephants have been working animals since at least the Indus Valley Civilization and continue to be used in modern times. There were 13,000\u201316,500 working elephants employed in Asia in 2000. These animals are typically captured from the wild when they are 10\u201320 years old when they can be trained quickly and easily, and will have a longer working life. They were traditionally captured with traps and lassos, but since 1950, tranquillisers have been used.\nIndividuals of the Asian species have been often trained as working animals. Asian elephants perform tasks such as hauling loads into remote areas, moving logs to rivers and roads, transporting tourists around national parks, pulling wagons, and leading religious processions. In northern Thailand, the animals are used to digest coffee beans for Black Ivory coffee. They are valued over mechanised tools because they can work in relatively deep water, require relatively little maintenance, need only vegetation and water as fuel and can be trained to memorise specific tasks. Elephants can be trained to respond to over 30 commands. Musth bulls can be difficult and dangerous to work with and are chained and semi-starved until the condition passes. In India, many working elephants are alleged to have been subject to abuse. They and other captive elephants are thus protected under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960.\nIn both Myanmar and Thailand, deforestation and other economic factors have resulted in sizable populations of unemployed elephants resulting in health problems for the elephants themselves as well as economic and safety problems for the people amongst whom they live.\nThe practice of working elephants has also been attempted in Africa. The taming of African elephants in the Belgian Congo began by decree of Leopold II of Belgium during the 19th century and continues to the present with the Api Elephant Domestication Centre.\nWarfare\nHistorically, elephants were considered formidable instruments of war. They were equipped with armour to protect their sides, and their tusks were given sharp points of iron or brass if they were large enough. War elephants were trained to grasp an enemy soldier and toss him to the person riding on them or to pin the soldier to the ground and impale him.\nOne of the earliest references to war elephants is in the Indian epic Mahabharata (written in the 4th century BC, but said to describe events between the 11th and 8th centuries BC). They were not used as much as horse-drawn chariots by either the Pandavas or Kauravas. During the Magadha Kingdom (which began in the 6th century BC), elephants began to achieve greater cultural importance than horses, and later Indian kingdoms used war elephants extensively; 3,000 of them were used in the Nandas (5th and 4th centuries BC) army while 9,000 may have been used in the Mauryan army (between the 4th and 2nd centuries BC). The Arthashastra (written around 300 BC) advised the Mauryan government to reserve some forests for wild elephants for use in the army, and to execute anyone who killed them. From South Asia, the use of elephants in warfare spread west to Persia and east to Southeast Asia. The Persians used them during the Achaemenid Empire (between the 6th and 4th centuries BC) while Southeast Asian states first used war elephants possibly as early as the 5th century BC and continued to the 20th century.\nIn his 326 B.C. Indian campaign, Alexander the Great confronted elephants for the first time and suffered heavy casualties. Among the reasons for the refusal of the rank-and-file Macedonian soldiers to continue the Indian conquest were rumors of even larger elephant armies in India. Alexander trained his foot soldiers to injure the animals and cause them to panic during wars with both the Persians and Indians. Ptolemy, who was one of Alexander's generals, used corps of Asian elephants during his reign as the ruler of Egypt (which began in 323 BC). His son and successor Ptolemy II (who began his rule in 285 BC) obtained his supply of elephants further south in Nubia. From then on, war elephants were employed in the Mediterranean and North Africa throughout the classical period. The Greek king Pyrrhus used elephants in his attempted invasion of Rome in 280 BC. While they frightened the Roman horses, they were not decisive and Pyrrhus ultimately lost the battle. The Carthaginian general Hannibal took elephants across the Alps during his war with the Romans and reached the Po Valley in 217 BC with all of them alive, but they later succumbed to disease.\nOverall, elephants owed their initial successes to the element of surprise and to the fear that their great size invoked. With time, strategists devised counter-measures and war elephants turned into an expensive liability and were hardly ever used by Romans and Parthians.\nZoos and circuses\nCircus poster, c. 1900\nElephants were historically kept for display in the menageries of Ancient Egypt, China, Greece, and Rome. The Romans in particular pitted them against humans and other animals in gladiator events. In the modern era, elephants have traditionally been a major part of zoos and circuses around the world. In circuses, they are trained to perform tricks. The most famous circus elephant was probably Jumbo (1861 \u2013 15 September 1885), who was a major attraction in the Barnum & Bailey Circus. These animals do not reproduce well in captivity, due to the difficulty of handling musth bulls and limited understanding of female oestrous cycles. Asian elephants were always more common than their African counterparts in modern zoos and circuses. After CITES listed the Asian elephant under Appendix I in 1975, the number of African elephants in zoos increased in the 1980s, although the import of Asians continued. Subsequently, the US received many of its captive African elephants from Zimbabwe, which had an overabundance of the animals.\nKeeping elephants in zoos has met with some controversy. Proponents of zoos argue that they offer researchers easy access to the animals and provide money and expertise for preserving their natural habitats, as well as safekeeping for the species. Critics claim that the animals in zoos are under physical and mental stress. Elephants have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying, or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos. Elephants in European zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long those in the wild.\nThe use of elephants in circuses has also been controversial; the Humane Society of the United States has accused circuses of mistreating and distressing their animals. In testimony to a US federal court in 2009, Barnum & Bailey Circus CEO Kenneth Feld acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind their ears, under their chins and on their legs with metal-tipped prods, called bull hooks or ankus. Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers and acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device, known as a hot shot or electric prod, on an elephant. Despite this, he denied that any of these practices harm elephants. Some trainers have tried to train elephants without the use of physical punishment. Ralph Helfer is known to have relied on gentleness and reward when training his animals, including elephants and lions. Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey circus retired its touring elephants in May 2016.\nAttacks\nElephants can exhibit bouts of aggressive behaviour and engage in destructive actions against humans. In Africa, groups of adolescent elephants damaged homes in villages after cullings in the 1970s and 1980s. Because of the timing, these attacks have been interpreted as vindictive. In parts of India, male elephants regularly enter villages at night, destroying homes and killing people. Elephants killed around 300 people between 2000 and 2004 in Jharkhand while in Assam, 239 people were reportedly killed between 2001 and 2006. Local people have reported their belief that some elephants were drunk during their attacks, although officials have disputed this explanation. Purportedly drunk elephants attacked an Indian village a second time in December 2002, killing six people, which led to the killing of about 200 elephants by locals.\nCultural depictions\nIn many cultures, elephants represent strength, power, wisdom, longevity, stamina, leadership, sociability, nurturance and loyalty. Several cultural references emphasise the elephant's size and exotic uniqueness. For instance, a \"white elephant\" is a byword for something expensive, useless, and bizarre. The expression \"elephant in the room\" refers to an obvious truth that is ignored or otherwise unaddressed. The story of the blind men and an elephant teaches that reality can be observed from different perspectives.\nElephants have been represented in art since Paleolithic times. Africa, in particular, contains many rock paintings and engravings of the animals, especially in the Sahara and southern Africa. In Asia, the animals are depicted as motifs in Hindu and Buddhist shrines and temples. Elephants were often difficult to portray by people with no first-hand experience of them. The ancient Romans, who kept the animals in captivity, depicted anatomically accurate elephants on mosaics in Tunisia and Sicily. At the beginning of the Middle Ages, when Europeans had little to no access to the animals, elephants were portrayed more like fantasy creatures. They were often depicted with horse- or bovine-like bodies with trumpet-like trunks and tusks like a boar; some were even given hooves. Elephants were commonly featured in motifs by the stonemasons of the Gothic churches. As more elephants began to be sent to European kings as gifts during the 15th century, depictions of them became more accurate, including one made by Leonardo da Vinci. Despite this, some Europeans continued to portray them in a more stylised fashion. Max Ernst's 1921 surrealist painting, The Elephant Celebes, depicts an elephant as a silo with a trunk-like hose protruding from it.\nElephants have been the subject of religious beliefs. The Mbuti people of central Africa believe that the souls of their dead ancestors resided in elephants. Similar ideas existed among other African societies, who believed that their chiefs would be reincarnated as elephants. During the 10th century AD, the people of Igbo-Ukwu, near the Niger Delta, buried their leaders with elephant tusks. The animals' religious importance is only totemic in Africa but is much more significant in Asia. In Sumatra, elephants have been associated with lightning. Likewise in Hinduism, they are linked with thunderstorms as Airavata, the father of all elephants, represents both lightning and rainbows. One of the most important Hindu deities, the elephant-headed Ganesha, is ranked equal with the supreme gods Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma. Ganesha is associated with writers and merchants and it is believed that he can give people success as well as grant them their desires. In Buddhism, Buddha is said to have been a white elephant reincarnated as a human. In Islamic tradition, the year 570 when Muhammad was born is known as the Year of the Elephant. Elephants were thought to be religious themselves by the Romans, who believed that they worshipped the sun and stars.\nElephants are ubiquitous in Western popular culture as emblems of the exotic, especially since \u2013 as with the giraffe, hippopotamus and rhinoceros \u2013 there are no similar animals familiar to Western audiences. The use of the elephant as a symbol of the U.S. Republican Party began with an 1874 cartoon by Thomas Nast. As characters, elephants are most common in children's stories, in which they are generally cast as models of exemplary behaviour. They are typically surrogates for humans with ideal human values. Many stories tell of isolated young elephants returning to a close-knit community, such as \"The Elephant's Child\" from Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories, Disney's Dumbo, and Kathryn and Byron Jackson's The Saggy Baggy Elephant. Other elephant heroes given human qualities include Jean de Brunhoff's Babar, David McKee's Elmer, and Dr. Seuss's Horton.\nSee also\nReferences\nBibliography"}

An Elephants trunk is so powerful and precise that it can carry calves and also be used for more delicate acts like picking flowers!\nAs the largest land mammal, the Elephant also has the longest pregnancy at 22 months! New-born calves weigh around 90kg and are about 3 feet tall.\nIt is believed that years ago there were more than 300 species of Elephant, however today there only remains two: the Asian and African species.\nWhat is the difference between these two?\nThe African Elephant is the largest, with huge ears and unisex tusks. The Asian Elephant has a large body too, but with smaller ears! The females also do not develop tusks for this species.\nAre Elephants social creatures?\nYes! Elephants live and travel in groups which are led by a matriarch female who tends to be an older and experienced member of the group. Males however, are pushed out of the group when they reach sexual maturity and roam alone when not breeding.\nFemale Elephants are known to show caring behaviour to fellow females and young calves. They are also thought to hold lifelong relationships with family and friends, just like humans do! This act showcases their brilliant memory, which allows them to remember good water hole and feeding locations.\nThere is also evidence to suggest that elephants mourn the passing of conspecifics. They can recognise skulls of other elephants long after they have died, even with the tusks removed!\nHow do Elephants communicate with one another?\nElephants are famous for their many vocalisations. This includes chirps, trumpets and high pitched squeaks that can travel far to other groups. Vocalisations are used for both daily communication and to signal willingness to breed.\nHow do we know that Elephants are intelligent?\nElephants have displayed complex behaviour indicating that they feel empathy for others, and are capable of demonstrating other emotions including grief.\nThey are able to use tools and recognise themselves using mirrors! Self-recognition indicates a very high level of awareness. Only cetaceans, magpies, humans and other primates have so far been found to recognise themselves in mirrors!\nWhat conservation threats do Elephants face?\nThe biggest threat to the Elephant is habitat loss. Clearance of land for agricultural purposes and human development is occurring in both Africa and Asia, leaving little space for the Elephants to roam freely. As the human population grows, forests are lost and food sources for the Elephant are weakened. Read more about how habitat loss can affect a species here.\nAnother important threat comes from the illegal trade of ivory, which although it has been campaigned against since 1989 is still very much present. There have been success stories in many countries where bans and stricter laws regarding ivory imports have been made, whereas other countries see the trade as an economic benefit. In 2016, the U.S. furthered their strict limitations against the ivory trade, and at the 17th CITES CoP meeting such acts influenced others. Although Elephants were not declared an Appendix I species, Botswana, the African country containing over a third of the continents Elephants, announced that they would treat the species as if it were on Appendix I.

Today, there are three remaining species of elephants: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. These unique species have many amazing qualities and adaptations which have helped them thrive both in their native habitats and in captivity.\nYou likely already know that elephants are the world\u2019s largest land mammals, but have you heard of any of these other lesser-known elephant facts?\n1. An elephant molar tooth is roughly the size of a brick and can weigh anywhere from 4 to 8 pounds!\nElephants are strictly herbivorous animals, but they still need large teeth to break down the massive amount of plant material they consume each day. They typically have four molars total at any given time, but it is typical for an elephant to go through six sets of molars or more during its lifetime!\nThese wide, flat molar teeth have ridges on them to help grind up plants like tree bark and branches as efficiently as possible. Interestingly, African and Asian elephants have differently shaped ridges on their molars; African elephants\u2019 molar ridges are diamond-shaped, while those of Asian elephants have a more cylindrical shape.\nCan you spot the elephant molar teeth? They weigh as much as a brick! Eddi_m/Shutterstock.com\n2. The oldest elephant on record was an Asian elephant named Changalloor Dakshayani, who lived to a robust 89 years old!\nBoth African and Asian elephants have long lifespans. Asian elephants in the wild typically live anywhere from 40 to 50 years, while African elephants live a bit longer, at around 60 years.\nChangalloor Dakshayani was originally bought by India\u2019s Travancore royal family and was donated to the Thiruvarattu Kavu Temple in 1949 when she was 19 years old. She was later transferred to another facility, the Chenkalloor Mahadeva Temple, in the late 1960s.\nIn 2016, she was officially certified as the oldest elephant in captivity by Kolkata, India\u2019s Univeral Records Forum. She died on February 5th, 2019, at a care facility in Pappanamcode, the capital of Kerala, India, at the ripe, old age of 89.\n3. African elephants have larger ears than Asian elephants to keep themselves cool.\nJust by looking at Asian elephants compared to their African counterparts, it is obvious their ears are far smaller and more rounded in appearance. The main reason for this difference is because they live in vastly different climates.\nWhile Asian elephants live in cooler jungle areas with a lot of plant cover for shade, African elephants live in much hotter, harsher desert-like environments. Over time, this has resulted in African elephants evolving to have much larger ears, which they use sort of as fans to cool their massive bodies off under the brutal African sun.\nAdditionally, the ears of the African elephant have huge networks of capillaries running through them which work to release excess heat during the elephants\u2019 long, arduous treks through the African savanna.\nAn Elephant challenges the photographer in the wilds of Africa. Elephants are the world\u2019s largest land animal, with male African elephants reaching 3m tall and weighing between 4,000 -7,500kg. Peter Betts/Shutterstock.com\n4. The only known occurrence of Asian and African elephants crossbreeding, a male calf named Motty, died after only 10 days in captivity.\nAsian and African elephants never come in contact in the wild, so they have never crossbred naturally. However, this hasn\u2019t stopped humans from trying to breed the two species with each other in captivity.\nWhile there are a few rumored occurrences of Asian/African hybrid elephants being born to various zoos and circuses throughout history, only one has actually been confirmed. In 1978 at the Chester Zoo in Cheshire, England, a calf named Motty was born to an Asian elephant mother, Sheba, and an African elephant father, Jumbolino. Motty was named after the zoo\u2019s founder, George Mottershead.\nSadly, the calf only lived for 10 days before succumbing to an umbilical infection. Today, Motty\u2019s body is preserved at London\u2019s Natural History Museum.\n5. Elephants can recognize their own reflection in mirrors!\nSelf-awareness is an extremely rare trait amongst animals, and it has only been consistently demonstrated by and recorded in three species: humans, chimpanzees, and orangutans. However, the \u201cmirror test\u201d has been conducted on many other species, to mixed outcomes.\nIn more recent years, many other animals such as dolphins, magpies, and even elephants have displayed promising results when subjected to the test. In 2006, a standard mirror test was done at the Bronx Zoo on three Asian elephants living at the facility.\nAmazingly, the elephants did not greet their reflection in the same way that they would usually approach other elephants! They were observed to touch the mirror and closely observe themselves, repeating movements like swinging their trunks and moving their heads. It was at this point that the researchers realized the elephants actually understood that they were looking at a reflection of themselves and not another member of their species!\nAn elephant underwater Willyam Bradberry/Shutterstock.com\n6. An elephant\u2019s trunk has around 40,000 distinct muscles!\nBy comparison, we humans have around 600 muscles throughout our entire bodies. An elephant\u2019s trunk is extremely powerful and flexible, with those 40,000 muscles divided into even more individual units to give it a wide range of motion and dexterity.\nWith these 40,000 muscles, an elephant\u2019s trunk is able to pick up objects weighing up to 700 pounds! This is a huge help to them when feeding, as they use their trunks to rip bark clean off of trees and pull entire branches into their mouths with ease.\n7. A baby elephant can weigh over 250 pounds at birth.\nIt\u2019s no secret that elephants are enormous animals, but did you know just how huge their babies are? A newborn elephant calf usually weighs around 250 pounds, is three feet tall, and can stand up on its own within 30 minutes of being born. This is an amazing feat, considering how heavy they are even at such a young age!\nDespite this size and strength at such a young age, though, baby elephants must stay very close to their mothers early on in order to survive. This is because they are nearly blind at birth and have to rely on their other senses, such as sound, touch, and smell to move around.\nBaby elephants weight 250 pounds at birth! paula french/Shutterstock.com\n8. An elephant\u2019s tusks are actually modified incisor teeth.\nIn most species of animals, incisor teeth are primarily used to bite into and tear apart food. An elephant\u2019s tusks are used in a similar way, often tearing into tree bark, branches, and even the ground itself with ease. These tusks grow continuously throughout an elephant\u2019s life and are worn down gradually as the animal uses them to eat, dig, and even defend itself.\nIn addition, the tusks help to protect the elephant\u2019s tender trunk. They are positioned perfectly on either side of the trunk to shield it from predators and damage from repeated use.\n9. Elephants can\u2019t jump.\nWe\u2019ve all seen it before: an elephant in a cartoon leaping in fright at the sight of a mouse or other rodent. In reality, though, elephants\u2019 legs aren\u2019t designed for jumping at all.\nIn addition to being too heavy to lift themselves off the ground, the bones in an elephant\u2019s legs all point downward and lack the flexibility and strength to push themselves off the ground and into the air. Elephants always keep at least one leg on the ground, even while running at speeds of up to 25 mph!\nAn Asian elephant in the beautiful forest at Kanchanaburi province in Thailand.\n10. Elephants can sense seismic activity with their feet and trunks.\nScientists at Stanford University have discovered that elephants use their trunks and feet to pick up on seismic signals given off by other elephants hundreds of feet away!\nThis behavior is known as seismic communication. Many species of smaller animals use it to find mates, prey, and new territory, but it is much rarer amongst large animals like elephants. It is believed that elephants can even sense oncoming thunderstorms with their trunks and feet and will move towards them to find water!"}

Then it curls its trunk under, sticks the tip of its trunk into its mouth, and blows. Out comes the water, right down the elephant's throat.\nSince African elephants live where the sun is usually blazing hot, they use their trunks to help them keep cool. First they squirt a trunkful of cool water over their bodies. Then they often follow that with a sprinkling of dust to create a protective layer of dirt on their skin. Elephants pick up and spray dust the same way they do water\u2014with their trunks.\nElephants also use their trunks as snorkels when they wade in deep water. An elephant's trunk is controlled by many muscles. Two fingerlike parts on the tip of the trunk allow the elephant to perform delicate maneuvers such as picking a berry from the ground or plucking a single leaf off a tree. Elephants can also use its trunk to grasp an entire tree branch and pull it down to its mouth and to yank up clumps of grasses and shove the greenery into their mouths.\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\nWhen an elephant gets a whiff of something interesting, it sniffs the air with its trunk raised up like a submarine periscope. If threatened, an elephant will also use its trunk to make loud trumpeting noises as a warning.\nElephants are social creatures. They sometimes hug by wrapping their trunks together in displays of greeting and affection. Elephants also use their trunks to help lift or nudge an elephant calf over an obstacle, to rescue a fellow elephant stuck in mud, or to gently raise a newborn elephant to its feet. And just as a human baby sucks its thumb, an elephant calf often sucks its trunk for comfort. One elephant can eat 300 pounds (136 kilograms) of food in one day.\nPeople hunt elephants mainly for their ivory tusks. Adult females and young travel in herds, while adult males generally travel alone or in groups of their own."}

They are slightly larger than their Asian cousins and can be identified by their larger ears that look somewhat like the continent of Africa. (Asian elephants have smaller, rounded ears.)\nAlthough they were long grouped together as one species, scientists have determined that there are actually two species of African elephants\u2014and that both are at risk of extinction. Savanna elephants are larger animals that roam the plains of sub-Saharan Africa, while forest elephants are smaller animals that live in the forests of Central and West Africa. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature lists savanna elephants as endangered and forest elephants as critically endangered.\nAfrican elephants are keystone species, meaning they play a critical role in their ecosystem. Also known as \u201cecosystem engineers,\u201d elephants shape their habitat in many ways. During the dry season, they use their tusks to dig up dry riverbeds and create watering holes many animals can drink from. Their dung is full of seeds, helping plants spread across the environment\u2014and it makes pretty good habitat for dung beetles too. In the forest, their feasting on trees and shrubs creates pathways for smaller animals to move through, and in the savanna, they uproot trees and eat saplings, which helps keep the landscape open for zebras and other plains animals to thrive.\nTrunks and tusks\nElephant ears radiate heat to help keep these large animals cool, but sometimes the African heat is too much. Elephants are fond of water and enjoy showering by sucking water into their trunks and spraying it all over themselves. Afterwards, they often spray their skin with a protective coating of dust.\nAn elephant's trunk is actually a long nose used for smelling, breathing, trumpeting, drinking, and also for grabbing things\u2014especially a potential meal. The trunk alone contains about 40,000 muscles. African elephants have two fingerlike features on the end of their trunk that they can use to grab small items. (Asian elephants have just one.)\nBoth male and female African elephants have tusks, which are continuously growing teeth. Savanna elephants have curving tusks, while the tusks of forest elephants are straight. They use these tusks to dig for food and water and strip bark from trees. Males, whose tusks tend to be larger than females', also use their tusks to battle one another.\nDiet\nElephants eat roots, grasses, fruit, and bark. An adult elephant can consume up to 300 pounds of food in a single day. These hungry animals do not sleep much, roaming great distances while foraging for the large quantities of food that they require to sustain their massive bodies.\nAfrican elephants range throughout the savannas of sub-Saharan Africa and the rainforests of Central and West Africa. The continent\u2019s northernmost elephants are found in Mali\u2019s Sahel Desert. The small, nomadic herd of Mali elephants migrates in a circular route through the desert in search of water.\nBecause elephants eat so much, they\u2019re increasingly coming into contact with humans. An elephant can destroy an entire season of crops in a single night. A number of conservation programs work with farmers to help them protect their crops and provide compensation when an elephant does raid them.\nHerds\nElephants are matriarchal, meaning they live in female-led groups. The matriarch is usually the biggest and oldest. She presides over a multi-generational herd that includes other females, called cows, and their young. Adult males, called bulls, tend to roam on their own, sometimes forming smaller, more loosely associated all-male groups.\nHaving a baby elephant is a serious commitment. Elephants have a longer pregnancy than any other mammal\u2014almost 22 months. Cows usually give birth to one calf every two to four years. At birth, elephants already weigh some 200 pounds and stand about three feet tall.\nThreats to survival\nPoaching for the illegal ivory trade is the biggest threat to African elephants\u2019 survival. Before the Europeans began colonizing Africa, there may have been as many as 26 million elephants. By the early 20th century, their numbers had dropped to 10 million. Hunting continued to increase. By 1970, their numbers were down to 1.3 million. Between 1970 and 1990, hunting and poaching put the African elephant at risk of extinction, reducing its population by another half.\nIn the years since, poaching has continued to threaten both species: Savanna elephants declined by 30 percent between 2007 and 2014, while forest elephants declined by 64 percent from 2002 to 2011 as poaching worsened in Central and West Africa. In 2021, the International Union for Conservation of Nature recognized them as separate species for the first time, listing savanna elephants as endangered and forest elephants as critically endangered. As few as 400,000 remain today.\nCompounding the problem is how long it takes for elephants to reproduce. With reproduction rates hovering around 5 to 6 percent, there are simply not enough calves being born to make up for the losses from poaching.\nAfrican elephants are also losing their habitat as the human population grows and people convert land for agriculture and development. Elephants need a lot of room, so habitat destruction and fragmentation not only makes it harder for them to find food, water, and each other, but it also puts them in increased conflict with humans.\nConservation\nThe decision to recognize African elephants as two separate species is seen as an important step for conservation, as it highlights the different challenges that each species faces. Scientists hope that the listing will bring more attention to forest elephants, which have often been overlooked by governments and donors when grouped together with more visible savanna elephants.\nAfrican elephants are protected to varying degrees in all the countries of their geographic range. They\u2019re also protected under international environmental agreements, CITES and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species. There have been recent efforts to bring re-legalize the international trade in ivory, but those so far have failed.\nConservation groups and governments have worked to set aside land for wildlife\u2014including corridors that connect those protected lands. Still, researchers believe that up to 70 percent of elephants' range is on unprotected land.\nTo curb poaching, stopping the illegal trade is key. Advocates have launched campaigns that address both the supply side (poaching) and the demand side (people who buy ivory). There has been some progress in recent years, especially on the demand side: In 2015, China\u2014believed to be the world\u2019s biggest illegal and legal ivory market\u2014agreed to a \u201cnear-complete\u201d ban on the domestic trade of ivory. Since the ban went into effect, public demand for ivory seems to have fallen.\nOn the supply side, protecting elephants from poaching also requires a local approach. In 2019, a study showed that the suffering of elephants is tied to that of the humans living nearby: Regions with high levels of poverty and corruption are more likely to have higher poaching rates. This suggests that helping communities develop sustainable livelihoods could reduce the lure of poaching.\nDID YOU KNOW? Elephants recognize themselves in a mirror\u2014something few animals are known to do. \u2014 National Geographic Elephant family members show signs of grief and may revisit the bones of the deceased for years, touching them with their trunks. \u2014 National Geographic Mud baths protect elephants from the sun and clean their skin of bugs and ticks. \u2014 International Elephant Foundation African elephants can eat up to 300 pounds of food a day. \u2014 African Wildlife Foundation\n4:42\nPlease be respectful of copyright.

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Elephant images!\nThe elephant is the largest land animal in the world.\nThese massive giants exhibit all kinds of complex behavior that in some ways mirror our own behavior but in other ways are distinct and unique to them. This has made them the subject of rigorous behavioral, anatomical, and cognitive studies, as well as a source of continued fascination in human culture, particularly in Indian, Sumatran, and some African mythologies and tales. But after decades of decline from poaching and habitat loss, the elephant is in a perilous state, and unless more is done to protect them, they may be on a path toward extinction.\n5 Incredible Elephant Facts!\nThe elephant is one of the smartest animals on the planet. It is one of the few species that exhibit actual self-awareness and self-recognition. It appears to use tools, for example, as a fly swatter. And it has an excellent ability to learn and remember details. Scientists still debate whether elephants mourn their dead, but these creatures do appear to have some interior emotional life.\nThe elephant makes a low, rumbling sound that can be heard up to 5 miles away.\nThe word pachyderm, which derives from the Greek term pachydermos, meaning \u201cthick skinned,\u201d refers to any mammal with a particularly tough hide, including the rhino, elephant, and hippo. None of these animals are closely related to each other, though.\nAn elephant can carry up to 7 tons, making it one of the world\u2019s strongest animals. Learn about the strongest animals in the world here.\nAt one point, scientists believe there were 26 million elephants in Africa alone. Today the world population of elephants is estimated at less than half a million.\nMake sure to give our \u201810 Incredible Elephant Facts\u2018 page a read if you\u2019re looking for more facts on these amazing animals!\nElephant Scientific Name\nThe scientific name for the family of elephants is Elephantidae. There are two living genera in this family. The genus of Loxodonta contains two species: the African bush elephant and the African forest elephant. The genus of Elephas contains only a single living species: the Asian elephant, which itself can be divided further into several distinct subspecies, including the Indian, Sumatran, Borneo, and Sri Lankan elephants. The fossil record contains many more species, including the woolly mammoth, which once walked the planet in the last ice age.\nElephant Appearance\nElephants resemble no other animal on the planet. They are distinguished by the huge bodies, stout legs, thin tails, rounded ears, strong trunks, and in some elephants, the ivory tusks. These long tusks, which grow throughout the elephant\u2019s life, are really just incisor teeth; they allow the elephant to dig for food and water, defend itself, and lift heavy objects with ease. Four molars, each one about the size of a brick, also line the mouth. Another important aspect of the elephant\u2019s anatomy is the thick, wrinkled skin, which can retain about 10 times the amount of water as smooth skin.\nTheir eats are also a unique adaptation and give elephants some of the best hearing among all animals on Earth. On average, elephants can hear the calls from another elephant as far as 2.5 miles away!\nThe elephant is defined most of all by its size. These impressive creatures stand about 10 feet tall, reach about 18 to 24 feet long, and weigh between 4 and 8 tons. The largest specimen ever recorded stood 13 feet tall and weighed a massive 12 tons. Much of the skeletal structure is taken up by the huge skull, which supports the large ears, tusks, and trunk. The skull contains big cavities that reduce the weight without diminishing the strength. Apart from several other physical differences, Asian elephants differ from African elephants in their smaller size and the reduced chance of growing tusks. The Borneo elephant is the smallest subspecies of all; it\u2019s sometimes called the pygmy elephant for this exact reason. Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan elephants appear to be the least likely of all species/subspecies to grow tusks from their skull.\nVolodymyr Burdiak/Shutterstock.com\nElephant Trunk\nThe elephant trunk, which actually derives from a fusion of the nose and upper lip, is an impressive instrument that has many useful functions related to touch, smell, and communication. The trunk contains finger-like projections on the tip (the Asian elephant has one and the African elephant two), which enable it to grasp objects as small as a piece of straw. The trunk contains around 150,000 separate muscle fibers with no bones or cartilage and very little fat. This enables it to perform very fine movements that somewhat belies the elephant\u2019s rather hulking appearance.\nElephant Ears\nThe large, rounded ears appear to be a very effective organ for keeping the elephant cool. The size of the ears is a function of the number of blood vessels they contain. This allows an enormous amount of warm blood to flow through the capillaries and release excess body heat into the environment. This effect can be amplified when the elephant flaps its ears.\nElephant Behavior\nThe social life of many elephants revolves around herds and small groups. An elephant herd consists mostly of closely related female cows and their calves, which are led by a single matriarch who helps the entire group find food and water, avoid predators, and locate a shelter. The oldest daughter is almost always poised to inherit the matriarchal position upon the mother\u2019s death. A typical herd consists of around 10 individuals. If the herd grows too large, then some elephants may split off and form a new semi-independent group. The male bulls, on the other hand, either wander alone or form bachelor groups with specific dominance hierarchies. The males are much more likely to gather together during times of scarcity or in the presence of threats. They only come into contact with females when they want to mate.\nElephants have all manner of ways to communicate with each other. The trunk seems to play a critical part in this. A raised trunk seems to indicate a greeting. A lower-ranked member of the herd will also place its tip into the mouth of a higher-ranked individual, perhaps as a conciliatory gesture. Despite the iconic trumpeting sound, many of the noises produced by the elephant to communicate over long distances are actually too low for the human ear to detect. They also produce a growling noise from the stomach that seems to signify to others they are okay.\nDepending on the availability of food, the elephant may spend up to 18 hours a day feeding. The rest of the time is occupied by sleeping, bathing, cleaning itself, and bonding with the rest of the group. Playing and fighting are integral parts of their behavior. They tend to spar playfully with other elephants close to their own age.\nIn the wild elephants only sleep about two hours per day and prefer to sleep while standing up. In captivity, elephants will sleep closer to six hours per night and with no predators to worry about will sleep lying down.\nElephant Habitat\nThe elephant inhabits the savannas, deserts, marshes, and forests near rivers of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The Indian, Sumatran, Borneo, and Sri Lankan elephants all generally correspond to those particular geographical regions. But this range is actually reduced from its greatest historical extent. The Asian elephant, for example, once had a much larger range stretching between Syria and China. The African forest elephant is now reduced to a small piece of land in the Congo basin of western Africa.\nElephant Diet\nThe elephant is an herbivorous mammal whose only source of nutrients is vegetation. It needs an enormous amount of food to sustain itself. A typical individual consumes up to 330 pounds of food in a single day, although up to half of this may pass through the body without being properly digested.\nWhat does the elephant eat?\nElephants will eat almost any type of vegetation, including grasses, leaves, fruits, twigs, roots, and bark. The exact composition of its diet tends to vary based on location and season. Herbivores generally have two different strategies for obtaining food: browsing, in which they selectively feed on shrubs and trees above the ground, and grazing, in which they lightly feed on vegetation along the ground. Many elephants are both browsers in the dry season and grazers in the wet season. African forest elephants are primarily browsers but also mix in a lot of fruits.\n(And no, in case you were wondering, elephants do not eat peanuts!)\nElephant Predators and Threats\nAside from natural predators, the animal is under threat from poaching (due to the value of their tusks), habitat loss, and growing conflict with people. Some of these threats are amplifying each other. As the animal\u2019s natural habitat diminishes from the spread of agriculture and residential housing, it comes into contact with people, which can result in trampled crops and damaged properties. This in turn may cause people to retaliate against them.\nWhat eats the elephant?\nA full-grown adult elephant faces no consistent threats in the wild. Its massive size and thick hide make it almost impervious to attacks. However, a juvenile calf may be vulnerable to hyenas, lions, tigers, leopards, and African wild dogs, so it seeks protection from the group.\nElephant Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nAs they reach sexual maturity, male bulls undergo a periodic transformation called musth in which their testosterone levels surge to 10 times their normal amount. This is characterized by aggressive behavior, enlarged temporal glands behind the eyes, and a continuous dribble of urine as they walk. The musth is intended to advertise the bull\u2019s physical condition and shape, both to the females who may be looking for a mate and to the males who may be looking out for competitors. Males in musth are known to fight with each other, which rarely results in death. Females also release signals about their readiness to mate in various secretions. One male can have multiple female mates in his lifetime.\nAfter mating, the female carries a single calf for about 22 months, longer than any other species of mammal. The baby is able to stand up and walk within an hour of its birth. However, it still requires the protection and care of the entire herd. If an adult senses danger, then it will make a loud trumpeting sound. The herd will then form a protective ring around the calves, facing outward to deter the predator. While the female herd may be doting caretakers, the father plays almost no role in the actual development of the offspring.\nIt takes a long time for a baby to master the nuances of elephant life. In the 13 to 20 years it takes to reach full maturity, these animals need to develop their coordination, learn social nuances, and develop bonds. It\u2019s been suggested that a poorly reared elephant may exhibit some anti-social behavior. Meanwhile, it takes a full five or six years before the baby is fully weaned from its mother\u2019s milk. The calf packs on 2 to 3 pounds every day over the first year alone. Upon growing fully, the females tend to stay with the group, while the males tend to leave and forge their own path in life. They can easily live in excess of 50 years in the wild.\nThe oldest elephant to ever live reached 88 or 89 years old and lived in captivity in India. Indian elephants tend to live longer than their African counterparts.\nElephant Population\nAccording to the IUCN Red List, which publishes a list of threatened species, both the African bush elephant and forest elephant are considered to be vulnerable species. Only about 415,000 remain in the wild. This is a fall of some 90% since the early 20th century. The Asian elephant is in an even worse state. With only about 45,000 remaining and its population heavily fragmented, it is currently classified as endangered by the IUCN Red List.\nConservationists are focusing their efforts on habitat protection and the end of poaching. Following an international agreement in 1989 that banned the ivory trade, poaching rates did temporarily subside. This was further bolstered by China\u2019s ban on its domestic ivory market in 2018. Conservation groups are also working with local people to reduce negative interactions and create elephant corridors and safe places for them to roam. However, due to low birth rates and long maturation times, it takes a while for elephant populations to replenish.\nElephants in the Zoo\nDue to their food and space requirements, only a few zoos are privileged enough to harbor these animals. The San Diego Zoo has a unique area called the Elephant Odyssey habitat that contains both African and Asian elephants. These animals are also present at the Indianapolis Zoo, the Maryland Zoo, the Seneca Park Zoo, the North Carolina Zoo, the Los Angeles Zoo, the Cincinnati Zoo, and Zoo Atlanta.\nView all 68 animals that start with E"}

However, some genetic studies suggest that the African elephant is two separate species\u2014savannah elephants and forest elephants. All elephants are at risk. Asian elephants roam forests and grasslands in India, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia. The African elephant population migrates across dense forests and arid deserts in 37 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.\nThese sentient creatures are massive. Asian elephants weigh up to six tons, and can reach over 11 feet tall. African elephants range from eight to 13 feet in height and weigh over six and a half tons. Both Asian and African elephants have life spans of 60 to 70 years. Despite our long history studying elephants, there is much to learn about these complex creatures. From their ability to distinguish languages to their altruistic behavior, you too can learn more about the extraordinary elephant.\n1. Elephants Never Forget\nThe memory of elephants is legendary, and for good reason. Of all land mammals, elephants possess the largest brains. They have the ability to recall distant watering holes, other elephants, and humans they have encountered, even after the passage of many years.\nElephants transmit their wealth of knowledge from generation to generation through the matriarchs, and this sharing of information has been beneficial to the creatures\u2019 survival. They are also able to recall the path to sources of food and water across great distances, and how to reach alternative areas should the need arise. Even more impressive, they adjust their schedule to arrive just in time for the fruit they are seeking to be ripe.\n2. They Can Distinguish Languages\nElephants exhibit a deep understanding of human communication. Researchers at Amboseli National Park in Kenya played back the voices of speakers from two different groups\u2014one that preys on the elephants, and another that does not. When the elephants heard the voices of the group they feared, they were more likely to act defensively by grouping tightly together and smelling the air to investigate. What's more, the researchers found the elephants also responded with less intensity to female and younger male voices, becoming most agitated at the voices of adult males.\nElephant language skills go beyond understanding. One Asian elephant learned to mimic words in Korean. Researchers theorize that because his primary social contact while growing up was with humans, he learned to mimic words as a form of social bonding.\n3. They Can Hear Through Their Feet\nGraeme Shannon / Shutterstock\nElephants have a great sense of hearing and the ability to send vocalizations over long distances. They make a variety of sounds, including snorts, roars, cries, and barks. But they also specialize in low frequency rumbles and are able to pick up sounds in an unusual way.\nCaitlin O'Connell-Rodwell, a biologist at Stanford University, found that the lower frequency vocalizations and foot stomping of elephants resonate at a frequency other elephants can detect through the ground. Enlarged ear bones and sensitive nerve endings in their feet and trunks allow elephants to pick up these infrasonic messages. The ability to detect such seismic vibrations also helps elephants survive. When an agitated elephant stomps, they\u2019re not just warning those in the immediate area, they may also be warning other elephants miles away. And when an elephant rumbles a call, it could be intended for family members far out of sight.\n4. Elephants Are Excellent Swimmers\nLyashenko Egor / Shutterstock\nIt may not come as a shock that elephants enjoy playing in the water. They are famous for splashing and showering themselves and others with sprays from their trunks. But it might be a surprise to learn that these huge animals are also quite good at swimming.\nElephants have enough buoyancy to stay at the surface and use their powerful legs to paddle. They also use their trunk as a snorkel when crossing deep water so they are able to breathe normally even when submerged. Swimming is a necessary skill for elephants as they cross rivers and lakes when searching for food.\n5. They Support Those in Need\nZdenek Matyas Photography / Shutterstock\nElephants are highly social and intelligent creatures, and they demonstrate behaviors we humans recognize as compassion, kindness, and altruism. In a study of elephant behavior, researchers found that when an elephant became distressed, other nearby elephants responded with calls and touches intended to console the individual.\ufeff\ufeff In addition to humans, this behavior was previously only witnessed in apes, canids, and corvids. Elephants also demonstrate empathetic behavior and \u201ctargeted helping\u201d where they coordinate with each other to help a sick or injured individual.\n6. They Can Suffer From PTSD\nWe know that elephants are sensitive souls, with strong bonds to their family members, a need for comfort, and a long memory. So it should come as no surprise that elephants who experience tragedy, like witnessing a family member being killed by poachers, have symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Calves orphaned by poachers will show PTSD-like symptoms even decades later. Elephants released from abusive situations show symptoms of PTSD long after they've found safety in a sanctuary.\nThese traumatic experiences also negatively impact learning.\ufeff\ufeff When selective individuals are killed in a cull or by poachers, young elephants lose vital social information that would have been passed down by adults.\n7. Elephants Need Their Elders\nVicki Jauron, Babylon and Beyond Photography / Getty Images\nAll of the information necessary to elephants\u2019 survival is passed down by their elders. It\u2019s crucial for young elephants to spend time with older family members, particularly the matriarchs, so they can learn all that they'll need to know as adults. The matriarch of the herd carries the knowledge of the elders and shares essential information with the young including how to respond to a variety of dangers and where to find food and water.\nWhile African elephants live in a matriarchal society, research has shown that Asian elephants are less hierarchical than their African counterparts and show little dominance based on age or gender.\ufeff\ufeff This difference in social organization could be attributed to habitat. In Africa, conditions are more harsh, so the elders' wisdom is more valuable; in parts of Asia where predators are few and resources are plentiful, there's not as much need for strong leadership.\n8. They Can't Live Without Their Trunks\njo Crebbin / Shutterstock\nFilled with over 40,000 muscles, an elephant's trunk is powerful and extremely sensitive. Elephants use their prehensile trunks to smell, eat, breathe underwater, make sounds, clean themselves, and defend themselves. Elephants have \u201cfingers\u201d at the tips of their trunks\u2014African elephants have two and Asian elephants have one\u2014that allow them to pick up tiny objects. Extremely dexterous, elephants can form a joint with their trunk to pile up small materials like grains.\nAn elephant will reach out its trunk and use its sense of smell to determine which foods to eat. In a 2019 study, Asian elephants were able to determine which of two sealed buckets contained more food based on smell alone. Another study found that African elephants could differentiate between a variety of plants and choose their favorite, guided only by scent.\nElephants also use their trunks to hug, caress, and comfort other elephants\u2014and baby elephants suck their trunks like human babies suck their thumbs. Apparently this helps them to learn how to use their trunks more effectively. With over 50,000 muscles in the trunk, this helps a young elephant figure out \"how to control and manipulate the muscles in the trunk so that it can fine-tune its use.\"\n9. They Are Related to the Rock Hyrax\nBased on sheer size alone, it's surprising to discover that the elephant's closest living relative is the rock hyrax, a small, furry herbivore native to Africa and the Middle East that looks similar to a rodent. Other animals closely related to elephants include manatees and dugongs (a marine mammal that looks like a manatee).\nDespite its appearance, the hyrax still has a few physical traits in common with elephants. These include tusks that grow from their incisor teeth (versus most mammals, which develop tusks from their canine teeth), flattened nails on the tips of their digits, and several similarities among their reproductive organs. The manatee, the rock hyrax, and the elephant share a common ancestor, Tethytheria, which died out more than 50 million years ago. That's been long enough for the animals to travel down very different evolutionary paths. Though they look and behave differently, they remain closely related.\n10. Elephants Honor Their Dead\nThe abundant sensitivity of elephants is well documented, but their sentient nature is particularly notable in the interest they express toward the dead. Even among unrelated animals, elephants show interest, examining, touching, and smelling the deceased animal. Researchers have observed elephants making repeated visits, attempting to assist expired animals, and calling out for help.\nLong after an animal has died, elephants will return and touch the remaining bones with their feet and trunks. The Washington Post described a young 10-year-old elephant visiting her mother's corpse in Kenya and leaving with \"the temporal glands on each side of her head... streaming liquid: a reaction linked to stress, fear and aggression.\" A form of tears, perhaps?\n11. They Use Dirt as Sunscreen\nEduard Kyslynskyy / Shutterstock\nThere\u2019s a good reason that elephants like to play in the dirt. Although their hide looks tough, elephants have sensitive skin that can get sunburned. To counteract the damaging rays of the sun, elephants throw sand on themselves. Adult elephants will also douse youngsters with dust. When coming out of a bath in a river, elephants will often throw mud or clay on themselves as a layer of protection.\n12. They Have Math Skills\nAsian elephants may just be one of the smartest creatures in the animal kingdom when it comes to math. Researchers in Japan attempted to train Asian elephants to use a computer touch screen panel. One of the three elephants, when presented with different quantities, was able to choose the panel that displayed more fruit.\nIt should be noted that only Asian elephants have been shown to possess this ability. Researchers posit that the split of African and Asian elephant species 7.6 million years ago may have resulted in differing cognitive abilities. Some research shows that the average EQ is 2.14 for Asian elephants, and 1.67 for African.\n13. Elephants Are at Risk\nAll elephants are at risk. The Asian elephant is endangered and the African elephant is vulnerable. The primary threats to elephants are habitat loss, fragmentation, and degradation. Elephants also face human threats. As farmers encroach on elephant habitats to plant crops, conflicts between the animals and humans have led to the retaliatory killing of elephants. Asian elephants in particular, which inhabit one of the planet\u2019s most densely populated areas, are unable to coexist with the expanding human population.\nThere are some innovative efforts to deter elephants away from human settlements and farms, reducing friction between the two species. One example is Project Orange Elephant in Sri Lanka, which incentivizes farmers to plant orange trees around their homes and garden plots; elephants dislike citrus, and the farmers gain an additional crop to sale for profit.\nIn spite of the 1989 international trade ban on ivory sales, the illegal and legal hunting and poaching of elephants for their tusks, hide, meat, and fur have been a large contributor to the decline of elephants, especially in Africa. Asian elephants are also poached, and since only males have tusks, this also leads to a shortage of males in the breeding population and a lack of genetic diversity."}

You know, you and elephants have something in common.\nAlthough they don\u2019t mean to knock over trees, elephants are just, well, awkward. As they stumble amongst their way, they unintentionally clear habitat space for new life to regrow and soil fertilization.\nSo, if a tree falls in the forest and there are only elephants around, does it make a sound?\nElephant Fact #3: They\u2019re Natural Excavators\nWhat animal has the strongest sense of smell? You would never guess given their noses are feet long, but the answer is African Elephants!\nAccording to Phys, \u201cElephants\u2019 sniffers are five times more powerful than people\u2019s noses, twice that of dogs, and even stronger than the previous known record-holder in the animal kingdom: rats.\u201d\u00b9\nWith this kind of sniffing power, it\u2019s no surprise they can uncover underground water sources during times of need.

But before we let you go, we need to talk about the only not so fun elephant fact.\nWhat are some of the biggest threats to elephants in the common day?\nIn terms of elephant protection, poachers are one of the largest menaces, hunting elephants for the illegal ivory trade. Many organizations and countries combat this violent trading culture by hiring law enforcement to stand guard in wildlife sanctuaries or bringing the issue to public knowledge.\nHabitat destruction, or furthermore, habitat relocation is still the widest cause of elephant births declining. These mammals are forced into foreign habited areas where it is unsafe for them to raise young, and far away from their natural supply of food and vegetation.\nCurrently, there are a mere 20,000 to 40,000 Asian elephants, a decrease of 50 percent over the past 75 years. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were more than 100,000 wild elephants in Thailand.

We know you know this, but did you know all 10 of our fascinating facts about these incredible gentle giants?\n1. The BIGGEST fact!\nAfrican elephants are the largest living land mammal! To find a bigger mammal you would have to take to the seas and track down some whales! Weighing in at a mind blowing 6,350kg (7 tonnes!) and measuring up to 4.2m (13ft), African elephants are an impressive sight on the savanna.\nOur own African Elephant bull, Coco, living at Howletts Wild Animal Park is a slightly more diminuative 3,600kg and 2.95m tall, but at only 20 years old he is stilll a growing boy! Male elephants can continue to grow even into their 50s \u2013 in particular their head needs to get wider to accommodate their ever growing tusks. Female elephants don\u2019t grow much taller after their mid 20s but they can continue to grow in length.\nCoco the bull elephant at Howletts Wild Animal Park\n2. Two or three species?\nWell, scientists are still arguing about that one so we probably can't call this a solid fact, but we still think it's pretty interesting! We all know that there are two species of elephants; African and Asian, right? Wrong! (Possibly.) As well as the Asian elephant, scientists now believe that there are in fact two species of elephants in Africa; the savanna elephant that we all recognise and the lesser known forest elephant with its straight tusks and smaller stature - perfectly adapted for moving around amongst the trees!\nThe African elephants you'll see at Howletts are the more well known savanna or bush elephant. Excitingly, forest elephants have been caught on camera traps and spotted visiting the river at our gorilla rescue and rehabilitation project in Gabon.\nA herd of forest elephants spotted at the river\n3. My, what big ears you have!\nSo, how do we tell the difference between savanna, forest and Asian elephants? Firstly, look at the ears - if they're large and shaped like Africa, its an African elephant! Asian elephant ears are smaller and rounder. Now you know that you're looking at an African elephant, how do you tell if it's a savanna or forest elephant? HINT: look at the tusks; if they're pointing straight down, its a forest elephant!\nCheck out the graphic below for more tips on how to tell your elephant species apart!\nClick to enlarge\n4. An elephant never forgets!\nEver wondered how that saying came to be? Elephants have amazing long term memories, recognising people and other elephants after many years of absence and remembering where all the best food, watering holes and routes between them are! Here comes the science bit... an elephant's temporal lobe (the area of the brain associated with memory) is much more developed than a human's! African elephants can live 60-70 years in the wild so that's a lot of memories to store!\n5. Let's talk poo!\nElephants spend 16-18 hours a day eating up to 450kg of grasses, leaves, bark and twigs. It's no surprise that an animal that can eat that much food every day will produce a huge amount of poo!\nAn adult elephant's poo weighs around 18kg and they will poo every couple of hours. One elephant can produce up to 150kg of poo every day. With the largest herd of African elephants in the UK at 14 individuals, keepers at Howletts Wild Animal Park clear up a staggering 12 tonnes of poo every week!\nA Keeper Academy student shovelling elephant poo at Howletts Wild Animal Park.\nAfrican elephants have much shorter intestines than Asian elephants. They pass food through much more quickly (as little as 12 hours) and are very inefficient at digesting it. Around 60% is wasted....although it\u2019s not really waste \u2013 it makes excellent fertiliser and many plants have evolved to germinate better after their seeds have passed through an elephant and been deposited in dung!\n6. My, what big teeth you have!\nYes, tusks are actually teeth! The elongated incisors grow throughout the elephant's life and they use them for scraping bark off trees, digging up tree roots and for defence when fighting. Elephants can be left or right tusked just as people are left or right handed!\nBoth male and female African elephants grow tusks, but only male Asian elephants grow tusks.\nFemale African elephant with tusks at Howletts Wild Animal Park in Kent, UK\n7. Who run the world?\nIn the immortal words of Beyonce, the matriarch of pop herself: \"Girls!\" Herds are led by the oldest female (or cow), also known as the matriarch. The matriarch will lead the herd along routes she learned from her predecessor and assist the females with raising their calves. When she passes away another female, usually her eldest daughter, will take her place.\nAt Howletts Wild Animal Park we have 2 family groups which closely associate for much of their time, but will also go off and forage in separate paddocks, especially in the mornings. This is similar to \u201cbond groups\u201d in the wild which are usually separate families who are related.\nWe asked Head Elephant Keeper, Natalie for some tips on how to spot the leading ladies in our two family groups: \"Tammi leads her family group of 7, so is considered their matriarch. However, she does seem to rely heavily on her eldest daughter Jara in leading the group. Tammi has the longest tusks of all the Howletts elephants. Unlike Coco the bull, her tusks are slender, as is typical of females.\"\nTammi, African Elephant at Howletts Wild Animal Park. Photo by Emily de Pasquale Wood.\n\"Jama is still a young female but is Matriarch of her family of 5. Recent studies at Howletts have shown that when Jama calls (a low call known as a \u201clets go \u201c rumble), all her family will follow and sometimes youngsters from Tammi\u2019s family will also follow her. Jama is more difficult to recognise than Tammi. She is the 4th tallest after Coco, Tammi and Jara. She has shorter tusks than Jara and is a much stockier, wrinklier elephant.\"\nAfrican elephant, Jama with calf Nusu at Howletts Wild Animal Park in Kent, UK\n8. Waiting for baby\nNot content with just one breaking record, elephants also have the longest pregnancy of any mammal! After 22 months (we're exhausted just thinking about it!), elephant cows give birth to a whopping 90kg calf!\nAfrican elephant calf, Oku, at Howletts Wild Animal Park in Kent, UK\n9. Pardon?\nWhen you think of the sound an elephant makes, you probably think of the loud trumpeting call. However, most of their vocalisations are of such a low frequency that humans can't hear them! These low rumbling, or infrasonic sounds can travel great distances to warn or reunite with other elephants.\n10. Jumbo rescue!\nIn 2019 The Aspinall Foundation in conjunction with Wild911, an American NGO, stepped in to save 11 elephants and a large number of other animals within a hunting reserve in South Africa from an almost certain death. The starving, dehydrated animals were darted and transported to nearby Buffalo Kloof, a private game reserve, where they are now thriving under 24hr protection.\nAn elephant is sedated and prepared for travel\nFind out more about this enormous elephant rescue mission.\nCome and visit our herd of gentle giants this summer at Howletts Wild Animal Park, including our 3 adorable calves, Nusu, Oku and Nguvu!"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephant Interesting Facts \u2013 International Elephant Foundation", "url": "https://elephantconservation.org/elephants/just-for-kids/", "text": "The skin on an elephant can weigh as much as 2000 pounds, or over 900 kg.\nElephant skin lacks moisture so it must be loose, especially around the joints, to provide the necessary flexibility for motion.\nThe skin of the African elephant is more wrinkled than that of the Asian elephant. The wrinkles in an elephant\u2019s skin help to retain moisture, keeping the skin in good condition.\nThe pink or light brown areas of skin on some Asian elephants are from a lack of pigmentation. This lack of pigmentation can be influenced by genetics, nutrition, habitat and age. The condition is not seen in African elephants.\nThe skin can be as thick as an inch on areas such as the back and as thin as 1/10 of an inch on the ears and around the mouth.\nDespite it\u2019s rough and dry appearance, the skin is delicate and may be soft to the touch.\nThe natural color is grayish black, but an elephant usually appears to be the same color as the soil where the elephant lives. This is because elephant\u2019s take frequent mudbaths or dust with soil to protect against insects, to control body temperature, to condition and moisturize the skin, and to protect against sunburn.\nOne way a person regulates body temperature is by sweating \u2013 on a person, sweat glands are located throughout their skin. Elephants have very few sweat glands. The few sweat glands that an elephant has are located on the foot, near the cuticles. This results in a skin that is dry to the touch but soft and supple. If you look at an elephant on a hot day, you may see a wet area around the top of their toenails.\nThe only visible glands that are found on the skin of an elephant are the mammary glands and the temporal glands. Elephants have one temporal gland on each side of the head between the eye and the ear. The temporal gland is a large gland, much like a sweat gland, that sometimes produces a secretion that trickles down the side of the face. In female elephants, these glands may become active when the animal gets very excited. In male elephants, the temporal glands are active when the male is in \u201cmusth\u201d, which is a condition very much like \u201crut\u201d in a deer."}

They are moderately larger than their Asian cousins and can be recognized by their big ears.\nAlthough they were long assembled together as one species, scientists have intent on that there are actually two kinds of African elephants and that both are at possibility of extinction. Savanna elephants are huge animals that rove the plains of sub-Saharan Africa, while wood elephants are minor animals that reside in the forests of Central and West Africa. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature enlisted savanna elephants as jeopardized and forest elephants as censorious endangered.\nTrunks and tusks\nElephant ears divaricate heat to help keep these huge animals cool, but sometimes the African warmth is too much.

The matriarch is generally the mammoth and oldest. She guides over a multi-generational herd that consists other females, called cows, and their young ones. Adult males are called bulls, tend to rove on their own, sometimes making smaller, more free-floating associated all-male groups. Having a baby elephant is a momentous commitment.\nElephants have a time taking pregnancy than any other mammal that is almost 22 months.\nThreats to survival\nPoaching for the illegal animal tusk trade is the immense threat to African elephants\u2019 survivance. There may have been as many as 26 million elephants. By the early 20th century, their counting had fallen to 10 million. poaching continued to grow. By 1970, their numbers were fallen down to 1.3 million. Hunting and poaching put the African elephant at menace of extinction, diminishing its populace by another half."}

In this article, you'll learn 10 essential elephant facts, ranging from how these pachyderms use their trunks to how females gestate their young for almost two years.\u200b\n01 of 10 There Are 3 Different Elephant Species Getty Images All of the world's pachyderms are accounted for by three species: the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). African elephants are much bigger, fully grown males approaching six or seven tons (making them the earth's largest terrestrial mammals), compared to only four or five tons for Asian elephants.\n02 of 10 An Elephant's Trunk Is an All-Purpose Tool Wikimedia Commons Besides its enormous size, the most notable thing about an elephant is its trunk; basically an extremely elongated nose and upper lip. Elephants use their trunks not only to breathe, smell and eat, but to grasp the branches of trees, pick up objects weighing as much as 700 pounds, affectionately fondle other elephants, dig for hidden water, and give themselves showers. Trunks contain over 100,000 bundles of muscle fibers, which can make them surprisingly delicate and precise tools. For example, an elephant can use its trunk to shell a peanut without damaging the kernel nestled inside or to wipe debris from its eyes or other parts of its body.\n03 of 10 An Elephant's Ears Help to Dissipate Heat Getty Images Given how enormous they are, and the hot, humid climates in which they live, it makes sense that elephants evolved a way to shed excessive heat. An elephant can't flap its ears to make itself fly (a la Walt Disney's Dumbo), but the large surface area of its ears is lined with a dense network of blood vessels, which convey heat to the surrounding environment and thus help to cool the pachyderm down in the blazing sun. Not surprisingly, the large ears of elephants convey another evolutionary advantage: in ideal conditions, an African or Asian elephant can hear a herd mate's call from over five miles away, as well as the approach of any predators that might threaten the herd's juveniles.\n04 of 10 Elephants Are Extremely Intelligent Animals Getty Images In absolute terms, adult elephants have enormous brains, up to 12 pounds for fully grown males, compared to four pounds, max, for the average human (in relative terms, though, the brains of elephants are much smaller compared to their overall body size). Not only can elephants use primitive tools with their trunks, but they also display a high degree of self-awareness (for example, recognizing themselves in mirrors) and empathy toward other herd members. Some elephants have even been observed tenderly fondling the bones of their deceased companions, though naturalists disagree whether this shows a primitive awareness of the concept of death.\n05 of 10 Elephant Herds Are Dominated by Females Getty Images Elephants have evolved a unique social structure: essentially, males and females live entirely apart, hooking up only briefly during mating season. Three or four females, together with their young, congregate in herds of up to a dozen or so members, while males either live alone or form smaller herds with other males. Female herds have a matrilineal structure: members follow the lead of the matriarch, and when this elderly female dies, her place is taken by her oldest daughter. As with humans (at least most of the time), experienced matriarchs are renowned for their wisdom, leading herds away from potential dangers (such as fires or floods) and toward abundant sources of food and shelter.\n06 of 10 Elephant Pregnancies Lasts Almost Two Years Getty Images At 22 months, African elephants have the longest gestation period of any terrestrial mammal (though not of any vertebrate on earth; for example, the eel-frilled shark gestates its young for over three years!) Newborn elephants weigh a whopping 250 pounds, and they usually have to wait for at least four or five years for any siblings, given female elephants' extremely long interbirth intervals. What this means, in practical terms, is that it takes an unusually long time for devastated populations of elephants to replenish themselves, which makes these mammals especially susceptible to poaching by humans.\n07 of 10 Elephants Evolved Over the Course of 50 Million Years Getty Images Elephants, and elephant ancestors used to be a lot more common than they are today. As far as we can tell from the fossil evidence, the ultimate progenitor of all elephants was the tiny, pig-like Phosphatherium, which lived in northern Africa about 50 million years ago; a dozen million years later, by the late Eocene epoch, more recognizably \"elephant-y\" proboscis-like Phiomia and Barytherium were thick on the ground. Toward the later Cenozoic Era, some branches of the elephant family were characterized by their spoon-like lower tusks, and the golden age of the breed was the Pleistocene epoch, a million years ago, when the North American Mastodon and the Woolly Mammoth roamed the northern expanses of North America and Eurasia. Today, oddly enough, the closest living relatives of elephants are dugongs and manatees.\n08 of 10 Elephants Are Crucial Components of Their Ecosystems Getty Images As big as they are, elephants have an outsize influence on their habitats, uprooting trees, trampling ground underfoot, and even deliberately enlarging water holes so they can take relaxing baths. These behaviors benefit not only the elephants themselves but also other animals, which take advantage of these environmental changes. On the other end of the scale, when elephants eat in one location and defecate in another, they function as crucial dispersers of seeds; many plants, trees, and bushes would have a hard time surviving if their seeds didn't feature on elephant menus.\n09 of 10 Elephants Were the Sherman Tanks of Ancient Warfare Getty Images There's nothing like a five-ton elephant, decked out with elaborate armor and its tusks capped with spear-points of brass, to inspire fear in the enemy, or there was nothing like that over 2,000 years ago when the kingdoms of India and Persia drafted pachyderms into their armies. The ancient deployment of war elephants reached its apogee around 400 to 300 BC, and ran its course with the Carthaginian general Hannibal, who tried to invade Rome, by way of the Alps, in 217 BC. After that, elephants mostly fell out of favor with the classical civilizations of the Mediterranean basin, but continued to be used by various Indian and Asian warlords. The true death knell of armored elephants came in the late 15th century when a well-placed cannon shot could easily fell a rampaging bull.\n10 of 10 Elephants Continue to Be Endangered by the Ivory Trade Getty Images While elephants are subject to the same environmental pressures as other animals they are especially vulnerable to poachers, who value these mammals for the ivory contained in their tusks. In 1990, a worldwide ban on the ivory trade led to the rebound of some African elephant populations, but poachers in Africa continued to defy the law, a notorious case being the slaughter of over 600 elephants in Cameroon by raiders from the neighboring country of Chad. One positive development is the recent decision by China to outlaw the import and export of ivory; this hasn't completely eliminated poaching by ruthless ivory dealers, but it has certainly helped."}

There are 2 species and 6 sub-species spread across the warm forests and savannas of Asia and Africa.\nThe Sumatran elephant, the smallest sub-species, may only stand 6 feet at the shoulder when mature, but the massive bush elephant of Africa has been known to reach 13 feet tall.\nElephants live in herds of 6 to 30 individuals that may join up occasionally with any of several other herds within the master social structure known as a clan. There may be up to 400 elephants within the clan, and it is believed that elephants may recognize and have different relationships with all of their fellow members.\nFemales stay with the same herd usually for their entire lives, only occasionally branching off to form a new herd. Young males live with the herd until 8 to 10 years of age after which they may wander about in small groups of males for several years, but eventually live solitary lives, only joining up with herds for a few days a year to mate with available females.\nAlthough elephants have been used as beasts of burden in Asia for thousands of years, the Asian elephant is not a domestic animal. Elephants are captured from the wild when they are young adults and trained through ancient techniques by elephant handlers called \"mahouts\".\nThe means with which they control and train wild-caught elephants is unpleasant at best, and includes the use of large steel hooks called ankusas, long poles, ropes and chains.\nElephants have also been used in circus shows as far back as Ancient Rome where they were often pitted against lions and bears in battles that were considered to be great entertainment.\nThe intelligence and emotional depth of both the Asian and African elephant is legendary, and fortunately, the tide is turning against the casual use of these highly advanced creatures simply for our amusement.\nThe African elephant has a vulnerable status as a species, and the Asian elephant is listed as endangered.\nThese animals are difficult to breed in captivity and the maintenance of a wild population on both continents is critical to the elephants long term survival on our planet. - Elephant Facts.\nThe amazing elephant\nThe elephant has the longest childhood of any creature on Earth, including us! Males may not reach sexual maturity until they are thirty years old, and may not have an opportunity to mate until they reach the prime age of 40 to 50 .\nFemales may nurse a calf for 6 years, and may only have 3 kids in their lifetime.\nAlthough ape species have been known to mourn over the remains of the lost, only elephants and humans routinely show reverence, and even ritual, years after the passing.\nHerds will pause at the location of an individuals death for years after the occurrence. While bones are still present, they will fondle and carry them about. Once nothing remains, individuals may still linger and remember.\nThe elephants memory has become famous mainly because of the many stories where elephants separated for decades from each other, from human friends, or even in one case from a pet parrot, showed obvious delight in the form of head-rocking, vocalizing and tender touching with eager trunks upon their reunion.\nIn one such case, some detective work revealed that the two joyfully reunited elephants in question hadn't seen each other in fifty years.\nIt was only recently discovered that African elephants regularly make sounds that are too low for humans to hear..... yet loud enough for elephants miles away to respond to! - Amazing Elephant Facts\nelephant reproduction\nElephant babies\nBaby Asian and African elephants with moms\nWhen male elephants reach 25 to 30 years of age they begin to experience a yearly spike in testosterone known as musth -a Hindi word which means \"intoxicated\". Musth may occur at any time of year and will last from 15 to 90 days.\nThe male will become restless, agitated and sometimes violent as the rise in hormones sends him searching, often without sleeping or eating, for a female in estrus.\nFemales come into estrus 3 times a year for only 4 days at a time. They project a scent that attracts males in musth and when more than one male arrives a violent fight may ensue involving charging and wrestling, one set of huge tusks and muscular trunks against another.\nMales rarely gore or otherwise seriously injure each other, but the battles may be long and exhausting, and sometimes the victor turns around to find his love interest has simply wandered away.\nMusth is an uncomfortable time for males as they single-mindedly pursue a mate. Unique to elephants, two temporal glands located behind the eyes secrete a trail of fluid down both sides of the face, and a steady dribble of noxious urine marks every step the male takes.\nOnce impregnated, the mother carries her calf for almost 2 years, then, with the herd forming a circle around her to protect her, she gives birth while standing up, to a 200 pound calf.\nThe calf, who may be remarkably hairy at birth, will not be able to stand for the first hour or so which is a very nervous time for the herd. Eventually the calf will struggle up to nurse and can walk 2 hours after birth. Females have 2 teats right behind their front legs and baby elephants have been known to nurse (by mouth not by trunk) for up to 6 years! - Elephant Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

The trunk can reach over 20 feet high into trees for fruits or leaves or suck up and discharge up to 5 gallons of water at a time to bathe in, or playfully spray others with.\nThe trunk has no bones but it is layered with muscle and immensely powerful, weighing up to 350 pounds, and allowing the elephant to lift trees out of the ground or casually roll boulders out of its path. If something irritates the lining of the trunk the elephant can and will sneeze.... just like us...only a tad louder. -Amazing Elephant Facts\nelephant life\nThe Elephants brain\nThe brain of an elephant is naturally quite large, however it is still much smaller in relation to body size than our own. In terms of this ratio, known as the Encephalization quotient, elephants fall in the range of a chimpanzee.\nHowever, the neocortex- the region of the brain devoted to cognitive process - or \"reasoning\" is greater in relative size than human beings and features highly developed regions of communication.\nThe trumpet of an elephant - such a recognizable sound - is not their only form of vocalization. Elephants have a vast vocabulary of grunts, whines and chirping sounds, as well as sounds of such a low decibel that human ears can't hear them.\nThe elephant also has an enormous number of neurons devoted to the mobility of the trunk, which is as dexterous as a human hand.\nAnd finally, the area of the brain linked to emotions - the hippocampus- is larger in percentage than any other animal, including humans and whales.\nthe african elephant\nAfrican elephants\nAfrican elephant mother and baby\nThe largest animal on land, the African elephant starts out life big - usually 200 pounds at birth, and grows at a rate of up to 2 pounds a day. Most adult males reach full height - about 10 or 11 feet- at age fifteen, but continue to gain mass well into their thirties. As adults, these creatures have no natural enemies other than us.\nThe most critical issue facing African elephants is the slaughter for the use of their tusks. The tusks are modified teeth that begin to develop at about five months of age and grow continuously throughout the animals life.\nBoth male and female African elephants have tusks, but the males tend to be more massive and grow up to 8 inches a year. The ivory from tusks is used to make decorative items, and powdered elephant tusk is used as a medicinal aid and supplement.\nIn a fascinating twist of evolution, however, naturalists have begun to notice that some wild elephants are now reaching maturity without developing tusks at all. It seems the depletion of individuals with robust tusks has impacted the genepool. And the killing of elephants with large tusks before they are able to reproduce means tusk size has been going down for years, and in some cases tusk no longer form. Incredibly, the poachers may be saving the elephants without even knowing it.\nFinally, a few words on the most famous African elephant of them all, whose name became a household word we still use almost everyday. In the late 1800's an African elephant named \"Jumbo\" - a variation of the Swahili word for \"hello\" - became a household name as he toured the world with P.T.Barnum and the \"Greatest Show on Earth\" the Barnum and Bailey circus.\nHe was about 13 feet tall and weighed approximately 15,000 pounds. In the circus he was billed as the largest elephant that ever lived and his name became synonymous with enormous size. Shockingly, he passed away after being hit by a train while waiting to be loaded into his railway car. His hide was mounted and stuffed and toured with the circus for many years after his death. It was eventually destroyed in a fire. Jumbos gigantic skeleton was mounted and donated to the American Museum of Natural History. - African Elephant Facts\nthe asian elephant\nWild Asian Elephants\nAsian Elephant mother and calf\nThe Asian elephant, also known as the Indian elephant, has had a very long and rather unfortunate relationship with human beings.\nThey were first kept as beasts of burden about 5000 years ago in the area now known as Pakistan. Baby elephants were originally captured with the assumption that they would be easier to tame, but they would not survive in captivity without their mother.\nAttempts to captively breed and domesticate elephants are futile because males in musth are exceedingly dangerous and must be kept in chains during this period. In addition, the length of the childhood of an elephant is unmanageable, with six to eight years devoted just to weaning\nIn modern day Asia, young adults between eight and twelve years old are captured and taken from their herds by a method called \"mela shikar\", where a captive trained elephant is used to help capture the wild one. Once imprisoned, the animals are trained by handlers called \"mahouts\", who may stay with the animal for the length of its life.\nElephants are used for many tasks including general transportation, farming, forestry and construction, and fully trained elephants may know over 300 specific commands.\nThe manner in which they are handled and tamed is often aggressive and involves intimidation and the infliction of pain in order to gain their cooperation. A long steel hook called an ankusa is used to hook around the ear, and often elephants are prodded in their mouths and throats to get the desired results .\nElephants have been the focus of much scientific study. When the elephants brain is examined and the cerebral cortex in particular is observed, indications are that the Asian elephant may be the most intelligent animal on earth - second only to human beings! - Asian Elephant Facts\nreaching out - elephant conservation\nAfrican elephants and Asian elephants are some of the most intelligent beings on Earth with a childhood, lifespan, social structure and understanding of life, death and self similar to our own.\nThey should be cherished and protected by us.\nTheir territories and range should be preserved to the best of our abilities.\nAnd most importantly they should not be captured and removed from their families, and their use in circus acts and carnivals and as beasts of burden should be stopped to preserve not just their dignity but our own.\na few more elephant facts\nThe Asian elephant is often commonly referred to as the Indian elephant\nWild African and Asian elephants reaching adulthood without ever growing tusks is becoming more common - an amazing evolutionary result of adults with large, well-formed tusks being killed off for their ivory before they can reproduce.- a very recent elephant fact and a fascinating example of micro-evolution!\nis becoming more common - an amazing evolutionary result of adults with large, well-formed tusks being killed off for their ivory before they can reproduce.- and a fascinating example of micro-evolution!

This can leave elephants with no choice but to head onto private land where they\u2019re threatened by human activity.\n. This can leave elephants with no choice but to head onto private land where they\u2019re threatened by human activity. African elephants have just 50% of their original habitat .\n. Elephants play an intrinsic role in the ecosystem, and losing them would be devastating. Sadly, poaching remains a huge problem in some African countries, particularly in East and Central Africa.\nBefore we wrap up, let\u2019s check a few more interesting facts about elephants.\n15. There Are Only Between 40,000\u201350,000 Wild Asian Elephants Left.\n(Source: WWF)\nIn the last three generations, the Asian elephant population has dropped by 50%.\nThere are 15,000 captive Asian elephants. Unfortunately, most help the Asian tourist trade and can\u2019t go back into the wild where they can thrive.\nMuch like our furballs need dog vitamins, captive elephants need vitamin A supplements because they don\u2019t get as much as they need. Remember, elephants track food far in the wild, and captivity can\u2019t offer them the same variety.\nIf these fun facts about elephants teach us anything, it\u2019s that elephants should stay in the wild.\nWrap Up\nElephants are truly unique animals that we can learn a lot from. They\u2019re gentle and have a profound sense of family and belonging. Also, these lovely giants are quite protective of their herd.\nWhat\u2019s more, their bodies can store two gallons of water in the trunk and walk 90 miles a day.\nFun facts about elephants show us that these amazing creatures are fundamental for ecosystems. But their numbers are dwindling by 100 a day in Africa. So we need to do everything we can to help them.\nFAQ\nHow can I help elephant population numbers?\nThe most significant change you can make on a personal level is to never buy an ivory product. Many countries have banned ivory, which helped a lot, but elephants are quickly becoming the next rhino. While the black market trade is illegal, it\u2019s still a billion-dollar-a-year industry.\nWhat do I call a male elephant?\nHere are some fun facts about male elephants: the males are called bulls, the females \u2014 cows, and their babies are calves. Moreover, male elephants are bigger than their female counterparts, particularly the African bush elephant, which can reach over six tonnes.\nWhat are the closest relatives of elephants?\nSurprisingly, genetic studies show a close relative correlation between elephants and sea cows. Other fun facts about elephants reveal that horses and rhinos are more closely related to elephants than the aardvark. The aardvark was believed to be the second closest relative. Still, recent studies showed a whole slew of genetically similar species."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephant Facts and Information - EleAid", "url": "https://www.eleaid.com/elephant-information/elephant-facts/", "text": "Elephant Facts\nAsian Elephant Facts\nGENUS : Elephas Maximus (largest elephant)\nCOMMON NAME : Asian or Indian Elephant\nCLASS : Mammalia\nORDER : Proboscidae\nFAMILY : Elephantidae\nVital Statistics\nHeight: 2.5 TO 3.0 M (At The Shoulder)\nLength: 5.5 TO 6.4 M\nWeight: Males \u2013 5,000 kg\nFemales \u2013 3,000 kg\nPhysical Features\nThe Asian elephant is second only to its African cousin (Africana Loxodonta) as the largest of all land animals.\nHead\nThey have a deeply lobed forehead with a prominent twin domed crown.\nThe Brain\nThe elephant has a highly developed brain, which is the largest of all land mammals. Their brain is 3 or 4 times larger than that of humans, although smaller as a proportion of bodyweight.\nEyes\nElephants\u2019 eyes are small; because of the position and size of the head and neck, they have limited peripheral vision. They have poor eyesight with a range of only 25 ft. This is slightly improved in forest shade.\nEars\nThey have smaller ears than the African elephant with large veins flows beneath the thin covering of skin. This is said to cool the blood and be important for temperature control (elephants cannot sweat!) From the age of 10, the top of the ear gradually folds over, increasing at about an inch for every 20 years of an elephant\u2019s life. This provides a rough indication of an elephant\u2019s age. Elephants have an excellent sense of hearing and are said to be able to pick up some sounds over distances of 10 miles!\nElephants have two types of teeth, molars and incisors. The molars are rasping surfaces with a series of parallel ridges (African elephants differ in this respect). Elephants have six sets of teeth over their lifetime, with old teeth being replaced as they wear out through use. Once all an elephants teeth are used up it is unable to feed properly a situation that leads ventually to the old animals death.\nTongues and Taste\nElephants have lovely big tongues, which they enjoy being stroked!They have a good sense of taste and are highly discriminating in what they eat.\nThe elephant\u2019s trunk is one of nature most amazing creations. It is made up of six major muscle groups, composed of over 100,000 individual muscle units. At its tip, the Asian elephant\u2019s trunk has a single finger, whereas African elephants have two. The trunk is dexterous and sensitive while at the same time being strong and powerful. An elephant uses its trunk for a multitude of purposes: it can lightly pluck a flower or pick up a coin or lift huge logs or elephant calves; it can be used for reaching high branches or rummaging low down on the forest floor; it conveys food and water to the mouth and can suck up huge volumes of liquid, expelling it at great force; it is also used to make sounds such as trumpeting. In self-defense, the trunk is a highly formidable weapon that is capable of killing. Last but not least, the trunk houses a keen sense of smell, which is said to be more developed than any other land animal. A damaged trunk is a death sentence to an elephant. The trunk is highly sensitive and they are very careful to protect them, sleeping with trunks tucked up under their chins and will adopt the same position when threatened.\nElephant tusks are developed upper incisors. They are used for digging, locating water, balancing large objects and in defense as a potentially lethal weapon. Asian elephants commonly have short and light tusks, but they can on occasion be long and slender. As opposed to their African cousins, only male Asian elephants have tusks; females may have short protrusions called tushes. These are rarely longer than 4 inches. Not all males are tuskers. Tuskless males are at no disadvantage; the energy they save from not growing tusks goes into additional body weight and they usually have stronger, more developed trunks. Elephant tusks are both a blessing and curse. While they give elephants a majesty over all animals, they also lead to ivory poaching and elephant deaths.\nSkin\nDespite being termed pachyderms, the elephant is not thick-skinned but very sensitive. The skin is heavily grooved, with a loose fitting appearance covered with coarse bristles. It is prone to irritation from insect bites and mites living within the skin folds. For this reason, regular bathing is vital to the good health of the animals. Elephants will frequently use their trunks to blow a covering of mud over their bodies to protect themselves from insect menace.\nTail\nAn elephant\u2019s tail can be as long as 1.3m and is tipped by a series of very coarse, wire-like hairs. They have an extraordinary degree of control over tail movement and use them as a fly swat against insects.\nFeet\nThe elephant\u2019s feet are an amazing product of genetic engineering making them unsurpassed as a means of traversing saturated ground or marshland. The sole pads expand when weight is brought down and contract when the pressure is released. This allows even distribution of the elephant\u2019s massive bulk. Thai elephants usually, but not always, have four toenails on their front feet and five on the rear. An amazing, but nevertheless accurate, fact is that an elephant\u2019s height at the shoulder is twice the circumference of his foot.\nHabitat\nAsian elephants are found in a wide range of habitats including jungle forests and grasslands. The reduction of viable elephant habitat is the greatest threat to the survival of Asian elephants.\nDiet\nElephants are herbivores and enjoy a range of vegetation including grass, bamboo, a variety of tree and plant leaves, legumes, bark, roots and fruit. A mature adult has a prodigious appetite and requires between 200-300kg of food every day. An elephant\u2019s digestive system is not particularly efficient, digesting less than 50% of its food.\nA healthy adult can drink up to 60 gallons of water a day!\nLifespan and Cycles\nThe elephant, more than any other animal, closely follows the life cycle of human beings. A pregnant elephant\u2019s gestation period is between 18 and 22 months. Towards the end of pregnancy, the mother will choose another female from the herd as an \u2018auntie\u2019 to help with the birth and the rearing of her offspring. Twins occur very rarely.\nThe young are suckled up to the age of four, although they will start developing an interest in solids from as young as six months. As the infant grows, the whole family group is involved in its protection, education and discipline. In the early teens, elephants become sexually mature and from the age of 16, a female can reproduce. A cow rarely has more than four children through her lifetime. Between the ages of 25 and 40, elephants are in their prime of life and the peak of their physical prowess. After 40, they begin to slow down but have the advantage of experience. At about 55, old age starts to set in and if they are lucky, they will reach 70 and possibly even older.\nMusth\nMusth is a condition unique to elephants, which has still not been scientifically explained. It affects sexually mature male elephants usually between the ages of 20 and 50. It occurs annually and lasts for a period of between 2 to 3 weeks, usually during the hot season. During this time, the elephant becomes highly agitated, aggressive and dangerous. Even normally placid animals have been known to kill people and other elephants when in the full throes of musth. The reasons for its occurrence are not fully understood. The animal is sexually agitated, but musth is not thought to be entirely sexual in nature. Elephants mate outside the musth period and it is not the same as the rutting season common in some other mammals. When in musth, a strong smelling oily secretion flows from a gland above the eye. This discharge can be quite free flowing and run down the elephant\u2019s face and dribble into his mouth. The taste of the secretion can drive the animal wild. Domesticated elephants experiencing musth are usually kept securely chained and fed from a distance until the torment subsides, after which he will return to his usual character. From 45-50 musth gradually diminishes, eventually disappearing altogether. On very exceptional occasions, a form of musth has been recorded in females.\nSocial Behaviour\nElephants are highly socialised animals which live in family groups. Wild herds consist of females and their young and are led by a matriarch, who is the undisputed leader; where she goes the herd will always follow. The matriarch and other senior females carry within their memories the wealth of knowledge gained from their life experiences. This is vital to the extended family\u2019s well being. At the onset of maturity, young males will be ousted from the herd and form small male groups of up to 10 animals. These will roughly track the movements of the main female group. As they reach their mid twenties, mature males usually stay in pairs or a group of three. There is a hierarchy among the adult male, with the dominant bull having prime mating rights. This position is usually attained by a trial of combat against any challenging bulls. Different herds, including male groups, can come together at favoured water holes or grazing sites. There is never friction between the groups and observers have reported that often they appear to be joyous reunions."}

The largest species of elephant, the African savanna elephant may reach a length up to 5m (16ft) long with a weight up to 7 tonnes (7 tons).\nThey have a number of identifiable, unique features. The most obvious of these is the trunk. This is a flexible elongation of the upper lip and nose. It includes thousands of muscles and is used to collect food, lift items and suck up water.\nAnother feature is the tusks which are the upper incisors. In all species the male has large visible tusks. Male African elephants have visible tusks while those of females do not protrude past the lips.\nA major threat to elephants is poaching to obtain the ivory from which their tusks are formed.\nThe final feature is the large ears which fan out on either side of the head. These are filled with a network of blood vessels which helps them to remove heat from their body. African elephants have larger ears than the Asian elephants and it is said that they look like the shape of Africa."}

Sadly, elephant facts reveal that people are the only real danger to these animals.\nThe number of elephants left in the wild is diminishing. We must put a stop to poaching once and for all! Keep on scrolling to find out more interesting facts about these majestic animals!\nTop 10 Facts About Elephants\nIf these quick facts got you interested, keep reading to learn more fascinating facts and stats about the Earth\u2019s biggest land mammal!\nInteresting Facts About Elephants\nWe\u2019re sure that all elephant fans know the most common facts about these mammals. But, here are some of the most interesting ones we bet you didn\u2019t know.\n1. There are three distinct elephant species \u2014 the African Savanna elephant, the African Forest Elephant, and the Asian elephant.\n(National Geographic Kids)\nFacts on elephants reveal they\u2019re renowned for their tusks, big ears, and trunks. Moreover, there\u2019s actually a neat trick to differentiate the African and Asian Elephants \u2014 their famous ears!\nThe African elephant has big ears, shaped much like the African continent. Whereas the Asian elephant\u2019s ears are much smaller and shaped like India, as well-known elephants\u2019 ears facts reveal.\n2. An adult elephant needs to eat up to 330lbs of food every day.\n(Discover Wildlife)\nWhat do elephants eat? Elephants are herbivores; meaning, their diet consists primarily of plants. They often eat grass, leaves, flowers, and even woody parts of trees and shrubs, including fruit when it\u2019s available. They also dig for roots after rain.\nAnd just how much does an elephant eat a day? A whopping 330lbs of food! The Asian elephant eats more than 100 species of plants. And both the African and Asian elephants eat crops such as millet.\n3. Elephant fun facts reveal that an average adult elephant makes about one ton of poop every week.\n(National Geographic Kids)\nSince elephants spend somewhere between 12 and 18 hours a day eating, there has to be an awful lot of poop.\nHowever, elephant poop facts reveal this is extremely useful since it fertilizes the soil and disperses tree seeds. Also, elephants dig water holes and make footpaths, changing the very landscape around them.\n(A-Z Animals)\nThis is how scientists determine the size of an elephant merely by measuring the size of its footprint.\nWhat\u2019s more, elephant feet have five toes. Yet, not all their toes have toenails. The toes are formed so that when an elephant walks, they are actually walking on their tiptoes.\n5. About 50% of Asian female elephants have short tusks (tushes), according to elephant tusks facts.\n(EleAid)\nAnother main difference between the Asian and African elephants is their tusks. All African elephants have tusks, both male and female. On the contrary, only some Asian elephants have them, and females have \u201ctushes.\u201d\nBasically, elephants\u2019 tusks are elongated teeth, which never stop growing. Elephants use their tusks primarily for self-defense, to dig, and lift and move heavy objects.\n6. Besides tusks, elephants also have 4 molars (teeth).\n(International Elephant Foundation)\nAs the fun facts about elephants state, there is one molar in each jaw.\nAn African elephant usually goes through six sets of molars during its lifetime. Each molar can grow between 10 and 12 inches and can weigh over 8lbs.\nThe final set of molars form when the elephant is in their forties, and it lasts them till the end of their lifetime.\n7. An elephant\u2019s eyesight has a range of only 25ft.\n(EleAid)\nAccording to the interesting elephant facts, the animal has relatively poor eyesight, and its eyes are incredibly small. The reason for this is the position and size of their head and neck.\nIn addition to this, elephants also have limited peripheral vision. Their eyesight improves slightly in the forest shade.\n8. Elephant trunks can lift up as much as 770lbs.\n(RealClearScience)\nAn elephant\u2019s trunk is actually a fusion of its upper lip and nose. They use it to touch, smell, breathe, grasp, and make sounds.\nElephant trunk facts reveal that the trunk has no bones. It actually consists of more than 40,000 muscles divided into 150,000 individual units. For comparison, the entire human body has only 639 muscles.\nBesides all of these functions, the elephant\u2019s trunk also serves as a snorkel. All the elephant has to do is keep their trunk above water, and they can cross any body of water they want.\n9. Elephant memory facts reveal that elephants can recognize up to 30 companions by either smell or sight.\n(TED-Ed)\nTheir memory is astonishing. They remember each member of their herd, yet their memory is not limited to just their herd or species.\nThere are circus elephants who have performed together and have recognized each other after decades of separation.\nMoreover, elephants can also recognize people they have bonded with, even though they may have been separated for years, as some elephant facts claim.\n10. Elephants are exceptionally intelligent animals.\n(Mental Floss)\nTheir overall behavior is proof of this. For example, the African elephant can distinguish between people\u2019s age, gender, and ethnicity solely based on the sound of their voice.\nMoreover, besides identifying languages, elephants can also understand the human body language. They can also mimic people\u2019s voices, show empathy, and mourn their dead.\nIn addition to all this, elephant intelligence facts also show that they can use various tools to reach fruit or use sticks for scratching themselves (just like in the cartoons).\n11. An elephant\u2019s tail can be up to 4.2ft long.\n(EleAid)\nElephants have great control over the movement of their tails. They usually use them as fly swats against various insects. Besides being quite long, the elephant\u2019s tail is also tipped by extremely coarse hair that looks like wires.\nFacts About Elephants and Their Family\nAs if elephants weren\u2019t sweet enough, these facts will melt your heart and make you love them even more.\n12. An elephant family typically consists of 6 to 12 members, but it can count up to 20 members.\n(Elephants Forever)\nA very important elephant fact \u2014 herds have a matriarchal head, and they usually consist of 3 or 4 female elephants (the matriarch\u2019s daughters) and their calves.\nThe females help each other while giving birth, and they also keep an eye on each other\u2019s calves. When the matriarch dies, one of her daughters (usually the eldest) replaces her.\n13. Elephants\u2019 romantic relationships last forever.\n(TravelStart)\nOne of the sweetest elephant facts about love is that they\u2019re incredibly romantic creatures.\nElephants are highly social and bond fairly quickly. They touch each other, cuddle, and intertwine their trunks, just like people hold hands, which is the ultimate sign of love between them. Usually, their relationships last for a lifetime.\n14. An elephant pregnancy lasts for 22 months.\n(AAAS, ElephantFacts)\nElephants are enormous in every way. Besides being the largest land animal, they also have the longest gestation period among all mammals.\nAs elephant pregnancy facts state, the gestation period can last anywhere between 620 and 680 days, which adds up to almost two years. Typically, the intervals between two pregnancies vary between 4 and 6 years.\n15. Approximately 99% of elephants are born at night.\n(ThoughtCo.)\nBaby elephants are called calves, and they usually stay close to their mothers for the first couple of months after they\u2019re born.\nBaby elephants suck their trunks just like human babies suck thumbs, as baby elephant facts explain. When they reach 6 to 8 months, the calves learn to use their trunks to eat and drink.\n16. Baby elephants weigh 250lbs at birth.\n(ThoughtCo.)\nThey are also approximately 3ft tall and have curly black or red hair on their foreheads. Elephant calves drink milk from their mother for up to ten years after being born, drinking up to 3 gallons of milk every day, as elephant birth facts claim.\nFemale elephants stay with their herd for the entirety of their lives, whereas male elephants start a solitary life between 12 and 14.\n17. Baby elephants start walking just minutes after being born.\n(Elephants for Africa)\nThe reason for this is that they must stand to be able to drink their mother\u2019s milk, or they\u2019ll perish. They also follow their mothers and observe their behavior to adapt to their new surroundings.\nAfrican Elephant Facts\nThe Asian elephant is the largest of all elephant species. Did you know it can weigh up to 8 tons?\nWant to know what is unique about African elephants? Here\u2019s more interesting info on the subspecies.\n18. The largest ever recorded elephant was an African male, weighing 24,000lbs.\n(Global Sanctuary for Elephants)\nHe was also 13ft tall, at the shoulder. For comparison, an average car weighs approximately 4,000lbs, and an average one-story home is about 8ft tall. African elephants live on the majority of the African continent, south of the Sahara desert.\n19. African elephant\u2019s brain weighs 5.4kg (9.9lbs).\n(United for Wildlife)\nOne of the most fascinating elephant facts is the size of their brain. We\u2019ve already noted that nothing about this animal species is small. So it comes as no surprise that the largest land animal on Earth also has the largest brain of all land animals.\n20. There are roughly 415,000 African elephants left in the wild.\n(WWF)\nThe data on elephant population by-country reveals that African elephants wander through 37 African countries.\nTheir natural habitat includes flooded grasslands and savannahs, tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests, Acacia savannahs, and Miombo woodlands.\nThe African elephant population is relatively small, yet their official status is vulnerable and not endangered.\n21. There are two African elephant species \u2014 the African Forest elephant and the African Savanna (Bush) elephant.\n(National Geographic)\nFor a reasonably long time, scientists thought that these two species were merely subspecies of the African elephant.\nHowever, DNA analysis has revealed that these two are actually two different species.\nWhat\u2019s more, the two species have evolved from a common ancestor, as African Bush elephant facts show. It occurred somewhere between 2.5 million and 5 million years ago.\n22. African Savanna elephants are the larger species \u2014 they grow up to 13ft and weigh up to 7 tons.\n(WWF)\nSavanna elephants are renowned for their enormous ears. They help the elephants radiate excess heat. Another distinctive feature is their front legs that are relatively longer than their hind legs.\nAccording to the data on the African elephant population, the species lives in the southern and eastern regions of the continent. This particular species lives predominantly in Tanzania, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Kenya, South Africa, and Mozambique.\n23. The African Forest Elephant is the smaller species, growing up to \u201cjust\u201d 10ft and weighing up to 5 tons.\n(WWF)\nTheir ears are not as big as the African Savanna elephants\u2019 and are also oval-shaped. Their tusks are also straighter and pointed downwards. They live in dense tropical forests, so their exact numbers can\u2019t be counted as precisely or as efficiently.\nAfrican Forest elephant facts state that they usually live in dense forests of:\nthe Democratic Republic of Congo\nGabon, Cameroon\nC\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\nthe Central African Republic\nGhana, and\nLiberia.\n24. African Forest elephants reach reproductive maturity at the age of 23.\n(AWF)\nThey have the slowest reproductive rate of all three species.\nConsidering the two-year gestation period, any population decline caused by either poaching, bushmeat trade, logging operations, or natural resource extraction could be fatal for the species.\nAsian Elephants Facts\nEven though it\u2019s much smaller than its African cousin, the Asian elephant is still the largest mammal on the Asian continent.\n25. The Asian elephant can grow up to 9.8ft and weigh up to 5.5 tons.\n(National Geographic)\nFacts about Asian elephants show that Asian elephants are relatively smaller than their African counterparts, and they\u2019re classified as endangered species.\nIllegal ivory trade and habitat loss due to deforestation and agricultural development are two main threats to the Asian elephant population.\n26. There are three subspecies of the Asian elephant \u2014 the Indian elephant, the Sumatran elephant, and the Sri Lankan elephant.\n(WWF)\nIndian elephant facts state that this subspecies makes up for the majority of the remaining Asian elephants.\nThe Sri Lankan elephant is physically the largest of the three subspecies and has the darkest skin. On the contrary, the Sumatran elephant is the smallest of the three.\n27. Only 7% of male Thailand elephants have tusks.\n(BLES)\nThe females have tushes, as previously mentioned. The whole species has only one trunk finger, which they use to pick up and move objects, as the Thailand elephants\u2019 facts state.\nTheir ears are also much smaller than those of their African cousins, and their skin is smoother.\n28. Thailand had approximately 20,000 elephants trained for war back in the 17th century.\n(Culture Trip)\nThe elephant is a royal symbol in Thailand, and the Thai Royal Family has kept them for thousands of years. Besides taking part in ceremonies and festivals held in their honor, they were also used as war animals.\nAmazing facts about elephants reveal that their strength, size, power, and longevity, made them the perfect weapon, as well as shields, in battle.\n29. There are between 2,400 and 2,800 Sumatran elephants left in the wild.\n(WWF, OneKindPlanet)\nThe smallest of the subspecies, but the biggest mammal on the Sumatran island, is critically endangered.\nUsually, these elephants love to roam the forests of Sumatra and Borneo. They can even climb up to 300 meters uphill, as Sumatran elephant facts reveal.\nBecause of their size, Sumatran elephants have practically no predators. Although, sometimes, tigers tend to prey on baby Sumatran elephants.\n30. Less than 8.2ft tall, the Borneo pygmy elephant is the smallest in the world.\n(Natural Habitat Adventures)\nThey\u2019re a part of the Sumatran elephant subspecies derived from the Sundaic stock some 300,000 years ago.\nThe primary threat to these elephants is habitat loss. The Borneo pygmy elephant facts reveal that there are approximately 1,500 of these elephants left in the world.\nMoreover, 20% of the subspecies are hurt by illegal snares set to catch smaller animals.\n31. There are less than 4,000 Sri Lankan elephants left in the world.\n(Animalia)\nThe largest of the three Asian elephant subspecies is also highly endangered. There are between 2,500 and 4,000 Sri Lankan elephants left in the wild.\nAccording to the Sri Lankan elephant\u2019s facts, the subspecies were spread across Sri Lankan forests. They\u2019re now facing habitat loss due to rapid deforestation and urbanization.\n32. There are only 30 white elephants left in the world.\n(Travel Triangle, USA Today)\nThailand is known as the \u201cLand of White Elephants.\u201d For centuries, these majestic creatures were viewed as a sign of the king\u2019s magnificence. These scarce albino elephants aren\u2019t actually white but rather pinkish in color.\nWhite elephant numbers have always been low, but the species is alarmingly close to extinction. Royals used to pamper them, and many people believed that they brought good luck to the country.\n33. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild.\n(Mom.me)\nElephant figures reveal that the African elephant lives a bit longer than the Asian and has a median lifespan of 56 years.\nOn the other hand, their Asian cousins have a median lifespan of just 41.7 years. Poaching, illegal hunting for ivory, deforestation, and urbanization are shortening their lifespans.\n34. Elephants in the Elefanjoy sanctuary were seriously affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n(The Guardian)\nAs the pandemic hit, many countries, including India, went into a strict lockdown. The worldwide elephant population was affected, but elephants of the Elefanjoy sanctuary in Jaipur, India, were hit hard.\nThey couldn\u2019t take their daily 30-mile walks, which are essential for stretching their legs and digestion.\nMoreover, the elephants could sense their caretakers\u2019 and other animals\u2019 gloomy moods, so they also fell into depression. This shows just how sensitive these giants are.\nElephant Poaching Statistics\nDespite the 1989 ban on international ivory sales, elephants are still being hunted down and poached for their tusks. Black market sales have increased exponentially.\nAs a result, their numbers are reducing, as the elephant poaching statistics from 2020 show.\n35. Elephant poaching rates had decreased from more than 10% in 2011 to 4% in 2017.\n(ScienceDaily)\nElephant poaching facts reveal that the poaching rates peaked in 2011. Even though they\u2019re currently pretty low, the species are still endangered (the Asian elephant in particular) or on the verge of becoming endangered (the African elephant).\n36. Over the last decade, the number of elephants has dropped by 62%.\n(World Elephant Day)\nIf the killing rates continue, elephant poaching statistics for 2022 show that elephants could become completely extinct by the end of the next decade.\nElephants are being hunted and poached for their ivory, whose price in China has tripled from 2010 to 2014.\n37. 361 elephants died in Sri Lanka in 2019.\n(BBC)\nThis is a record number ever since Sri Lanka became independent in 1948. Unfortunately, the majority of these elephants were killed by people.\nBut according to the elephant poaching statistics from 2019, there are still approximately 7,500 elephants in Sri Lanka.\n38. More than 100,000 African elephants have been killed in just three years.\n(National Geographic)\nThe data on the elephant population from 2020 reveals that just in 2011, 1 in every 12 elephants was killed by poachers. Researchers estimate that every year 3% of the total population of elephants was poached.\nElephants are a crucial species since they help balance out other species in the ecosystem. Losing them would be horrific.\n39. Elephant poaching statistics from 2019 show approximately 415,000 African elephants were left in the wild.\n(WWF)\nSome pockets of African elephants are safe from poachers and are currently expanding, particularly those in southern Africa.\nHowever, the number of elephants in central and some parts of east Africa is dramatically low. There are barely over 400,000 elephants left, and the species is incredibly vulnerable.\n40. There are only 40,000\u201350,000 Asian elephants left in the world.\n(WWF)\nElephant poaching statistics reveal that the number of Asian elephants has dropped by more than 50% throughout the past three generations.\nOne common thing for both the Asian and African elephants is that their numbers have dropped significantly during the 19th and 20th centuries, mainly due to poaching.\nFAQ\n41. How many elephants are born each year?\nMore elephants are killed than born at the moment.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that their rate of birth is so low. They give birth to only one calf at a time \u2014 twins are possible but extremely rare. Furthermore, their gestation period is around two years, and there\u2019s also a 4\u20136-year gap between pregnancies.\n42. How many elephants are killed each day?\nIt\u2019s estimated that around 100 African elephants are killed every day for their ivory, meat, and body parts, leaving barely 400,000 of them on the planet.\n43. How many more elephants are left?\nThere were predictions that by 2020 elephants would be extinct. Still, there are currently about 465,000 elephants in the Asian and African wilds.\n44. How many elephants are killed each year?\nUnfortunately, the data shows that about 20,000 African elephants are being killed every year.\n45. What percentage of African elephants are killed each year?\nIn the last decade, more than 64% of African elephants have been killed. It\u2019s estimated that every year 8% of African Savanna elephants are killed, and 1 in 12 elephants of the entire species.\n46. How smart is an elephant?\nElephants are impressively smart. They have been using objects from their vicinity to swat insects, reach food, or scratch themselves. They are also known for mourning their dead, distinguishing different languages, and remembering people.\n47. Why are elephants so amazing?\nThey plant trees, fight climate change (in their own way), and support other species by fertilizing the land and digging waterholes.\n48. Why are elephants so special?\nBesides being incredibly intelligent and emotional creatures, elephants help the ecosystem and maintain biodiversity.\n49. What are elephants scared of?\nIt\u2019s a cartoon myth that elephants are afraid of mice. They are actually scared of bees because African honey bees are known to be extremely aggressive.\n50. Are elephants dangerous to humans?\nGenerally, elephants aren\u2019t dangerous. However, when male elephants reach their reproductive age (musth), they are extremely dangerous to both people and animals due to their reproductive hormones.\n51. Are elephants endangered?\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies the African elephant as vulnerable. In contrast, the Asian elephant is an endangered species.\n52. What are elephant tusks used for?\nElephants use their tusks for defense, offense, digging, lifting heavy objects, gathering food, or stripping tree barks so they could eat from trees, and they also protect the trunk.\nConclusion\nWe hope that this long list of elephant facts has shown you what majestic creatures they are and why we should try to protect them as much as we can.\nWe must raise awareness and put an end to poaching and the illegal ivory trade. Perhaps then, this amazing species\u2019 population can increase in numbers and stop itself from becoming extinct.\nSources"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "15 Fun and Interesting Elephant Facts for Kids - ChildFun", "url": "https://www.childfun.com/articles/general/15-elephant-facts-for-kids/", "text": "Spread the love\nWhen a child finds a new interest, it\u2019s always fun to be able to explore it with them, and present them with the tools to dig deeper and learn more. If you know a kid who has expressed an interest in elephants, or animals in general, you\u2019ll find this page very helpful! We\u2019ve curated a collection of fifteen interesting and fun facts about elephants for kids, along with further reading, sources, and references for you!\n1. There are two types of elephants found in the world\nThere are two species of elephants found on Earth today, the Asian Elephant (Elephas maximus) and the African Elephant (Loxodonta africana). Asian Elephants are found in Nepal, India, and Southeast Asia in tropical forests while African Elephants are found in the Sahel desert, sub-Saharan Africa, and tropical forests in Central and West Africa.\nYou can tell these species of elephants apart from their size and ears. Asian Elephants are smaller than African Elephants with smaller, less pronounced ears.\n2. Elephants are the largest living land animal\nWhen fully grown, African Elephants range in size from 8 to 13 feet shoulder height, and weigh between 5,000 to 14,000 pounds. Asian Elephants are smaller than their African counterparts with a height of 7 to 10 feet shoulder height, and weigh between 4,500 to 11,000 pounds on average.\nThe only living mammal larger than an Elephant is the Blue Whale, found in the Pacific, Antarctic, and Atlantic oceans.\n3. Elephants can\u2019t jump\nUnlike the cute depictions in television shows and movies, elephants don\u2019t have the ability to jump. Now, this fact might not come as much as a surprise due to their large size, but there are other reasons why elephants can\u2019t jump besides the obvious.\nMost animals that jump do so out of necessity, whether it is to gather food or escape from predators. Luckily, for our elephant friends, their large size makes them a threat to most would-be predators, and food is easily accessible to them.\nAnother reason why elephants can\u2019t jump is due to their bone structure. Unlike our bones, the bones in an elephant\u2019s legs are only pointed downward, removing the necessary \u201cspring\u201d required to jump into the air.\n4. Elephants spend 16 hours per day eating\nElephants are herbivores, which means they only eat plants. They are also one of the largest animals in the world, so it might not come as a surprise to you that they spend most of their day eating. It takes a lot of fuel to power such a large and powerful creature, and that means they have to eat a lot of plants to fill up. Imagine eating a bowl of plain greens as your meal, it would have to be such a huge bowl to fill you up, now imagine you\u2019re as big as an elephant!\nSome of an elephant\u2019s favorite foods are bamboo, flowers, fruits, grasses, leaves, twigs, seeds, and herbs. This is an opportunity to ask the child what their favorite foods are, how much of that food they would eat if they were an elephant, and other fun and creative things to think about.\n5. Elephants travel in a herd\nClose relationships and family ties are important for elephants, just like they are for people like us! Female elephants travel in groups called herds that range in size from 8 to 100 elephants. The elephants in a herd are members of the same family, and the oldest is the leader.\nMale elephants leave the herd between 12 to 15 years of age and live alone or with other male elephants.\n6. Elephants can communicate with each other over far distances\nElephants communicate to each other using a variety of sounds. These sounds include crying, roaring, snorting, and even rumbling. Elephants are known for having great hearing, allowing them to communicate and hear each other from up to 5 miles away. That type of hearing can come in handy when you\u2019re wandering around from your friends!\nThey do this by using the sensitive nerves in their feet to hear sound vibrations as they travel through the ground at a volume only elephants can hear. When you think of how big they are, it makes sense that they would be able to create such deep sounds that can vibrate the ground, but it\u2019s also incredible to think about! It\u2019s like they\u2019re a living subwoofer, good thing they aren\u2019t your neighbors!\nExtra: Can you think of a landmark that\u2019s around 5 miles away from where you are? It can help to contextualize that distance for children.\n7. Elephants can live to be 70 years old\nWhen left in their natural habitat with plenty of food, water, and low amounts of stress, elephants are known to live as long as 70 years of age. This is not far from our life expectancy as humans.\nLike with humans and other animals, there are factors that contribute to a shorter lifespan. Some factors affecting elephants are not enough sources of food or water, illness, and illegal hunting. It helps that they\u2019re able to fend off most predators, unfortunately illegal poaching has had a very negative impact on the numbers of elephants in the wild.\n8. Elephants can use their trunks to breathe underwater\nIt might surprise you to learn that elephants are naturally great swimmers. Their large size allows them to float with ease and they can swim long distances thanks to the use of their trunk.\nUseful for other tasks like eating, picking up objects, and drinking water, elephants can also use their trunk as a snorkel for breathing while swimming completely submerged. Elephants are known to love water and will spend hours swimming to keep cool and search for new areas of land.\n9. Elephants have great memories\nThis might sound unbelievable, but take a look at this real-life example that took place in 1999 at The Elephant Sanctuary located in Hohenwald, Tennessee.\nWhen a new Asian Elephant named Shirley arrived at the sanctuary, it didn\u2019t take long for employees to notice the excitement in Jenny, an African Elephant. Employees were stumped because it was not the response you\u2019d expect when introducing new elephants. Surprising to everyone involved, a search into the background of both elephants discovered that they briefly performed at the same circus together 23 years earlier. How crazy is that?\n10. Female elephants are pregnant for 2 years\nAn elephant fetus takes 22 months to develop in the womb. To put this in perspective, this is about 2.5 times as long as a human fetus, which takes 9 months to develop.\nA baby elephant weighs between 200 and 300 pounds at birth, so it\u2019s easy to see why they take so much longer than any other mammal to fully develop. Additionally, unlike human babies, baby elephants are born with almost fully developed brains. This gives them the knowledge to walk, eat on their own, and understand their role in the herd shortly after birth.\n11. One adult elephant consumes 300 \u2013 600 pounds of food per day\nElephants usually fall within the range of 5,000 and 14,000 pounds when fully grown, so it might not come as a surprise that they consume such a large quantity of food. Their large body mass isn\u2019t the only reason an elephant eats so much food, though!\nPoor digestion is also to blame, as elephants can only digest (make use of) 40% of the food they eat. They need to eat larger quantities of food to make up any energy or nutrients lost from a previous meal. Remember when we talked about how much time they spend eating? Now you know why it takes them so long!\n12. Along with their large food consumption, elephants drink 30-50 gallons of water per day\nWater is essential in an elephant\u2019s daily life for hydration, cooling off, bathing, and even play time. Water consumption also plays an important role in successful digestion, so it\u2019s no wonder why an animal as large as an elephant can drink so much water!\nIf you need help visualizing 50 gallons of water, it would be like drinking 12 \u00bd big jugs of milk, or almost a bathtub full.\n13. Elephants use mud as sunscreen\nSun safety is just as important for elephants as it is for us. Coppertone might not make sunscreen for elephants, but luckily, they are resourceful animals and use something else that is readily available to them \u2013 mud!\nAn elephant will slather themselves in mud by using their trunk to spray it over their body or by bathing in it. Mud doubles as protection against ticks and other bugs too!\n14. Elephants are afraid of bees\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine an animal as large as an elephant being afraid of anything, but it\u2019s true \u2013 elephants are afraid of bees.\nElephants show their discomfort around bees by flapping their ears, kicking up dust, making noises, or running away when they hear the buzzing of a hive nearby. The fear is so strong that African farmers have started to keep beehives near their crops to keep elephants out.\n15. Humans are an elephant\u2019s strongest predator\nWith the exception of weakened or young elephants becoming prey to lions and other strong predators in the wild, they are known to have no natural enemies. In other words, most other animals respect and like the elephants\u2026\nUnfortunately, the strongest threat to an elephant is a human. Many elephants have lost their lives to senseless hunting in the name of the ivory trade. Over time, elephants have become a protected species with restrictions against the production of ivory. This hasn\u2019t completely eliminated the senseless violence against these gorgeous and important creatures, but it has been reduced greatly.\nNote: Depending on the age and maturity of your child, you may want to leave out this last fact. It\u2019s heavy, sad and upsetting, but it\u2019s also a very teachable moment if you\u2019re prepared for that conversation.\nFinal Thoughts\nElephants are an important creature, and they need our help to thrive around the world. Things have shifted in recent years, with an informed public being less interested in ivory or circus elephants that are treated very poorly. Still, there\u2019s a lot of work to do, and it all begins with education!"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "ELEPHANT FACTS - Elephant Conservation Center", "url": "https://www.elephantconservationcenter.com/elephant-facts/", "text": "Elephants have worked alongside humans for thousands of years. The ancient art of being an elephant owner (mahout) carries with it the responsibility of trust, skill, strength and kindness. Captive elephants in Laos are treated as family members by their adopted human family.\nSadly, captive elephant populations are in decline. Approximately 400 wild elephants remain in Laos. The new millennium has bought with it the burden of financial gain, with mahouts having to work their elephants seven days a week to earn a living. Until recently elephants were mainly employed in the logging industry, a very hard and dangerous job. Elephants are too overworked to reproduce and can even die from logging accidents.\nThe fertility of female elephants is markedly lost at 30 years of age. It\u2019s very important that a cow has had the opportunity to reproduce before her reproductive health is compromised.\nHowever a mahout cannot afford to rest his female elephant during her pregnancy and lactation. The cow cannot work for at least 4 years and a calf is a liability for logging mahouts who need to wait the animal\u2019s 13th birthday before the elephant can make money by pulling logs \u2013 a very long time for a family to be without income.\nAll these factors mean the birth of a domestic calf is a rare event in Laos. However, the Elephant Conservation Center allows owners of pregnant cows to join their breeding programme during their elephant\u2019s pregnancy and during the 2-3 years that follow it. This supports elephant reproduction while offering mahouts a paid job. Thanks to the Elephant Conservation Center\u2019s breeding incentive programme, captive elephants and their owners are given alternative options. This hopefully will help Laos remain a sacred heartland for elephants."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Facts about Elephants - Elephant Nature Park", "url": "https://www.elephantnaturepark.org/about/facts-about-elephants/", "text": "There are two different species of elephant \u2013 the African (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian variety (Elephas maximus). The former is larger and there are a few distinct differences. The African species numbers are estimated at approximately 500,000 whilst the Asian variety has fallen to an disturbingly low estimated figure of below 30,000.\nThere are a number of elephant races within the Asian species. For instance the Indian elephant, is bigger, has longer front legs and a thinner body than their Thai counterparts. As the park deals exclusively with Thai elephants we will concern ourselves with this particular order. The facts are, however, generally applicable to all types of Asian Elephant.\nVarious authorities differ somewhat on exact details. Using our own experience and taking into account numerous sources we present you with our own interpretation. Elephants, like human beings, can and do vary in many characteristics, emotions and personality.\nAsian Elephants \u2013 Existing Numbers\nThe Asian Elephant, still known to many as the Indian Elephant, is officially an endangered species. Present numbers have dropped to an alarmingly low level with estimates of under 30,000 left in the entire world. This disturbingly small number of survivors is epitomised by the fact that these gentle beast have been exterminated from large areas of their former habitat.\nIn Thailand there is an estimated 3,000-4,000 elephants. Around half of this number are domesticated, the remainder living wild in National Parks Reserves. Some 300 are suffer under appalling conditions in Bangkok.\nIt is notable that at the start of the 20th century (1900 AD) over 100,000 elephants graced the Siamese (Thai) countryside.\nElephant Abuse\nThey are forced to walk on hot tarmac roads by gangs of elephant owners and beg for fruit and food. The owner of often buys the elephant purely to obtain begging money from sympathetic passers by. As he has scant experience with animal training, the hapless creature is cruelly treated and beaten as the rider becomes impatient. In the city the animal cannot possibly get the 200-300 kg of food and 100-200 litres of water necessary for it\u2019s daily nourishment so it plods the hot polluted streets, thirsty hungry and confused. These animals quickly suffer from stress through polluted air, poor diet, dehydration, loneliness and their sensitive ears are soon damaged. Much of the fruit purchased from local sellers has been treated with chemicals and causes serious stomach problems and eventually death.\nOther forms of, less apparent abuse come in the form of pet baby elephants featured at hotels and entertainment complexes. Although the animals may seem happy enough they are invariably fed the wrong diet, suffer from loneliness and boredom and will soon die. Many unwitting tourists, delighted at the sight of a \u201ccute\u201d baby elephant, are completely unaware that the lifespan of the creature is likely to be only a few years.\nThe problems\nThere are a number of important factors to consider but we will deal with the four main ones;\nFirst and foremost is human encroachment in the domain of the elephant. With a fast growing population Asia does not have the land resources for both humans and the indigenous wildlife populations. There is not a government in the world that will sacrifice it\u2019s voters in favour of mere animals.\nSecondary is greed. Whilst it is inevitable that much land is set aside for growing human populations there are a number of influential persons seeking huge land areas for personal gain. Illegal logging and such environmentally detrimental pursuits lead to a reduction in grazing or browsing land for the animals.\nThirdly is poaching for ivory, skin or aphrodisiacs which the elephant is said to possess.\nFourthly: Sport. Unbelievably there are such deluded souls amongst us that actually think the killing a defenseless animal is sport. Wealthy patron\u2019s of these games are willing to travel and pay handsomely for the sheer pleasure of \u201cbagging\u201d an elephant.\nHow our park is helping\nThrough the development of our park we are providing a haven for these animals. The birth of three baby elephants within a few months of opening was both a joy for everyone at the park and a great encouragement."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "10 Fascinating facts about elephants - Africa Geographic", "url": "https://africageographic.com/stories/10-fascinating-facts-about-elephants/", "text": "Written by Aleema Noormohamed\nElephants, the planet\u2019s largest terrestrial mammal, are fascinating creatures that are worth getting to understand.\nHere are 10 facts everyone should know about elephants.\n1. There are three distinct species of elephant left in the world: The Asian elephant and, in Africa, the forest and savannah elephant species.\n2. The word \u201celephant\u201d comes from the Greek word \u201celephas\u201d which means \u201civory\u201d.\n3. The elephant\u2019s gestation period is 22 months \u2013 longer than any other land animal in the world. A newborn human baby weighs an average of 7 pounds while a newborn elephant baby can weigh up to 260 pounds! The baby can stand up shortly after being born.\n4. The oldest known elephant in the world lived for 86 years (1917 \u2013 2003). The average lifespan of an elephant is from 50 to 70 years. The largest known elephant was shot in Angola in 1956 and weighed about 11 tons! It had a shoulder height of 3.96 metres!\n5. The tusks of an elephant are modified incisors that grow throughout an elephant\u2019s lifetime. An adult male\u2019s tusks grow about 7 inches a year. Tusks are used to dig for salt, water and roots, to debark trees, to clear a path and occasionally in fights. Additionally, they are used for marking trees to establish an elephant\u2019s territory.\n6. The elephant\u2019s trunk is a fusion of its nose and upper lip. It is the elephant\u2019s most important limb. The trunk is sensitive enough to pick up a blade of grass and strong enough to rip the branches off a tree. The trunk is also used for drinking \u2013 the elephant can suck up to 14 litres of water at a time and then blow it straight into its mouth!\nWhen bathing, the elephant sucks water to spray on its body. It will then spray dirt and mud on its wet coat, which will dry and act as a sunscreen.\n7. Elephants have two gaits \u2013 a walk and a faster gait that is similar to running. They cannot jump, trot or gallop, however, they can swim and use their trunk as a snorkel. Read more about this fascinating topic here: Can elephants run, or do they just walk faster?\n8. The elephant\u2019s huge ears are used to radiate excess heat away from the body. They have blood vessels close to the skin surface, that carry air, cooled when the elephant flaps its ears, to the main bloodstream.\n9. Elephant behaviour is associated with a unique animal intelligence that displays grief, altruism, compassion, self-awareness, play, art and music!\n10. There is a structured social order in the elephant\u2019s lifestyle. The females spend their entire lives in tight family groups made up of mothers, grandmothers, aunts, sisters and daughters. The eldest female normally leads the group. Adult males prefer to live a bachelor lifestyle.\nTo comment on this story please join our PRIVATE TRAVEL & CONSERVATION CLUB.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "African Elephant Facts for Kids | Elephants | African Animals", "url": "https://animalfactguide.com/animal-facts/african-elephant/", "text": "Weighing up to 6000 kg (6.6 tons) and measuring up to 3.3 m (10 ft.) at the shoulder, the African elephant is the world\u2019s largest land mammal. It is characterized by its highly dexterous trunk, long curved tusks, and massive ears.\nA combination of the upper lip and nose, an African elephant\u2019s trunk is extremely versatile. Elephants use their trunk for smelling, breathing, detecting vibrations, caressing their young, sucking up water, and grasping objects. The tip of their trunk is comprised of two opposable extensions, or fingers, which allow for extreme dexterity.\nBoth male and female elephants possess tusks, which are modified incisor teeth. Although tusks are present at birth, the \u201cbaby tusks\u201d fall out after a year, and permanent ones replace them. These tusks will continue to grow throughout the elephant\u2019s life. Similar to the trunk, elephant tusks are utilized in a wide range of activities. They are used for digging, foraging, and fighting. At times, they also act as a resting place for the elephant\u2019s very heavy trunk.\nAn African elephant\u2019s large ears also serve many purposes. The ears\u2019 large surface area helps radiate excess heat under the harsh African sun. The ears are also often used to communicate visually. Flapping their ears can signify either aggression or joy. And finally, elephants\u2019 ears, used in conjunction with the soles of their feet and their trunk, aid in the ability to hear sounds over long distances. On average, an elephant can hear another elephant\u2019s call at 4 km (2.5 mi.) away. Under ideal conditions, their range of hearing can be increased to 10 km (6.2 mi.).\nAlthough elephants can make a very wide range of sounds (10 octaves), they mostly communicate through low frequency sounds called \u201crumbling.\u201d In fact, elephants are capable of producing and perceiving sounds one to two octaves lower than the human hearing limit. As lower frequency sounds travel farther than their higher counterparts, their range of communication is extensive. Furthermore, elephants have the ability to judge the distance from another elephant based on the pitch of his/her call. As the sound travels over distances, the higher tones will fade out, leaving a lower pitch.\nAside from their ability to learn through watching and mimicking, African elephants also possess other very human qualities. Their great capacity for compassion is demonstrated as they care for the wounded and grieve the deceased. Their developed sense of memory allows them not only to remember lost loved ones, but also to harbor grudges, and recognize long-lost friends. Upon the return of a friend, elephants take part in a joyous greeting ceremony where they spin in circles, flap their ears, and trumpet.\nHaving adapted to life across Africa\u2019s diverse ecosystems, the African elephant plays a vital role in maintaining ecological harmony. African elephants ingest plants and fruits, walk for miles, and excrete the seeds in fertile dung piles. In this way, new plants can grow in different areas and can cross fertilize. In fact, 90 different tree species rely on the elephant for propagation. African elephants also dig holes to expose underground springs. This allows smaller animals to access water in drier times.\nFamily Life\nElephants rely on a social network for survival. The sustaining social unit is a herd of mothers and their young, sisters, and female cousins, led by an older matriarch.\nMale elephants will leave the herd at around 14 years old when they hit puberty. They then join a loose-knit band of other bull elephants, leaving the bachelor herd at will to search for potential mates. Upon successful mating, the male elephant will move on to other herds, and the female will start a 22-month gestation period.\nWhen the calf is born, aunts, sisters, and cousins all help care for the newborn. In this way, all the elephants of the herd learn essential lessons in rearing a baby. And since elephants only give birth once every 5 years, successfully raising their offspring is critical to their survival.\nConservation Status\nAs African elephants act as a keystone species, it is vital to take steps in their conservation. Poaching and urban sprawl pose a massive threat to their survival. As such, the African elephant is classified as a vulnerable species under IUCN\u2019s Red List.\nWhat You Can Do to Help\nThere are several ways to help support African elephants. One way is to participate in eco-tourism. Boosting Africa\u2019s economy through eco-tourism helps placate local residents who view elephants as pests.\nThe illegal ivory trade has skyrocketed in recent years. Decreasing the demand for ivory is essential. Never buy, sell, or wear ivory. Write to your politicians to speak out against poaching. (Americans can write a letter to the Secretary of State on the Wildlife Conservation Society website.) For information on organizations that combat the illegal ivory trade, see National Geographic\u2019s page, Blood Ivory: How to Help.\nIn addition, you can help provide captive elephants with the best possibly life. Boycott circuses, whose unethical treatment includes chaining elephants up by their feet and trunks, as well as beating them frequently. Encourage zoos to create environments similar to African elephants\u2019 native habitat. They should be able to encompass elephant families and their travel patterns, and they should be located in a warm climate so that the elephants can spend all year outside.\nAfrican Elephant Distribution\nElephant Resources\nBlog Posts about the African Elephant"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephant | Species | WWF - World Wildlife Fund", "url": "https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/elephant", "text": "Elephants are the largest land mammals on earth and have distinctly massive bodies, large ears, and long trunks. They use their trunks to pick up objects, trumpet warnings, greet other elephants, or suck up water for drinking or bathing, among other uses. Both male and female African elephants grow tusks and each individual can either be left- or right-tusked, and the one they use more is usually smaller because of wear and tear. Elephant tusks serve many purposes. These extended teeth can be used to protect the elephant's trunk, lift and move objects, gather food, and strip bark from trees. They can also be used for defense. During times of drought, elephants even use their tusks to dig holes to find water underground.\nTwo genetically different African species exist: the savanna elephant and the forest elephant, with a number of characteristics that differentiate them both. The African savanna elephant is the largest elephant species, while the Asian forest elephant and the African forest elephant are of a comparable, smaller size.\nAsian elephants differ in several ways from their African relatives, with more than 10 distinct physical differences between them. For example, Asian elephants' ears are smaller compared to the large fan-shaped ears of the African species. Only some male Asian elephants have tusks, while both male and female African elephants grow tusks.\nLed by a matriarch, elephants are organized into complex social structures of females and calves, while male elephants tend to live in isolation or in small bachelor groups. A single calf is born to a female once every four to five years and after a gestation period of 22 months\u2014the longest of any mammal. Calves are cared for by the entire herd of related females. Female calves may stay with their maternal herd for the rest of their lives, while males leave the herd as they reach puberty. Forest elephants' social groups differ slightly and may be comprised of only an adult female and her offspring. However, they may congregate in larger groups in forest clearings where resources are more abundant.\nElephants need extensive land areas to survive and meet their ecological needs, which includes food, water, and space. On average, an elephant can feed up to 18 hours and consume hundreds of pounds of plant matter in a single day. As a result, as they lose habitat, they often come into conflict with people in competition for resources."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephants: 15 Facts You Won\u2019t Believe!", "url": "https://kidadl.com/animal-facts/elephants-facts", "text": "Elephants Interesting Facts\nWhat type of animal are elephants?\nElephants are a type of land animal. Elephants are known to be the largest existing land animals and are divided into three separate species: African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (Loxodonta africana cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). The African and Asian Elephants are quite different from one another. The Asian Elephant (Elephas maximus) has smaller ears than African elephants, and is smaller in size. Other than that, only the male Asian elephants have tusks. On the contrary, both the male and female African elephants have tusks. African elephants (Loxodonta africana) and Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) are large mammals who feed on plants and have a snout that is modified into trunks, and the teeth modified into tusks.\nWhat class of animal do elephants belong to?\nAsian elephants and African elephants both belong to the class of mammals. All of the elephants are mammals that belong to the Elephantidae family and are huge in size. Elephants are known as the world's largest land mammals. The African elephant and Asian elephant are distinguished by their different features which include lengthy trunk, legs, and a huge head with temporal glands, and wide, flat ears.\nHow many elephants are there in the world?\nThere are around 440,000 elephants left in the world and the number of Asian elephants and African elephants have subject to a rapid decline over the past several decades. The species come under the category of Endangered species in the world, and there are several reasons that are responsible for the decline in the number of elephants in the world.\nWhere do elephants live?\nAsian elephants and African elephants (Loxodonta africana) usually prefer to live in savannas, grasslands, and forests. Most of the time they also try to occupy a huge range of habitats which includes tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia, deserts, and swamps.\nWhat is an elephants' habitat?\nAsian elephants and African elephants usually prefer to live in diverse habitats that include wetlands, forests, grassland, savanna, and other deserts across 37 countries in southern, eastern, western, and central Africa and Asia. Elephants get their food from the habitat where they live. Elephants are herbivores and find grasses, bushes, and trees in their habitat to feed on.\nWho do elephants live with?\nAdult Asian elephants and African elephants are solitary creatures, but wild elephants may try to associate with other bulls in small and unstable groups. Male Asian elephants and male African elephants usually leave the family unit between the age of 12 to 15 years. The female elephants usually live in herds with their daughters, sisters, and their offspring, whereas the male elephants often stay independent.\nHow long do elephants live?\nThe lifespan of wild elephants differs from one species to another. The African elephants can live for about a period of 60 to 70 years and Asian elephants can live for a period of up to 48 years. The elephants in the wild and elephants who live in captivity (zoos or safari parks) have different lifespans depending on different factors such as a change in environment, surroundings, weather, and many other things that could either increase or decrease their lifespan. Also, both the Asian elephants and African elephants come under the category of Endangered species, hence all species of wild elephants should be protected.\nHow do they reproduce?\nThe male tries to chase the female if she retreats and tries to chase off any other males. Elephants use their trunks in order to stroke each other before the male mounts the female from behind. They stand vertically as they mate. The females have the ability to mate with more than one bull in each of their estrus cycles, and that can last up to 18 weeks. The male elephants will try to fight over a potential mate in order to start their mating. The caretakers work to get the female elephants pregnant during their fertilization period. After the female elephant gets pregnant, the gestation period of the elephant officially begins. The gestation period of the elephants is around 22 months.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nThe conservation status of Asian elephant and African elephant species is Critically Endangered as elephant populations are declining day-by-day. This rapid decline is due to poaching. People hunt these creatures for their tusks in order to get ivory. Loss of habitat is also a huge reason for the decrease in these animals, as areas get more urbanised and climate change effects their habitats, these creatures are losing their home. Human beings are responsible for the Endangered status of elephants as many hunters hunt elephants for their tusks. There are efforts being made for the conservation of this species as the focus is on maintaining habitat, and creating corridors to connect the areas. Conservation experts are also trying to improve the laws and protections regarding the trade of tusks for ivory. There are different laws that are in place for the protection of this Endangered species as the elephant populations are declining due to various factors.\nElephants Fun Facts\nWhat do elephants look like?\nElephants are the largest land animals on Earth, and they are one of the most unique-looking animals too. Their characteristics are described as having long noses (which are called trunks), large and floppy ears, and wide and thick legs. There is no other animal that is similar to the elephant\u2019s physique. Forest elephants have columnar legs and huge heads with temporal glands and wide and flat ears. Elephants range in color from grayish to brown, and their body hair is sparse and coarse. Elephants are one of the very few species that recognize themselves in the mirror very easily. Elephant tusks are present only in Asian male elephants but in both male and female African elephants.\nHow cute are they?\nElephants are known to be super cute for the way they look. With the help of their little trunks, tusks, and ears, they tend to obsess people and win the hearts of many people. The way they lift their trunk is so adorable.\nHow do they communicate?\nElephants can communicate by using very low-frequency sounds and pitches that are below the range of human hearing. The low-frequency sounds are known as infrasounds and can travel several kilometers, and also provide the elephant with a private communication channel which is known to play an important role in the elephants\u2019 complex social life.\nHow big are elephants?\nSri Lankan elephants are quite large and big in size and are known to be the largest land animals. They are the largest existing land animals. The largest of all the elephant species is the African elephant which weighs up to 6,000-13,200 lb (2721-5987 kg).\nHow fast can Elephants move?\nElephants can run at speeds of about 25 mph (40 kmph). They cannot move fast as they are heavy in weight. Elephants are so big that it is hard to outrun an elephant by zigzagging. They usually roam around at a leisurely pace due to absence of any serious predators and need to look for food, water, and other essentials.\nHow much do elephants weigh?\nThe weight of the elephants differs from one species to another. African bush elephants weigh around 13,200 lb (5987 kg), Asian elephants weigh around 8,800 lb (3991 kg), and African forest elephants weigh around 6,000 lb (2721 kg).\nWhat are the male and female names of the species?\nThe male elephant is known as a bull elephant, whereas the female elephant is known as a cow.\nWhat would you call baby elephants?\nA baby elephant is called a calf. The baby elephants reach maturity in their second year of life. The African elephant stays with the mother until it becomes entirely dependent at the age of three to five years.\nWhat do they eat?\nElephants are herbivores. They eat grasses, small plants, bushes, fruits, twigs, tree bark and roots and move in herds in search of food and water. They are known to be vegetarians. The adult elephants need up to 300 lb (136 kg) of food in a single day. Water for elephants is essential, not only for drinking but for bathing as well. They use their trunk to lift food to their mouth where their incisor teeth shred it into pieces.\nAre they dangerous?\nNo, elephants are very peaceful and loveable animals, but at the same time can harm humans if they are mistreated. They are the most intelligent mammals that display a different range of emotions. If any attack takes place, then there are chances that an elephant is quite capable of killing another elephant and there are chances that humans can get killed by their trampling.\nWould they make a good pet?\nElephants are highly intelligent animals that have an excellent memory and are sometimes, unfortunately, trained to become performers and working animals. Elephants are not domesticated like dogs and cats, and it is not possible for one individual wild animal to be domesticated for a lifetime. You cannot pet elephants as they are huge in size and need an open area to roam around and be with their offspring. They are highly sensitive and caring animals, just like humans. Moreover, as elephant population is declining across South Africa and Asia, efforts for their conservation are eagerly required.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nDid you know...\nElephants are pregnant for nearly two years which is much longer than any other animal. The African elephants are smaller when they are born than the Asian elephants, but are much bigger when they grow up as adults. Their trunk is very powerful, making it easy for them to sense the size, shape, and temperature of an object very easily and quickly.\nFive interesting facts about elephants include, that elephants can smell water from 12 miles away. Elephants also spend most of their time foraging every day and spend only two to three hours actually sleeping. Elephants are the only mammals, other than human beings, who have chins. Elephants have more than 100,000 muscles out of which 40,000 are in their trunk. In fact, the elephant's trunk is the fusion of their upper lip and the nose. Elephants are afraid of bees, and mice as well as they have the fear that they might end up biting them. These animals also aren't huge fans of fire, and can become quite scared of it.\nWhat is so special about an elephant?\nThey are highly intelligent animals who have complex emotions, feelings, compassion, and self-awareness. Elephants are one of the few species that can recognize themselves in a mirror. Moreover, they use their tusks for a variety of tasks including digging.\nWhat animals rely on elephants?\nMany animals indirectly reply on elephants for their survival, this includes birds, baboons, and antelope. There are also different birds and animals that rely on elephants such as oxpeckers who sit on the elephants while they eat lice and ticks. Cattle egrets, olive baboons, and antelope also rely on these creatures. Elephants help to maintain the forest and the savanna ecosystem for the other species and are integrally tied to rich biodiversity. Elephants are the most important ecosystem engineers.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly animal facts for everyone to discover!

African elephants weigh up to 7 tonnes \u2013 that\u2019s the same as about three cars! Let\u2019s discover some more interesting elephant facts\u2026\nAwesome Facts About Elephants\nWhat\u2019s the difference between African and Asian elephants?\nIt used to be thought that there were only two types of elephant, the African elephant and the Asian elephant. Recently the African elephant has been split into two different species, the African bush elephant and the African forest elephant.\nThis means that there are now three recognized elephant species.\nAfrican bush elephants are bigger than Asian elephants, and both males and females have tusks.\nAsian elephants are a little bit smaller and only the males have tusks.\nIf you touch the skin of an Asian elephant, it is quite smooth and their ears can\u2019t wrap around their face and cover their eyes.\nForest elephants are the smallest species of elephant. However, they can still reach 2.5 m (8.2 ft) in height and up to 6 tonnes (13,230 lb) in weight (although most are around 2.7 tonnes / 5,950 lb).\nHow much do elephants weigh?\nElephants are the biggest land animal on the planet (the blue whale is the biggest animal, but it lives in the sea). Picture how big a Labrador dog is. Now imagine that dog about 50 times bigger \u2013 that\u2019s the size of an elephant!\nAfrican bush elephants weigh up to 7,000 kilograms and Asian elephants weigh up to 6,000 kilograms.\nElephants have big, heavy bodies. Their trunks are also really heavy, too. A big, male elephant can have a trunk that weighs 140 kilograms. Can you imagine if your nose weighed that much? You would get quite a headache!\nHow long do elephants live?\nElephants live longer than most animals. Because they are so big they don\u2019t have many predators (animals that hunt them). In the wild, elephants can live to be over 70 years old. But you can\u2019t really tell how old an elephant is because they are born with so many wrinkles!\nCan elephants swim?\nLike most mammals , elephants are able to swim. It\u2019s hard to picture a huge elephant taking a dip in the local pool (it would have to be a very big pool!) but elephants can swim really well. They use their long trunks like a snorkel so that they can breathe underwater.\nElephants really like swimming. They love playing and splashing in the water to cool down in the hot sun. Elephants even have water fights sometimes. They get lots of water in their trunks, and then shoot it out at their friends. You wouldn\u2019t want to be up against an elephant in a water fight, would you!\nThe amazing film below shows elephants crossing a river. A calf gets into difficulties and two adult elephants rush to its aid.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV09iOnf4D0\nWhere do elephants live?\nAfrican elephants live in Eastern, Southern and West Africa. There are two types of African elephant, and they live in different habitats. African bush elephants live in the savannahs \u2013 large, desert plains in the Sahara Desert. African forest elephants live in the forest with lots of dense trees.\nAsian elephants live in a variety of grassland and forest habitats. They live in India, Sri Lanka and China. Asian elephants are also found in Southeast Asian countries like Thailand and Indonesia. Here the elephants normally live in rainforests where there are lots of trees and lakes for water to drink and go swimming in.\nWhat do elephants eat?\nElephants are herbivores which means that they don\u2019t eat meat. They love eating leaves, twigs, bamboo and roots. All of their food can be found in their natural habitats. Since elephants have such long trunks, they can use these to reach up to the very highest branches to get the tastiest leaves!\nThese big animals need to eat a lot through the day to make sure they get enough nutrients. They can spend up to 16 hours a day gathering food. That\u2019s a very long time to prepare dinner! Adult elephants eat around 100 kilograms of food a day \u2013 it\u2019s a good thing they have plenty of trees to get all those leaves from.\nAre elephants endangered?\nTwo types of elephant are critically endangered. These are the Sumatran elephant and the Bornean pygmy elephant.\nThis means that there is a very real chance that these creatures could soon be extinct.\nThe other Asian elephants are endangered.\nAfrican elephants are classed as \u2018vulnerable\u2018. This means that they are still aren\u2019t safe.\nThere used to be millions of elephants living across African and Asia. Now, there are far fewer elephants in the wild.\nIn Africa, there are about 500,000 elephants in the wild, and about 35,000 in Asia.\nElephants are endangered because they are losing their natural habitat. This is mainly because humans chopping down trees from the forests to create farming land where the elephants used to live.\nElephant Ivory\nAn elephant\u2019s tusks are made from a very valuable material called ivory. Ivory can be used to make a variety of objects, including knife handles and musical instruments. Things made out of ivory are very expensive, and it is very tempting for people living in poor countries to kill elephants for their tusks.\nIn the 1980\u2019s (not very long ago), nearly half of the African elephants in the world were killed for their tusks.\nIt is now illegal (people are not allowed to do it) to hunt elephants for ivory and even to buy or sell things made from ivory. Sadly, some people still do.\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019d much rather see a living elephant than a bit of jewellery!\nThere are many people fighting to save elephants. Organisations such as The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust work hard to protect elephants from poachers (people who hunt elephants for their tusks).\nPerhaps if you learn enough about wildlife you could get a job protecting elephants!\nTop 10 Elephants Facts\nElephants are so big and heavy that they can\u2019t jump. The skin of an elephant is an inch thick. Elephants can\u2019t see very well, but they do have a very good sense of smell (well, they would do with those noses!) It takes 22 months for a baby elephant to be ready to be born (it only takes 9 months for a human baby). Elephants use their tusks for lifting things and digging for water. Elephants are very playful and like swimming. Elephants live in family groups called herds, and there are about 12-15 elephants in a herd. Male elephants are called bulls, female elephants are called cows and young elephants are called calves \u2013 just like cows! The ears of elephants are large and thin and they can hear even the quietest sound. Elephants have feelings and emotions like humans \u2013 they hug each other, play, and feel sad when another elephant dies.\nDiscover More with Active Wild\nYou can find out more about endangered animals on this page: Endangered Animals List with Pictures & Facts"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Top 18 Facts About Elephants - Fun and Learn Today(Easy)", "url": "https://earthlyknowhow.com/facts-about-elephants/", "text": "If you are searching for Facts about Elephants then before that let me tell you Elephants are the largest animal living in the land. Mostly famous for its long trunk, heavy columnar legs, Very huge head with flat and wide ears and temporal glands. elephants belong to the \u201cElephantidae\u201d family. The most common color of elephants are greyish to brown and have coarse and sparse body hairs. Different kinds of their species can be found in different places. most often places to find them are savannas, dense forests or grasslands but their habitat extends to several wide ranges in the subtropical and tropical regions of Africa and Asia, including deserts, marshes and highlands. Lets see some amazing facts about elephants. Read On.\nTop 16 + 2 Facts about Elephants\nThere are three different types of species African bush, Asian elephant and African forest. African elephants are slightly bigger than Asian one. They also have hairs on their body and also have eyelashes. African elephants are called as the largest living land animal. They use their trunk for multi purposes. It could serve as a hand, a nose, a signaling and an extra foot. Tusks are found only in the male Asian elephants. As the elephant grows the tusk can weigh about 90 kg. They don\u2019t drink liquids with their trunks but use it as a tool to drink. Due to their heavy weight they become the only mammal that can not jump. Elephants have the longest gestation interval of about 22 years. The tooth of an elephant can weigh about 3 kg. Their eating time is sixteen hours per day. Their trunk can carry upto 350 kg. The length of their intestines could be 19 meters. They can store about 14 litres of water into their trunk. Baby elephants (calves) can stand on their feets within the 20 minutes of birth. Temporal lobe of an elephant is bigger and dence, so it is said that \u201celephants never forget\u201d.\n1. Currently three species are acknowledged\nAt the present time only three species have been recognised: the Asian Elephant, the African Forest Elephant and the African Bush Elephant . The African bush elephants are also popular with the other name \u201cAfrican savanna\u201d and scientific name as \u201cLoxodonta Africana\u201d. These are the largest surviving terrestrial creatures in the world. Their height is about 4 meters and weighs about 10.5 tons. Their habitats are spreaded across 37 african countries and settled in agricultural lands, wetlands or woodlands forests and grasslands. Since 2004, they have been listed in a very Vulnerable condition in IUCN\u2019s Red List.This is due to their habitat loss and poaching for ivory and meat.\nAsian elephants are also called as Asiatic elephants having the scientific name Elephas maximus. they are the only living genus of elephas and spreaded all over Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia primarily from India (west), Nepal (North), Breneo (east) to Sumatra (south). They are also categorized as endangered species in IUCN Red List.\nAfrican Forest Elephants are listed in two living species of African elephants. The moist forests of West Africa and the Congo Basin are their native habitats. They are the shortest of the three living species of elephants having the height about 2.4 metres to the soldier from the ground. Their diet is mainly based on fruits, seeds, leaves and bark of trees, hence it is also called \u201cmega-gardener of the forest\u201d\n2. Elephants are social animals\nElephants are very social creatures. They live in groups as well as travel like a family. These groups are guided by the matrich female, she is a very experienced member and slightly older in the group. however, And if there is no breeding then they move around alone. Male elephants are ejected from groups after gaining the sexual maturityAnd if there is no breeding then they move around alone.\nFemale elephants are recognized for their caring and loving behavior towards their young calves and fellow females. Just like as humans, they always think and do to carry a lifelong connection with their family and friends. This move exhibits their excellent memory, which permits them to remember feeding locations and nice water areas. There is much evidence also present that suggests elephants deplore the demising of conspecifics. They have an ability to recognize the skull of other members of elephants long after they died, even if the tusks are removed.\n3. Elephants eat for about 16 hours a day\nElephants are very giant animals known as eating machines and they need to eat a lot of food to keep their body moving. So most of their time goes into food and they are busy eating for about 16 hours a day. they are non ruminant vegetarians. They don\u2019t chew cuds, balch or ruminant as other ruminant animals like cow, goat, zebra etc. A wild elephant may consume as much as 270 kgs or 600 pounds in a single day, however the more typical amount is 110 \u2013 140 kgs (250 \u2013 300 pounds). A typical adult elephant living in a zoo, can feed 4-5 bales of grass and 4 to 8 kgs of grains in a day. If we look at the annual accounts for a single elephant, then it becomes more than about 29,000 kg of grass and more than 2,700 kg of grains.\n4. Elephant have insufficient digestive system\nThe digestive system of the elephants is less than 50% efficient. Due to a very inefficient digestive system a massive part of the eaten food is converted into manure, which means \u201cLots of Manure\u201d. An elephant defecates about 12 to 15 times a day and flushes out about 100 to 150 kg of dung. Their digestive system is not very special in structure, it is similar to other ordinary mammals.\nThe usual daily water consumption of elephants is 25 to 50 gallon (100 to 200 litres) each animal.\n5. Elephant\u2019s ear functions as cooler\nUsually the size of the ears of an elephant related to the quantity of heat vanished through them. Due to different geographic conditions the air sizes of Asian and African elephants is different. As compared to the Asian elephants, the African elephants live in a summery, brighter and sunnier weather and which needs longer and larger ears to relieve in thermo-regulation. However the ears of both families help them to regulate their body temperature. But Asian elephants have smaller ears than African.\nFluttering their ears supports them to cool in two ways. In addition to acting as a fan and transporting air to the rest of the elephant\u2019s organs, flapping also cools the blood when it circulates across the veins of the ears. When the cooler blood flows through the entire body of the elephant and its temperature for several degrees.\n6. Asian elephants are smaller\nAfrican elephants are bigger than the Asian elephants and have proportionally bigger ears. The skin of Asian elephants is usually brown or dark gray and have pink-yellow marks on their face, trunk, and ears. The asian elephants are the largest terrestrial animal of the asian continent while the african are largest in the world. smaller or bigger size depends upon the geographic situations. In the opposite of African elephants that have two fingers on each lip of the trunk, Asian elephants have a single \u2018finger\u2019 on their trunk\u2019s upper lips.\n7. African elephants have largest brain\nIn all of the animal kingdom African elephants have the biggest brains which can weigh about 5 kgs. This is an amazing fact about the elephants. It will be surprising when you think about the total weight of an elephant. An Asian elephant weighs about 5,400 kg while African Elephant weighs about 6,000 kg. Well it is much less than its weight but still it is the most. A human brain is very large as a proportion of its total body. The elephant brain is about more than three times of an average human brain. an elephant brain holds upto 257 billion neurons which is also three times than human\u2019s number of average neurons which are about 86 billion. Despite this, an elephant\u2019s cerebral cortex of the brain weighs about 2.8 kg which is more than two times that of a human\u2019s total brain and consists of only 5.6 billion neurons. These values of neurons in the cerebral cortex accounts for one third of the total number of human cerebral cortex which consists of 16.3 billion neurons.\n8. Their average lifespan is 50 \u2013 70 Yrs\nThe average age of African elephant species is 50 to 70 years while it is seen slightly less in Asian elephants, which is 45 to 55 years on average. Experts researching on the life of elephants believe that wild elephants are up to twice the age of elephants in zoos. This research was done by the Canadian and British scientists in six years and according to them elephants living in Africa and Asia\u2019s protected area lived twice as long as elephants in European zoos.\nIt is also true that guessing the lifespan of wild elephants can be slightly wrong, as it does not depend on correct figures. The correct figures can be found only in zoos, but there is a great difference between animals living in closed places and open animals. All these figures are different and unreliable. According to data from protected areas an average lifespan of elephants is 45 to 65 Yrs and may reach to 75 Yrs. 86 Yrs is the age of the world\u2019s oldest known elephants.\n9. An elephant\u2019s trunk is a multitasking tool.\nThe trunk of an elephant is an impressive multi-functioning tool. Besides being a large nose for smelling, trumpting and breathing, they also used it as a hand to grasp things. Trunks are very sensitive to picking a blade of grass and very strong to tear the branches of a tree, even they can rip very thick branches with it. Elephants also used their trunk as a huge straw, they may suck upto 14 litres of fluid at a time into their trunk and then they blow this sucked water into their mouth to drink. Also, when they are bathing they use their trunk for spraying the water and mud on themselves. You know that there are 40,000 muscles present in the trunk of an elephant. This is hilarious. here are some surprising facts about elephant\u2019s trunk\nTrunk of an elephant is the The most versatile accessory ever on the planet.\nIt consists of about 40,000 muscles.\nThis allows elephants to smell the water many miles away.\nElephant trunks have the capacity to lift upto 350 kg or 770 pounds.\nThere are fingers present in the elephant trunks. One in Asian elephants while two in African elephants.\nAt the time of birth the elephant trunks are stunted, but it quickly elongates over the duration of some days.\n10. Smelling senses of elephant is very strong\nElephants have an excellent sense of smell, they can detect the water sources about 19.2 km. Nostrils are situated at the prong of the trunk and function for smelling, breathing and strawing the water into the mouth. An elephant can account a sense of smell about four times the sensitivity of a Bloodhound dog. One of the main uses of their high smelling sensitivity to avoid danger. They can differentiate between similar smelling goods or foods. Even they can smell the TNT (trinitrotoluene) to avoid mines. In the situation of droughts, it also allows them to detect underground water.\nThese senses of elephants are in constant use with moving the trunk to and fro and detecting new smells and information. If the information is not enough provided by the smelling, they may gather the substance with their trunk. Then the chemical data is passed on Jacobson\u2019s organ, a chemical identifying cell present in the soft tissues of the roof of the mouth or upper palate. This organ is connected with nasal cavities and initially acts to recognise the reproductive status of females.\n11. The skin of elephants is very sensitive\nElephants are very sensitive with their skin and utilize the mud as the sunscreen. To preserve themselves from sunburn, moisture loss and insect biting, they have to take regular baths of mud. Dark grey is their natural skin color but sometimes it may emerge in the brownien color like dirt. The anatomy of elephants makes their skin very sensitive against touch. Even they can sense the touch of the smallest insects and climate change. The skin could be an inch thick around the back and 1/10 part of an inch thin at around the mouth.\n12. Elephant have cracks and wrinkles on their skin\nThese wrinkles or cracks are not only for show, they play an important role in keeping the elephants cool. Since African or Asian elephants have to bear the high temperature of savanna and forests, these furrows help them to chill by emitting the heat. Distinct from most mammals, elephants do not sweat. They regulate their body temperature by the evaporative cooling process which requires the epidermis to be wet. The water is then stored in these cracks when the elephant bathes which helps them to stay cool.\nIn some research it is found that elephants can carry five to ten times more water in their rough skin than the smooth surface. Even though both African and Asian elephants look almost alike, their skin has differences. There are more wrinkles present in the bodies of African elephants than the Asian elephants. Due to lack of some pigmentation the Asian elephant has some pink or brown spots.\n13. Elephant\u2019s feet are protected with a soft pedding\nTheir feet are covered with soft padding which provides them in balancing their weight. Not only this but it prevents them from slipping and dulling their footstep\u2019s sound. As a result of this the walking of elephants is almost silent, despite being so heavy! Each elephant has 5 toes on each foot like humans all fingers (including thumb / toe) but not everyone has nails. Both species African and asian have 5 nails on front feet and 4 toenails on the back feets. Due to the large stuff of gristle downside of each heel, the elephant feet are flat. This pad acts as a shock digester and supports them to walk very silently. The elephant legs are very straighter than the other animals. They spend most of the time of their lives walking long distances in search of food and water and their feet are adapted to such a lifestyle.\n14. Elephant use their feets for smelling\nOther than this they use their feet to feel the subsonic rumbling created by the other elephants throughout the vibrations or quiver in the land. It has been observed that to listen to these waves of vibrations they put their trunks on the ground and cautiously positioning their feet.\n15. They have longest Gestation period among all mammals\nThe pregnancy time of a female elephant is about 22 months which is very close to the 2 years. Which makes it the longest incubation of all mammals. According to the scientist\u2019s hypothesis, the reason for a long gestation period is important for the full development of the brain of an elephant. So they can take birth with complex cognitive skills and they are able to understand and sense how to survive in the new environment or how to interact with a group or group member. During the course of every pregnancy, each gland related to this slowly decreases production of its progesterone. It is a fantastic fact about elephants that the weight of their babies at the time of birth is about 120 kg.\n16. Elephant hate Ants and bees\nDespite being a largest land mammal they are afraid of one of the tiniest. however they easily kill or throttle them, but elephants want to avoid ants because they get inside their trunk and can pose a great danger to them. Their trunk is a very sensitive and important part for elephants, ants can damage these nerves. For the same reason they are afraid of the bees. If the ants are well organized they can cause great pain or even sometimes death of an elephant.\nMore Interesting Facts about Elephants\n17. Sometimes they could be very dangerous\nGenerally elephants are very quiet animals. But if they are angry, they become very aggressive even, they can kill the person in front. Elephants are popular for living in female-leded (matriarchal) social groups. Although they are respected by the people, they are still afraid of them because elephants can be dangerous and hostile at any time. However, the females may be more aggressive when they are with their calves and the males can be unusually truculent during musth. In the situation of illness, injury and irritation all elephants could be more aggressive.\n18 . We can understand much by looking on their tusks\nElephant tusks are literally their teeth\u2019s. Elephant teeth are actually enlarged teeth that first appear at their age of 2 yrs. The growth of these tusks increase lifetime. They use their tusks for feeding themselves, tearing bark off trees, dogging the roots or soil and as a defense instrument when they are engaged in a fight. You should know that this beautiful ivory becomes a threat to elephants. These teeth and products made from them are desirable items. Their price is very high, so hunters hunt elephants.\nThe average length of elephant tusks is about 2 meters ( or 6 feet) While weigh about 23kg (or 50 pounds). Tusks of Asian elephants are slightly smaller in size. They use their tusks as hands just like humans.\nWorlds longest tusks is about 3.5 meters which is a length of a small car while ever recorded heaviest tusk is almost 120 kg.\nWrap Up\nI hope you you get the answer about \u201cFacts about Elephants\u201d and If you want to find other posts check below."}

In fact, it\u2019s one of the Big Five, the creatures that big game hunters saw as the most difficult to hunt on foot. Now, its safari-goers who seek out this quintet of animals, which also includes the rhinoceros, lion, leopard and cape buffalo.\nAnd that\u2019s not even close to the most incredible of the elephant facts out there. Here are 11 wow-worthy truths to get you excited for your trek into the bush.\n1. They\u2019re the Largest Land Mammal\nIf you cross paths with an African elephant on your safari, you\u2019ll see the world\u2019s largest land mammal. They\u2019re notably bigger than even Asian elephants.\nAn African elephant can weigh up to 14,000 pounds and measure in at anywhere from 8 to 13 feet in height. Asian elephants, on the other hand, stand at up to 9.2 feet tall and only weigh 11,000 pounds at their largest.\n2. Their Closest Living Relative Isn\u2019t What You\u2019d Expect\nSomehow, the largest land mammal\u2019s closest living relative is extra-small. It\u2019s called the rock hyrax, a small mammal of which you\u2019ve probably never heard.\nThe tiny, brown creature dwells in the rocky stretches of Subsaharan African and Arabian landscapes. Its toes, skull, and teeth are very similar to the elephant\u2019s, making them genetic cousins.\n3. You Can Differentiate Them By Their Ears\nLet\u2019s say you have a small African elephant standing next to a standard Asian elephant. How can you tell them apart?\nIt turns out that their ear shapes give them away. Handily, the African elephant\u2019s ears have the same form as the African continent. Meanwhile, Asian elephants have ears that look a lot like India\u2019s outline.\n4. They Carry Babies For a Very Long Time\nA top draw of your Tanzanian safari will be catching a glimpse of an elephant \u2014 and perhaps a baby, too. If you see a calf, you should consider yourself extra lucky. Elephant moms carry their babies for a whopping 22 months before delivery, the longest gestation period of any animal.\nDelivering an elephant calf is no small feat, either. At birth, their babies stand at three feet tall and weigh in at 250 pounds.\n5. They\u2019re Not Bug Lovers\nYou might think that an animal as large as the African elephant wouldn\u2019t care about bugs. Indeed, they don\u2019t mind traipsing over insects that reside on the floor of the savannah.\nBut elephants do have a problem with bugs when they end up on their food. As herbivores, the world\u2019s largest mammal dines only on leaves, twigs, fruit, grass, and bark, among other meat-free eats.\nIf they find ants on their herbivorous fare, though, they won\u2019t eat it. That\u2019s because their trunks contain a slew of very sensitive nerve endings. If they get ants in there, it hurts \u2014 so they avoid ant-covered meals.\n6. They Eat All Day Long \u2014 Quite Literally\nElephants don\u2019t get to be so large by accident. As it turns out, they spend anywhere from 12 to 18 hours each day eating.\nAnd, as they munch, their trunks do a lot of the work. They sniff out food with it, and they use their trunks to grab what they want to eat. Imagine using your nose to pick up your dinner \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t be pretty!\n7. Peanuts? An Elephant Wouldn\u2019t Dare\nThe best books about Africa provide you with information about the animals, environment, and culture you can expect on your journey. But popular culture has painted a more pervasive picture of elephants that is simply untrue. Specifically, there\u2019s a misconception about these giant mammals and their love of peanuts.\nAs it turns out, elephants don\u2019t eat peanuts at all. They can\u2019t find them in the wild in Africa. And zoos don\u2019t feed the legumes to their animals, either.\n8. Elephants Believe in Girl Power\nPerhaps your safari leads you past a herd of elephants. As you watch them make their way across the savannah, keep in mind that what you\u2019re probably seeing is a group of females banded together.\nA matriarch leads her elephant families, and she tends to be the oldest in the herd. She leads the pack, choosing when they move and where they go throughout the day.\nWith her, you\u2019ll see her daughters and theirs, too. Boy elephants stick around until they hit puberty, which happens when they\u2019re between 12 and 15. At that time, they strike out on their own \u2014 or join up with a small male, although they\u2019re much more loose-knit than the female herds.\nIf you know anything about other safari animals, you know elephants aren\u2019t alone in this. Lions also operate in female-led groups, where the males have fewer responsibilities.\n9. Elephants Use Sunscreen\nWhen you go on safari, you have to wear protective clothes to keep you safe and comfortable. Elephants are no different \u2014 they have to safeguard themselves from the African sun, too.\nTheir methods for sunscreen will be a bit different than yours, though. Elephants slather themselves in mud and sand to keep the sun\u2019s rays off of their skin. Pretty clever, right?\n10. Elephants Know Who They Are\nYou\u2019ve probably seen hilarious YouTube videos of puppies, for example, who see their reflection for the first time. They often bark and chase themselves, not realizing that the dog they\u2019re seeing is actually them.\nElephants, however, have passed the mirror test, meaning they recognize themselves in the looking glass. The same goes for an elite group of animals, including dolphins, magpies, great apes, and human toddlers.\n11. Elephants Say Hi to Each Other\nHow do you greet your loved ones? With a hug, perhaps? Elephants do the same.\nOf course, they don\u2019t wrap their arms around one another as humans do. Instead, elephants greet each other with a trunk hug. They twist their noses around each other for an embrace that only their species can give.\nElephant Facts \u2014 They\u2019re Incredible\nAs you\u2019ve learned from these elephant facts, they are certainly one of the world\u2019s most incredible species. And, soon enough, you\u2019ll have the chance to see one on your African safari.\nNeed more information to prepare you for your once-in-a-lifetime journey?

Habitat Found in forests, grasslands, marshes, scrub, and semi-desert areas Population Global: No data Status IUCN: Vulnerable\nCITES: Appendix II\nUSFWS: Threatened\nFun Facts\nElephants live in a highly organized social structure referred to as a matriarchal herd. The herd is typically composed of up to ten females and their young. All of the females in the herd are directly related to the matriarch, who is typically the oldest and largest female. Males beyond the age of maturity are with the herd only during mating. African elephants are capable of making a wide variety of vocal sounds, such as grunts, purrs, bellows, whistles, and the obvious trumpeting. Elephants are also capable of making low frequency sounds that are below the human range of hearing; this allows wandering individuals within the herd as well as several different herds to stay in direct contact over distances of many miles. The most obvious characteristic of elephants, besides their massive size, is their trunk. The trunk is nothing more than an elongation of their nose and upper lip. Besides being used for breathing and smelling it is also used as an appendage, much like an arm or hand. Elephants are capable of pulling up to 11.5 liters (3 gallons) of water into the trunk to be sprayed into the mouth for drinking or onto the back for bathing. They also use two finger-like projections that are at the tip to manipulate small objects and to pluck grasses. Female elephants are one of the few mammals other than humans who live beyond their reproductive years. The typical cow will end her reproductive period between 45 to 50 years. During this post-reproductive time she assists with the care of other young. For more information on elephants, explore our Elephants Infobook.\nEcology and Conservation\nElephants, like humans, have a great impact upon their environment. Elephants are referred to as a keystone species, a species upon which many other organisms depend. Elephants make pathways through the environment that are used by other animals to access areas normally out of reach. The pathways have been used by several generations of elephants, and today people are converting many of them to paved roads. During the dry season elephants use their tusks to dig into dry river bottoms to reach underground sources of water. These newly dug water holes may become the only source of water in the area. Forest elephants create clearings that allow sunlight to reach the forest floor. This gives ground vegetation a chance to grow and feed the smaller forest animals.\nElephants and people have always had an interesting relationship. People have had to contend with elephants destroying their crops. However, it is the elephants who have had the greatest burden. They have been hunted and poached for their ivory tusks, been prevented from migrating between feeding and water sites, and have lost due to conversion into agricultural areas and human dwellings. While the whole elephant population throughout Africa is declining, some countries in southern Africa have the opposite problem: too many elephants. The future of the elephant in Africa is a complex issue that will need to resolve overpopulation in some areas and underpopulation in others.\nBibliography\nBenyus, Janine M. Beastly Behaviors.

Elephants are unique animals that live in parts of Africa and Asia. Scroll down for more information.\nThere are two types of elephant, the Asian elephant and the African elephant (although sometimes the African Elephant is split into two species, the African Forest Elephant and the African Bush Elephant). Elephants are the largest land-living mammal in the world. Both female and male African elephants have tusks but only the male Asian elephants have tusks. They use their tusks for digging and finding food. Female elephants are called cows. They start to have calves when they are about 12 years old and they are pregnant for 22 months. An elephant can use its tusks to dig for ground water. An adult elephant needs to drink around 210 litres of water a day. Elephants have large, thin ears. Their ears are made up of a complex network of blood vessels which help regulate their temperature. Blood is circulated through their ears to cool them down in hot climates. Elephants have no natural predators. However, lions will sometimes prey on young or weak elephants in the wild. The main risk to elephants is from humans through poaching and changes to their habitat. The elephant\u2019s trunk is able to sense the size, shape and temperature of an object. An elephant uses its trunk to lift food and suck up water then pour it into its mouth. An elephant\u2019s trunk can grow to be about 2 metres long and can weigh up to 140 kg. Some scientists believe that an elephant\u2019s trunk is made up of 100,000 muscles, but no bones. Female elephants spend their entire lives living in large groups called herds. Male elephant leave their herds at about 13 years old and live fairly solitary lives from this point. Elephants can swim \u2013 they use their trunk to breathe like a snorkel in deep water. Elephants are herbivores and can spend up to 16 hours days collecting leaves, twigs, bamboo and roots."}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "20 Amazing Elephant Facts - Our Planet", "url": "https://ourplnt.com/elephant-facts/", "text": "Elephants! Even though these largest existing land animals are loved, revered, and respected by people and cultures around the world, they are actually close to the edge of extinction. The escalation of poaching, habitat loss, human-elephant conflict, and mistreatment in captivity are just some of the threats to both African and Asian elephants. So, we urgently need to take action to protect these amazing (and cute!) animals. Here are 20 amazing elephant facts.\nElephant facts\nElephants in the Okavango Delta. The area is one of the best places to see animals and birds in Africa.\n1. Elephants are the largest existing land animals\nElephant facts: Diagram showing the average size of adult African bush elephants, with the largest recorded individual (nicknamed \u201cHenry\u201d) also included.\nElephants are the largest existing land animals, and African bush elephants are the largest elephant species. Male African bush elephants (Loxodonta africana) stand 3.2 meters (10.5 feet) tall (at the shoulder) on average and weigh around 6 metric tons.\nFemales stand about 2.6 meters (8.5 feet) on average at the shoulder with a body mass of about 3 metric tons.\nThe largest elephant ever measured: Henry\nElephant facts: Henry, the biggest elephant ever measured. Image: Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.\nSometimes called the F\u00e9nyk\u00f6vi elephant, after the Hungarian game hunter who killed this amazing animal, Henry is the world\u2019s largest elephant ever measured. Hungarian-born Josef J. F\u00e9nyk\u00f6vi shot the elephant in Angola in 1955. He donated the body in 1959 to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.\nHenry stands over 13 feet (3.96 meters) tall \u2013 larger than any elephant known to be living today. He was about 11-tons in weight.\nLater, an old-fashioned slug from a flintlock pistol found embedded in the elephant\u2019s leg provided a reason to believe the animal had been nearly 100 years old when F\u00e9nyk\u00f6vi killed it.\nElephant facts: When Henry, the largest elephant ever measured was unveiled for the first time at the United States\u2019s National Museum of Natural History in 1959, guests were marveled at its size. Image: Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Standing over 13 feet (3.96 meters) tall, \u201cHenry\u201d is the largest elephant ever measured.\n2. There are three different species of elephant\nThere are three different species of elephant: the African bush elephant (also known as the African savannah elephant, Loxodonta africana), the African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus).\nThe African forest elephant is the smallest of those three species, reaching a shoulder height of 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in). It was long considered to be a subspecies of the African elephant. But new research (morphological and DNA analysis) showed that they are actually a separate species entirely.\n3. A baby elephant is the biggest baby born on land\nAfrican bush elephant calves, when born, are around 90 cm (3 feet) in height. Captive-born calves measured between 100-120 kg (220 -260 lb) at birth. They gain about 0.5 kg (1.1 lb) weight per day.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlKCTwsQCq0 Video can\u2019t be loaded because JavaScript is disabled: Elephant Calf's First Week (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlKCTwsQCq0) Elephant facts: The first week of an elephant calf (Columbus Zoo and Aquarium)\n4. Elephant tusks never stop growing\nBig tusks can be a sign of an old elephant.\nBoth male and female African elephants grow tusks, but only male Asian elephants grow them. A tuskless adult elephant is likely to be a female Asian elephant.\nElephant tusks have a variety of uses: as a tool to dig for food or water and to strip bark from trees; as a weapon in battles with rivals; and as a courtship aid \u2013 the larger his tusks, the more attractive a male elephant may appear to a female.\n5. They eat and drink a lot\nElephants are herbivores. They spend between 12 to 18 hours eating grass, plants, and fruit every single day. An adult elephant can eat about 50 tonnes of food in a year.\nThey also drink 180-230 liters (40-50 imp gal; 50-60 U.S. gal) of water daily. That\u2019s why they prefer places near water \u2013 one of the main reasons for human-elephant conflicts.\n6. Elephants are known for their incredible memory\nElephants possibly have cognitive maps to allow them to remember large-scale spaces over long periods of time. Individuals appear to be able to keep track of the current location of their family members \u2013 a knowledge so vital for their survival.\n7. African elephants have big ears\nThe ears of African Elephants can reach up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) long. When flapped, they act as big fans, cooling the blood that runs close to the surface behind their ears.\nAsian elephants have smaller ears than African elephants.\n8. Elephants live in herds\nElephants live in herds, which are highly organized social groups of 6-20 elephants led and guided by an older female leader, called a matriarch.\nAs the leader of the herd, a matriarch will make all the decisions for the herd \u2013 including what to eat, where to sleep, and where to go.\nA new calf is usually the center of attention for herd members. Adults and most of the other young will gather around the newborn, touching and caressing it with their trunks.\n9. They walk at the pace of the slowest member of their herds\nThey walk with infants surrounded by nurturing members of the herd, and their young babies are always protected from the threats \u2013 not only hunters but also the wind, the rain, and the sun.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xstlZadejI0 Video can\u2019t be loaded because JavaScript is disabled: SafariLive Nov 6 \u2013 Lovely herd of Elephants walking by. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xstlZadejI0) Elephant facts: they walk at the pace of the slowest member of their herds. This video shows a lovely herd of Elephants walking by.\n10. Mothers nurse their calves for about 4 years\nAlthough they do start to eat vegetation at just a few months of age, during the nursing period, infant elephants are milk dependent and cannot live more than a few weeks without milk.\n11. Their trunk is so sensitive but too strong at the same time\nElephant trunks are actually a fusion of their nose and upper lip. It is manipulated by about 40-60,000 muscles. They have multiple functions, including breathing, olfaction (chemoreception that forms the sense of smell), touching, grasping, and sound production.\nIt is so strong \u2013 it can lift up to 350 kg (770 lb). It is also so sensitive, can be used for delicate tasks, such as wiping an eye and checking an orifice, and is capable of cracking a peanut shell without breaking the seed.\nFurthermore, elephant trunks suck up water at speeds of 540 kilometers per hour! (335.5 mph!)\n12. Their skin is too strong\nAn elephant\u2019s skin is generally very tough, at 2.5 cm (1 in) thick on the back and parts of the head.\n13. They have big brains\nThe brain of an elephant weighs 4.5-5.5 kg (10-12 lb) compared to 1.4 kg (3 lb) for an average human brain. But, obviously, it is proportionally smaller.\n14. Communication\nElephants communicate with a range of vocalizations, from low-frequency rumbles, known as infrasound, which humans can\u2019t hear, to higher-pitched screams and trumpets. Other elephants can hear these vocalizations as much as 10 km (6 miles) away. This allows them to keep in touch when apart and also enables them to recognize if an elephant is a friend. If not, they gather together for protection.\nPerhaps their most well-known call is the trumpet which is made by blowing through the trunk. Trumpeting is made during excitement, distress or aggression.\nTouching is an important form of communication among elephants. Individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition. Older elephants use trunk slaps, kicks, and shoves to discipline younger ones. Individuals of any age and sex will touch each other\u2019s mouths, temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during meetings or when excited. This allows individuals to pick up chemical cues.\nElephant facts: Individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks.\nTouching is especially important for mother-calf communication. When moving, elephant mothers will touch their calves with their trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf is behind them. If a calf wants to rest, it will press against its mother\u2019s front legs and when it wants to suckle, it will touch her breast or leg.\nElephants also use visual displays to communicate. They try to appear more threatening by raising their heads and spreading their ears. They may add to the display by shaking their heads and snapping their ears, as well as throwing dust and vegetation. They are usually bluffing when performing these actions. Excited elephants may raise their trunks. Submissive ones will lower their heads and trunks, as well as flatten their ears against their necks, while those that accept a challenge will position their ears in a V shape.\n15. Elephants are keystone species\nThis means without them, entire ecosystems would look dramatically different or cease to exist. In the case of an elephant, their dietary habits and movements help control an ecosystem and create new habitats for other animals including antelopes, zebra, and wildebeest, as well as smaller animals and insects.\nFor instance, elephants can travel over 80 km (50 miles) a day and when it rains, their large footprints act as water collectors and serve as water sources for smaller animals. Elephants also pull up grass and bushes when they eat, making room for new plants to grow whilst they also spread plant seeds to new areas through their droppings (dung).\n16. Elephants live long\nThey can live for 60-70 years.\nLin Wang, a captive male Asian elephant, lived for 86 years (1917-2003). He even served with the Chinese Expeditionary Force during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945). He lived out most of his life in the Taipei Zoo.\nBut it\u2019s a myth that elephants can live hundreds of years and outlive their caretakers.\nElephant facts: Lin Wang and General Sun Li-jen, 1947. Lin Wan lived for 86 years (1917-2003). Image source: Wikipedia\n17. Elephants can recognize themselves in mirrors\nThis is considered an indication of self-awareness and cognition that has also been demonstrated in some apes and dolphins.\nElephants are among the species known to use tools. An Asian elephant has been observed modifying branches and using them as flyswatters. But, their tool modification is not as advanced as that of chimpanzees.\n19. They have a slow pulse rate\nWhen standing, the elephant\u2019s heart beats approximately 25-35 times per minute. For comparison, an average human\u2019s heart beats about 80 times per minute.\nThe smallest known mammal by mass, the Etruscan shrew has a very fast heart beating rate, up to 1511 beats/min (25 beats/s) \u2013 probably the highest pulse rate in all animals.\nUnlike many other animals, the heart rate speeds up by 8 to 10 beats per minute when the elephant is lying down. A possible reason for that is: the weight of the animal in the recumbent position reduces tidal respiratory volume; the compensatory mechanism is to increase heart rate.\n20. They can\u2019t jump\nElephants are incapable of jumping, but these massive mammals can run at a maximum speed of 25 miles (40 km) per hour. Yet even when they are moving at their fastest, they still keep at least one foot on the ground at all times \u2013 so, technically, it\u2019s not \u201crunning\u201d.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_D4qqciraI Video can\u2019t be loaded because JavaScript is disabled: Elephants Run To Greeting A New Rescued Baby Elephant \u2013 ElephantNews (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_D4qqciraI) Elephant facts: in this video, elephants run to greet a newly rescued baby elephant: watch a whole herd run to greet a newly rescued baby elephant, \u201cDok Geaw\u201d, at Elephant Nature Park. Dok Geaw is one year and nine months old. He is an orphaned child\u2026but it looks like he will not have too much trouble finding a new family.\nFun video: baby elephant chasing birds\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77pWJqIa8yA Video can\u2019t be loaded because JavaScript is disabled: Baby Elephant Chasing Birds FAIL | The Dodo (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77pWJqIa8yA) Adorable baby elephant chasing birds falls over: this baby elephant got so excited chasing birds, he couldn\u2019t keep his balance.\nSome Not So-Amazing Elephant Facts\nAfrican elephants were listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2008. The poaching of elephants for their ivory, meat, and hides has been one of the major threats to their existence. Other threats include habitat loss (elephants need larger amounts of land than other sympatric terrestrial mammals) and fragmentation.\nHuman activity such as land conversion (building roads, etc) limits animals\u2019 ability to migrate, find mates, food, etc. They also divide wildlife populations into smaller ones, which cause a \u201cgenetic bottleneck\u201d that resulted in inbreeding, which detrimentally impacts species\u2019 survival.\nLand conversion (building roads, etc) limits animals\u2019 ability to migrate, find mates, food, etc. They also divide wildlife populations into smaller ones, which cause a \u201cgenetic bottleneck\u201d that resulted in inbreeding, which detrimentally impacts species\u2019 survival.\nThe consequences of such a genetic bottleneck might include a low sperm count, decreased sperm motility, and susceptibility to disease.\nEspecially the Asian elephant lives in areas with some of the highest human populations.\nPlease, do not ever buy ivory or other wildlife-related products.\nNotes\nWorld Elephant Day is an international annual event on August 12, dedicated to the preservation and protection of the world\u2019s elephants. The inaugural World Elephant Day was launched on August 12, 2012, to bring attention to the urgent plight of Asian and African elephants.\nSources"}

Discover 10 other interesting facts about elephants.\n10. How much does an elephant really weigh?\nThe weight of the elephants depends on the type of elephant. For African elephants which may grow as tall as 3-4 meters, they weigh from 4,000\u20137,500 kilograms. On the other hand, the Asian elephants weigh from 3,000-6,000 kilograms as they are relatively smaller than the African elephants. A newborn elephant baby may weigh up to 118 kilograms.\n9. Wait\u2026how are elephants even weighed?\nElephants can be weighed by either using a weighing scale or a given formula. There are portable truck scales that can be used to weigh the elephants. On the other hand, to use the weight formula, one must measure the circumference of one of the elephant\u2019s footpads, the length of the area around its body by measuring the area behind the front legs, and then measure the length of the elephant. Once one has the three figures, they will use the formula: (11.5 x hearth girth) + (7.55 x length) + (12.5 x pad circumference) \u2013 4016 = elephant\u2019s weight.\n8. How long do elephants live?\nTypically, the lifespan of elephants is between 50 and 70 years. However, the oldest elephant to have lived existed for 86 years. This elephant was an Asian elephant called Lin Wang.\n7. Where do elephants live?\nElephants naturally live in forests and savannas found in the continents of Africa and Asia. However, some of them have adapted to life in the Namib and Sahara deserts as well as zoos.\n6. Are elephants endangered?\nThe Asian elephants are categorized by the IUCN Red List as \u201cEndangered\u201d whereas the African elephants are under the list of the \u201cVulnerable\u201d species. In 2012, estimates placed the total elephant population at 440,000. The elephants face the threat of being hunted by humans who seek to trade the ivory in their tusks. Ivory has been used for centuries to make piano keys and billiard balls among other valuables. World Elephant Day is celebrated on August 12th each year to spread awareness about elephant conservation.\n5. Do female elephants have tusks?\nAll the elephants that inhabit the African continent have tusks: both female and male. However, in Asia, only male elephants have tusks. 50% of the female Asian elephants have small tusks known as tushes.\n4. How many bones are in an elephant trunk?\nAn elephant\u2019s trunk is a fusion of its nose and upper lips. It is made up of no bones. However, it consists of over 40,000 muscles that are further divided into 150,000 units.\n3. What was the biggest elephant who ever lived?\nThe largest elephant to have ever existed lived in Angola and weighed about 10,886 kilograms.\n2. What is the difference between an Asian elephant and an African elephant?\nThe first difference between Asian and African elephants is the shape and size of their ears. It is said that the ears of Asian elephants resemble the shape of India while the ears of the African elephants look like the shape of the map of the African continent. The African elephants\u2019 ears are much bigger and larger compared to those of their Asian counterparts. Secondly, the Asian elephant tusks are smaller compared to the African elephant tusks. Thirdly, African elephants are bigger and heavier than the Asian elephants. Whereas the African elephants weigh between 4000 and 7500 kilograms, the Asian elephants weigh between 3,000 and 6000 kilograms. The African elephants grow up to 4 meters tall while the Asian elephants do not grow more than 3.5 meters tall. With reference to the skin of the elephants, African elephants\u2019 skin is more wrinkled than those of the Asian elephants. The wrinkled skin help in containing moisture that provides a cooling effect in the heat of the sun as well as protects the elephants from parasites. Lastly, the trunks of the Asian elephants have one \u201cfinger\u201d while those of the African elephants have two \u201cfingers.\u201d\n1. How smart are elephants?\nResearch indicates that the brains of elephants are three to four times larger than that of human beings. Studying these animals reveals that they are quite intelligent as they have developed ways of even protecting themselves from the scorching sun. After taking a bath, they use their trunks to throw mud on the back of their bodies. The mud dries and acts as a sunscreen for the elephants. Besides, elephants often display compassion, self-awareness, compassion, and altruism. Furthermore, elephants can engage in plays, music, and art. Elephants also recognize themselves in a mirror."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "African Elephant - Animal Facts for Kids - Size, Weight, Trunk", "url": "https://www.animalfunfacts.net/elephants/57-african-elephant.html", "text": "African Bush Elephant Facts\nSize Up to 13 ft (3.96 m) Speed Up to 24 mph (39 km/h) Weight Up to 6 tons Lifespan 60-70 years Food Plants, fruit, roots Predators Crocodiles, lions, hyenas Habitat African steppe Order Proboscidea Family Elephantidae Scientific name Loxodonta africana Characteristics Trunk, tusks, large ears\nMain Characteristics\nThe African elephant is - on land - the heaviest mammal in the world. It is also the second largest animal after the giraffe. His two \"relatives\", the Asian elephant and the forest elephant are a little smaller and lighter. Its most striking features are its trunk and its tusks.\nPhysical Description\nHow Much Does an Elephant Weigh?\nElephants are the heaviest mammals to live on land. A fully grown male elephant can weigh up to six tons. That's roughly the same as six small cars. A hippopotamus \u201conly\u201d weighs up to 4.5 tons and a rhinoceros 3-4 tons. There are mammals, which are much heavier than the African Elephant, but they don't live on land. They live in water, for example the whale shark or the blue whale.\nWhat Size Is an Elephant?\nElephants reach a height of 13 feet (3.96 meters), which is almost the length of an average small car. To imagine it, you just have to turn it 90 degrees in your mind. There is only one animal larger than the elephant: the giraffe. It grows 18.7 feet (5-6 meters) tall.\nThe Elephant Trunk\nThe trunk constitutes both the upper lip and the nose of the elephant. Often the elephant appears to be drinking with its trunk, but the elephant only sucks the water up to spray it into its mouth.\nThe elephant can suck in up to two gallons (8 liter) of water in one go with its trunk. But the trunk has many more functions: The elephant can use it to dig, to grab or take up, draw, push, and throw things. Eight big muscles help the elephant to move its trunk.\nIn 2021, researchers found that elephants can suck three liters of water per second. At a speed of 330 mph (530 km/h). That's 50 times faster than a human sneeze. The animals also widen their nostrils and dilate their trunk by 30 %.\nWhy Do Elephants Have Big Ears?\nIn contrast to its colleagues, the African steppe elephant has huge ears. They help it to cool down, because during midday heat an elephant can easily have an attack of sweating. It pumps blood into its ears, uses them like a fan and then pumps the cooled down blood back into its body. African forest elephants and Asian elephants mainly loiter under the shady canopy of leaves of tropical forests or they are active at night. Therefore they do not need ears of this size.\nWhy Do Elephants Have Tusks?\nElephants have tusks and molar teeth. The tusks have developed from incisors and are also called ivory. Even though it is strictly prohibited, elephants are still hunted down by poachers because of the ivory. The elephant needs its molar teeth to grind plant food. They have five sets of molars \u2013 six sets if you also count milk teeth. While our third set consists of false teeth, elephants still can go on munching happily.\nAre Elephants Really \"Thick Skinned\"?\nElephants are often called thick-skinned animals. Their skin is indeed thicker than ours. Ours is only a few millimeters thick, while the elephant\u2019s skin measures about 0.8 inch (2 cm). If we call another person \u201cthick-skinned\u201d, we usually talk about someone who is not very sensitive. Yet, this does not apply to elephants. Elephants have a very sensitive skin and can even get a sunburn.\nBehavior\nWhy Do Elephants Bath in Mud?\nThe mud protects the elephants from sunburns and the heat.\nHow Much Water Does an Elephants Drink a Day?\nAn elephant consumes about 80 gallons (300 liter) of water per day. For comparison: Humans should drink about 0.5-0.8 gallons (2-3 liter) every day. Elephants can sniff where they can find water in the wide steppes of Africa and Asia \u2013 with their tusks of course.\nEnemies and Threats\nDo African Elephants Have Enemies?\nAdult elephants have no enemies (except humans), but young elephants do have. If the animals bathe in a river or lake, they can fall prey to crocodiles. Sometimes young or sick animals are also killed by leopards, hyenas or lions.\nReproduction\nAfrican elephants have the longest gestation period of all mammals: 22 months! At birth, the little calf already measures 35 inch (90 cm), weighs 220 lb (100 kg), and can stand on its own legs after half an hour. It is breast-fed by its mother for one year.\nThe African Bush Elephant Is Related To:\nAnimals in the Same Biome:"}

They are extremely sophisticated, peaceful creatures, revered by people across the world. Sadly, though, they are also hunted and highly prized by people across the world for the ivory contained in their tusks. As conservationists and animal lovers alike scramble to raise awareness for the dwindling global population of elephants, we celebrate these incredible creatures and all the things you might not necessarily know about them. For example, while elephants are gigantic when compared to other land animals, they're minuscule when compared to whales. In fact, a blue whale's tongue can weigh more than an entire elephant. By CBS News Staff Writer Christina Capatides\nDung-kin Donuts Paula Bronstein/Getty Images The world's most expensive cup of coffee comes from beans that have been handpicked from the dung of elephants in Golden Triangle, Thailand. At $500 a pound and $50 a serving, Black Ivory Coffee is so pricey because of its unique, natural refining process. An elephant eats the beans, digests them for 15-30 hours, and poops them out. The beans are then plucked from the elephant's dung, washed and roasted. Since elephants are herbivores, the fermentation that occurs within their stomachs is said to bring out the sugar in the coffee beans and strip them of any bitterness.\nVoice box Kim Jae-Hwan/AFP/Getty Images An elephant in South Korea shocked scientists in 2012, when he suddenly started speaking Korean. Placing the tip of his trunk into his mouth, Koshik is able to convincingly imitate a human voice, enunciating five Korean words: \"annyeong\" (hello); \"anja\" (sit down); \"aniya\" (no); \"nuwo\" (lie down) and \"choah\" (good).\nHyrax Mark Kolbe/Getty Images Oddly enough, the closest living relative to the elephant is the rock hyrax; a small, broad furry mammal found in South Africa, often mistaken for a rodent.\nTrunk dunk Pornchai Kittiwongsakul/AFP/Getty Images Despite weighing about 400 pounds, elephant trunks are so dexterous that they can pick up a single grain of rice. With that in mind, shooting hoops is a breeze!\nSatao - huge tusks Jean Liou/AFP/Getty Images Before the world mourned the premature death of Cecil the lion, it mourned the loss of Satao - one of Africa's last 'great tuskers' - to poachers. Satao, a bull likely born in the 1960s, was one of Kenya's most famous elephants because his massive ivory tusks grew to more than 100 pounds. Conservationists believe that Satao survived as long as he did because he learned to avoid humans, always moving from bush to bush with his ivory hidden in the foliage. In June of 2014, when poachers finally shot Satao with poison darts, he had migrated to a remote corner of Tsavo National Park to find fresh water after a series of storms. His body was later found with his face and great tusks mercilessly hacked off. Though the ivory trade is now banned, countless elephants are slaughtered each year and their tusks sold on the black market. In fact, the street value of elephant ivory in numerous Asian countries is now greater than gold.\nAdvanced emotions Tony Karumba/AFP/Getty Images Elephants grieve the loss of their loved ones for many years. They are like humans that way. They cry and even gather to grieve in groups, as if they were holding animal kingdom sort of funerals. When the \"Elephant Whisperer\" Lawrence Anthony died, for example, a herd of elephants travelled to his house to mourn him. They have a more developed hippocampus, thought to be the center of emotion, memory, and the autonomic nervous system, than any other animal, which could explain such advanced emotional awareness. In addition to grief, elephants have also been documented exhibiting humor and compassion. In fact, it is not unheard of for an elephant to rescue a trapped dog or even bury a deceased human.\nFull house Tony Karumba/AFP/Getty Images Female elephants can have babies until they're about 50 years old. During that time, they tend to give birth once every two-and-a-half to four years. That means a single elephant can have more than twenty kids.\nAn elephant's skin regiment Carl De Souza/AFP/Getty Images Elephants use mud as both a sunscreen and a moisturizer.\nSensitive skin Ivan Lieman/AFP/Getty Images Elephants' skin may look tough, but it's actually so sensitive that they can feel a single fly land on their bodies.\nSensitive ears 20th Century Fox In the Dr. Seuss classic, \"Horton Hears A Who!,\" elephants' ears are ultra sensitive... so sensitive, in fact, that Horton is able to hear microscopic creatures, called Whos, talking to him from a tiny planet, the size of a speck of dust. In addition to Horton, elephants are responsible for several of the world's other most beloved fictional characters, including Babar and Dumbo.\nElephant-sized appetite Stephanie Pilick/AFP/Getty Images An adult elephant can consume up to 300 pounds of food a day, sometimes spending as much as 16 hours doing it.

Many localities in Canada and numerous counties in the U.S. have also adopted bans. The U.K. is set to ban the use of wild animals in circuses, as well, in December 2015. After 145 years of elephant acts, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey, announced a plan on March 5, 2015 to retire its elephants by 2018. \"This decision was not easy, but it is in the best interest of our company, our elephants and our customers,\" said Kenneth Feld, chairman and CEO of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey's parent company, Feld Entertainment.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Endangered Elephants: Facts, Threats And Conservation", "url": "https://www.activewild.com/endangered-elephants/", "text": "All three living elephant species are threatened; both the African bush elephant and the Asian elephant are endangered, while the African forest elephant is critically endangered. The populations of endangered elephants in both Africa and Asia are decreasing and becoming ever-more fragmented.\nOn this page, we cover all three endangered elephants and the threats they currently face.\nPage Index\nIntroduction To Elephants\nDespite being among the most recognizable animals on Earth, elephants are under threat. These iconic animals, known not only for their distinctive appearance, but also for their high intelligence and fabled long memories, face an uncertain future. Wild elephant populations have fallen by 62% in the last decade (source) and extinction is an ever-growing possibility.\nThree living species of elephant are recognized: the African bush elephant, African forest elephant, and Asian elephant.\nTogether, they make up the family Elephantidae, which also includes several extinct species, including the mammoths. (Mastodons, although related, belong to a different family: Mammutidae.)\nAll three living elephant species appear on the IUCN red list of threatened species.\n(IUCN = International Union for Conservation of Nature)\nThe two main threats to elephants are poaching and habitat loss.\nElephant Poaching\nElephants are targeted by poachers primarily for their ivory tusks, which are traded by criminal networks and fetch high prices on the black market.\nIvory\nIvory is a hard, white substance obtained from the tusks and teeth of animals, most notably from the tusks of elephants \u2013 the word \u201civory\u201d is derived from the ancient Egyptian word for \u201celephant\u201d.\nIvory has been traded by humans for over 3,500 years. Historically, the ivory trade was extremely important for the continent of Africa; Ivory Coast (also known as C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire), a country in Western Africa, was named after the material.\nBeing durable, relatively easy to work on, and pleasing to the eye, ivory was used in the manufacture of a variety of items, including knife handles, billiard balls, piano keys, pipes, and a variety of ornamental objects.\nThe ivory trade has been responsible for a huge reduction in the populations of all three elephant species. In the 1980\u2019s, half of Africa\u2019s 1.3 million elephants were killed to supply the ivory trade.\nIn 1989, a CITES ruling placed a worldwide ban on the trade of African elephant ivory. Despite this, and several other subsequent rulings prohibiting the sale of ivory, elephants continue to be hunted to supply the illegal ivory trade.\n(CITES = Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora)\nHabitat Loss\nWhile poaching is the primary threat to Africa\u2019s elephants (although habitat loss is a close second), in Asia the situation is reversed.\nThe human populations of both Africa and Asia have undergone huge growth in recent years. This has resulted in a vast amount of savannas and forests \u2013 the traditional homes of most elephants \u2013 being destroyed to make way for growing cities, towns, farms, plantations, roads, and other human developments.\nElephants are being forced into areas too small to support large elephant populations. Additionally, elephant populations are becoming increasingly fragmented, leaving them at risk of disease and genetic problems.\nHuman-Elephant Conflict\nHabitat loss also increases the likelihood of conflict between humans and elephants. Although elephants are herbivores, they are large, powerful animals that need a lot of space.\nNot only are elephants a danger to crops, they are also dangerous to humans, killing several hundred people every year. As a result, elephants may be seen by many people in local communities as a threat both to their livelihoods and to their safety; just one of the many challenges faced by conservationists.\nAfrica\u2019s Elephants\nAfrica is home to two species of elephant: the African bush elephant and the African forest elephant. Both belong to the genus Loxodonta, and until recently these closely-related species were considered to be subspecies of a single African elephant species.\nAfrican elephants are distributed across a wide area of sub-Saharan Africa.\nAfrican Bush Elephant / African Savanna Elephant\nScientific name: Loxodonta africana\nConservation status: Endangered\nHeight (male): 3.04 to 3.36 m / 9.97 to 11.02 ft.\nHeight (female): 2.47 to 2.73 m / 8.1 to 8.96 ft.\nWeight (male): 5.2 to 6.9 t / 5.73 to 7.6 short tons\nWeight (female): 2.6 to 3.5 t / 2.87 to 3.86 short tons\nThe African bush elephant (also known as the African savanna elephant) is famous for being the world\u2019s largest and heaviest living land animal.\nThe average weight of a male African bush elephant is around 6 metric tons / 6.61 short tons \u2013 that\u2019s over 4 times the weight of a typical hatchback car. Females are around 50% of the weight of males.\nThe largest-known African bush elephant had an estimated weight of over 10 tons / 11.02 short tons.\nThe African bush elephant inhabits a range of habitats, including forests, woodlands and deserts, but is typically found in savannas and open plains. Females live in herds with their offspring. Males, after reaching maturity, are more independent, living alone or in small bachelor groups.\nUnlike the Asian elephant, both male and female African bush elephants have tusks (in general, only male Asian elephants have tusks).\nThe population of African elephants (both bush and forest species) is around 415,000 individuals; half of what it was in the 1930\u2019s. Despite numerous conservation schemes, the species\u2019 population continues to decline.\nEven today, the main threat to the African bush elephant is poaching for the ivory trade.\nHabitat loss is also a major factor in the species\u2019 continued decline; as Africa\u2019s human population continues to rise, more and more of the elephant\u2019s traditional habitat is lost due to the planting of crops, the growth of towns and cities, and the construction of roads and other infrastructure.\nAfrican Forest Elephant\nScientific name: Loxodonta cyclotis\nConservation status: Critically Endangered\nHeight (male): 2.09 to 2.31 m / 6.86 to 7.58 ft.\nHeight (female): 1.8 to 2.4 m / 5.91 to 7.87 ft.\nWeight (male): 1.7 to 2.3 t / 1.87 to 2.53 short tons\nWeight (female): 1.5 to 1.9 t / 1.65 to 2.09 short tons\nThe African forest elephant, which until the turn of the 21st century was considered a subspecies of African elephant, is the smallest of the three elephant species.\nAs its name suggests, the African forest elephant is found in forest habitats. It is present in tropical forests and other forest habitats in western and central Africa. The largest remaining populations of forest elephants are found in Gabon and the Republic of the Congo.\nFruit forms a major part of the diet of forest elephants. The species also eats bark and leaves from trees.\nThe African forest elephant plays an important part in the ecosystem of African forests as its fruit-based diet helps distribute seeds (the dung of African forest elephants often contains the seeds of over 70 species of trees).\nThe main threat to this endangered elephant is illegal poaching. Deforestation is also a significant threat to the species, whose population is becoming ever-more fragmented as its forest habitat is lost.\nAsian Elephant\nScientific name: Elephas maximus\nConservation status: Endangered\nHeight (male): 2.61 to 2.89 m / 8.56 to 9.48 ft.\nHeight (female): 2.28 to 2.52 m / 7.48 to 8.27 ft.\nWeight (male): 3.5 to 4.6 t / 3.86 to 5.07 short tons\nWeight (female): 2.3 to 3.1 t / 2.53 to 3.42 short tons\nWith an average weight lower than that of the African bush elephant, and higher than that of the white rhinoceros, the Asian elephant is the world\u2019s second-largest land animal (and the largest found in Asia).\nApart from size, differences between the Asian and African elephants include: smaller ears, a back that is generally convex rather than concave, and smoother skin.\nUnlike their African cousins, female Asian elephants rarely have tusks. As a result, males are more likely to be targeted by poachers.\nAsian elephants are additionally targeted for their skin, which is used for a variety of products, including beads for jewelry.\nThe black market trade in both elephants and ivory is particularly active in Thailand.\nAsian elephant calves are also stolen and smuggled out of their native countries to Thailand, where they are trained (often with brutal methods) and used in the tourist industry.\nAlthough poaching remains a serious problem, the biggest threat faced by the Asian elephant is habitat loss and fragmentation.\nLogging, the creation of crop plantations, the growth of towns and cities, and the construction of infrastructure such as roads, railways and power lines all result in the destruction of the elephant\u2019s traditional habitat.\nThe rapid growth of Asia\u2019s human population brings humans and elephants into conflict. Not only are elephants responsible for the destruction of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of crops each year, but these large, dangerous animals also cause the deaths of hundreds of people.\nThis is a tragic result of humans and elephants having to share an ever-decreasing amount of space.\nThe total Asian elephant population consists of around 40-50,000 individuals, around 60% of which live in India (source); many sport stadiums hold more people than there are Asian elephants left in the wild. The Asian elephant population has declined by at least 50% in three generations (source).\nElephant Extinction\nWith decreasing, ever-more fragmented, elephant populations, the threat of extinction is very real for these distinctive animals.\nIt can take many years for elephant populations to rise significantly; female elephants are usually at least nine years old before they start to breed; males well into their teens.\nWith gestation lasting around two years (among the longest pregnancies of all mammals), and several years between each birth, the typical generation length is around 25 and 22 years for African bush and Asian elephants respectively.\nIf we want to save these magnificent animals, we need to act immediately.\nFurther Reading\nYou can find out more about elephants and other endangered animals on the following pages:"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "African Bush Elephant - Facts, Diet, Habitat & Pictures on Animalia.bio", "url": "https://animalia.bio/african-bush-elephant", "text": "Habits and Lifestyle\nSavanna elephants live in a rather complex social hierarchy. These animals gather into family units, consisting of about 10 females and their offspring. Reaching maturity, male calves usually leave the family unit, forming bachelor herds or living solitarily. As a general rule, males socialize with these family groups only when mating. Meanwhile, several family herds may gather together, making up a 'clan'. Each clan is dominated by a female matriarch, and can consist of as many as several hundred elephants. African bush elephants are very careful and protective animals. Allomothering is a common practice in this species: females can raise calves of other females of their herd. They protect and care for calves of the herd, while all adults are sleeping. If a calf strays too far, these allomothers are responsible for retrieving the baby. These active animals are constantly on the move. These elephants forage during the daytime hours, wandering the home range of their herd. Savanna elephants freely communicate with conspecifics both verbally and non-verbally."}

They are highly social animals, gathering into matriarchal units: these are stable groups, which may consist of more than 20 related females. The leader of a group is the oldest female. She guides the herd in their search of food and water sources. These matriarchal units can occasionally divide into smaller, temporary groups. These small herds communicate with each other by low frequency vocalizations, heard from afar. Some males are known to join these groups. These elephants are non-territorial animals. The Indian elephants used to migrate seasonally. However, they presently cannot do it due to agricultural development and other human activities. Along with many other large mammals, these animals handle cold better than heat. During the hottest part of the day, elephants usually shelter, releasing heat through their ear by flapping them at different speed, depending on the extent of heat."}

They have even returned to the bones later.\nElephants in Circuses Are Abused and Deprived\nElephants who are used for entertainment don\u2019t get to do anything they like to do. Because these gentle giants are so powerful, they\u2019re often torn away from their families when they\u2019re just babies. Can you imagine what it would be like never to see your family again?\nCircuses are terrible places for elephants, and trainers abuse them using electric shocks, whips, and sharp metal-tipped sticks called \u201cbullhooks.\u201d When they make a \u201cmistake,\u201d they may be beaten, yelled at, tied up with ropes, or chained for hours. Many elephants in circuses develop arthritis, foot infections, and other health problems, and sometimes they don\u2019t even get treatment.\nElephant Rides Cause Suffering\nElephants forced to give rides are separated from their mothers as babies, and people hurt them and scare them to try and break their spirits so they can be easily dominated. In this process, they are often tied down with ropes and beaten, sometimes for days. Some of them die during the abuse.\nWhat You Can Do to Help Elephants Used for Entertainment\nElephants are used by the entertainment industry for one reason: to make money. People who exploit them don\u2019t care about their well-being. If you want to help stop this abuse, don\u2019t go to animal circuses, say no to elephant rides, and don\u2019t buy tickets to movies that use real animals."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "elephant - Reproduction and life cycle | Britannica", "url": "https://www.britannica.com/animal/elephant-mammal/Reproduction-and-life-cycle", "text": "Reproduction and life cycle\nElephants live in small family groups led by old females (cows). Where food is plentiful, the groups join together. Most males (bulls) live in bachelor herds apart from the cows. Males and females both possess two glands that open between the eye and ear. Elephants of all ages and sexes secrete a fluid called temporin out of this orifice. Males, however, enter a \u201cmusth period,\u201d during which they secrete a fluid differing in viscosity from the fluid secreted when they are not in musth. Serum testosterone during musth is higher than in a nonmusth elephant, and the animal\u2019s behaviour is erratic; they are uncontrollable (musth is Hindi for \u201cintoxicated\u201d), sometimes even by their own handlers (mahouts). Musth is the time for establishing reproductive hierarchy, which can differ from the usual social hierarchy in that a male in musth outranks nonmusth males. In the wild, males are usually at their prime physical state during musth and ordinarily do most of the breeding.\nElephants are able to assess the reproductive status of one another by using their keen sense of smell. Inside the skull, elephants possess from seven to nine nasal turbinals with specialized sensitive tissues for olfaction. (Humans have only three turbinals; dogs have five.) When a female is in estrus, or when a male is in musth, an elephant apparently can detect airborne hormones. Once \u201ccollected,\u201d the information is then passed to the Jacobson\u2019s organ, located on the roof of the mouth. This organ conveys the molecules to the brain for analysis. Hormones are also sniffed directly from urine and feces.\nGestation is the longest of any mammal (18\u201322 months). The newborn elephant is about a metre (3.3 feet) tall and weighs about 100 kg (220 pounds). It suckles by using the mouth, not the trunk, at mammary glands located in the chest region. Weaning is a long process and sometimes continues until the mother can no longer tolerate the pokes of her offspring\u2019s emerging tusks. After weaning, many hours of each day are spent eating.\nElephants reach sexual maturity early in their second decade of life. African elephants become sexually mature at age 10\u201312, whereas Asian elephants become sexually mature about age 14. It is during that period that males leave their natal herd (herd of origin) to live either singly or in small herds with other males. Females, in contrast, remain with their natal herd for their whole lives. Despite living apart, adult male and female elephants form short-lived mating or feeding associations with one another.\nElephants can live to 80 years of age or more in captivity but live to only about 60 in the wild. Evidence does not substantiate the existence of so-called \u201celephant graveyards,\u201d where elephants supposedly gather to die."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Sri Lankan Elephant: 15 Facts You Won\u2019t Believe! - Kidadl", "url": "https://kidadl.com/animal-facts/sri-lankan-elephant-facts", "text": "Sri Lankan Elephant Interesting Facts\nWhat type of animal is a Sri Lankan elephant?\nSri Lankan elephants are Asian elephants' largest subspecies, closely related to Indian elephants but smaller than African elephants. With ears, face, trunk, and a big torso, this gigantic animal is very docile and lives in a social group called herd or clan where older females take care of theirs young ones. An elephant eats hundreds of pounds of food every day to maintain their huge body.\nWhat class of animal does a Sri Lankan elephant belong to?\nThe subspecies of the Asian elephant belong to the Elephantidae family and Mammalia class. The scientific name of this Sri Lankan Elephant is Elephas maximus maximus.\nSri Lankan elephants are the largest elephants found on the Asian continent but are smaller than African elephants.\nHow many Sri Lankan elephants are there in the world?\nAccording to recent studies, approximately 2500-4000 adult elephants are there in Sri Lanka. However, the population is declining with the decrease in their natural habitat and poaching for tusks. The species is endangered in the IUCN Red List. Sri Lankan elephants are now conserved in the National Park of Sri Lanka.\nWhere does a Sri Lankan elephant live?\nSri Lankan elephants are found in the rainforest and tropical woodland. To satisfy the need of a large amount of food and water to sustain themselves with their giant body, the group migrates from place to place in the island forest areas for food and water. The elephants are an essential part of the forests for maintaining balance in the ecosystem.\nWhat is a Sri Lankan elephant's habitat?\nNative to Sri Lanka, these elephants prefer wet and fertile forest and woodlands regions and are widely spread across the island country. Due to an increase in land use by humans for development and agricultural purposes, the species is now restricted to the country's dry and hot regions. The elephant is adapting to the drier habitat consisting of deciduous woodland, scrub, grassland, and marshes.\nWho do Sri Lankan elephants live with?\nFemale elephants live in a group along with their calves. The group is called a clan or herd, and the young ones are taken care of by this clan's females. The males of the Asian elephant subspecies are solitary animals and prefer to live on their own or in scattered groups of only males away from the clan. Sri Lankan elephants only come together during the mating season.\nHow long does a Sri Lankan elephant live?\nThe Sri Lankan elephant lifespan is between 55-70 years in the wild. In captivity, a Sri Lankan wild elephant can live up to 80 years with proper care. The Sri Lankan elephants live in close relationships with their clan in a herd. These are migratory animals, and the oldest female in the herd takes up the responsibility to remember their migratory route. Sri Lankan elephant herds are very intelligent and have excellent communication among themselves, and the elder ones pass on their knowledge to the younger ones in the clan.\nHow do they reproduce?\nSri Lankan elephants reach sexual maturity at the age of 10-11 years. Mating happens throughout the year. Females have a short estrus period of three to seven days when they are fertile and ready to mate. Male elephants have a hormonal phase called musth, which significantly increases their potential as a mate. The males of the Sri Lankan elephant fight and the females choose the most desirable ones. After a gestation period of 18-22 months, a female delivers a calf. Calves are weaned at 18-36 months. Females do not mate again until the baby is weaned off.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nThe Sri Lankan elephant conservation status is Endangered. The Sri Lankan elephants (Elephas maximus maximus) are protected under Sri Lankan law, and a death penalty is issued if these animals are poached. There are few national parks and protected areas in Sri Lanka where these are conserved. However, since these are migratory species, the fragmentation of their natural habitat by human activity has brought them into conflict with humans, which is the primary reason for the decline in the Sri Lankan elephant population, which was once widely distributed across the island nation.\nSri Lankan Elephant Fun Facts\nWhat do Sri Lankan elephants look like?\nSri Lankan Elephants have a curved torso, angular ears, and the skin is primarily gray-black or brown with pigmentation. Females do not have tusks, and male elephants are almost double their female counterparts of the same age.\nHow cute are they?\nThe Sri Lankan elephant is a large mammal that is an adorable, cute, and friendly animal. These Asian elephants can easily be domesticated. They have lived together with humans for centuries and are a part of this island country's religious culture.\nHow do they communicate?\nElephants produce many voices to communicate with each other. The voices are produced with mouth and trunk. They have different voices for both short and long-distance communication and mate selection. Elephants have glands that help in chemical communication. They use their trunk and tusks to touch and communicate with each other in a herd.\nHow big is a Sri Lankan elephant?\nMale elephants are larger than females of the same age. They are huge terrestrial mammals with bodyweight between 4,000-12,000 lb (2000-5500 kg). The elephants' length is between 18-21 ft (5.5-6.5 m), and the shoulder height is between 6-11 ft(1.8-3.4m). Comparatively, it is smaller than the African elephant.\nHow fast can a Sri Lankan elephant run?\nSri Lankan Elephants can run up to a speed of 27 mph. In general, they keep walking in the migratory route, determined according to the monsoon season. They constantly move for food and water and rest during the day under a tree.\nHow much does a Sri Lankan elephant weigh?\nThe Sri Lankan elephant has its body weight between 4,000-12,000 lb (2000-5500 kg). It is smaller than the African elephant. The male elephants are larger than the females. They are the largest of the subspecies of Asian elephants and are closely related to the Indian elephants.\nWhat are their male and female names of the species?\nThe male elephant is called a bull elephant, and the female is called a cow. These animals live in groups called a herd or clan, with most females taking care of the young ones. The males live separately in smaller groups or in solitary.\nWhat would you call a baby Sri Lankan elephant?\nThe Sri Lankan baby elephant is called a calf. The calves stay in the clan under the protection of their mother and other female elephants until they grow big. Once the males reach sexual maturity at ten years of age, they leave the herd to live independently or in small bachelor groups.\nWhat do they eat?\nThe Sri Lankan elephant diet consists of over a hundred species of grasses, trees, shrubs, and vines. They also eat cultivated crops, especially sugar cane. They eat approximately 10% of their body mass per day. An adult elephant weighs around 12,000 lb and requires 300-400 lb of food and 25-50 gal of water per day to survive. To meet their need, they eat nearly 16 hours a day.\nAre they dangerous?\nThe giant Asian elephant is very friendly and not dangerous unless provoked. Due to the human encroachment of the Sri Lankan elephant habitat and their migratory and forage areas, these animals conflict with humans over the years.\nWould they make a good pet?\nElephants are very high maintenance pets. They are very friendly animals and connect to their mahouts and caretakers. However, Sri Lankan elephants are an endangered species and are protected under Sri Lankan law with a death penalty to whoever breaches it. Nevertheless, these animals have been domesticated for centuries. The kings kept these animals as a status symbol and an essential part of their military.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nDid you know...\nThe female Sri Lankan wild elephants do not have tusks, and only eight percent of the male population have tusks.\nThese elephants have leathery skin of up to one inch in thickness, but they are very sensitive to the sun. That is why they cover themselves in dust or mud and spend summertime in marshes and water bodies.\nThough tigers can not kill the larger animals, they prey on the younger calves, affecting the population.\nElephants are revered in Sri Lanka for their symbolic, spiritual, and economic value. Tourists come to see elephants in the wild in national parks. They help logging operations by dragging felled trees, and they play an important role in religious ceremonies.\nThe elephant defecates around 15 times a day! Half of the food it eats is not used by its body. Around 220 lb of dung is defecated daily, forming manure in the forest. The undigested seeds are distributed around the forests for new growth.\nTwin Sri Lankan elephants are born but this only happens rarely.\nWhy is the Sri Lankan elephant endangered?\nSri Lankan elephants are one of the subspecies of Asian elephants which are endangered, and their number has been constantly declining since the beginning of the 19th century. The main threat to these huge mammals is humans. With humans' encroachment in their habitat for development and agriculture, these animals are forced to lose their habitat. Poaching these animals for their tusks is another example of human cruelty leading to endangering these species to the verge of extinction. Now the conservation of these animals has been taken up seriously. By giving the death penalty to those who kill an elephant, Sri Lanka's law protects it. There are national parks and protected areas in Sri Lanka where proper measures are being taken, including afforestation to conserve the elephants in the wild.\nAre elephants sacred in Sri Lanka?\nYes, the Sri Lankan elephants are sacred in Sri Lanka. The Sinhalese hold these animals as quasi-sacred and are essential in religious ceremonies and rituals. Almost every big temple has its sacred elephant. Orphaned or injured elephants are domesticated to keep up the continuity of these age-old religious rituals.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly animal facts for everyone to discover!

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "The 10 Weirdest Animal Facts - ThoughtCo", "url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/weirdest-animal-facts-4116013", "text": "Some animal facts are weirder than others. Yes, we all know that cheetahs can run faster than motorcycles, and that bats navigate using sound waves, but those tidbits of information aren't nearly as entertaining as immortal jellyfish, butt-breathing turtles, and three-hearted octopuses. Below you'll discover 10 truly weird (and true) facts about 10 truly weird (and real) animals.\n01 of 10 Female Spotted Hyenas Have a Penis Getty Images Okay, it may be a bit of an overstatement to say that the female spotted hyena has a penis: more accurately, the clitoris of the female closely resembles the penis of the male, to the extent that only a very brave naturalist (presumably wearing gloves and protective headgear) could hope to tell the difference. (For the record, the female's sex organ is slightly thicker, with a more rounded head than that sported by males.) Only slightly less weirdly, spotted hyena females are dominant during courtship and mating, and prefer to hook up with younger males; clearly they're the \"cougars\" of the mammal family.\n02 of 10 Killer Whales Experience Menopause Getty Images The menopause of human females is one of the mysteries of evolution: wouldn't it be better for our species if women could give birth throughout their lives, rather than becoming infertile around the age of 50? This enigma isn't diminished by the fact that only two other mammals are known to experience menopause: the short-finned pilot whale and the orca, or killer whale. Female killer whales stop bearing children when they reach their 30's or 40's; one possible explanation is that elderly females, undistracted by the demands of pregnancy and birth, are better able to guide their pods. This is the same \"grandmother effect\" that has been proposed for elderly human females, who provide inexhaustible supplies of wisdom (and babysitting).\n03 of 10 Some Turtles Breathe Through Their Butts Wikimedia Commons A handful of turtle species\u2014including the North American eastern painted turtle and the Australian white-throated snapping turtle\u2014have specialized sacs near their cloacas (the organs used for defecating, urinating, and copulating) that collect air and filter out oxygen. However, these turtles are also equipped with perfectly good lungs, which begs the question: why breathe through your butt when your mouth will do? The answer likely has something to do with the tradeoffs between hard, protective shells and the mechanics of respiration; apparently, for these turtles, butt-breathing is less metabolically demanding than mouth-breathing.\n04 of 10 One Species of Jellyfish Is Immortal Getty Images Before we talk about immortal jellyfish, it's necessary to define our terms. Turritopsis dohrnii will definitely kick the marine bucket if you step on it, pan-fry it, or torch it with a flamethrower. What it won't do, however, is die of old age; the adults of this jellyfish species can reverse their life cycles all the way back to the polyp stage, and (theoretically) repeat this process an indefinite number of times. We say \"theoretically\" because, in practice, it's virtually impossible for a single T. dohrnii to survive for more than a few years; that would require a given individual (either polyp or adult) to avoid getting eaten by other marine organisms.\n05 of 10 Koala Bears Have Human Fingerprints Getty Images They may seem cute and cuddly, but koala bears are extremely devious: not only are they marsupials (pouched mammals) rather than true bears, but they have somehow managed to evolve fingerprints virtually indistinguishable from those of human beings, even under an electron microscope. Since human beings and koala bears occupy widely separated branches on the tree of life, the only explanation for this coincidence is convergent evolution: just as early Homo sapiens needed a way to firmly grasp primitive tools, koala bears needed a way to grasp the slippery bark of eucalyptus trees.\n06 of 10 It's Almost Impossible to Kill a Tardigrade Getty Images Tardigrades\u2014also known as water bears\u2014are microscopic, eight-legged, vaguely repulsive-looking creatures that can be found pretty much everywhere on earth. But the weirdest thing about tardigrades, apart from their nightmarish appearance, is that they're pretty much indestructible: these invertebrate animals can survive prolonged exposure to the vacuum of deep space, endure bursts of ionizing radiation that would fry an elephant, go without food or water for up to 30 years, and prosper in terrestrial environments (Arctic tundra, deep-sea vents) that would kill most other animals, including human beings.\n07 of 10 Male Seahorses Give Birth to Young Getty Images You might think the spotted hyena (previous slide) is the last word for gender equality in the animal kingdom, but you don't know about seahorses yet. These marine invertebrates pair up for elaborate, intricately choreographed mating rituals, after which the female deposits her eggs into a pouch on the male's tail. The male carries the fertilized eggs for two to eight weeks (depending on species), its tail slowly swelling up, and then releases up to a thousand tiny seahorse babies to their fate (which mostly involves being eaten by other marine creatures; sadly, only one-half of one percent of seahorse hatchlings manage to survive into adulthood).\n08 of 10 Three-Toed Sloths Wear Algae Coats Getty Images Just how slow is the three-toed sloth? Not much faster than you saw in the movie Zootopia; this South American mammal, when it isn't entirely motionless, can hit top speeds of a blazing 0.15 miles per hour. In fact, Bradypus tridactylus is so crepuscular that it can easily be overtaken by unicellular algae, which is why most adults sport shaggy green coats, making them (for all intents and purposes) equal parts plant and animal. There is a good evolutionary explanation for this symbiotic relationship: the green coats of three-toed sloths provide valuable camouflage from jungle predators, notably the much, much faster jaguar.\n09 of 10 Octopuses Have Three Hearts and Nine Brains Getty Images There's a reason vaguely octopus-like creatures often feature in science-fiction movies as super-intelligent aliens. The anatomy of octopuses is alarmingly different from that of humans; these invertebrates have three hearts (two of which pump blood through their gills, the other to the rest of their bodies), and nine aggregations of nerve tissue. The primary brain resides, appropriately enough, in the octopus' head, but each of its eight arms also contains its share of neurons, which allow for independent movement and even primitive \"thinking.\" (Let's keep things in perspective, though: even the smartest octopus only has about 500 million neurons, one-twentieth the amount of the average human.)\n10 of 10 Dugongs Are Closely Related to Elephants Getty Images You might naively assume that dugongs\u2014the awkward-looking marine mammals that drunken sailors once mistook for mermaids\u2014are most closely related to seals, walruses, and other pinnipeds. The fact is, though, that these ocean dwellers descend from the same \"last common ancestor\" that spawned modern elephants, a tiny quadruped that lived on dry land about 60 million years ago. (Dugongs belong to the same family, the sirenians, as manatees; these two mammals went their separate ways about 40 million years ago.) The exact same pattern was repeated by (unrelated) whales, who can trace their ancestry to a population of dog-like mammals that lived during the early Eocene epoch."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "African Elephant | Species | WWF", "url": "https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/african-elephant", "text": "African elephants are the largest animals walking the Earth. Their herds wander through 37 countries in Africa. They are easily recognized by their trunk that is used for communication and handling objects. And their large ears allow them to radiate excess heat. Upper incisor teeth develop into tusks in African elephants and grow throughout their lifetime. There are two species of African elephants\u2014the savanna (or bush) elephant and the forest elephant. Savanna elephants are larger than forest elephants, and their tusks curve outwards. In addition to being smaller, forest elephants are darker and their tusks are straighter and point downward. There are also differences in the size and shape of the skull and skeleton between the two species.\nForest elephants are uniquely adapted to the dense forest habitat of the Congo Basin, but are in sharp decline due to poaching for the international ivory trade and habitat loss and fragmentation. It is estimated that probably one-quarter to one-third of the total African elephant population is made up of forest elephants."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Asian Elephant | Species | WWF", "url": "https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/asian-elephant", "text": "The Asian elephant is the largest land mammal on the Asian continent. They inhabit dry to wet forest and grassland habitats in 13 range countries spanning South and Southeast Asia. While they have preferred forage plants, Asian elephants have adapted to surviving on resources that vary based on the area.\nAsian elephants are extremely sociable, forming groups of six to seven related females that are led by the oldest female, the matriarch. Like African elephants, these groups occasionally join others to form larger herds, although these associations are relatively short-lived. In Asia, elephant herd sizes are significantly smaller than those of savannah elephants in Africa.\nMore than two-thirds of an elephant's day may be spent feeding on grasses, but it also eats large amounts of tree bark, roots, leaves, and small stems. Cultivated crops such as bananas, rice, and sugarcane are favorite foods. Elephants are always close to a source of fresh water because they need to drink at least once a day.\nIn Asia, humans have had close associations with elephants over many centuries, and elephants have become important cultural icons. According to Hindu mythology, the gods (deva) and the demons (asura) churned the oceans in a search for the elixir of life so that they would become immortal. As they did so, nine jewels surfaced, one of which was the elephant. In Hinduism, the powerful deity honored before all sacred rituals is the elephant-headed Lord Ganesha, who is also called the Remover of Obstacles."}

In fact, the largest elephant ever recorded was an adult male African elephant that weighed 24,000 pounds and was 13 feet tall, when measured at the shoulder. Take a look below for 30 more fun and interesting facts about elephants.\n1. Elephants are one of the only mammals that can\u2019t jump.\n2. They can live to be over 70 years old.\n3. Elephants have a highly developed brain, it\u2019s also the largest out of all land mammals. Their brian is 3 to 4 times larger than a humans, although it\u2019s much smaller in proportion to body weight.\n4. The average weight of an elephant heart is between 27 to 46 pounds.\n5. Their skin is an inch thick.\n6. When they\u2019re 16 years old, they can begin to reproduce. However, they will rarely have more than 4 offspring throughout their lifetime. At birth, an elephant calf can weigh up to 230 pounds.\n7. Elephants have very bad eyesight, but an amazing sense of smell.\n8. They have the longest pregnancy period out of all animals. Female elephants take 22 months from conception to give birth.\n9. Elephants prefer one tusk over the other, just as humans prefer one hand over the other.\n10. Like cats, elephants sometimes purr as a means of communication.\n11. Tusks are an elephants incisor teeth. They use their tusks for defense, digging for water and lifting things.\n12. An elephant trunk has more than 40,000 muscles in it.\n13. They have 4 molars, one on the top and one on the bottom on both sides of their mouth. One molar can weigh about 5 pounds and be the size of a brick.\n14. Elephants waive their trunk up in the air and from side to side in order to smell better.\n15. An elephants trunk is able to sense the size, temperature and shape of an object. They use their trunk to lift food and suck up water then put it into their mouth.\n16. Elephants are known to cry, play, have very good memory and even laugh.\n17. They\u2019re covered in a soft padding that helps uphold their weight, prevent them from slipping and dull most sounds. This is why they can walk almost silently even though they weigh thousands of pounds.\n18. They\u2019re capable swimmers. They use their trunk to breathe like a snorkel when in deep water.\n19. Elephants use their feet to listen to sounds. They can pick up subsonic rumblings made by other elephants through vibrations in the ground.\n20. They\u2019ve been observed listening by putting their trunks on the ground and carefully positioning their feet.\n21. They\u2019re very sensitive and caring animals. For example, if an elephant offspring complains, the entire family will rumble to go caress it.\n22. Elephants are able to express grief, compassion, self-awareness, altruism and even play.\n23. They\u2019ve been observed having greeting ceremonies when a friend has been away for a long time and returns to the larger group.\n24. They have large and thin ears. Their ears are made up of a network of blood vessels that regulate an elephant\u2019s body temperature. Their blood is circulated through their ears to help cool them down in extremely hot climates.\n25. They\u2019re very social creatures and are known to \u201chug\u201d by wrapping their trunk together in displays of greeting and affection.\n26. They have been observed hearing sound waves that are well below a human\u2019s hearing limitation. The far reaching use of high pressure infrasound open the elephant\u2019s spatial experience far beyond our limited capability.\n27. Stories of African elephants getting drunk from the fermented marula fruit aren\u2019t true. They animals don\u2019t eat the fruit off the ground where it ferments, and even if they did, due to the elephants large size it would take about 1,400 pieces to get one elephant drunk.\n28. The main reasons elephants are poached is because of their tusks. While there is a strong demand for ivory tusks, scientific research has shown that ivory is made out of the same tissue that human bone is made out of and it has no species effects or qualities.\n29. Elephant skin is so sensitive that they can feel a fly landing on it.\n30. Ancient civilizations used elephants as working animals. Since bulls are difficult and dangerous to work with, elephants were a lot easier to control and were used as formidable instruments of war."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "How Smart Are Elephants Really? | Reader's Digest", "url": "https://www.rd.com/article/how-smart-are-elephants/", "text": "There's a reason behind the old adage, \"an elephant never forgets.\" Read on to learn more about these brilliant, beautiful creatures.\nBlueOrange Studio/Shutterstock\nSure your dog is smart. But there\u2019s dog-smart, and then there\u2019s, well, elephant-smart. For example, if you hold a mirror up to your dog, he may bark or even try to play with his reflection. That\u2019s because dogs as a species aren\u2019t capable of self-awareness. But elephants are; they are one of a very few species of animal that can look in the mirror and realize they\u2019re seeing themselves. As amazing as that is, pachyderms also hold the honor of being one of the even fewer species that can recognize their bodies as separate from surrounding physical objects, as suggested by a 2017 study out of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom.\nFor that study, elephant intelligence researchers had elephants step onto a rubber mat, pick up a stick from the mat, then pass the stick to a person standing in front of them. The elephants were divided into two groups:\nFor Group 1, the stick was attached to the mat with a rope, which meant the elephant wouldn\u2019t be able to pass the stick without stepping off the mat. The researchers hypothesized that only an animal with a sense of his body in space would be able to figure out that it was necessary to step off the mat.\nFor Group 2, the stick wasn\u2019t attached, which meant the elephant could pass the stick even while remaining on the mat.\nAs it turned out, the elephants in Group 1 stepped off the mat significantly more often than the elephants in Group 2. That means they were capable of recognizing their own bodies as obstacles to the task at hand\u2014passing the stick. That keen level of self-awareness is so rare in the animal kingdom, we don\u2019t generally see it even in humans before the age of two, points out one of the researchers, Josh Plotnik, PhD, assistant professor of psychology at Hunter College, City University of New York and founder of conservation charity Think Elephants International.\n\u201cElephants are well regarded as one of the most intelligent animals on the planet,\u201d states the lead author of the Cambridge study, Rachel Dale, a PhD candidate at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, Austria. In addition to self-awareness, elephants demonstrate complicated decision-making skills, both alone and in cooperation with other members of their herd, with whom they communicate using a combination of \u201cgentle chirps, thunderous trumpets, and low-frequency rumbles\u2026as well as nudges, kicks, and visual signals such as a tilt of the head or flap of the ear,\u201d according to Scientific American. They can be seen \u201cdeliberating\u201d amongst themselves prior to initiating a group action. and afterward, they can be seen celebrating by lifting their heads high, clanging tusks together, and intertwining their trunks. All of this suggests more than mere mental acuity, but actual empathy in elephants. Find out what other facts you may have had wrong about different animals.\nBut if there\u2019s any doubt, elephants have been observed helping those who are injured by bringing them food and water, grieving for family members who have died, and burying their dead. Elephants are even capable of understanding what \u201cpointing means,\u201d which is an important milestone in child development, and although some dogs understand it, many otherwise intelligent animals, including chimpanzees, do not appear to. But as smart as elephants are, there\u2019s one thing they can\u2019t do. Read on to find out what that is along with 45 other amazing facts about your favorite animals."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Asian elephant - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_elephant", "text": "Species of mammal in the family Elephantidae\nThe Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), also known as the Asiatic elephant, is the only living species of the genus Elephas and is distributed throughout the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, from India in the west, Nepal in the north, Sumatra in the south, and to Borneo in the east. Three subspecies are recognised\u2014E. m. maximus from Sri Lanka, E. m. indicus from mainland Asia and E. m. sumatranus from the island of Sumatra. It is one of only three living species of elephants or elephantids anywhere in the world, the others being the African bush elephant and African forest elephant.\nThe Asian elephant is the largest living land animal in Asia. Since 1986, the Asian elephant has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List, as the population has declined by at least 50 percent over the last three elephant generations, which is about 60\u201375 years. It is primarily threatened by loss of habitat, habitat degradation, fragmentation and poaching. In 2019, the wild population was estimated at 48,323-51,680 individuals. Female captive elephants have lived beyond 60 years when kept in semi-natural surroundings, such as forest camps. In zoos, Asian elephants die at a much younger age; captive populations are declining due to a low birth and high death rate.\nThe genus Elephas originated in Sub-Saharan Africa during the Pliocene and spread throughout Africa before expanding into the southern half of Asia. The earliest indications of captive use of Asian elephants are engravings on seals of the Indus Valley Civilisation dated to the 3rd millennium BC.\nTaxonomy\nCarl Linnaeus proposed the scientific name Elephas maximus in 1758 for an elephant from Ceylon. Elephas indicus was proposed by Georges Cuvier in 1798, who described an elephant from India. Coenraad Jacob Temminck named an elephant from Sumatra Elephas sumatranus in 1847. Frederick Nutter Chasen classified all three as subspecies of the Asian elephant in 1940. These three subspecies are currently recognised as valid taxa. Results of phylogeographic and morphological analyses indicate that the Sri Lankan and Indian elephants are not distinct enough to warrant classification as separate subspecies.\nElephas maximus borneensis was proposed by Paules Edward Pieris Deraniyagala in 1950 who described an elephant in an illustration published in the National Geographic magazine, but not a living elephant in accordance with the rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. The Asian elephants living in northern Borneo are smaller than all the other subspecies, but with larger ears, a longer tail, and straight tusks. Results of genetic analysis indicate that their ancestors separated from the mainland population about 300,000 years ago.\nThe following Asian elephants were proposed as extinct subspecies, but are now considered synonymous with the Indian elephant:\nThe Asian elephant is the closest living relative of the extinct mammoths; the last common ancestor of the two is estimated to have lived between .\nCharacteristics\nIllustration of an elephant skeleton\nThe nail-like structures on the toes of an Asian elephant\nIn general, the Asian elephant is smaller than the African bush elephant and has the highest body point on the head. The back is convex or level. The ears are small with dorsal borders folded laterally. It has up to 20 pairs of ribs and 34 caudal vertebrae. The feet have more nail-like structures than those of African elephants\u2014five on each forefoot, and four on each hind foot. The forehead has two hemispherical bulges, unlike the flat front of the African elephants.\nSize\nOn average, when fully-grown, bulls are about 2.75 m (9.0 ft) tall at the shoulder and 4 t (4.4 short tons) in weight, while cows are smaller at about 2.40 m (7.9 ft) at the shoulder and 2.7 t (3.0 short tons) in weight. Sexual dimorphism in body size is relatively less pronounced in Asian elephants than in African bush elephants; with bulls averaging 15% and 23% taller in the former and latter respectively. Length of body and head including trunk is 5.5\u20136.5 m (18\u201321 ft) with the tail being 1.2\u20131.5 m (3.9\u20134.9 ft) long. The largest bull elephant ever recorded was shot by the Maharajah of Susang in the Garo Hills of Assam, India in 1924, it weighed an estimated 7 t (7.7 short tons), stood 3.43 m (11.3 ft) tall at the shoulder and was 8.06 m (26.4 ft) long from head to tail. There are reports of larger individuals as tall as 3.7 m (12 ft).\nTrunk\nThe distinctive trunk is an elongation of the nose and upper lip combined; the nostrils are at its tip, which has one finger-like process. The trunk contains as many as 60,000 muscles, which consist of longitudinal and radiating sets. The longitudinals are mostly superficial and subdivided into anterior, lateral, and posterior. The deeper muscles are best seen as numerous distinct fasciculi in a cross-section of the trunk. The trunk is a multipurpose prehensile organ and highly sensitive, innervated by the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve and by the facial nerve. The acute sense of smell uses both the trunk and Jacobson's organ. Elephants use their trunks for breathing, watering, feeding, touching, dusting, sound production and communication, washing, pinching, grasping, defence and offence.\nThe \"proboscis\" or trunk consists wholly of muscular and membranous tissue, and is a tapering muscular structure of nearly circular cross-section extending proximally from the attachment at the anterior nasal orifice, and ending distally in a tip or finger. The length may vary from 1.5 to 2 m (59 to 79 in) or longer depending on the species and age. Four basic muscle masses\u2014the radial, the longitudinal and two oblique layers\u2014and the size and attachments points of the tendon masses allow the shortening, extension, bending, and twisting movements accounting for the ability to hold, and manipulate loads of up to 300 kg (660 lb). Muscular and tendinous ability combined with nervous control allows extraordinary strength and agility movements of the trunk, such as sucking and spraying of water or dust and directed airflow blowing.\nThe trunk can hold about four litres of water. Elephants will playfully wrestle with each other using their trunks, but generally use their trunks only for gesturing when fighting.\nTusks\nTusks serve to dig for water, salt, and rocks, to debark and uproot trees, as levers for maneuvering fallen trees and branches, for work, for display, for marking trees, as a weapon for offence and defence, as trunk-rests, and as protection for the trunk. Elephants are known to be right or left tusked.\nCows usually lack tusks; if tusks\u2014in that case, called \"tushes\"\u2014are present, they are barely visible and only seen when the mouth is open.[citation needed] The enamel plates of the molars are greater in number and closer together in Asian elephants. Some bulls may also lack tusks; these individuals are called \"filsy makhnas\", and are especially common among the Sri Lankan elephant population.\nA record tusk described by George P. Sanderson measured 5 ft (1.5 m) along the curve, with a girth of 16 in (41 cm) at the point of emergence from the jaw, the weight being 104+1\u20442 lb (47.4 kg). This was from an elephant killed by Sir Brooke and measured 8 ft (2.4 m) in length, and nearly 17 in (43 cm) in circumference, and weighed 90 lb (41 kg). The tusk's weight was, however, exceeded by the weight of a shorter tusk of about 6 ft (1.8 m) in length which weighed 100 lb (45 kg).\nSkin\nDepigmented skin on the forehead and ears of an Asian elephant\nSkin colour is usually grey, and may be masked by soil because of dusting and wallowing. Their wrinkled skin is movable and contains many nerve centres. It is smoother than that of African elephants and may be depigmented on the trunk, ears, or neck. The epidermis and dermis of the body average 18 mm (0.71 in) thick; skin on the dorsum is 30 mm (1.2 in) thick providing protection against bites, bumps, and adverse weather. Its folds increase surface area for heat dissipation. They can tolerate cold better than excessive heat. Skin temperature varies from 24 to 32.9 \u00b0C (75.2 to 91.2 \u00b0F). Body temperature averages 35.9 \u00b0C (96.6 \u00b0F).\nIntelligence\nAsian elephants have a very large and highly developed neocortex, a trait also shared by humans, apes and certain dolphin species. They have a greater volume of cerebral cortex available for cognitive processing than all other existing land animals[citation needed]. Results of studies indicate that Asian elephants have cognitive abilities for tool use and tool-making similar to great apes. They exhibit a wide variety of behaviours, including those associated with grief, learning, allomothering, mimicry, play, altruism, use of tools, compassion, cooperation, self-awareness, memory, and language. Elephants reportedly head to safer ground during natural disasters like tsunamis and earthquakes, but data from two satellite-collared Sri Lankan elephants indicate this may be untrue.\nSeveral students of elephant cognition and neuroanatomy are convinced that Asian elephants are highly intelligent and self-aware. Others contest this view.\nDistribution and habitat\nAn elephant herd in the grasslands of Jim Corbett National Park Asian elephant grazing on the banks of Kabini River, Nagarhole National Park Asian elephant in Thailand Asian elephant walking in Tad Lo river, Salavan Province, Laos\nAsian elephants inhabit grasslands, tropical evergreen forests, semi-evergreen forests, moist deciduous forests, dry deciduous forests and dry thorn forests, in addition to cultivated and secondary forests and scrublands. Over this range of habitat types elephants occur from sea level to over 3,000 m (9,800 ft). In the eastern Himalaya in northeast India, they regularly move up above 3,000 m (9,800 ft) in summer at a few sites.\nIn China, the Asian elephant survives only in the prefectures of Xishuangbanna, Simao, and Lincang of southern Yunnan. Estimated population is around 300 individual (in 2020).\nIn Bangladesh, some isolated populations survive in the south-east Chittagong Hills. A herd of 20\u201325 wild elephants was reported as being present in the Garo Hills of Mymensingh in the late-1990s, being detached from a big herd in the Peack hills of India and prevented from returning by fences put up in the meantime by the Indian border security force. The herd was estimated at about 60 individuals in 2014.\nThree subspecies are recognised:\nThe Borneo elephant occurs in Borneo's northeastern parts, primarily in Sabah (Malaysia), and sometimes in Kalimantan (Indonesia). In 2003, mitochondrial DNA analysis and microsatellite data indicated that the Borneo elephant population is derived from stock that originated in the region of the Sunda Islands. The genetic divergence of Borneo elephants warrants their recognition as a separate Evolutionarily Significant Unit.\nEcology and behaviour\nA 5-month-old calf and its 17-month-old cousin in a sanctuary in Laos\nElephants are crepuscular. They are classified as megaherbivores and consume up to 150 kg (330 lb) of plant matter per day. They are generalist feeders, and are both grazers and browsers. They are known to feed on at least 112 different plant species, most commonly of the order Malvales, as well as the legume, palm, sedge and true grass families. They browse more in the dry season with bark constituting a major part of their diet in the cool part of that season. They drink at least once a day and are never far from a permanent source of fresh water. They need 80\u2013200 litres of water a day and use even more for bathing. At times, they scrape the soil for clay or minerals.\nCows and calves move about together as groups, while bulls disperse from their mothers upon reaching adolescence. Bulls are solitary or form temporary \"bachelor groups\". Cow-calf units generally tend to be small, typically consisting of three adults (most likely related females) and their offspring. Larger groups of as many as 15 adult females have also been recorded. Seasonal aggregations of 17 individuals including calves and young adults have been observed in Sri Lanka's Uda Walawe National Park. Until recently, Asian elephants, like African elephants, were thought to be under the leadership of older adult females, or matriarchs. It is now recognized that cows form extensive and very fluid social networks, with varying degrees of associations between individuals. Social ties generally tend to be weaker than in African elephants.\nUnlike African elephants, which rarely use their forefeet for anything other than digging or scraping soil, Asian elephants are more agile at using their feet in conjunction with the trunk for manipulating objects. They can sometimes be known for their violent behavior.\nAsian elephants are recorded to make three basic sounds: growls, squeaks and snorts. Growls in their basic form are used for short distance communication. During mild arousal, growls resonate in the trunk and become rumbles while for long-distance communication, they escalate into roars. Low-frequency growls are infrasonic and made in many contexts. Squeaks come in two forms; chirpings and trumpets. Chirping consists of multiple short squeaks and signal conflict and nervousness. Trumpets are lengthened squeaks with increased loudness and produced during extreme arousal. Snorts signal changes in activity and increase in loudness during mild or strong arousal. During the latter case, when an elephant bounces the tip of the trunk it creates booms which serve as threat displays.: 142 Elephants are able to distinguish low-amplitude sounds.\nRarely, tigers have been recorded attacking and killing calves, especially if the calves become separated from their mothers, stranded from their herd, or orphaned. Adults are largely invulnerable to natural predation. There is a singular anecdotal case of a mother Asian elephant allegedly being killed alongside her calf; however, this account is contestable. In 2011 and 2014, two instances were recorded of tigers successfully killing adult elephants; one by a single tiger in Jim Corbett National Park on a 20-year-old elephant, and another on a 28-year-old elephant in Kaziranga National Park further east, which was taken down and eaten by several tigers hunting cooperatively.\nReproduction\nBulls will fight one another to get access to oestrous cows. Strong fights over access to females are extremely rare. Bulls reach sexual maturity around the age of 12\u201315. Between the age of 10 and 20 years, bulls undergo an annual phenomenon known as \"musth\". This is a period where the testosterone level is up to 100 times greater than non-musth periods, and they become aggressive. Secretions containing pheromones occur during this period, from the paired temporal glands located on the head between the lateral edge of the eye and the base of the ear.\nThe gestation period is 18\u201322 months, and the cow gives birth to one calf, only occasionally twins. The calf is fully developed by the 19th month, but stays in the womb to grow so that it can reach its mother to feed. At birth, the calf weighs about 100 kg (220 lb), and is suckled for up to three years. Once a female gives birth, she usually does not breed again until the first calf is weaned, resulting in a four to five-year birth interval. Females stay on with the herd, but mature males are chased away.\nAsian elephants reach adulthood at 17 years of age in both sexes. Average elephant life expectancy is 60 years in the wild and 80 in captivity, although this has been exaggerated in the past.\nGeneration length of the Asian elephant is 22 years.\nFemales produce sex pheromones. A principal component thereof, (Z)-7-dodecen-1-yl acetate, has also been found to be a sex pheromone in numerous species of insects.\nThreats\nThe pre-eminent threats to the Asian elephant today are the loss, degradation and fragmentation of its habitat, which leads to increasing conflicts between humans and elephants. Asian elephants are poached for ivory and a variety of other products including meat and leather. The demand for elephant skin has risen due to it being an increasingly-common ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine.\nHuman\u2013elephant conflict\nOne of the major instigators of human\u2013wildlife conflict in general is competition for space. This is especially true for wild Asian elephants, which require relatively large territories to live in. Destruction of forests through logging, encroachment, slash-and-burn, shifting cultivation, and monoculture tree plantations are major threats to the survival of elephants. Human\u2013elephant conflicts occur when elephants raid crops of shifting cultivators in fields, which are scattered over a large area interspersed with forests. Depredation in human settlements is another major area of human\u2013elephant conflict occurring in small forest pockets, encroachments into elephant habitat, and on elephant migration routes. However, studies in Sri Lanka indicate that traditional slash-and-burn agriculture may create optimal habitat for elephants by creating a mosaic of successional-stage vegetation. Populations inhabiting small habitat fragments are much more liable to come into conflict with humans.\nHuman-elephant conflict can be categorised into:\nultimate causes including growing human population, large-scale development projects and poor top-down governance;\nproximate causes including habitat loss due to deforestation, disruption of elephant migratory routes, expansion of agriculture and illegal encroachment into protected areas.\nDevelopment such as border fencing along the India-Bangladesh border has become a major impediment to the free movement of elephants. In Assam, more than 1,150 humans and 370 elephants died as a result of human-elephant conflict between 1980 and 2003. In India alone, over 400 people are killed by elephants every year, and 0.8 to 1 million hectares are damaged, affecting at least 500,000 families across the country. Moreover, elephants are known to destroy crops worth up to US$2\u20133 million annually. This has major impacts on the welfare and livelihoods of local communities, as well as the future conservation of this species. In countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, the Asian elephant is one of the most feared wild animals, even though they are less deadly than other local animals such as venomous snakes (which were estimated to claim more than 30 times more lives in Sri Lanka than elephants). As a whole, Asian elephants display highly sophisticated and sometimes unpredictable behaviour. Most untamed elephants try to avoid humans, but if they are caught off guard by any perceived physical threat, including humans, they will likely charge. This is especially true of males in musth and of females with young. Gunfire and other similar methods of deterring, which are known to be effective against many kinds of wild animals including tigers, may or may not work with elephants, and can even worsen the situation. Elephants that have been abused by humans in the past often become \"rogue elephants\", which regularly attack people with no provocation.\nPoaching\nFor ivory\nThe demand for ivory during the 1970s and 1980s, particularly in East Asia, led to rampant poaching and the serious decline of elephants in both Africa and Asia. In Thailand, the illegal trade in live elephants and ivory still flourishes. Although the amount of ivory being openly sold has decreased substantially since 2001, Thailand still has one of the largest and most active black markets for ivory seen anywhere in the world. Tusks from Thai poached elephants also enter the market; between 1992 and 1997 at least 24 male elephants were killed for their tusks.\nUp to the early 1990s, Vietnamese ivory craftsmen used exclusively Asian elephant ivory from Vietnam and neighbouring Lao and Cambodia. Before 1990, there were few tourists and the low demand for worked ivory could be supplied by domestic elephants. Economic liberalisation and an increase in tourism raised both local and visitors' demands for worked ivory, which resulted in heavy poaching.\nFor skin\nThe skin of the Asian elephant is used as an ingredient in Chinese medicine as well as in the manufacture of ornamental beads. The practice has been aided by China's State Forestry Administration (SFA), which has issued licences for the manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products containing elephant skin, thereby making trading legal. In 2010, four skinned elephants were found in a forest in Myanmar; 26 elephants were killed by poachers in 2013 and 61 in 2016. According to the NGO Elephant Family, Myanmar is the main source of elephant skin, where a poaching crisis has developed rapidly since 2010.\nHandling methods\nYoung elephants are captured and illegally imported to Thailand from Myanmar for use in the tourism industry; calves are used mainly in amusement parks and are trained to perform various stunts for tourists.\nThe calves are often subjected to a 'breaking in' process, which may involve being tied up, confined, starved, beaten and tortured; as a result, two-thirds may perish. Handlers use a technique known as the training crush, in which \"handlers use sleep-deprivation, hunger, and thirst to \"break\" the elephants' spirit and make them submissive to their owners\"; moreover, handlers drive nails into the elephants' ears and feet.\nDisease\nSee Elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus.\nConservation\nThe Asian elephant is listed on CITES Appendix I. It is a quintessential flagship species, deployed to catalyze a range of conservation goals, including habitat conservation at landscape scales, generating public awareness on conservation issues, and mobilisation as a popular cultural icon both in India and the West.\nThe World Elephant Day is celebrated on 12 August since 2012. Events are organized to divulge information and to engage people about the problems that the Asian elephant is facing. August has been established as the Asian Elephant Awareness Month by zoos and conservation partners in the United States.\nIn China, Asian elephants are under first-level protection. Yunnan province has 11 national and regional nature reserves. In total, the covered protected area in China is about 510,000 km2 (200,000 sq mi). In 2020, the population of Asian elephants in Yunnan was estimated at around 300 individuals. As conflicts between humans and wild elephants have emerged around protected areas in the last years, the prefecture of Xishuangbanna built food bases and planted bananas and bamboo to create a better habitat.\nIn Thailand, Salakpra Wildlife Sanctuary and Than Thanlod National Park are protected areas hosting around 250-300 elephants, according to figures from 2013. In recent years the National Park has faced issues due to encroachment and over-exploitation.\nIn India, the National Board of Wildlife did a recommendation, allowing coal mining in the Dehing Patkai elephant reserve in April 2020. The decision raised concerns between students and environmental activists who launched an online campaign to stop the project.\nIn captivity\nRhythmic swaying behaviour is not reported in free ranging wild elephants and may be symptomatic of psychological disorders.\nAbout half of the global zoo elephant population is kept in European zoos, where they have about half the median life span of conspecifics in protected populations in range countries. This discrepancy is clearest in Asian elephants: infant mortality is twice that seen in Burmese timber camps, and adult survivorship in zoos has not improved significantly in recent years. One risk factor for Asian zoo elephants is being moved between institutions, with early removal from the mother tending to have additional adverse effects. Another risk factor is being born into a zoo rather than being imported from the wild, with poor adult survivorship in zoo-born Asians apparently being conferred prenatally or in early infancy. Likely causes for compromised survivorship is stress and/or obesity. Foot problems are commonly observed in captives elephants. These are related to lack of exercise, long hours standing on hard substrates, and contamination resulting from standing in their dung. Many of the problems are treatable. However, mistreatment may lead to serious disability or death.\nDemographic analysis of captive Asian elephants in North America indicates that the population is not self-sustaining. First year mortality is nearly 30 per cent, and fecundity is extremely low throughout the prime reproductive years. Data from North American and European regional studbooks from 1962 to 2006 were analysed for deviation of the birth and juvenile death sex ratio. Of 349 captive calves born, 142 died prematurely. They died within one month of birth, major causes being stillbirth and infanticide by either the calf's mother or by one of the exhibition mates. The sex ratio of stillbirths in Europe was found to have a tendency for excess of males.\nIn culture\nElephants are used for safari tourism in some Asian countries\nAt this elephant training camp, captive elephants are taught to handle logs.\nBones of Asian elephants excavated at Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley indicate that they were tamed in the Indus Valley Civilization and used for work. Decorated elephants are also depicted on seals and were modelled in clay.\nThe Asian elephant became a siege engine, a mount in war, a status symbol, a beast of burden, and an elevated platform for hunting during historical times in South Asia.\nAsian elephants have been captured from the wild and tamed for use by humans. Their ability to work under instruction makes them particularly useful for carrying heavy objects. They have been used particularly for timber-carrying in jungle areas. Other than their work use, they have been used in war, in ceremonies, and for carriage. It is reported that war elephants are still in use by the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) to take control of Kachin State in northern Myanmar from Myanmar's military. The KIA use about four dozen elephants to carry supplies.\nThe Asian elephant plays an important part in the culture of the subcontinent and beyond, being featured prominently in the Panchatantra fables and the Buddhist Jataka tales. They play a major role in Hinduism: the god Ganesha's head is that of an elephant, and the \"blessings\" of a temple elephant are highly valued. Elephants are frequently used in processions where the animals are adorned with festive outfits.\nThe Asian elephant is depicted in several Indian manuscripts and treatises. Notable amongst these is the Matanga Lila (elephant sport) of Nilakantha. The manuscript Hastividyarnava is from Assam in northeast India.\nIn the Burmese, Thai and Sinhalese animal and planetary zodiac, the Asian elephant, both tusked and tuskless, are the fourth and fifth animal zodiacs of the Burmese, the fourth animal zodiac of the Thai, and the second animal zodiac of the Sinhalese people of Sri Lanka. Similarly, the elephant is the twelfth animal zodiac in the Dai animal zodiac of the Dai people in southern China.\nSee also\nReferences\nFurther reading"}

Maybe it\u2019s their huge size, or the gentle intelligence in their eyes, or their slow, somber movements. There\u2019s something timeless about them.\nWhatever the reason, elephants are some of the most beloved of all animals. People travel halfway around the world just to be near them, and they feature prominently in the art and mythology of Africa and Asia. There\u2019s nothing else quite like them.\nLet\u2019s find out more about these (usually) gentle giants\u2026\nWhat Is an Elephant?\nElephants are mammals in the family Elephantidae, which consists of two main groups: Asian elephants (genus Elephas) and African elephants (genus Loxodonta). There are three living species of elephant: The African bush elephant, African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Elephants are known for their large size, trunks (an extension of the nose and upper lip) and tusks (modified teeth).\nThe elephant family also includes dozens of extinct species, such as the woolly mammoth and the North American mastodon.\nThe African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana) is the largest living land animal.\nStanding 10 feet / 3 meters at the shoulder, the African bush elephant dwarfs its close cousin, the 7-foot / 2.1-meter-tall African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis).\nAfrican bush elephants can weigh as much as 22,000 lbs. / 9980 kg\u2026 that\u2019s 5 times the weight of a pickup truck, or almost 200 times the weight of an average human!\nThe Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) is smaller than the African bush elephant, but larger than the African forest elephant.\nAsian elephants stand about 9 feet / 2.74 meters at the shoulder, and have a very different appearance from their African cousins. The Asian elephant has much smaller ears, and the top of its head is bulbous compared to the flat-headed appearance of African elephants.\nThe largest elephant ever recorded was an African bush elephant that stood 13 feet / 3.96 meters at the shoulder, towering over ordinary elephants by several feet. His name was Henry and he lived in Angola, southwestern Africa. His preserved body still stands in the rotunda of the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC, where he greets millions of visitors each year.\nElephants survive on a low-nutrient diet of grasses and mature leaves, which have to be digested for a long time to extract nutrients.\nBecause their diet is not very nutritious, they have to eat a lot: in zoos, elephants may eat as much as 500 pounds / 227 kg of hay in a single day.\nElephant Evolution & Prehistoric Elephants\nAn elephant\u2019s body is a relic of the Miocene, the geologic period dominated by large mammals. During the Miocene, there were dozens of elephant species living all over the world, from the steaming wetlands of equatorial Asia to the icy tundra of northern Europe.\nThe most famous prehistoric elephant is the woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) of Ice Age Europe. These shaggy, slope-backed animals roamed the tundra under the shadow of the polar glaciers, where they used their tusks to scrape away ice and tough, frozen soil to get at the buried vegetation. Their populations declined as the ice age ended, and the added pressure of human hunting drove them to extinction.\nIn North America around the same time, the American mastodon (Mammut americanum) inhabited wetlands and scrubby forests from Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico.\nMastodons differed from mammoths in the shape of their teeth and the habitat they lived in: mammoths lived in much more open environments, like plains and steppes, whereas mastodons preferred more closed woodlands and wetlands. Mammoths lived all over the world, but mastodons were restricted to North America.\nThe largest prehistoric elephant was the steppe mammoth, which inhabited northern Europe during the rapid climate fluctuations of the Middle Pleistocene. Adapted for extreme cold, it had a thick coat and towered over 15 feet / 4.57 m. A grown human could have walked right between their legs and under the belly without bending over.\nElephants are so unusual that no one is really sure who their closest relatives are. Based on DNA evidence, the best guess right now is that their closest cousin may be the Sirenians, or sea cows: animals like manatees and dugongs.\nAnother strong contender, amazingly, is the hyrax, a tiny rabbit-like creature that lives in Africa.\nAlthough elephants look a bit like rhinos and hippos, they are not close relatives.\nWhy did elephants get so big? The most obvious advantage of large size is that it helps keep the elephant safe from predators. Elephants share their habitat with some of the largest predators on land: tigers in Asia and lions in Africa. By growing so massive, elephants make themselves intimidating to all but the boldest of the big cats.\nAnother advantage of size is that it allows elephants to reach higher than other animals in their search for food. That can be a big help for bush elephants, who live in relatively dry areas where drought is a major concern.\nThere\u2019s one more advantage of being big, and it has to do with digestion. A big body (with a big belly) can digest low-quality plants that would just pass right through a smaller digestive tract. Animals that eat leaves, grasses, and other nutrient-poor foods tend to get much bigger than their fruit- or seed-eating cousins. Gorillas, cows, and elephants are all examples of this trend.\nElephant Trunk & Tusk Facts\nApart from its size, an elephant\u2019s most striking feature is its trunk. The trunk evolved as an extension of the nose, but calling the elephant\u2019s trunk its \u201cnose\u201d would be a little like calling a human hand a kind of fin. Sure, hands evolved from fins, but the hand has evolved to do things no fin could ever do.\nScientists aren\u2019t sure how the trunk originally evolved. It may have been a kind of snorkel, allowing prehistoric elephants to breathe while they searched for submerged food in a semi-aquatic environment. Or it might have evolved to manipulate objects like food and obstacles.\nToday, the trunk serves a wide range of purposes in the lives of elephants. They use the trunk like an arm to pluck grasses and strip leaves to satisfy their constant hunger. They also use the trunk to drink, sucking up huge jets of water and then spraying it into their mouths (or over their bodies when they need a bath).\nThe trunk is also a sensitive probe that elephants use to explore objects around them, much the same way humans use their hands. But unlike a hand, a trunk provides smell information as well as touch.\nAfter the trunk, the next thing you\u2019ll probably notice about an elephant is its tusks. The tusks are massive front teeth that continue growing throughout an elephant\u2019s lifetime.\nBoth male and female African elephants have tusks, but tusks are only present in male Asian elephants.\nAfrican elephants mainly use their tusks for digging: by rooting around with their tusks, elephants can find buried roots or water sources that other animals can\u2019t reach. They also dig for mud, which contains nutrients not found in the elephant\u2019s tough plant-based diet. This mud-eating behavior, called geophagy, is an active area of research in elephants and other animals that do it.\nJust like humans, who can be left or right-handed, elephants seem to have a \u201cdominant tusk.\u201d Some favor the right, others the left.\nTusks are also powerful weapons. Bull elephants sometimes compete with each other for dominance, using their tusks to grapple and butt just like stags would do with their antlers. In Asian elephants, male competition is the main purpose of the tusks, which is why females have lost them.\nElephant Intelligence & Behavior\nElephants are some of the most intelligent creatures on earth. Their brains are massive \u2013 even bigger than the brains of the much larger-bodied humpback whale. More remarkable still, those brains develop extremely quickly as the animal grows, much like whales and primates but completely unlike other mammals.\nWith their oversized brains, elephants have some remarkable abilities. They\u2019re one of only a handful of animals that understand mirrors \u2013 they can recognize their own reflection and therefore understand, at the very least, that they have bodies similar to the bodies of their groupmates. Some scientists have speculated that elephants may even have a sense of self, of personal identity.\nElephants also excel at cooperation. In the wild, they form cooperative groups that can last for generations. In lab experiments, they can succeed at tasks that require the animals to wait and coordinate their movements \u2013 tasks that require the elephants not only to trust and cooperate with one another, but also to understand one another\u2019s roles.\nElephants form flexible groups that vary in size depending on local conditions. In dry areas, they may range with a small family group of 5 to 7 individuals. During the rainy season, when food is abundant, the groups come together and may swell to 30 or more members.\nWild elephant herds are led by a matriarch, an older female. Contrary to the popular myth, elephants do forget things from time to time, but they have long lives and long memories. Older matriarchs know where to find food and water throughout the year, and other members of the herd defer to the most well-informed individual. If only human groups were so wise.\nMale elephants can be aggressive, so they often travel alone or with small all-male \u201cbachelor groups.\u201d They leave their mother\u2019s herd when they reach adulthood and often spend their whole lives in relative solitude.\nElephant Conservation\nIn addition to their overwhelming natural beauty, elephants play a crucial role in maintaining their ecosystem. All three elephant species are considered \u201ckeystone species\u201d, organisms whose extinction could lead to the collapse of the whole ecosystem.\nElephants are particularly important in maintaining the African savanna: by controlling the growth of woody plants, they keep the habitat open and suitable for smaller grazers like oryx and antelope.\nThe main threat to elephants is poaching. Historically, the ivory from elephants\u2019 tusks has been a valuable material for jewelry and decorations, almost like a biological gemstone.\nElephants\u2019 tusks are also used in some traditional medicines, though there is no scientific evidence that they have medicinal properties.\nThe international ivory trade has been banned since 1989, but there is still a market for elephant tusks.\nElephants also suffer from habitat fragmentation. These huge animals need to roam over huge areas, and human expansion has broken their habitat up into small pieces. A fence, town, or highway might not destroy the savanna outright, but it will interrupt elephant migration routes and cause their population to decline.\nFortunately, China \u2013 which historically was the main market for elephant ivory \u2013 enacted its own ban in 2018, which dramatically reduced demand. Elephant poaching is now less lucrative than it once was, and conservation experts are hopeful that this could lead to a rebound in elephant populations.\nFind Out More with Active Wild\nSources"}

In this article, we share more interesting facts about this animal.\nLast update: 06 January, 2020\nThe elephant is one of the largest mammals in the world and, in the terrestrial realm, it undoubtedly takes the top spot. This is a species that\u2019s a descendant of the mammoths and mastodons from the Ice Age.\nThis animal belongs to the group of pachyderms, which includes mammals that are herbivores, have thick and hard skin, are large, and weigh a lot. Thus, this group also includes rhinos, wild boar, and hippopotami.\nThe elephant and its characteristics\nBeyond its size, which can exceed 13 feet (4 meters), the elephant has other very striking physical characteristics. For example, it can weigh up to one ton. When a calf is born, it usually weighs about 220 pounds (100 kilograms).\nThe elephant is one of the oldest animals on the planet, and can live up to 70 years. In this regard, there was a case of a specimen in captivity that died at age 86! Other highly interesting characteristics of the elephant are:\nSpeed: Up to 34 mph (40 kph)\nUp to 34 mph (40 kph) Gestation period: 22 months.\n22 months. Reproductive age: From age 12 to 50\nIts trunk doesn\u2019t contain any bone, and is a very useful tool for elephants to collect food, make sounds, and identify smells. Their ears not only serve to detect sounds in their surroundings, but also to regulate their body temperature.\nDiet\nThe elephant is a herbivorous animal. Their diet consists of bark and leaves of both trees and shrubs, as well as herbs and fruits. It needs to feed for 16 hours a day to be able to survive. This means it can consume up to 551 pounds (250 kg) of food throughout this time.\nThe elephant\u2019s body can process only 50% of what it eats. Hence, it needs to feed slowly and progressively. However, to complete its diet, the elephant needs to rehydrate. In fact, it can drink up to 15 liters of water at once.\nIt should be noted that elephant calves spend up to four years feeding only on breast milk to grow and develop properly. Thus, this animal develops slowly but surely.\nBehavior\nThe elephant groups in herds with a matriarchal organization. In other words, the herd consists of young females and calves and is guided by the oldest female. Herds don\u2019t usually rotate their members and recognize each other for the rest of their lives. Males are independent except when they mate.\nWhen a specimen is already too old or sick, the herd tries to help it get up until the animal no longer can hold itself up. Then, the herd groups around it to try to help it. Once it dies, the other elephants manifest different behaviors, such as:\nRaising their trunk while remaining standing in a posture that denotes tension\nCaressing the body with its trunk and throwing dirt, leaves, or branches on the remains\nStaying with the body until it begins to decay\nThis animal keeps a constant and positive interaction with its herd. Females are particularly sociable with each other and usually show a lot of empathy. Also, they have a great sense of cooperation and fellowship, and try to protect each other.\nHabitat\nElephants usually always live near a source of water. Not only for drinking but also for bathing, as it allows them to protect their skin from the sun and heat. These mammals love to wallow in the mud and spray dust on themselves to counteract the effects of sunlight or insect bites.\nThe elephant needs a lot of space, and doesn\u2019t usually stay in the same place for long periods of time. These animals are nature\u2019s gardeners. When they migrate, they disperse seeds and this promotes the growth of vegetation in different areas.\nNow, depending on the species, the landscape varies. For example, African elephants live in tropical forests, grasslands, river valleys, swamps, and savannas, while Asian elephants live only in tropical forests. However, nowadays, many elephants have had to be placed in sanctuaries and protected areas.\nIn danger of extinction\nThe biggest threats to this species are humans, who continue to destroy their natural habitat or hunt for the ivory trade and other purposes. And despite the actions of activists and animal lovers, there\u2019s still a lot to be done regarding their protection. To raise awareness, August 12 was declared World Elephant Day.\nIt might interest you..."}

They\u2019re a little smaller than African elephants but can grow nine feet tall and weigh nearly six tons. That\u2019s heavier than two medium-size cars! Even newborns are on the hefty side, weighing some 200 pounds. Given their size it\u2019s no surprise that these guys are big on food. Adults can eat 300 pounds in one day, nearly 75 times what the average human eats! An Asian elephant\u2019s ideal meal includes roots, grasses, fruit, and bark.\nMuch of an Asian elephant\u2019s time is spent searching for grub. In fact the animal may travel 50 miles a day to find food. Asian elephants also enjoy taking dips in the water. To cool down their backsides, the animals will fill their trunks with water and spray it over themselves like a hose.\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\nSOCIAL NETWORK\nAsian elephants are gentle and super-social. Related females live with their young in herds. (Adult males go off on their own.) To communicate with each other they use rumbles, bellows, growls, and moans. Some of their vocalizations can be heard more than a mile away. Talk about a long-distance call!"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "90 Interesting Facts About Elephants - The Fact File", "url": "https://thefactfile.org/facts-about-elephants/", "text": "We may not always know or appreciate it but we are blessed to have elephants as the largest land animals. Intelligent and gentle, these giants have been around for millennia and while they are much admired and loved by some cultures, they do not always receive the respect and care they so deserve. Elephants are descended from an ancient elephant specie that walked the earth about 56 million years ago in Africa. This specie then traveled to other regions via land bridges. Floppy-eared, calm, equipped with an adorable trunk and cute tusks (well, at least some), elephants are beloved by many. Kids who love elephants find them fascinating because of their sheer size and gentle demeanor.\nInteresting facts about elephants\n1. The word elephant is derived from the Greek word, elaph, meaning ivory. Elephants are a member of the order Proboscidea, to which animals that have a trunk belong. They are the only living members of this order. It also includes extinct animals such as mammoths and mastodons.\n2. There are two types of elephants \u2013 the African elephant and the Asian elephant. The African elephant has two distinct species \u2013 the forest and the savanna elephants.\n3. Asian elephants have smaller ears than African elephants. The shape of the head also differentiate them. African elephants have round heads while Asian elephants sport a twin dome.\n4. Did you know that the average walking speed of an elephant is 4.5 miles per hour? And during an experiment, some elephants demonstrated that they could walk or run up to 15 mph. Considering their size, it is surprising how fast they can move. Now, this is an amazing fact about elephants that you can share with your friends and family.\n5. In a day, an elephant can drink 50 gallons of water and eat 220 pounds of food or 70,000 calories a day. They eat 12 to 18 hours a day.\n6. Elephants only digest about half of their food.\n7. The average elephant needs about 150 kg of food everyday. This is why they are constantly on their feet, roaming to search for more food.\n8. Since elephants eat a lot, they also produce a lot of dung. According to some estimates, they produce nearly 100 kilograms or 220 pounds of dung every day. Now, that is a lot of shit!\n9. The elephant dung itself is mostly fibre. And since paper is made from fibre, an elephant\u2019s one day excreta can be used to make roughly 115 sheets of paper. This process also helps reduce deforestation.\n10. A group of elephants is commonly called a herd, or less commonly, a parade!\n11. Did you notice their trunk? Well, learn that their trunk is actually the fusion of the nose and upper lip.\n12. Although elephants seem to drink using their trunks, they do not actually imbibe water through it. Instead, they siphon the water using their trunk, then pour it into their mouths.\n13. Elephant trunks are made up of about 150,000 muscles. This is why their trunks are quite flexible and capable of doing plenty of things. They don\u2019t only smell with their trunks (elephant trunks have nostrils at the end) but they also use it to touch and feel objects and other elephants.\n14. An elephant\u2019s trunk is similar to our fingers in that he can do certain tasks with it. He can pick up small objects such as peanuts using his trunk. He can then break the shell, blow it away by releasing air through the nostrils at the end of his trunk, then bring the peanut to his mouth to eat using his trunk. And yes, some elephants even learned to paint by holding a brush with their trunk.\n15. Elephants are vertebrates who are warm-blooded and produce milk to nurse their babies.\n16. The elephant is a mammal and it is the only one of its kind who cannot jump. And they are the only mammals in the world who cannot do so. Note that elephants always keep their one leg on the ground even while running whereas other mammals like rhinos and hippos cannot jump but they can have all the four feet off the ground at the same time when they run.\n17. If elephants seem cool and collected, it is probably because their pulse is slow at just 27 beats a minute.\n18. Elephants have 26 teeth in all, 24 of these are molars and the remaining two are the tusks. Molars are in six sets of four, as one set is worn down it gets replaced by the next set pushing in from behind.\n19. It is interesting to note that elephants are gifted with 6 sets of molars in a lifetime. Due to grinding and chewing plant material, their set of teeth wear down, and the next set pushes through.\n20. Elephants have better peripheral vision. Because of the position of the elephant\u2019s eyes on his head, he could see objects to the sides and rear better than objects in front. When he\u2019s walking and exploring territory, he instead uses his trunk to feel what is ahead of him.\n21. Elephants have a third eyelid. The upper and lower eyelids of an elephant move horizontally, up and down. His third eyelid, however, moves vertically over his eyes. This eyelid helps protect his eyes when he is bathing, feeding, or just having fun in the dust.\n22. Did you know that baby elephants can drink up to 3 gallons of their mother\u2019s milk every day? And the calves drink their mother\u2019s milk for about two years, sometimes longer.\n23. Elephant skin is about 2.5 cm thick. African elephants have more wrinkles than Asian elephants. Skin folds help retain moisture and keep the animals cool, which means that either specie has evolved to adapt to its habitat.\n24. Elephants do have hair all over. Elephants may look bald from a distance but they actually have hair. It may not be as thick as those in other animals, however. Asian elephants also have more hair than African elephants. The elephant\u2019s bristly hair helps them cool down. If they had thicker hair, they would have a harder time staying cool where they live.\n25. Elephants purr. Elephants communicate vocally and they also produce a sound that is similar to a cat\u2019s purr, although the elephant\u2019s noise is more of a soft, low rumble. This is their way of talking and yes, singing.\n26. Elephants rumble. This means that they communicate through vibrations. It is believed that elephants have special receptors in their feet and trunk. When in distress, elephants rumble and this low frequency rumbling generates seismic waves in the ground that can travel up to 20 miles along the surface of earth. This activity also helps them detect stress from a herd many miles away.\n27. Elephants can smell water up to 12 miles.\n28. Did you know that elephants are naturally born swimmers and can swim for hours while being completely submerged in water? Their body mass allows them to enjoy good buoyancy and float in the water or, if they choose, submerge themselves for a dive. Their trunk helps them breath.\n29. An elephant\u2019s trunk can hold more than 8 litres of water at a time.\n30. Elephants are herbivores.\n31. When it comes to tusks, only Asian male elephants can grow tusks while both male and female African elephants do. Note that not all elephants, Asian or African, develop tusks as adults.\n32. There are only an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 African elephants living in the wild and they are considered endangered. About 90% of these animals were decimated due to poaching.\n33. An elephant\u2019s ears help dissipate heat. Since Africa has a higher temperature compared to Asia, African elephants evolved to develop larger ears.\n34. An African elephant\u2019s ear is six feet from top to bottom and five feet across. This enormous size of their ears is because of the fact that they help keep the elephant cool in high temperature. The blood circulating through the veins in the ears also gets cooled when elephants flap their ears. This cooled blood re-circulates through the animal\u2019s body and helps regulate its core body temperature. Now, you understand the science behind the size of its ears!\n35. Elephants give themselves dust baths to remove parasites from their skin.\n36. The African elephant brain is three times larger than the human brain. It is estimated that there are 257 billion neurons in the brain of the world\u2019s largest land mammal. However, a large concentration of the neurons (97.5%) is found in the cerebellum.\n37. Did you know that in spite of the fact that elephants are the largest animals on land, they are very afraid of bees? They are so terrified of the tiny insect that they will flap their ears, make noises and stir up dust when they sense the buzz of a bee hive. This fact was used productively by African farmers to keep their farms protected from elephants.\n38. The United States banned commercial importation of ivory in 1989.\n39. Elephants are intelligent and self-aware as well. Researchers discovered that elephants could recognize themselves in mirrors.\n40. Elephants show affection to the other members of their herd by stroking other elephants head and back with their trunk to console or comfort them.\n41. Lawrence Anthony, who was an environmentalist and an international conservationist, from South Africa, was able to communicate with a herd of elephants and got them to a protected reserve when they were in distress and were afraid of other humans. The elephants settled in the reserve and led their lives while Anthony was bonding with them and taking care of them. However, sadly in 2012, after a sudden heart attack, Anthony passed away. And to everyone\u2019s surprise, the elephants marched from one corner of the reserve to the other, and came to Anthony\u2019s home and stood outside of it. Their presence outside of his home signified that they were mourning the demise of their friend; and after two days, they went back to their place in the reserve. No one knows for sure why this happened, but it is understood that the animal has the ability to build an emotional bond even with human beings.\n42. African savanna elephants grow larger than forest elephants.\n43. African herds are matriarchal. Each herd is led by the oldest female in the group.\n44. Young and adolescent males stay with the herd until they are about 12 or 15 years old. They then leave to live solitary lives. They may sometimes form a small herd with other males but these groups are temporary.\n45. Males in small groups also form a social structure determined by a hierarchy. The leader is usually the oldest and strongest. They are the ones that protect the herd. The more docile ones are those that help stabilize the group.\n46. Bull (male) elephant groups are nomadic. This allows them to maximize their ability to reproduce, since they can potentially associate with several different herds in a year. A bull can potentially mate with 30 females in just one year.\n47. The smallest family unit of an elephant consists of about three members, always led by the oldest female. The older the female is, the higher her rank in the herd.\n48. Older females help take care of the calves in the group. The more older females there are in the group, the better the chances that the calf will survive.\n49. It is possible for an elephant family unit to meet and bond with other units. They may be related or unrelated and usually congregate to mingle, interact, and feed together. The usual meeting places are watering holes.\n50. In regions that have more food, elephants form larger family units. In regions that have less food, they have smaller units.\n51. To determine dominance among bulls, they play-fight or spar. Often, larger, older bulls win due to their strength.\n52. Contrary to what some people believe, elephants are not territorial animals because they have a wide home range.\n53. Elephants have a gland between the ear and the eye, just beneath the surface of their skin. This gland is called musth. Each year, these glands secrete a substance and becomes inflamed. When male elephants are in musth, they exhibit erratic, unpredictable, and dominant behavior.\n54. Bull elephants do not experience musth at the same time as others. In short, they do not have a musth season. When a bull elephant is in musth, other bulls avoid a confrontation with him.\n55. An elephant in musth may rub itself against a tree as a way to scent-mark it. This is a means to signal other males about his current status.\n56. If elephants seem to laugh and smile while bathing, it\u2019s because it is a pleasurable activity for them. Bathing helps get rid of pests and parasites.\n57. Elephants usually sleep standing up but they may also spend half of their sleeping hours lying on their side. They are noisy sleepers but could get by with just four hours of dream time.\n58. If you see an elephant toppling a tree, it\u2019s likely a young bull testing its strength. Bulls are so strong that they can push and uproot an 18-inch diameter tree using just their trunk, head, or a leg.\n59. African elephants are threatened mostly by poaching. Asian elephants are threatened by habitat loss and conflict with humans.\n. . . continue reading on the next page"}

That is if they are awake because koalas sleep up to 20 hours per day.\nLearn more about koalas.\n#17. Animal Facts: Some Sharks Glow in the Dark\nSilhouettes of people in an aquarium looking at a big shark through the glass. Sharks have special electroreceptor organs that allow the shark to sense electromagnetic fields and temperature shifts in the ocean. Anna Kucherova/Shutterstock.com\nThere are at least 15 species of deep-sea sharks that produce light with special cells on their underbellies. These sharks live as deep in the ocean as sunlight ever reaches. Marine biologists theorize that the sharks use the eerie green light to hide from other marine animals swimming underneath them. The kitefin, which grows up to 6-feet long, is the longest light-producing animal, called a bioluminescent vertebrate, in the world. Scientists, however, know that some species of giant squid also produce their own light.\nLearn more about sharks.\n#16. Animal Facts: Slow Lorises are the Only Venomous Primate\nSlow lorises may be slow, but they can travel around 8 kilometers in one night. Nachaliti/Shutterstock.com\nThere are more than 200,000 venomous animals in the world. The only one, however, that is a member of the primate family is the slow loris. Only five mammal species in the world are venomous, but the slow loris is unique because it often bites other slow lorises. In order to produce its venom, this primate raises its arms before licking the underpart of its upper arm. The venom, containing the same compound as found in cat\u2019s dander and other substances, causes the skin to rot.

Simultaneously, the frog\u2019s liver produces large amounts of glucose, which props the reptile\u2019s cells up. The process dehydrates the frog\u2019s body so that t can stay hidden under a leaf when the weather gets cold. Brain and heart activity stop. Then, when the weather warms up, water slowly returns to the frog\u2019s bloodstream. Then, its organs start working again, and the frog resumes his hopping.\nLearn more about wood frogs.\n#13.

When a horned lizard feels threatened, these muscles contract, stopping blood from flowing back to the animal\u2019s heart. Then, if the lizard still feels threatened, it contracts the muscles more, causing blood to squirt from the lizard\u2019s eyes.\nLearn more about horned lizards.\n#10. Animal Facts: Elephants Have a Specific Human Danger Call\nAfrican bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), also known as the African savanna elephant herd drinking at a waterhole, in the Kruger National Park, South Africa.\nIt is a well-known fact that elephants have specific sounds that they make to communicate with each other. Researchers in Kenya played a recording near resting elephants of people talking in the local language. The elephants repeatedly made a low rumbling sound, and either grew restless or moved away. Then, the researchers created a recording of the low rumbling sound and played it to a different group of resting elephants. They immediately grew restless and moved away from the area, even though no humans were nearby. The rumble sounds very similar to the call the African elephants make when bees are nearby to human ears. Still, with the bee rumble, the elephants violently shake their heads while no head shaking is observed with the human rumble.\nLearn more about elephants.\n#9. Animal Facts: Dogs Smell the Passage of Time\nA beautiful Boerboel lying in the grass. Dogs are about as intelligent as a two-year-old. Marina Plevako/Shutterstock.com\nDogs can predict when it is time for you to return home as long as it\u2019s a predictable occurrence, such as going to work or home each day. When you leave home, your scent is strong in the house. Over time, your scent begins to fade. According to researcher Alexandria Horowitz, dogs can tell when it is time for you to return by how much of your scent is left in the house.\nLearn more about dogs.\n#8. Animal Facts: Reindeer Eyes Turn Colors Depending on the Season\nIn North America reindeer are also called caribou. Both the males and females grow antlers.\nA shiny, mirrored layer behind the retina in the reindeer\u2019s eyes changes colors based on the season. When it\u2019s summer, the layer, called the tapetum lucidum, is a golden color, but as winter arrives, it turns blue. It is the same part that causes many animal\u2019s eyes to seem to glow. Scientists theorize that it turns blue in the winter to take advantage of any available light as they often live in areas where there is no sunlight in the winter.\nLearn more about reindeer.\n#7. Animal Facts: Dolphins Get High From Pufferfish\nA charming dolphin baby swims with his mom in a pool. They are not only the friendliest or caring creatures but also the most intelligent ones. Elena Larina/Shutterstock.com\nAccording to Smithsonian Magazine, dolphins play gently with pufferfish to get poked, causing the pufferfish to send out a toxic substance. In small enough amounts, this substance puts dolphins in a drug-induced trance.\nLearn more about dolphins.\n#6. Animal Facts: Flamingos Can Only Eat With Their Heads Upside Down\nFlying flamingos over the water of Natron Lake. The word Flamingo comes from the Spanish and Latin word \u2018flamenco\u2019 which means fire, it refers to the bright colors of the bird\u2019s feathers. Sergey Uryadnikov/Shutterstock.com\nFlamingoes must turn their heads upside down to eat because their mouth acts like a large sieve. Therefore, they need to capture the food in comb-like extensions on its beak using its tongue.\nLearn more about flamingos.\n#5. Animal Facts: A Female Ferret Will Die if it Goes Into Heat and Cannot Find a Mate\nEndangered Black-footed Ferret enjoying some sunshine. Kerry Hargrove/Shutterstock.com\nA female ferret reaches sexual maturity during its first spring. If a ferret goes into heat and cannot find a mate, she will eventually die of aplastic anemia, where the body stops producing new blood cells. This can lead to a prolonged, painful death from infections.\nLearn more about ferrets.\n#4. Animal Facts: Penguins Do a Thousand Animal Wave\nEmperor Penguins with a chick. The black and white \u201ctuxedo\u201d look donned by most penguin species is a clever camouflage called countershading.\nWeather conditions, like 200 miles per hour winds and \u201358-degree weather, make it hard for emperor penguins to survive Antarctic winters. Therefore, they huddle together in groups of up to 1,000 birds so that they can rely on each other\u2019s body warmth to stay alive. When a single penguin moves as little as 0.8-inches, the whole group moves the same amount to keep the huddle together. This little bit of movement typically happens every 6-to-12 seconds.\nLearn more about penguins.\n#3. Animal Facts: Worker Fire Ants Take 250 Power Naps Daily\nFire ant colonies are typically comprised of female worker ants and one queen, who is responsible for laying the eggs. wnarong/Shutterstock.com\nResearchers have discovered that worker fire ants take up to 250 power naps daily. Each nap lasts only about a minute. About 20% of a colony is asleep all the time. By comparison, queens slept about 90 times a day for an average of 6 minutes.\nLearn more about ants.\n#2. Animal Facts: Polar Bears Have Black Skin\nPolar bear with cub. Because they spend most of their lives on the sea ice of the Arctic Ocean depending on the ocean for their food and habitat, polar bears are the only bear species to be considered marine mammals.\nPolar bears have black skin to help them absorb as much heat as possible. Their fur is not white but consists of transparent, hollow tubes of keratin. These tubes scatter the light so that we perceive most polar bears to be white. Each tube helps pass light closer to the bear\u2019s skin, where he can use it to stay warm.\nLearn more about polar bears.\n#1. Animal Facts: A Baby Kangaroo is the Size of a Grape\nIf a joey is still in the pouch of a pregnant kangaroo, the younger sibling can enter a dormant state called embryonic diapause. IntoTheWorld/Shutterstock.com\nWhen a baby kangaroo, called a joey, is born, he is about the size of a grape. He travels unaided through his mom\u2019s fur until he reaches her pouch, where he will stay for the next 10 months. He is so weak that he cannot suck, so the mother pumps the milk down his throat.\nLearn more about kangaroos.\nNext Up: Top 10 Most Colorful Animals in the World"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephant Facts: 30 Incredible Pieces of Trivia | Best Life", "url": "https://bestlifeonline.com/elephant-facts/", "text": "It's no secret that elephants are extraordinary animals. These magnificent beasts have an impressive size, are some of the smartest creatures on the planet, and, of course, they have huge floppy ears that make them insanely adorable. But it turns out, there's way more to learn about elephants than what you already know.\nFor example, were you aware that about 2,000 pounds of an elephant's hefty weight is comprised of its skin alone? Or that they're one of the only animals that can identify themselves in a mirror? Read on, because the more you learn about these gentle giants, the more smitten you'll be with them.\n1 Elephants can tell your gender, age, and ethnicity from your voice.\nIn the case of elephants, big brains really do mean greater intelligence. According to findings published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2014, these creatures are so clever that they can determine ethnicity, gender, and even the age of a human from acoustic cues that they can pick up in their voices. The researchers believe that elephants use this incredible skill to identify possible human threats and adjust their behavior accordingly.\n2 Some elephants can recognize themselves in a mirror.\nElephants aren't only good at recognizing human voices, they can also recognize their own reflection. In another study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2006, scientists found that Asian elephants know that they're looking at themselves while gazing into a mirror, a level of self-awareness that only highly intelligent animals\u2014like dolphins, apes, and humans\u2014are known to display. Lookin' good, guys!\n3 Elephants can \"hear\" with their feet.\nElephants may have massive ears, but they can also pick up on noises via their feet, which register low-frequency rumbles caused by other animals up to 20 miles away, according to researchers at Stanford University.\n\"We think they're sensing these underground vibrations through their feet,\" explained study author Caitlin O'Connell-Rodwell, an affiliate of the Stanford Center for Conservation Biology. \"Seismic waves could travel from their toenails to the ear via bone conduction, or through somatosensory receptors in the foot similar to ones found in the trunk.\"\n4 They make their own sunscreen.\nIf you spend any amount of time outside under the scorching sun, you know how important it is to protect yourself from harmful UV rays with sunscreen. And elephants, who live in some of the sunniest places on the planet, know it too. They save themselves from painful burns by using sand as a natural sunscreen to cover up their skin, according to Smithsonian. They'll even cover their young in sand while they're sleeping in order to keep them safe. Aww!\n5 Elephants can turn pink.\nMost elephants have grey skin, even though it sometimes appears brown thanks to the reddish sand they cover themselves with for protection. However, when Asian elephants get older, they can start to lose pigment in their skin; as a result, parts of their bodies, such as their trunks, begin to turn pink.\nIt turns out though, that rosy color isn't exclusively for the elders: In 2009, a pink baby elephant was spotted in Botswana andt was believed to be an extremely rare albino African elephant.\n6 Just like humans are right- or left-handed, elephants are right- or left-tusked.\nElephants use their tusks\u2014which are actually a pair of the animal's upper incisors\u2014in all kinds of handy ways, from digging to fighting. But they use one more than the other. Yes, just like humans, elephants have one tusk that's more dominant. You can generally tell which is the animal's \"master tusk\" because it's often the shorter of the two, with a tip that's been rounded down by use, according to the McGill School of Computer Science.\n7 And their tusks never stop growing.\nAn elephant's tusks continue to grow throughout their lives\u2014and they grow a lot. According to McGill, the tusks of an adult male grow around seven inches every year. So if you spot an elephant with particularly long tusks, that can be an indicator of old age.\n8 They use \"cologne\" to find a mate.\nScientists believe that when male elephants are in \"musth,\" a period of high levels of testosterone, they produce pheromones to attract females. Well-known elephant researcher Joyce Poole suggests that the animals might flap their ears in order to fan this \"elephant cologne\" as far as possible, according to McGill.\n9 Female elephants only get pregnant once every five years.\nWhen female elephants are between 12 and 15 years old, they're at an age when they're ready to mate and will continue to do so until they're around 50. However, they don't get pregnant every year. In fact, most elephants will only give birth once every five years. But there's a very specific reason for that\u2026\n10 And their pregnancies lasts for nearly two years.\nWhen human parents are waiting for a new baby to arrive, nine months can seem like a very long time. But that's nothing compared to how long a female elephant\u2014which is also called a cow\u2014has to wait before she gives birth to her little one. Each pregnancy lasts just about 22 months, which is the longest gestation period for any mammal, according to research published in Proceedings of the Royal Society.\n11 Male elephants can stay with their moms for up to two decades.\nMale elephants tend to live on their own or with small groups of other males. But that's only when they're adults. From the time they're born until they're teenagers, anywhere from 10 to 20 years old, they stay with their mothers and live with a group of female elephants.\n12 One female elephant raises all the babies in the herd.\nThe oldest elephant in a group of females is deemed the matriarch, who assumes a leadership role in the herd. She's responsible for taking care of the offspring and making decisions that affect the survival of the group, such as fleeing danger and seeking out food sources.\n13 An elephant's trunk contains around 100,000 muscles.\nElephants accomplish a ton with their trunks, from delivering water to their mouths, to stripping leaves off of trees, to making their signature trumpet-like sound. How do they get it all done? They're very buff, it turns out. An elephant's trunk has around 100,000 different muscles, National Geographic reports.\n14 And those trunks can hold more than two gallons of water.\nElephants don't actually use their trunks like a straw, as some people might believe. Instead, the animals suck water up into their trunks and then spray it into their mouths to quench their thirst. It's a pretty effective process judging by the fact that adult elephants can hold around 2.25 gallons (or 8.5 liters) of water in their trunks.\n15 Elephants have a \"finger\" on their trunk.\nOn the tip of an Asian elephant's trunk is an extension that gives the appendage its dexterous ability and allows the animal to grasp things and pick them up much like humans do with their hands. That's why this tip is referred to as the trunk's \"finger.\"\n16 African elephants have ears shaped like the continent of Africa.\nIf you ever come across an elephant and aren't sure which type you've encountered, simply look at their ears, according to National Geographic. African elephants, the largest elephant species, have ears that are roughly shaped like the continent they call home. Asian elephants are slightly smaller and happen to have ears that resemble India.\n17 Asian elephants are missing a toenail.\nBesides their ears, another way to ID an elephant is by looking at their back feet. Though both Asian and African elephants have five toes on each foot, Asian elephants tend to only have four toenails on their back feet, Smithsonian notes.\n18 Elephants may have developed a sixth toe.\nDespite the fact that some elephants only have four toenails, somewhere along the line, other elephants may have developed an additional toe to improve their posture, according to findings published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2011. What scientists previously dismissed as \"cartilaginous curiosities\" are now thought to \"act functionally like digits,\" meaning that the boney bit may be like another toe.\n19 And the size of an elephant's shoulders will determine the size of their front feet.\nae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb\nYou might not think that an elephant's shoulders have anything to do with their feet, but if you're willing to do some math, there's actually a clear correlation. According to Smithsonian, the height of an Asian or African elephant at the shoulder is \"roughly equivalent to the circumference of their front foot multiplied by two.\"\n20 The closest living relative of the elephant is much smaller than you'd expect.\nIf you had to guess which animal is the elephant's closest living relative, you might choose a hippo or even a walrus. You probably wouldn't go with the correct answer, the hyrax, since this East African mammal only weighs around 8 to 11 pounds, doesn't have a trunk or tusks, and resembles a furry rodent.\n21 Elephants are the only mammals to have four knees.\nLike humans, most mammals have two knees and two elbows. Think of a dog: The joints where their front legs bend are considered elbows, while the joints in the back legs are knees. Elephants, however, are the only mammals that have four forward-facing knees, according to McGill.\n22 Elephants are neither diurnal nor nocturnal.\nMost creatures are either diurnal (awake during the day and asleep at night) like humans, or nocturnal (primarily active during the night) like owls. But elephants reserve more specific windows for activity. Classified as crepuscular, they tend to sleep during the night and rest throughout the day, with dawn and dusk being their busy time.\n23 They eat 300 to 600 pounds of food each day.\nElephants spend around 16 hours each day foraging for food to satisfy their enormous appetite. Grass makes up half of their diet, while the rest consists of a combination of bamboo, tree bark, root, leaves, fruit, seeds, and even flowers. Incredibly, each adult elephant consumes anywhere from 300 to 600 pounds of vegetation every day, McGill notes, although around 60 percent of that passes through the animal's body without actually being digested.\n24 There are underground salt-mining elephants.\nWe tend to think of elephants as creatures that roam the wide-open plains while grazing on grass, but there are actually a group of the enormous animals that head underground whenever they're looking for a snack, according to Animal Planet. Elephants in Mount Elgon, Kenya, have been known to travel down into the area's Kitum Cave, where they then use their tusks to break salt free from the subterranean shelters before eating the savory treat.\n25 Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth.\nModern day elephants might just be the closest thing we have to dinosaurs, at least when it comes to their gigantic size. Elephants are the world's largest terrestrial animals, and male African elephants, the biggest species, grow up to be over nine feet tall, weighing anywhere from 9,000 to 16,500 pounds, National Geographic reports. The biggest elephant ever recorded was even more massive than that, and weighed about 26,400 pounds.\n26 And their skin alone can weigh one ton.\nYou already know that elephants get impressively heavy, but did you realize how much of that weight could be attributed to their skin alone? According to the International Elephant Foundation, an elephant's skin can weigh as much as 2,000 pounds and grow as thick as one inch.\n27 Elephants are huge when they're born.\nElephants aren't only massive when they're full-grown adults, they're already giants when they're first born. Baby African elephants usually stand around three feet tall and already weigh around 200 pounds at birth. And they drink around 3 gallons of milk every day to support their growing bones.\n28 The world's smallest elephant is the Borneo pygmy.\nThe smallest elephants that ever existed on Earth were around the size of large pigs and lived on Crete until 5000 B.C. Today, according to Guinness World Records, the tiniest elephant is the Borneo pygmy, but they're still a pretty good size: Adults males grow to between five and eight feet tall and weigh around 5,000 pounds (that's a photo of one, above).\n29 An elephant-made painting once sold for $39,000.\nThey may not be pulling in what a piece by Picasso demands at auction, but a group of elephants made their mark\u2014and brought in the big bucks\u2014with their own art. A painting created by eight elephants from Chiang Mai, Thailand, sold for $39,000 in 2005, making it the most expensive painting by elephants ever, according to Guinness.\n30 Elephants don't really like peanuts.\nDespite what TV and movies would have you believe, peanuts are not a natural part of an elephant's diet. According to Marie Galloway, the elephant manager at the Smithsonian's National Zoo, they're definitely \"not a favorite food\" of the animals. She explains that peanuts have too much protein for the creatures, who require a high fiber diet, which is why they prefer to eat grass, fruits, and vegetables.

The dominant elephant in the herd is a female, the matriarch. She is often the oldest, largest or most experienced elephant in the herd of related females and their young. An infant elephant is cared for by its mother and other females called \"aunties\" in the herd. Elephants can use low frequency sound waves for communication between members of the herd and individuals outside the herd. These sounds may carry for distances of up to 10 miles. For more information about elephants, explore our Elephants Infobook.\nEcology and Conservation\nAsian elephants have adapted to their environment as it changed over vast periods of time. Today they still interact with and shape their environment. Their foraging activities help to maintain the areas in which they live. by pulling down trees to eat leaves, branches, and roots they create clearings in which new young trees and other vegetation grow to provide future nutrition for elephants and other organisms. Elephant trails through the brush are paths that other animals can use. Termites eat elephant feces and often begin construction of termite mounds under piles of feces!\nThe Asian elephants' forest homes are being ravaged today because of commercial demand for forest derived products such as coffee, tea, rubber, and hardwoods. Crop cultivation, mining for iron ore, and flooding by hydroelectric projects have also acted to diminish the large tracts of land required by elephants for adequate food supplies. Only about 35,000 to 40,000 Asian elephants survive today throughout a discontinuous range in southeast Asia.\nBibliography\nEisenberg, J.F., McKay, G.M., and Seidensticker, J. Asian Elephants.

The Bush Elephant is larger, a lighter colour, and has outward curving tusks, whereas the Forest Elephant is smaller, very dark and has downward facing tusks.\nWhere does the African Bush Elephant live?\nThe African Bush Elephants habitat is given away by its name \u2013 in the African Bush! This includes savanna grasslands, partial desert areas and primary forest within Central and Southern Africa. These locations are perfect areas for the African Bush Elephant to find food.\nWhat do African Bush Elephants eat?\nAn ideal meal for the African Bush Elephant consists of plenty of grass, fruit, and roots. They spend most of their day eating, as they need to consume a large amount to consume sufficient calories for their large bodies. Leaves and branches are stripped off trees using their powerful trunk, and their tusks can be used for digging and for scraping bark. African Bush Elephants have flat teeth specifically designed to break down and help them digest plant matter.\nDo African Bush Elephants have to watch out for predators?\nNot particularly. Due to their immense size, weight, and social grouping, they are rarely preyed upon! However, young elephants can sometimes be targeted by lions and hyenas if they stray from the group. When surrounded by large females, predators won\u2019t take the risk.\nAre African Bush Elephants social like other Elephants?\nYes, in fact all Elephants are social and live in similar matriarchal societies. This means that they are led by an older, more experienced female, and females stick together whilst males leave the group once sexually mature. As nomadic animals, they are constantly travelling together to search for food and keep their young safe from predators.\nElephants are incredibly intelligent animals, capable of showing emotion and remembering information. To read more on their behaviour check out our Elephant page.\nHow do African Bush Elephants cope with the heat?\nBy using their trunks! They fill their trunks with water and spray it over their young in the hotter months, and frequently visit watering holes. Muddy spots can also be used for cooling down.\nAfrican Bush Elephants that live in the Sahara or Namib deserts are also known as Desert Elephants, but are otherwise the same as those that live in the grasslands.\nWhat threats do African Bush Elephants face?\nAlthough population levels are recovering, African Bush Elephants face many threats including habitat loss and poaching. Similar to other species, loss of land reduces the availability of food and water, meaning they have to travel further. What\u2019s worse, some won\u2019t survive the journey if they cross paths with poachers. African Bush Elephants aren\u2019t just killed for the illegal ivory trade, but they are often the victims of conflict with local people too.\nWhat can be done to help African Bush Elephants?\nGive them room to roam! A possible solution would be to provide wildlife corridors that allow the African Bush Elephant to travel without coming into conflict with people. The African Wildlife Foundation combines governments and communities in Africa and works to set land aside for this purpose. Similarly, education that encourages people to understand the African Bush Elephant can change perceptions and reduce local hunting pressure.\nThe African Wildlife Foundation also recruit \u2018wildlife scouts\u2019 that act as rangers to monitor populations and illegal activity.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Borneo Elephant Facts You\u2019ll Never Forget - Kidadl", "url": "https://kidadl.com/animal-facts/borneo-elephant-facts", "text": "Borneo Elephant Interesting Facts\nWhat type of animal is a Borneo elephant?\nA Borneo elephant or the Borneo pygmy elephant is a type of Asian elephant found on the Borneo island.\nWhat class of animal does a Borneo elephant belong to?\nA Borneo elephant (Elephas maximus borneensis) comes under the class of Mammalia and the family Elephantidae.\nHow many Borneo elephants are there in the world?\nIt is estimated that 1,500 Borneo pygmy elephants exist in the wildlife.\nWhere does a Borneo elephant live?\nBorneo elephants prefer to stay in the lowland rainforests of Borneo, a Southeast Asian island shared by Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei. The Borneo pygmy elephant habitat is especially found in the areas of Kalimantan (Indonesia) and Sabah (Malaysia).\nWhat is a Borneo elephant's habitat?\nThe Borneo elephants are mainly found in the North and Northwestern parts of the island. They are also found in the Lower Kinabatangan floodplain. A Bornean elephant can spend 12-18 hours of its day roaming in the forest. Moreover, a seasonal migrational tendency has been observed in the Borneo elephant species, which helps them to keep up their rounded shape and good health.\nWho do Borneo elephants live with?\nBorneo pygmy elephants usually live in groups of up to eight individuals. The groups of the Bornean elephants are headed by female members. Borneo pygmy elephants are especially known for their gentle nature. They are even able to move through the forest without damaging a lot of vegetation.\nHow long does a Borneo elephant live?\nThe average lifespan of a Bornean elephant is 60-75 years.\nHow do they reproduce?\nThe reproduction of Borneo pygmy elephants has not been a part of extensive studies, but they do share common characteristics with the Asian elephants. The males go through something known as the 'musth' when they have the desire to mate. The male elephants may participate in a fight with other elephants to get to a female Borneo pygmy elephant. Elephants have the ability to mate around the year. However, when a female Bornean elephant usually vocalizes her desire to mate she prefers a strong and dominant partner. Female Borneo pygmy elephants have to raise the baby alone with her herd as the father elephants do not play any role. Females can stay pregnant for 22 months or up to two years. They usually carry only one baby per pregnancy. An elephant only gets pregnant at intervals of four to five years. It takes 10-15 years for an elephant to reach its sexual maturity.\nWhat is their conservation status?\nThe Borneo pygmy elephant is enlisted as Endangered in the IUCN Red List. Their main threat to life is the loss of habitat. According to World Wildlife Fund, about 20% of Bornean elephants residing in the forest of Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary of Sabah have been injured by humans due to them trespassing into palm oil plantations. With just 1,500 individuals of the species remaining in wildlife, strict conservation is needed.\nBorneo Elephant Fun Facts\nWhat do Borneo elephants look like?\nThe very first thing that makes Borneo elephants special is their smaller size. They are quite small compared to other Asian elephants. It is also the reason for them to be regarded as Borneo pygmy elephants. The elephants have large ears and rounded bellies. A Borneo pygmy elephant does have a shorter trunk, and even the tusks in males are smaller compared to other elephants. The tusks are missing or tiny in the case of female Borneo elephants. The rough and wrinkly skin of the Borneo pygmy elephants is covered with sparse hair, and they are usually gray in color. As elephants are fond of applying mud to their body, they can also appear to have a brownish color. One of the distinct features of this elephant is its long tail which can even touch the ground. Additionally, the straighter tusks of Bornean elephants are also eye-catching.\nHow cute are they?\nA Borneo elephant (Elephas maximus borneensis) is extremely cute. Their rounded belly and face shape gives them a cuter look. As one of the smallest Asian elephants present the Asian elephant subspecies look extremely cute in their childhood.\nHow do they communicate?\nLike many other elephants, the Borneo elephants also communicate by making a low-frequency sound with the help of their tusks. The sounds are inaudible to the human ears. As an Asian elephant species, they can also communicate through movements and touch with their herd members. They also have the ability to make the usual high-frequency elephant-like sound.\nHow big is a Borneo elephant?\nAn average Borneo elephant grows up to the height of 6.5-10 ft (2-3 m). Even though this elephant subspecies is called 'pygmy', they grow up to be of the same size as a Sumatran elephant. However, a Borneo elephant is around 30% smaller than other bigger Asian elephants.\nHow fast can a Borneo elephant run?\nA Borneo elephant can run at the average speed of 26 mph or 41 km/h. So, you shouldn't be fooled about their ability to run seeing their big size and adorable large ears.\nHow much does a Borneo elephant weigh?\nOne of the most interesting things about these animals has to be their weight. A Borneo pygmy elephant can grow up to have a weight of 6,500-11,000 lb (3000-5000 kg).\nWhat are their male and female names of the species?\nThere are no distinct names for the female and the male elephants of the species.\nWhat would you call a baby Borneo elephant?\nA baby of the Borneo's is called a calf.\nWhat do they eat?\nBorneo elephants, the subspecies of an Asian elephant, are herbivores. Borneo elephants especially like to eat grass. However, other things that are part of their diet are fruits, flowers, crops, tree bark, grains, and leaves. These animals can go through up to 286 lb or 130 kg of food in a single day.\nAre they aggressive?\nBorneo elephants are known to be one of the most docile and peaceful subspecies of Asian elephants. They do not like to behave aggressively and are quite affectionate to the members of their herd. They can even go through their usual routes without harming the smaller vegetation. However, a male pygmy elephant tends to behave aggressively when they are in 'musth'.\nWould they make a good pet?\nNo. A Borneo elephant wouldn't make a good pet as they are meant to live in the wildlife. A human being wouldn't be able to provide them a proper habitat like the forests that they call their home. Also, it is very tough to control a big animal like an elephant during its mating seasons. Technically it is also illegal to take a Borneo elephant as a pet.\nKidadl Advisory: All pets should only be bought from a reputable source. It is recommended that as a potential pet owner you carry out your own research prior to deciding on your pet of choice. Being a pet owner is very rewarding but it also involves commitment, time and money. Ensure that your pet choice complies with the legislation in your state and/or country. You must never take animals from the wild or disturb their habitat. Please check that the pet you are considering buying is not an endangered species, or listed on the CITES list, and has not been taken from the wild for the pet trade.\nDid you know...\nThe only Borneo pygmy elephant of the United States is present in the Oregon Zoo. The name of the female elephant is Chendra and she came to the zoo after being rescued from one of the oil palm plantations of the State of Sabah.\nWhy are Borneo elephants important?\nBorneo elephants are important as they are one of the smallest subspecies of Asian elephants present in this world. Along with that, elephants do a great task of dispersing seeds along their way which in turn gives birth to many forests and helps to renew the environment.\nWhy are Borneo elephants endangered?\nBorneo elephants have the status of being Endangered in the IUCN Red List. According to World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the main reason behind this is the human-elephant conflict over land. These elephants reside on the island of Borneo, and as the human population rises, it mistreats the population of these pygmy elephants. The forests are being cleared out, which reduces the proportion of habitat and food sources that these elephants need. When wildlife gets into palm oil plantations, Borneo's humans feel threatened and end up attacking these beings. As the humans encroach more space, the migration routes used by the elephant population seem to vanish.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly animal facts for everyone to discover!

Most probably, you will never see an elephant\u2019s teeth up close. The below can help you understand the teeth of an elephant and answer your question.\nElephants have a total of 26 teeth: two incisors, which are the tusks, plus 12 premolars and 12 molars. An elephant can go through six sets of replacement molars throughout its life.\nElephant Teeth Facts\nAsian Elephants\nAsian Elephant\nAsian elephants have smaller tusks than African elephants.\nMales tusks are bigger than females.\nThey have perfect flat teeth perfect for chewing vegetation.\nElephants are polyphyodonts mammals and replace teeth many times throughout their lives.\nAsia elephants have long cylindrical ridges on their teeth.\nTusks are worn down throughout their life depending on if they prefer to use the right or left tusk.

Just like us humans being left or right-handed.\nTusks (incisors)\nPlayfighting with their tusks\nTusks are used for defence, digging, carrying and lifting. They are just like giant teeth, and they have a nerve that runs two-thirds of them, just like a regular tooth. Baby elephants have temporary tusks when born and will replace them at around 13 months old with their permanent tusks. Tusks are an off white colour and made of dentine, a hard, dense, bony tissue. The tusk is then wrapped in a hard enamel.\nThe unfortunate thing is that poachers remove the tusks of an elephant for their ivory. Considering how family originated elephants are, this behaviour is one of the most terrible things imaginable for a herd of elephants to go through.\nDo elephant tusks grow back?\nNo, once the tusk is broken, damaged or removed, it will not ever grow back.\nHow much do elephant tusks weigh?\nMale tusks: between 50-79 kg (110-175 lb)\nFemale tusks: between 18-20 kg (40-44 lb)\nAnimals With Tusks Today\nElephants\nHippotamus\nNarwhal\nWalrus\nWarthog\nWild pig\nWhich extinct animals had tusks?\nMammoths\nMastodons\nAmebelodon\nWhy do animals have tusks?\nAnimals have tusks for many reasons. They use them to show dominance, defend themselves against attackers, and as tools such as digging and gathering food. Elephants use their tusks for these purposes, while walruses use their tusk to haul themselves out of the ice.\nHow much does a single elephant tooth weigh?\nA single tooth can weigh between 1.8-2.0 kg (4-4.5 lb)\nWhat do elephants teeth look like?\nThe teeth of an elephant are wide and flat shaped. Depending on which type of elephant, they will have diamond-shaped ridges or long cylindrical ridges on their molars. The teeth of an elephant are an off white colour.\nDo elephants get cavities?\nNo, not often because they dont eat a high sugar diet, however, the teeth of an elephant will get grinded down with use, and in this case, they will fall out or be pushed out and get replaced by a new tooth with their unique dentition system.\nPolyphyodont Meaning\nA polyphyodont is an animal that can replace teeth within the mouth continuously. The elephant\u2019s teeth are roughly replaced six times throughout their life.\nPolyphyodont Mammals\nMost mammals are diphyodonts; however, the below mammals are an exception.\nElephants\nKangaroos\nManatees\nIf you\u2019ve never seen an elephant in person, it might be hard to imagine that they have a total of 26 teeth. They also use their tusks for more than just defence. But not many people know the other uses these impressive mammals put their tusks to or how important they are to elephants overall health. Thanks to the unique dentition system, elephants can grow back lost or damaged molar teeth with no problem. Replacing teeth happens roughly six times in an elephants lifetime.\nSharing is a good thing to do!"}

African bush elephant, Loxodonta africana at Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa\nPhotographer: Derek Keats; License CC BY 2.0\nElephants are primarily split into two different types, the African elephant and the Asian elephant. African elephants, however, are the largest living land animals.\nDue to poaching, the African elephant population is widely dwindling--poaching leaves some elephant populations in Africa endangered, while some populations (mainly in eastern and southern regions) are stable and expanding.\nThere are two sub-species of African elephants, the African bush elephant and the African forest elephant.\nThe African bush elephant also known as the savannah elephant (L. a. africana) is the largest of all elephant species. Males can weigh anywhere up to 16,500 pounds and its maximum measured shoulder height is up to 4 metres!\nTo differentiate the African bush elephant from other elephant species, it is important to remember that the African bush elephant is recognizable by its large outward-pointing tusks. Both males and females have tusks, making it very difficult to tell the sex of an elephant just by looking at it. Instead, scientists must observe an elephant's behaviour in order to tell whether it is a male or female!\nThe African bush elephant lives throughout the savannah regions of the African continent--in other words, it can be found in the grassy plains and woodlands of Africa, especially in the eastern and southern countries."}

Fun Animal Facts For Kids", "url": "https://kidadl.com/fun-facts/what-is-a-group-of-elephants-called-fun-animal-facts-for-kids", "text": "Elephants are known to everyone as the largest terrestrial animals in the world.\nElephants are considered unique animals. This is due to the uniquely structured big ears, a long trunk, tusks, and thick columnar-type legs.\nHas someone ever guessed how these animals with such a special physique use their body parts? Well, elephants do have some wild and exciting facts from the day these big animals are born. One must have heard about an elephant's teeth and tusks. In reality, the thing which is called the tusk of an elephant is actually the teeth. Though these visible tusks are teeth, elephants do not use them for eating purposes. Elephants have a different set of teeth inside the mouth, which is meant for chewing or eating food.\nOne must have heard that elephants do travel in groups. This is similar to all other animals, so it is natural to wonder about what a group of elephants is called? A group of elephants is usually called a 'herd'. One may use the term 'a herd of elephants' to best describe that there are a bunch of elephants moving together. There have been many other names given to a group of elephants. Keep reading to check all the interesting facts out about the world\u2019s largest land animals.\nLove to know more than just what is a group of elephants called then why not take a look at what is a group of goats called, or can birds eat rice.\nMost Common Names For A Group Of Elephants\n'Herd' is the most common name given to a group of elephants. Apart from this, a group of elephants is also called 'a parade of elephants'.\nDo you want to learn about the elephant parade meaning? There is a very simple reason behind this name for a group of elephants. Have you ever watched this animal take a walk in a group? Does it not look similar to a marching band? Well, a group of elephants is called a 'parade' because when they walk together in a group, you can see the perfect synchronization of the body parts of each elephant.\nWhat is a group of baby elephants called?\nA group of baby elephants is called a herd. A herd of elephants is a very common phrase.\nOne would be surprised to know those baby elephants are able to stand just after 20 minutes of coming into this world. Is that not interesting? Other little animals would take days to stand up. Another interesting fact that would leave one shocked is that the long trunk that is seen on the elephant's body can actually contain around 1.8 gal (8.1 L) of water. These trunks are usually used as snorkeling units by elephants when these heavy creatures go swimming.\nName For A Large Group Of Elephants\nStarting from the very big and flat ears to the trunk, to the movement of the legs, every part of an elephant is in sync.\nA large group of elephants looks similar to a marching parade. Also, another fact about elephants in groups is that all these animals tend to put the weights of the body to one side.\nHerd Vs Parade Of Elephants\nStudying the collective nouns of elephants may have made you curious about the collective names for other animals.\nJust like elephants, monkeys in groups also have a collective name for the monkey group. A group of monkeys is usually called a 'troop of monkeys', but not apes. There is another popular name for a group of monkeys. The other name for a group of monkeys is called 'a barrel of monkeys'. Some people use 'cartload' or 'tribe' for calling a group of monkeys, but this is rare. A group of apes is called a shrewdness.\nTurtles are also known for some unique facts. The most common one to hear is that turtles are way too slow in their day-to-day activities. But turtles also move in groups or in their groups, they can groups communicate with each other. Does a group of turtles even get a collective name? Yes, turtles do have some unique and specific collective names that are meant for only turtles. Terms like 'bale' or 'turn' are specifically used for only a group of turtles. A group of turtles is also called by some other collective names too. One would often find people saying sentences like 'a nest of turtles' or 'a dole of turtles'. The terms 'nest' and 'dole' can be used for other animals too. But turtles, we exclusively call them by the collective nouns, 'bale' and 'turn'.\nNow that one has learned so many names for turtles, monkeys, and elephants, one must be wondering why elephants are called by two different names. One must have acknowledged by now that a group of elephants is called 'herd,' and at the same time, a group of elephants can also be called a 'parade'. So a curious question is why would these big animals have been given different collective names. Is there any specific reason behind this? The answer is yes. The two terms do have different meanings. If someone calls a group of elephants a 'herd', then one must know that the person means that all the elephants belong to one family.\nEach member is known to travel in a group, known as a herd in a range from 8-100 elephants. This herd of elephants is often led by the eldest member of the family. Another interesting fact to notice about a herd of elephants is that old and young female elephants do travel with the herd for their whole life while the male elephants are known to leave the herd when the elephants reach 12-15 years of age.\nStudies have found that often a group of elephants, more than two, can be called a memory. This is due to the fact that elephants are known to have been blessed by nature. These animals have an excellent memory and do possess sentimental intelligence. The social behaviors of elephants must have led to this term. It is worth noticing that elephants are well versed in expressing emotions. Elephants often are known to have emotions of love, grief, respect, faith, and playful interactions with human friends. Elephants even mimic quickly and memorize things that are taught. So, this might be the reason for calling the group of elephants as memory.\nThis was all about some interesting facts that you might have heard or completely new to you. Elephants are the greatest creatures on earth and they are mostly calm and composed, if not threatened. Baby elephants can be too cute to deal with, but even baby elephants are way too big to play with.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly facts for everyone to enjoy!

Here are some interesting facts about these magnificent beasts.\nThe elephant is a religious symbol in Thailand\nThe elephant is a symbol of Buddhism and the Lord Buddha. Legend says that Queen Maya, the Lord Buddha\u2019s mother, dreamt that a white elephant presented her with a lotus flower, another religious symbol, before entering her womb. She consulted with fortune tellers after the dream and was told that she would give birth to a special baby.\nA statue of Buddha with a white elephant | \u00a9 Ivan Fourie / Flickr\nThe elephant is a royal symbol in Thailand\nElephants have been kept by the Thai Royal Family for hundreds of years. They are regularly used in royal ceremonies, where they are kitted out in colourful outfits and sometimes painted. White elephants have royal status and are seen as being incredibly lucky. In the past, all white elephants were given to the King.\nStatue of white elephants near the Grand Palace in Bangkok | \u00a9 Ninara / Flickr\nThere\u2019s a yearly festival to honour Thailand\u2019s elephants\nEach year, Surin Elephant Roundup pays homage to Thailand\u2019s elephants and gives thanks for the role these mighty creatures have played in the development of Thailand over the years. All of the province\u2019s elephants are recalled for the event, including those that now live in other parts of the country. There\u2019s a huge parade, with hundreds of elephants, followed by a gigantic buffet breakfast. Fruit and vegetables are laid out on long stretches of tables for the elephants to feast upon. There are then several days of elephant demonstrations at the stadium. The festival is, however, very commercialised today, and one could argue that the original point of honouring these special creatures has been very lost over the years.\nBuffet breakfast at Surin Elephant Roundup | \u00a9 Sarah Williams\nElephants appear in many official seals\nThe elephant appeared on the Siamese flag up until the early 1900s. It is still found on many provincial seals. Bangkok\u2019s seal, for example, shows the Hindu deity of Indra riding an elephant. Chiang Mai\u2019s seal shows an elephant in a palace and Chiang Rai\u2019s features an elephant surrounded by mythical naga creatures. Mae Hong Sin\u2019s provincial seal shows an elephant bathing in water. Other provinces that use the elephant in their seal include Nakhon Nayok, Tak, Nathathiwat, and Suphanburi.\nBangkok\u2019s seal showing an elephant | \u00a9 Prince Narisara Nuvadtivongs / Wikimedia Commons\nThai elephants were once used in wars\nIn ancient times, Thais used elephants as war animals. Their strength, size, longevity, and power made them ideal weapons and shields in battles. Elephants went through rigorous training to prepare them for war, including having to chase horses and practice fighting other elephants with their tusks. Training included many booming sounds to prepare them for the loud noises of war. In the 17th century, Thailand had some 20,000 elephants trained for war!\nBattle re-enactment at Surin Elephant Roundup | \u00a9 Sarah Williams\nElephants played an important role in industry and agriculture\nElephants were once a vital part of Thailand\u2019s logging industry, with the gigantic creatures used to drag heavy logs from deep within dense forests. They were also once used as agricultural animals, helping farmers with heavy labour and transportation.\nElephants sitting in the grass | \u00a9 Tontan Travel ** Note to copy editor - this image is from Flickr, okay to use as long as attributed to a different website - https://www.flickr.com/photos/tontantravel/15789028250/in/photolist-q4dU21-xJfR8-6e6AFk-6eaHBs-61PPTb-RcMWz-79nd78-5hDmj3-79ncMR-9t8Mzz-22rN87B-oFHmN6-qvEQm4-BQmi4-eeBYGY-dnDrE7-d1gduw-qmWniw-qN25MC-59KnR8-68uxqA-5S28pg-RcMX2-pR6guy-7CjTQc-dyLWUk-qvw15G-fj3hv3-RMSnp2-5QsDyR-68rzGV-bHusj6-9pRCFx-f5u1Mv-7ZG87i-9FotDc-68EpsS-68vcYq-9pRq4F-4mmEJA-7W7aAS-qvx2j5-iFGVYN-68qoDt-buwvWm-bHr6Ar-7W3Gwt-5QwW7A-buzoPj-68sCmt\nElephants are important in tourism in Thailand\nMany tourists dream of getting up close and personal with elephants in Thailand. But many people are also now realizing the harmful effects of riding elephants and seeing the darker side of elephant tourism. Fortunately, there are now several ethical camps and sanctuaries where you can interact with elephants in a harm-free environment.\nInteracting with elephants in Thailand | \u00a9 Chris Feser / Flickr\nAsian elephants and African elephants are different\nAsian elephants, the type found in Thailand, have several big differences with their African cousins. African elephants are usually significantly larger and heavier than Asian elephants. The two species of elephants have different ear and head shapes, and there are differences between their teeth, trunks, and toenails. The skin of an Asian elephant is typically smoother too. Furthermore, only male Asian elephants have tusks, whereas both male and female African elephants may have these ivory horn-like overgrown teeth.\nA trio of majestic Thai elephants | \u00a9 Chris Feser / Flickr\nElephant manure has beneficial uses\nCreatures as large as elephants are sure to produce a lot of waste. Luckily, there are several uses of elephant dung. It is a rich fertilizer, loved by Thai farmers around the country. Burning elephant manure is a great way to keep mosquitoes away! How about taking home an unusual souvenir from Thailand and picking up some elephant poop paper? Of course, it\u2019s been heavily processed so as to be clean, sanitary, and smell free.\nEquipment for turning elephant dung into paper | \u00a9 amanderson2 / Flickr\nThai elephants are used to produce coffee\nYou may have heard of Kopi Luwak, an expensive coffee that uses the civet cat in its production. But did you know that elephants can be used in a similar manner to make a unique coffee too? Black Ivory coffee is made from beans that have passed through an elephant\u2019s digestive system. Having been eaten, fermented, and excreted, the beans are collected from the manure and then used to brew an expensive and novel pot of coffee.\nWould you try coffee from an elephant\u2019s poop? | \u00a9 Zacharias Korsalka / Flickr\nThailand\u2019s elephants are endangered\nSadly, despite their status and heritage, many factors have led to a huge decline in the numbers of elephants in Thailand today. It is estimated that the country now only has around 4,000 elephants, compared with some 100,000 in the middle of the 1800s. Additionally, around 50% of Thailand\u2019s elephants today live in captivity. Asian elephants are now considered to be endangered."}

But when you stop to consider this oddest of dangling appendages, one quickly remembers what a curious animal part it is. Imagine having, essentially, a supernaturally strong skin-covered slinky attached to your face ... one that can caress, has fine motor skills, and is so sensitive it can feel distant thunder from vibrations in the ground.\nAmong the trunk\u2019s many exceptional features, consider these wonders.\nIt is many body parts in one\nThe trunk is both an upper lip and a nose, with two nostrils running through the whole thing. At the trunk\u2019s tip, African elephant have two fingers while Asian elephants have one. The dexterity of the fingers allows an elephant the ability to do things like deftly pick up a single blade of grass or hold a paintbrush.\nIt has mighty muscles\nAn elephant\u2019s trunk has eight major muscles on either side and 150,000 muscle bundles in all. It is so strong that it can push down trees and lift a whopping 700,000 pounds.\nIts got the moves\nLike the human tongue, the trunk is a muscular hydrostat \u2013 a boneless muscular structure that allows for its excellent maneuverability.\nIt has reach\nWikimedia Commons/CC BY 2.0\nImagine how awkward it would be for an elephant to squat down for its mouth to reach water, or how long its neck would have to be to reach leaves?

But just how effective of a water tool is it? It can suck up to 10 gallons of water a minute and can hold up to two gallons of water at a time! (And for the record, the elephant doesn't drink directly through the trunk, yet uses it so bring water to its mouth.)\nIt says a lot\n\u00a9 Elephant Voices\nNot only is the trunk used for breathing (and smelling and drinking and feeding) it is also used for social purposes like greetings and caresses. Mother elephants often use their trunks to comfort their offspring by stroking the calf's neck and shoulders. They will even wrap their trunks around the belly or back leg.\nIt's a comfort item\nJoyce Poole has been studying elephants for nearly 4 decades \u2013 and is co-founder of Elephant Voices. She explains that when an elephant feels uneasy, or is ambivalent about what to do next, he or she may use the trunk in a \u201ctouch-face\u201d gesture, a \u201cself-directed touching of the face, mouth, ear, trunk, tusk, or temporal gland, apparently to reassure and self-soothe.\u201d Apparently, elephants pet themselves with their trunks to makes themselves feel better.\nIn conclusion, a video of a baby elephant learning to use her trunk.

They are about 6.6 to 11.5 feet in height and weigh about 4000 to 1000 pounds.\nThese elephants go by the scientific name Elephas maximus indicus and have long trunks that are completely boneless. The trunks are known to be made up of about 40,000 muscles.\nIndian elephants are known to be very sociable animals and display a wide variety of emotions. They are incredibly intelligent and expressive.\nIncredible Indian Elephant Facts!\nThe trunk of this elephant contains no bones. Though it includes both the upper lip and the nose, the entire trunk is made up of 40,000 muscles, which is about 62 times the number of muscles in the entire human body.\nMothers have the help of other females in their herd to raise their calves. These helpful females are referred to as aunties, and the fathers play a less significant role.\nDuring the hot months, an they can drink up to 200 liters of water per day. This heavy drinking suggests that the mammal can drink their weight in water almost three times a month\nIndian elephants weigh between 6,000 and 8,000 pounds as an adult, measuring between 18 and 21 feet in length. This length includes their body, head, and trunk. Even a baby is fairly large, measuring weighing up to several hundred pounds as well.\nAn Indian elephant spends 19 hours a day just eating.\nIndian Elephant Scientific Names\nThe Indian elephant goes by the scientific name Elephas maximus indicus. They belong to the kingdom Animalia and class Mammalia. These elephants come from a family called Elephantidae and have a subspecies called E. m. indicus. They belong to the order called Proboscideans.\nThe word elephas is the Latin influence for elephant, but it comes from the Greek word \u1f10\u03bb\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, which could\u2019ve been influenced by the Egyptian word for ivory or elephant. Interestingly, ivory\u2019s etymology comes directly from Latin and Greek interpretations of the word elephant, making them interconnected forever.\nIndicus is rooted in the Ancient Greek from \u1f38\u03bd\u03b4\u03af\u03b1, which means India. Essentially, the interpretation of this name simply means that the animal is a large elephant from India.\nIndian Elephant Appearance\nThese elephants are huge animals with a size of about 18 to 21 feet, weighing in at up to 8,000 pounds as a male. Though their head is large heads, their necks are small. With such a high weight, the legs take on much work to carry them.\nWhile other elephant breeds have a shorter tail, the tail of this elephant is incredibly long. Matching their grayish color, the tail sometimes goes longer than their knees, potentially brushing the ground with the coarse hair that hangs from the bottom of the tail.\nThe trunks are perhaps the most fascinating feature of the Indian elephant. While the trunk makes up quite a large portion of the body, it doesn\u2019t contain any bones at all. Instead, as described in the above facts, this powerful extremity contains a total of 40,000 muscles, which are broken down into 150,000 separate sections.\nThis muscled trunk is necessary for the elephant\u2019s survival, allowing them to cool off with splashing, hydrate by bringing water to their mouth, tear down food to eat, and express themselves.\nJayanand Govindaraj / Creative Commons\nIndian Elephant Behavior\nThese elephants are diurnal which means that they are the most active during the day and sleep at night. However, contrary to that, these animals are also nocturnal in nature which means that some of them can also be highly active during the night.\nThese elephants are highly social and are known to exist in stable groups. The groups are usually matriarchal and consist of 20 female Indian elephants that are very closely related. The groups are headed by the oldest female elephant. The leader usually guides the whole group in the quest for food and water.\nThese elephants are known to be intelligent and display a wide variety of emotions like joy and grief. The Indian elephants are known to make a variety of sounds \u2013 both low and high pitched \u2013 to communicate.\nThe groups that these elephants exist in are called herds. With their family, the Indian elephant takes 19 hours a day to eat, which produces a large amount of waste \u2013 220 pounds of dung daily, to be exact. They will travel up to 125 miles a day to keep themselves active as they seek out their next source of nutrients. Even when they sleep, most elephants will remain standing while in the wild.\nThese elephants are known to travel from one forest to another and are also known to often stay in different forests at different periods. However, the male Indian elephants like to live in solitude, especially in their youth years.\nIndian Elephant Habitat\nThese elephants exist in a variety of habitats and prefer to live in forests, grasslands, and scrublands. Besides that, they can also be found in cultivated forests. When they sleep at night in ordinary circumstances, herds that reside near villages may reverse these habits to remain vigilant against potential human threats.\nThey can be found in several parts of Southeast Asia including Cambodia, the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Thailand. These regions provide the Indian elephants with a substantial number of plants to feast on, but they are dwindling.\nHumans and Indian elephants in the region are starting to see their habitats collide. This combination can cause a major conflict, forcing them to give up their natural habitat and dwindle in numbers. While there are efforts to correct this conflict, humans have been accosted, injured, and even killed in the process.\nIndian Elephant Diet\nThese elephants are majorly plant-eaters (i.e., megaherbivores) and are known to eat about 330 pounds of food each day. Their diet majorly includes grass, leaves, barks, stems, and roots.\nApart from that, these huge mammals also feed on bananas, sugarcane, and rice. They love grazing on tall grasses and are known to remove the shoots and blades of these grasses very skillfully.\nAs plentiful as this food may sometimes be, the search can be dangerous for humans and elephants alike.\nWhat Does an Indian Elephant Eat?\nThese elephants are majorly plant-eaters. They usually feed on grass, leaves, bark, stem, root, and shoots. They also feed on bananas, sugarcane, and rice. Apart from that, they graze on tall grass. Though the blades and shoots can be harmful to their stomach and mouth, the strong trunk of the Indian elephant allows them to remove these parts before they chew them up.\nAs the habitats of the Indian elephant become smaller, some of their journeys for nutrients take them fairly close to the human populations.\nWhat Eats Indian Elephants?\nDue to their humongous size and weight, these animals have very few predators. Bengal tigers are known to eat them, but they hunt down only the baby Indian elephants as they are easy to hunt owing to their smaller size as compared to the larger ones.\nMany of the reports of these tiger attacks are in the Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand.\nIndian Elephant Predators and Threats\nAs stated above, there are almost no predators (in terms of the natural food chain) of the Indian elephants. Bengal tigers are one of the prominent predators of the Indian elephant, but tigers hunt down the babies of these elephants owing to their size. Some of these instances have even appeared in the news, tracing back to a zoo in Uttarakhand, India.\nThe biggest threat to the Indian elephant is humans and their daily life. Poaching remains a major threat to these animals as humans use their tusks for ivory, but the threat goes beyond that. The reduced habitat has caused aggressive confrontations between the humans nearby. As the elephants look for food in farmlands, these humans lose out on their income. However, the violent response from both sides has led to the death of nearly 500 humans each year.\nIndian Elephant Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nThe Indian elephants are known to mate by rubbing their bodies against each other and even wrapping their trucks together. Male Indian elephants then mount the female from behind. The sexual act lasts for about two minutes after which, the male Indian elephant stays near the female Indian elephant to ward off other males from around her.\nMales that fall in the age bracket of 40 to 50 years are most likely to mate with the females for babies. however, the courtship between the male and the Indian elephant female is fairly short-lived. Females are about 10 years old when they can start producing babies, which are referred to as calves. The gestation period lasts for around 22 months after which they give birth to the calves or baby elephants.\nA baby Indian elephant usually weighs around 100 Kgs at birth. The mother and other females \u2018aunties\u2019 take care of the baby. The calf sticks around with its mother for about five years after which the male calves move out of the herd while the female ones stay behind.\nAn Indian elephant usually has a lifespan of about 48 years. However, conservation efforts and captivity influence that age.\nIndian Elephant Population\nIndian elephants can be found throughout mainland Asia, with up to 31,368 elephants in India alone. Over half of these elephants are found in the southern region. Myanmar has the second-most Indian elephants at about 4,000 to 5,000, though the population is greatly broken up.\nA few thousand Indian elephants each are found in Malaysia and Thailand, but the number is only in the hundreds in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Laos, China, and Cambodia. There are a few areas in southern Vietnam with elephants, though their numbers are as low as 70 Indian elephants total.\nThe Indian elephant is on the ICUN Red List as an endangered species. Since the 1950s, the total number of Indian elephants has decreased by 50%, which is what landed the species on the list in 1986. The IUCN\u2019s last update on the population in 2019 indicated that current numbers were needed to see how many are currently left.\nIndian Elephant in the Zoo\nThese elephants are often found to exist in captivity, particularly in India and Thailand. They are often used as an object of fascination in zoos and have often been used to uplift the tourism industry. In the United States, it is difficult to find an Indian elephant, as there are many groups against holding them in captivity. The only zoos that have elephants often source them from Africa.\nMuch of the reason that these animals are in zoos are an effort to protect them from humans and domesticate them.\nView all 27 animals that start with I"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Asian Elephant Facts: Animals of Asia - WorldAtlas", "url": "https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/asian-elephant-facts-animals-of-asia.html", "text": "5. Physical Description\nThe largest terrestrial animals of Asia, and the second largest elephant species in the world, Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) differ from their African counterparts in terms of their smaller size and shorter ears. Their heights at their shoulders range between 6.6 and 9.8 feet (2 to 3 meters) and their weights lie between 2.25 and 5.5 tons (2,041 to 4,990 kilograms). These elephants are dark gray to brown in color and have pinkish patches on their ears, trunks, and some other areas of their bodies. The most interesting part of these elephants\u2019 physical features are their highly functional and agile trunks, which are actually an extension of the nose and upper lip, ending in nostrils at the bottom of the trunk. The trunk can be used for multiple purposes like breathing, smelling, sucking in water, producing their characteristic \"trumpeting\" sounds, as well as for grabbing and picking up objects. There are fingerlike structures at the ends of these trunks, which are primarily used to hold onto objects with a firm grip. The Asian elephant possesses one such fingerlike projection at the end of its trunk, while African elephants' trunks have a pair of them. The trunk alone has about 100,000 individual muscles, accounting for the efficiency and work capacity of this unique appendage. Depending on the subspecies, male elephants usually possess tusks, which are used to dig up the ground, debark trees, or as a weapon of defense. Some populations, like the Sri Lankan elephants, have only 5% of their males being \"tuskers\", as compared to 90% in nearby states in southern India. Such statistics exhibit a pattern that is believed to correspond to the prevalence of hunting in their respective areas, with tusks being especially sought after in Sri Lanka.\n4. Diet\nAsian elephants can be classified as \"mega-herbivores\", as they are completely dependent on herbivory and consume up to 330 pounds (150 kilograms) of vegetation each day. Consumption of such large volumes of food is crucial to the survival of these elephants. The foraging techniques of these pachyderms involves both grazing and browsing activities, and their diet consists of grasses, barks, roots, stems, and the leaves of trees, as well as crops growing on human-cultivated lands, such as bananas and sugarcane. Often, the act of raiding farmers\u2019 crops by elephant herds results in serious human-animal conflicts, which can even end in the death or injury to either the elephants or humans involved. The elephants also require large intakes of water on a regular basis, the volume of which ranges between 21 and 53 gallons (80-200 liters) of water daily.\n3. Habitat and Range\nToday, the Asian elephant has been categorized as \u2018Endangered\u2019 in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. With about 100,000 of these gentle giants existing at the beginning of the 20th Century, their numbers have rapidly dwindled to lower than 50% of that figure over the past few decades. Today, these elephants, which used to live across large parts of Asia, occupy only 15% of their original ranges. Countries of the Indian subcontinent, including India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand, are considered to have small to large Asian elephant populations. India has the most widespread habitat for the elephants, while Sri Lanka has much smaller populations that are greatly restricted to fragmented living areas. Sumatran Asian elephants have lost 70% of their original habitats as well. The tropical and subtropical forests in these countries serve as ideal habitats for these mega-herbivores. Today, Asian elephant populations are threatened by exploitative human activities, such as the establishment of developmental projects in forested lands, deforestation, the spread of human habitation into elephant territories, habitat fragmentation, and the death of elephants due to human-animal conflicts. Cases of poaching of Asian elephants are lower than that of their African counterparts, but yet some elephants are still killed for their tusks, meat, and skin. Wild elephants are also captured for captive breeding to boost tourism industries in countries like Thailand, which further depletes the wild populations of this species.\n2. Behavior\nThe Asian elephants have a complex, hierarchical social structure, living in large groups exhibiting matriarchy. The males leave their families between the age of 12 and 15 years old, and then wander solitarily or otherwise form small, temporary groups comprised by a few bull elephants. Such groups are led in the front and the rear by the strongest males and the remaining members act to stabilize the group. The hierarchical roles of these members transform every time a new male enters or when one leaves the group. The bull elephant does not have preference for a single family unit, but instead wanders in search of mates between different family units. This increases their chances of mating, and potentially allows the elephant to mate with about 30 females within a given year. This leads to the production of more offspring in a single mating season than if they had stayed with a single family unit. The family units are comprised by 3 to 25 members, and has a stable core group led by the oldest and most experienced female, called the matriarch. She is accompanied by her adult daughters and their collective offspring. The females are responsible for bringing up their offspring, and teaching them social, foraging, and defensive skills. The chances of offspring survival increases when there are larger numbers of adult females in the group. The family units might also bond with related or non-related elephant groups, referred to as \"kin\" or \"bond\" groups. Elephants are also reported to mourn for their dead companions by pausing for a while when they come across the dead body of a deceased elephant, gently caressing the body with their trunks, and sometimes even carrying a piece of tusk or bone with them as fond memory of their dead companions.\nElephants also love to bathe and to wallow in the mud. They will coat their bodies with mud and dust, and then rub themselves against hard surfaces in order to get rid of pathogens that have stuck to their bodies. Elephants sleep for about four hours a day and, during deep sleep, they will lie on their sides and breathe deeply, and sometimes even snore. These giant pachyderms (thick-skinned mammals) are \"crepuscular\" in nature, and thus are primarily most active at dawn and dusk.\n1. Reproduction\nThe elephant mating ritual is a fascinating spectacle to behold. Usually older males, about 40 to 50 years of age, are the most preferred males for mating. Females are ready to begin mating at the age of about 14 years. Physical aggression is hardly involved when males compete with each other for the attention of the female. It is believed the younger ones back out due to respect and admiration for the older, more experienced males. The courtship is short lived, and involves the male running in pursuit of the playful female, followed by body rubbing and trunk wrapping. Elephants have an extremely long gestation period of 22 months, and this is one of the factors responsible for the slow growth rate of the elephant population. Baby elephants are born blind and helpless, and are at first looked after by all the other females in the herd. This is in order to allow the mother sufficient time to feed, so that she can produce enough milk for feeding her newborn baby."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the African Forest Elephant images!\nAfrican Forest Elephant Classification and Evolution\nThe African Forest Elephant is one of two Elephant subspecies on the African continent. Until recently, scientists thought they were the same species. But further study revealed enough variation to warrant subspecies status.\nAfrican Forest Elephants are slightly smaller than African Bush Elephants, but they\u2019re still one of the largest animals on land today. Although the two species are very similar, the African Forest Elephant has rounder ears, straighter tusks, and more toenails than the African Bush Elephant.\nAfrican Forest Elephant Anatomy and Appearance\nThe African Forest Elephant is the one of the largest known land mammals on Earth, with male African Forest Elephants reaching nearly 3 meters in height and the female African Forest Elephants around 2.5 meters. The tusks of an African Forest Elephant can grow to nearly 1.5 meters long and generally weigh between 50 and 100 pounds, which is about the same as a small adult Human. They are thinner, straighter and shorter than the tusks of the African Bush Elephant. African Forest Elephants have four molar teeth each weighing about 5.0 kg and measuring about 12 inches long. They have large rounded ears which are used both for hearing and to keep them cool.\nAfrican Forest Elephant Distribution and Habitat\nThe African Forest Elephant mainly lives in central and southern Africa in nomadic herds that wander through the forests and grasslands of Africa grazing for food and searching for waterholes. They are most commonly founds in the tropical dense jungles, where their smaller size allows them to move through the thick vegetation more easily than the larger African Bush Elephant. African Forest Elephants are threatened throughout much of their natural habitat today mainly due to deforestation and climate change and have been pushed into smaller and smaller pockets of their native lands.\nAfrican Forest Elephant Behavior and Lifestyle\nThe African Forest Elephant mainly uses its immense tusks for digging for roots in the ground and to strip the bark off trees. The African Forest Elephant also uses its tusks to defend itself from predators such as Lions, and to fight with other male African Forest Elephants during the mating season. Males are generally fairly solitary but females and their young form small family groups known as herds. This allows the more vulnerable offspring to be more easily protected. African Forest Elephants communicate through a series of low-frequency calls which they are able to detect from a few kilometers away.\nAfrican Forest Elephant Reproduction and Life Cycles\nFemale African Forest Elephants reach sexual maturity (are able to reproduce) after 10 or 11 years, and male African Forest Elephants often don\u2019t reach sexual maturity until they are nearly 20 years old. After a gestation period of up to 2 years, the female African Forest Elephant gives birth to a single calf (twins have been known but are extremely rare). The African Forest Elephant calf is nursed for 2 years and will remain with the herd until it is old enough to support itself. It is at this point that the tusks of the African Forest Elephant calf will be starting to grow.\nAfrican Forest Elephant Diet and Prey\nThe African Forest Elephant is a herbivorous animal meaning that it only eats plants and other vegetation. They predominantly eat leaves and fruit from trees, herbs and low-lying shrubs. However, the front pair of molars in the mouth of the African Forest Elephant wear down and drop out in pieces, making the back pair shift forward and two new molars emerge in the back of the African Forest Elephant\u2019s mouth. African Forest Elephants replace their teeth six times during their lives but when the African Forest Elephant is about 40 to 60 years old, the African Forest Elephant no longer has teeth and will likely die of starvation, which is sadly a common cause of death in the African wilderness.\nAfrican Forest Elephant Predators and Threats\nThe African Forest Elephant has no real natural predators to threaten its survival, mainly due to the African forest elephant\u2019s sheer size. However, it is not uncommon for large carnivores such as Lions and Hyenas to pick out a calf that has strayed from the herd or an adult that is more vulnerable from ill health or old age. African Forest Elephants are fairly docile animals and can be seen co-inhabiting in the African wilderness with other large mammals and birds, relatively peacefully. Deforestation and therefore loss of its natural habitat is one of the biggest threats to the African Forest Elephant, along with poaching.\nAfrican Forest Elephant Interesting Facts and Features\nThe tusks of the African Forest Elephant are pretty straight instead of curved to help them move through the thick jungle with greater ease. This, along with their pinkish tinge, has made the ivory of the African Forest Elephant\u2019s tusks in high demand on the black market. Despite African Forest Elephants being able to communicate with one another through a couple of miles of dense jungle, the sound they make is so low that it cannot be heard by Humans. They are an essential tool in the spreading of seeds throughout Africa\u2019s forests and are therefore vital to the running of their native ecosystems.\nAfrican Forest Elephant Relationship with Humans\nSadly, due to an increase of outside interest in Africa and its exotic wonders, the African Forest Elephant population took a devastating decline towards extinction. In 1989 a worldwide Elephant ivory hunting ban fell into place, meaning that the African Forest Elephant population has fortunately begun to recover. In 1980, there were an estimated 380,000 African Forest Elephants but due to growing Human populations in their native countries, numbers have fallen to 200,000. Deforestation of their habitats and the illegal poaching of the African Forest Elephant for their ivory are also to blame for their recent demise.\nAfrican Forest Elephant Conservation Status and Life Today\nToday, although slightly recovering in certain areas, African Forest Elephant populations are still threatened from increasing levels of illegal poaching and habitat destruction. Deforestation in the African Forest Elephant\u2019s territory means that the African Forest Elephants lose both their food and shelter making them more vulnerable in the wild. African Forest Elephants are also constantly threatened by poachers hunting the Elephants for their ivory tusks. They are now listed as an Endangered species.\nView all 122 animals that start with A"}

They are known as pachyderms, meaning thick-skinned animals.\nFind out more about these amazing animals by reading the facts below or alternatively you can download our comprehensive worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\nThere are three species of elephant: the African Forest Elephant, African Bush Elephant and the Asian Elephant, and they are the largest living land mammal. African elephants are different from Asian elephants in several ways.\nThe African elephant\u2019s ears are larger and are shaped like the continent of Africa. The male and female African elephants have tusks. The African elephant is usually larger and the Asian elephant has a back that is concave, or curved downward. African elephants are less hairy than the Asian elephant.\nThe Ice Age, which occurred over 10,000 years ago, killed off the other species of elephants, otherwise known as mammoths and mastodons.\nElephants are called pachyderms, which means thick-skinned animals, and most elephants have skin that is 1 inch thick.\nElephants wallow in rivers and streams. They dig up the mud and spray in over their bodies to protect the skin from the harsh rays of the sun. The mud not only protects the elephant from getting a sunburn, but it also protects their skin against insect bites, the loss of moisture and helps to regulate the animal\u2019s body temperature.\nMost elephants are grey in color.\nAfrican elephants can grow to be 13 feet tall and weigh 8 tons or more.\nThe most distinguishing feature of the elephant is its trunk. The trunk is actually the elephant\u2019s nose and upper lip which have joined together. Scientist now believe the elephant\u2019s trunk may contain over 40,000 muscles. At the end of the trunk, the African elephant has two finger-like projections and the Asian elephant has one. The elephant uses these projections just like we use our fingers.\nThe trunk is also used for drinking. The elephant sucks water up into its trunk and then sprays the water into its mouth. The water can also be sprayed on their bodies to cool them. An elephant will also wrap its trunk around the trunk of another elephant. This gesture is much like a handshake. They use their trunks to play and for fighting or defending themselves.\nElephants are classified as herbivores, or plant-eaters. They always use their trunks to tear up their food and then place it in their mouth.\nElephants like to eat grass and pull fruit and leaves off the branches of trees. If an elephant can\u2019t reach the leaves or fruit, they will shake the tree or sometimes even push the tree over.\nFemale elephants live with other females and their young. Males live mostly alone. The oldest female in the herd is called the matriarch and she is the leader. Baby elephants are called calves.\nIt takes 22 months for a calf to be born and when they arrive, they can weigh 260 pounds. Elephants can live to be 70 years old.\nElephants have no natural predator, although a full grown lion will go after a calf if they are willing to deal with an angry herd of female elephants. Poaching, however, has become a real problem for elephants.\nPoachers are people that hunt elephants and kill them mostly for their ivory tusks.

You are wise and intuitive, and you don\u2019t need everything to be spelled out just for you to understand it.\nYou feel things on a deeper level, and you respond to things from this depth of emotions. You fight for those who are too weak to fight for themselves and who are helpless about their situations.\nYou possess a connectedness to people, and you demonstrate this by being loyal, sensitive, and sympathetic.\nDespite difficulties and less than ideal situations, you remain faithful and steadfast and always see the good in everyone.\nLike your elephant spirit animal, you are naturally responsible even at a young age. Taking care of people, both young and old, and even risking your life just to keep someone out of harm\u2019s way, makes you happy.\nYou are a natural provider, and you will go through pain and hardships just to be able to see your loved ones happy.\nBecause of your persistence, commitment, and confidence in your abilities, you can easily do all these!\nBe inspired by your elephant spirit animal as it plows through challenges and crushes difficulties with its sheer size and attitude.\nUse your sense of empathy to iron out differences in your family, or in your personal and professional relationships.\nNegative Traits of the Elephant Spirit Animal\nThe elephant is a proud and dignified animal. It symbolizes royalty and authority.\nWith the elephant totem, it can sometimes be a challenge accepting defeats and setbacks.\nSometimes, when things don\u2019t turn out like you\u2019ve planned, your pride and sense of dignity can get in the way of dealing with the loss.\nCall on your Elephant Spirit Animal when:\nYou are feeling weak in body, mind, and soul.\nYour elephant spirit animal will give you the strength that you need, just like what the elephant does when it forages for food and water to sustain its young. Don\u2019t forget to take care of yourself, though, because there\u2019s no way that you can achieve all your goals if your body is not at its 100%.\nYou need to be reminded about your driving force, your motivation, and your life goals.\nBe inspired by the commitment and the strength of your elephant totem.

Take the lessons and let them guide you on your next adventure!\n5 Unusual Facts About Elephant Symbolism\nElephant symbolism is, perhaps not that surprising, rather powerful when it comes to the message that it is seeking to put across.\nHowever, we do still require a firm understanding of what it involves to then become more aware of the way in which it can have a positive impact on your life.\nTo do this, we can examine a number of facts surrounding both the symbolism as well as the spirit animal.\n1. You are substantially wiser than most.\nThe elephant is known for having outstanding levels of wisdom, so it should be no real surprise to then discover that elephant symbolism is also stating that you are wiser than most people.\nHowever, you do not necessarily let them know that this is the case, and you largely keep your wisdom to your own self just for it to be used as and when required.\n2. You have a wonderful memory.\nIf the elephant spirit animal is playing a regular part in your life, then it will often translate into you having a better than average memory.\nOnce again, this is something that you are going to often keep to your own self rather than divulging it at any given opportunity, but that is simply because you want to keep some sense of control over your powers wherever possible.\n3. You have a real sense of patience with people and situations.\nAn elephant is known for having patience, so the elephant spirit animal is certainly going to be the exact same.\nYou have a sense of what you want to achieve in life or what you desire, and you will then be determined to achieve it no matter what.\nYou are willing to work hard and the focus that you have will mean you can overcome various issues or problems with people and situations as you simply believe that the correct end result is going to be achievable.\n4.

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Borneo Elephant images!\nThe Borneo elephant is a subspecies of the Asian elephant and the only member of the species to reside on the island of Borneo.\nThis subspecies also goes by the alternative name of pygmy elephant. However, there is nothing small about this gigantic creature. By any measurement, it is still the largest land animal on the island of Borneo. Much about its behavior remains unknown. Until the World Wildlife Fund attached satellite collars to a few Borneo elephants in 2005, most of what we know about this subspecies was based upon extrapolation from the study of other Asian elephants. As its fate hangs in the balance, it\u2019s now a race against time to save it from extinction.\n4 Incredible Borneo Elephant Facts\nThe Borneo elephant last shared a common ancestor with its Asian kin about 300,000 years ago . Isolated from the other subspecies, it has evolved separately on the island of Borneo, never exchanging genes with other populations of elephants.\n. Isolated from the other subspecies, it has evolved separately on the island of Borneo, never exchanging genes with other populations of elephants. Asian elephants grow six sets of teeth throughout their lives.\nthroughout their lives. Female Asian elephants usually lack tusks , but they do have long teeth called tushes located right behind their upper lips.\n, but they do have long teeth called tushes located right behind their upper lips. The elephant trunk is an impressive instrument that\u2019s almost akin to a human hand. One of the more amazing facts about it is the ability to break off branches and swat away flies.\nBorneo Elephant Scientific Name\nThe scientific name of the Borneo elephant is Elaphas maximus borneensis. Elephas is obviously the name of the elephant family that includes both African elephants and Asian elephants. Maximus is the precise scientific name of the Asian elephant species. As you might already know, it is a Latin term meaning greatest or largest, which reflects the size of the Asian elephant. It is also where we get the English term maximum. Borneensis, a Latinized word for Borneo, refers only to the specific subspecies of Borneo. There are actually four subspecies of the Asian elephant in total. The other three are the Sri Lanka elephant, the Sumatra elephant, and the Indian elephant. It is believed that the Borneo elephant has evolved far enough away from its Asian counterpart to warrant a separate subspecies designation.\nBorneo Elephant Appearance\nThe Borneo elephant shares many features in common with its Asian relatives: the two-domed head, the smaller rounded ears, the four hooves on the hind foot, and the gray skin with tiny spouts of hair. But it also exhibits many physical differences, including straighter tusks and a longer tail. The Asian elephant is generally smaller than the African elephant, but the Borneo elephant is around 30% smaller than other Asian elephants. Small, in this case, is relative, since the Borneo elephant measures between 8.2 and 9.8 feet tall and between 6,500 and 11,000 pounds in weight. Males tend to have a much larger weight than females on average.\nylq/Shutterstock.com\nBorneo Elephant Behavior\nThe elephant trunk is an all-around incredible instrument. Thanks to the large concentration of muscles and nerves, it is the main means through which the elephant interacts with the world: breathing, smelling, drinking, communication, and grabbing objects. (It also has a finger-like appendage on the end to help with this.)\nThe elephant needs an equally impressive brain to perform all of these amazing feats with its trunk. Borneo elephants have not been widely studied for their cognition, but the elephant family as a whole has a highly developed neocortex (similar to humans, apes, and dolphins) that enables it to use tools, recognize itself in the mirror, solve complex problems, mimic behavior, and feel a range of complex emotions. Observations suggest that the elephant can experience grief and mourning over the death of a close friend or family member.\nThe herd is the center of all social activity and daily life for some elephants. This highly cooperative and altruistic unit consists of five to 20 adult females (called cows) and their offspring. The male bulls usually wander off on their own at a young age or join all-male bachelor groups, but the females tend to stay with the same herd for much of their lives. The oldest and largest female typically becomes the matriarch of the entire herd. She helps the group make decisions and instructs younger mothers on how to care for their young.\nThe Asian elephant is a crepuscular species, which means it sleeps during the day and accomplishes most of its activities during the dawn and dusk hours. Defying its rather cumbersome stereotype, the elephant is a fast runner and a surprisingly good swimmer. It can submerge its entire body in the water to stay cool. Only its trunk is visible above the water to help it breath. The elephant will also cover itself in mud or soil to keep its body temperature down during the warmer months.\nThe life of the herd revolves around a nomadic existence. This means it wanders around a massive territory in search of waterholes and abundant sources of food. Multiple groups will sometimes join together based on the season, habitat, and other conditions.\nBorneo Elephant Habitat\nThe Borneo elephant, as the name implies, is endemic to the northeastern part of the island of Borneo. Although isolated from the rest of Asia, Borneo is one of the largest islands in the Pacific and a source of immense biodiversity. The greatest concentration of the Borneo elephant is found in the Malaysian state of Sabah at the very northern tip of the island. Here it wanders the forests and grasslands for 12 to 18 hours a day in search of resources.\nBorneo Elephant Diet\nThe Borneo elephant is an herbivorous animal that feeds on a diverse diet of different plant species, including flowers, fruits, leaves, grains, and bark. In order to sustain itself, one elephant alone may consume hundreds of pounds of food in a single day either by grazing along the ground or browsing on the leaves and shoots of trees. The trunk functions as a versatile limb that can grasp vegetation and bring the food to its mouth.\nBorneo Elephant Predators and Threats\nBecause of its formidable size, the Borneo elephant has nothing to fear from any natural predators. Even the youngest elephants are quite large and in any case protected by the herd. The only real threat is humanity. Because this subspecies requires a large amount of land in which to live, deforestation for logging, agriculture, and plantations has degraded its natural habitat, which not only creates fragmented populations, but also leads to direct confrontation with people. Elephants are sometimes killed or harmed because they accidentally destroy crops as they move through farms and plantations. Some elephants are just the victim of unfortunate circumstances. It is estimated that around 20% of this subspecies has sustained injuries from illegal snares to catch smaller game.\nBorneo Elephant Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nThe reproductive habits of the Borneo elephant are not well studied, but based on what we know about other Asian elephants, several facts can be extrapolated. The most important element of male sexual behavior is a temporary condition called musth. During these periods, the male\u2019s hormones become elevated and the testes are enlarged. This allows the male in musth to compete with other elephants (who are usually not in musth) for the sexual rights of the female by wrestling, pushing, or ramming with their tusks. The weaker male will yield to the stronger male before these competitions turn too into a serious and deadly fight. This system tends to favor older males, because musth gains in intensity with age.\nAlthough elephants can mate all year round, it is believed that the female elephant is reproductively receptive for only a limited time of the year. She will demonstrate her sexual availability through various vocalizations and movements, triggering the males to compete for her affection. It is usually her choice whom she will mate with, but she prefers males who are in musth because it\u2019s a signal of strength and dominance.\nAfter copulation, the male will sometimes stay with the female just long enough to prevent her from mating with anyone else, but he otherwise plays no role in parental care. Once the father leaves, the female carries the young offspring for about 22 months, which is perhaps the longest of any mammalian species in the world. She produces only a single calf at a time, and rarely does she have twins. This is because the Asian elephant has an exceptionally long development time.\nAlthough they start out weighing more than 100 pounds, the calves need to a lot of growth before reaching their full size. The child will nurse on its mother\u2019s milk for at least two years after birth, but full weaning doesn\u2019t occur for almost four years. During this time, both the mother and her relatives will take an active role in the calf\u2019s development. They will provide the calf with protection and tutelage until it is ready to become independent. Because of the massive investments required to raise the offspring, she only breeds once every four to five years.\nBoth males and females tend to become sexually mature at around 10 to 15 years of age. If the elephant is stressed, then sexual maturity may be delayed by several more years. The typical life expectancy of this species is around 50 years in the wild, though some individuals can live up to 60 or 70 years.\nBorneo Elephant Population\nThe Borneo elephant is an endangered species with fewer than 1,500 individuals remaining in the wild. It is estimated that population numbers have fallen some 60% since 1980. In order to create more sustainable foresting practices, some organizations like the World Wildlife Fund are working with local plantation managers and owners near the elephant\u2019s habitat to create reforested wildlife corridors to enable the free movement between fragmented areas. This should also reduce conflicts with humans.\nBorneo Elephants in the Zoo\nThe Oregon Zoo has the only Borneo elephant in the United States: a female called Chendra. She was born in Sabah, Malaysia in 1993 and later found wandering around a palm oil plantation, hungry and alone, with wounds on her front legs and left eye. Unsuited for life in the wild, she came into the possession of the Oregon Zoo in 1999. Chendra is now housed at the elephant lands section along with other Asian elephants. This section has three interconnected outdoor spaces for the elephants to roam in, plus feeding stations, mud wallows, and a massive pool.\nView all 184 animals that start with B"}

The dominant tusk is referred to as the master tusk.\nElephant species are of the only surviving family, Elephantidae, within the Proboscidae order. There are currently three recognized extant elephant species in the world, African forest elephants, African bush elephants, and Asian elephants. Elephants are spread across a wide range in South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia, occupying deserts, forests, marshes, and savannahs. The life expectancy of elephants in the wild is 70 years. Among the three species of elephants, African bush elephants are the biggest land animals. Make elephants are usually larger and taller than female elephants. The smallest elephant species are the African forest elephants. There are around 326-351 bones in an elephant's skeleton. Asian elephants have 19-20 pairs of ribs, and African elephants have 21 pairs of ribs. An elephant's weight is carried by its pillar-like legs. Their limbs are more vertical than other animals to support the weight. Although 60% of an elephant's weight is carried by its front legs, both hind and forelegs carry an elephant's weight. Asian elephants and African bush elephants are recognized as endangered, and African bush elephants are currently critically endangered as per the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\nIf you enjoyed reading these facts about how much does a baby elephant weigh, then make sure to read some more interesting facts about how long do cats live and how long do rabbits live here at Kidadl.\nThe Average Weight Of Newborn Baby Elephant\nThe average newborn baby elephant weighs around 198.4-220.4 lb (90-100 kg).\nWild adult female elephants give birth to calves. Adult females produce one offspring and sometimes twins. Elephants may have twins around 1% of the time, unlike human beings who may have twins around 3.21% of the time. Calves or baby elephants are the center of attention in their family groups or herd and rely mostly on the mother for milk for up to three years of age like humans. Mothers provide all the nutrients that calves need through their milk. Baby elephants are precocial due to female elephants' long pregnancies. Most baby elephants are born at night. Usually, adult male elephants are heavier on average compared to adult female elephants. Baby elephants can reach up to 200 lb (90.7 kg) and can stand up to 3 ft (0.9 m) tall. Both African elephants and Asian elephants are 3 ft (0.9 m) tall. Cows or female elephants can give birth to calves that vary in weight, from 150-360 lb (68-163.2 kg). The largest elephant calf to be recorded was in San Diego Zoo in 2018, with a weight of around 281 lb (127.4 kg). This record was broken in 2020 by an elephant calf born in the Houston Zoo, which was a male Asian elephant weighing around 326 lb (147.8 kg).\nBaby elephants easily stand and walk an hour after birth. Babies need to stand to reach their mothers' bellies for their first milk. Elephants that are newly born do not eat using their trunks but not with the mouth. The range of African elephant habitat extends throughout the rainforest of West and Central Africa. In this part of Africa, African elephants have access to grasses, branches, roots, and leaves. An elephant calf only drinks milk for the first three months of life before adding a wide range of vegetation. Baby African forest elephants are around 200 lb (90.7 kg), African bush elephants are 260 lb (117.9 kg), and Asian elephants are around 200-250 lb (90.7-113.3 kg). Some Asian elephants may weigh around 150 lb (68 kg).\nHow much does a baby elephant weigh in tons?\nA baby can weigh anywhere between 0.077-0.113 tons (76-113 kg)\nThe gestation period lasts up to two years with intervals, which last up to four to five years. The gestation period of elephants compared to all mammals is the longest. African elephants usually have 22 months gestation period and Asian elephants' gestation is between 18-22 months. Elephants are also highly intelligent with large brains and the long gestation allows a calf to have a fully developed brain. Females reach their maturity earlier than males. Newborn babies communicate with mothers through the sense of smell, touch, and hearing as they have poor eyesight. Without precise control over their trunks, babies might even trip. Babies get control over the trunk after the second week. A calf that is a month old can hold and pick up things in its mouth, however, the calf will still not be able to suck up eater through the trunk and must use the mouth to drink water. Mother needs to stay close to her calf.\nAsian elephants weigh around 0.1-0.125 t (90-114 kg), some weighing around 0.075 t (150 lb). Baby African bush elephants weigh around 0.13 t (117 kg) and baby African forest elephants are 0.1 t (100 kg). It takes 15-25 years for elephants to get to their adult male or female size.\nHow much does a one-year-old baby elephant weigh?\nA year-old young elephant weighs around 930-1395 lb (422-633 kg).\nThe mother is protective of her newborn elephant and can get irritable od other herd members near her baby elephant. The baby elephant follows its mother and the herd members. Males will leave this animal herd once they mature and females will stay with the herd. After three months of age, these animals start to forage for leaves and grasses and readily drink water using their trunks. Leg and lip coordination occurs at this time. Until the age of six months, young elephants will continue to suckle on their mothers. Babies get foot, mouth, and trunk coordination by nine months of age. They gain full ability to feed, drink, and groom by the age of one year. The mother is still around till these young land animals reach two years of age to provide protection and nutrition. Females reach sexual maturity at the age of nine years and males around 14-15 years.\nBoth the extended pregnancy period and care from the mother elephant help this animal to develop properly. The weight range of a six-month-old young elephant is not exactly known. For the first 12 months of their life, they gain 2-3 lb (0.9-1.3 kg) every day, as per San Diego Zoo. Some elephants reach up to 560-840 lb (254-381 kg) at six months of age. Elephants will continue to grow at the same rate and in a year, they gain 730-1095 lb (331.1-496.6 kg). So, adding this weight, their average weight will be 930-1395 lb (421.8-632.7 kg) when they are one year old. The weight of elephants is impacted by a variety of factors like environment, food, and physical activity.\nHow much does a baby elephant weigh in stone?\nThe baby elephants at birth weigh on average around 19 stone.\nThere are loose aggregations and close family units of elephants. They also form a juvenile-care unit and nursing unit. A joint family consists of over two adult females with offspring. As males grow and mature they spend time at the edge of their family group and even associate with other males and families. Males usually stay alone or with other male elephants. Males and females get together for reproduction. Newborn baby elephants weigh 14-21 st (90-136 kg). At the age of six months, elephants weigh around 40-60 st (254-381 kg). After the age of one year, elephants reach 66-100 st (421-632 kg). When elephants reach their mature size and this size and weight varies from males to females. Adult mature females reach 429-571 st (2720-3628 kg) and adult mature males reach 357-1,000 st (2267-6350 kg).\nAs elephants reach their adult size, tusks replace their milk teeth around 6-12 months of age and continue to grow. Tusk sits in the socket of the elephant's skull. It is impossible to remove their tusks without harming elephants. This is one of the main threats faced by elephants. Human beings poach elephants for the ivory trade as their ivory tusks are highly profitable. There are other threats like conflicts with local human beings and habitat destruction.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly facts for everyone to enjoy!

(Amount, Feeding Habits) - Animal Ways", "url": "https://www.animalways.org/what-do-elephants-eat/", "text": "As the largest terrestrial animal, elephants consume a massive amount of food every day. As they have an enormous body, they consume a significant amount of food to stay alive. It is not surprising that their diet consists of a lot of unique food items. So, what do the elephants eat? Let\u2019s find out!.\nElephants are herbivore mammals with flat teeth that help them grind vegetation properly, such as grass, fruit, leaves, roots, bark, and bulbs. Herbivores only eat things that need photosynthesis to live.\nHow much food does an elephant eat?\nAn African elephant can consume up to 600 pounds of vegetation per day. Compared to that, smaller Asian elephants eat up to 300 pounds of food per day.\nFor example, if you fill one cup full of vegetation, you then times that amount by 300 or 600. That\u2019s the amount of food an elephant consumes a day!\nThese gentle giants tend to eat a lot, and they spend about 16-18 hours per day feeding. Apart from eating hundreds of pounds of food each day, an elephant drinks between 70-200 litres (15-50 gallons) of water in a single day, depending on the temperature. The hotter the weather, the more an elephant needs to drink.\nEating Habits\nThe amount of food an elephant consumes can change depending on its habitat, physical requirement, and food availability.\nFor example, the elephants living in the hot region tend to drink more than the elephants living in a lower temperate area. In some places of Africa, elephants have to travel hundreds of kilometres in search of water. In such cases, they drink vast amounts of water at one time to compensate for the loss of water from their body.\nHow far do elephants walk a day in search of food?\nElephants often take long and arduous journeys in search of water and food. Usually, elephants walk up to 50 miles a day to find sufficient food and water for their whole family.\nHow fast do elephants move?\nElephants have an average walking speed of 4.5 mph (7. km/h) and have an average running speed of 15 mph (24 km/h).\nHow long does it take an elephant to walk 50 miles per day?\nElephants have an average walking speed of 4.5 mph. The calculation time for elephants to walk 50 miles will take an elephant 11 hrs and 6 minutes.\nCompared to that, a human can walk 50 miles in 14 hrs and 17 minutes at an average speed of 3.5 mph.\nHerd Importance\nThe most important thing to an elephant is its family. The elephant family does not break up even when they get hungry. Instead, they stick together and walk long distances to find something to eat together. What helps an elephant put family or the herd first is that they are altruistic, meaning they are highly unselfish and greatly care for one another.\nWhat is a group of elephants called?\nA group of elephants is called a herd.\nWho is the leader of a herd of elephants?\nThe leader of an elephant herd is the oldest dominant female. This female is called the matriarch. Her responsibility is keeping the herd together, making travel decisions, and keeping a watchful eye over the herd.\nDiet\nAs the elephants are both browsers and grazers, they tend to eat many different types of vegetation. For example, elephants consume the leaves and bark of the plant. In The Wild, they do not discriminate between any plants. Elephants tend to feed on everything right from the grass to the trees.\nGrass\nFruit\nLeaves\nRoots\nBark\nBulbs\nSeeds\nFlowers\nSoil\nVegetables\n50% of what an elephant eats a day is made up of leaves. The other 50% is supplemented by the rest of the above items we have mentioned. While eating, elephants do not discriminate between various plants. They will willingly feed on grass as well as the leaves of big trees.\nTree bark is one of the favourite food items of elephants. Tree bark is the primary source of calcium for elephants. It also provides them with roughage and fibre, which helps them in their digestion process. They need to consume tree bark to get the necessary fibre content regularly.\nElephants also dig up soil to fulfil their salt and mineral requirements.\nYou can often see elephants in zoos or safari parks munching on hay. Hay is considered a major food component of elephants in captivity. Hay is chosen as one of the leading diet components of captive elephants because of its nutrition.\nCaptive elephants, compared to wild ones, have a good variety of fresh fruits and vegetables.\nElephants love to munch on apples, carrots, bananas, tomatoes, potatoes, turnips, and cabbages.\nHow many different species of elephants are there?\nRight now, there are only three living species of elephants still living in the world. They are the African Forest Elephants, the African Bush Elephant, and the Asian Elephants. All other elephant species that one time used to roam on earth are extinct. Some of the other elephant species had been extinct since the last ice age.\nHow many different species of elephants are there?\nAfrican Forest Elephants African Bush Elephant Asian Elephants\nRight now, poaching and human invasion are threatening the elephant population severely. The loss of habitat has created significant human-elephant conflict in many areas of Africa and Asia. It has also led to a further reduction in the number of wild elephants. Because of their size, elephants require many forest areas to roam around and consume food. Once the elephant visits a food area, they move from this place and only return once it gets re-vegetated.\nFacts\nElephants are brilliant animals, and they have excellent memory. They can clearly remember events from their early life and keep their memories intact throughout their lives.\nElephants use their trunks as a multipurpose tool. They primarily use their trunk for respiration. Other than that, they use it for smelling and as a hand. In some cases, elephants also pick up vibrations using their trunk.\nEven though it may seem very unlikely, elephants are great warriors as well. Thanks to their intelligence, size, and strength, these animals have proven very useful in warfare. In ancient India, Persia, and China, elephants were often used as the king\u2019s ride.\nWhen provoked, elephants can get angry pretty quickly. Thanks to their enormous strength, elephants can cause significant destruction when they are mad or upset.\nWhile browsing, elephants often uproot trees. While it may seem a bit destructive at first glance, this uprooting helps new trees to grow, leading to more vegetation. During the summer, elephants use their tusks to dig holes for exposing underground water.\nMost of the time, elephants die due to starvation. When they grow old, elephants lose all of their teeth. That means they find it hard to eat as they become old, which leads to starvation.\nElephants are very intelligent animals compared to other primates. An elephant\u2019s brain weighs about 5 kgs, which is just over three times heavier than a human brain.\nElephants have high altruistic emotions, which helps them in motherhood and within the family unit.\nHow many pounds of food does an Asian elephant eat?\nAsian Elephant\nAn adult elephant can consume up to 300 pounds of food in a single day. Asian elephants only eat vegetation, such as grasses, fruits, leaves, roots, bark, and bulbs. Herbivores only eat things that need photosynthesis to live.\nHow many pounds of food does an African elephant eat?\nAfrican Elephant\nAn adult elephant can consume up to 600 pounds of food in a single day. African elephants only eat vegetation, such as grasses, fruits, leaves, roots, bark, and bulbs. Herbivores only eat things that need photosynthesis to live.\nHow many litres of water does an elephant drink?\nDepending on the temperature, an elephant can drink between 70-200 litres (15-50 gallons) of water in a day.\nHow much milk does a baby elephant drink?\nElephant calves consume up to 20 pints of milk a day. The milk of an elephant is rich in nutrients, and the calf will drink this until they\u2019re about four months old!\nDo elephants love to eat bark?\nElephants love to eat tree bark, and it contains essential nutrients. They use their tusks to tear off strips of the trunk and peel away bits of bark for a tasty snack!\nSharing is a good thing to do!"}

Both males and females spend time at sea but their feeding habits and migration routes differ: males will follow a route that is more consistent, while females will vary their route in pursuit of prey. Elephant seals when in the water are solitary in nature, but they come together on the shore during mating season. There is a social hierarchy during the mating season, but males are less aggressive with each other when they come to land for molting. The nose of male acts as a kind of re-breather and is full of cavities designed to reabsorb the moisture from the seal's exhalations. During the mating season this is important, as the seals remain on the beach and do not feed, and so need to conserve body moisture because there is no incoming water."}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "All About Elephants - Physical Characteristics | SeaWorld Parks ...", "url": "https://seaworld.org/animals/all-about/elephants/characteristics/", "text": "Size\nAfrican elephants are the largest of all land animals, adult males weighing between 1,800 and 6,300 kg (2 and 7 tons/ 4,000 and 14,000 lb.). Females are smaller, weighing between 2,700 and 3,600 kg (3 and 4 tons/ 6,000 and 8,000 lb.). Shoulder height ranges between three and four m (9.8 and 13.1 ft.).\nAdult male Asian elephants weigh between 1,800 and 4,500 kg (2 and 5 tons/ 4,000 and 10,000 lb.), with females weighing slightly less. Shoulder height ranges between 2 and 3.5 m (6.6 and 11.5 ft.).\nTrunk\nThe elephant's trunk is an extension of the upper lip and nose. It functions for grasping, breathing, feeding, dusting, smelling, drinking, lifting, sound production/communication, defense/protection, and sensing.\nThe trunk contains an estimated 100,000 muscles and tendons in the trunk, giving it extreme flexibility and strength. Elephant trunks are capable of expanding, contracting, and moving in a diverse array of directions.\nAsian elephants have one finger-like projection at the tip of the trunk and African elephants have two. These finger-like projections have many sensitive nerve endings and are capable of fine motor skills, such as grasping small and delicate objects.\nAn adult Asian elephant can hold up to 8.5 L (2.2 gal.) of water in its trunk. Water is sprayed into the mouth for drinking and onto the back to keep cool.\nElephants' trunks and keen sense of smell are used to survey the environment. The trunk is raised and waived in the air to gather scent particles. Through the trunk, the scent particles are then carried to a specialized gland called the Jacobson's organ, located in the roof of the mouth. The Jacobson's organ is able to gather information about the elephant's surroundings by detecting and analyzing molecules and particles from the air. Through this process, elephants are capable of locating water sources up to 19.2 km (12 mi.) away and can even determine the reproductive status of distant elephants.\nElephants can reach vegetation as high as 5.7 m (19 ft.) by rearing up onto their hind legs and extending their trunk.\nSmall sensory hairs extend the length of the elephant's trunk enhance its sensitivity. These small hairs facilitate tactile communication during courtship and when caring for young.\nElephant trunks are very powerful-capable of uprooting an entire tree trunk, tearing down heavy branches, and delivering a forceful blow in self-defense.\nEars\nElephant ears are about one-sixth the size of its entire body and primarily function as a cooling mechanism. The ears contain extensive networks of tiny blood vessels, which are visible at the outer margins, where the skin is only about one to two mm (0.04 - 0.08 in.) thick. The warm blood cools as it circulates through the vessels in the ear, due to the thin layer of skin that separates it from the outside air. The cooler blood then circulates back into the body, helping reduce the overall body temperature of the elephant.\nThe size of elephant ears is proportionate to its geographic distribution. The closer to the equator the elephant resides, the larger the ears, allowing more heat to dissipate (remove) from the body, and therefore has larger ears. African elephants live closest to the equator and have the largest ears, followed by the Asian elephants. The now extinct woolly mammoth, lived near the North Pole, and had the smallest ears.\nElephants use their ears to funnel in sound waves from the environment, contributing to their keen sense of hearing.\nDentition\nBoth African and Asian elephants have a total of 26 teeth including two upper incisors (tusks), 12 premolars (non-permanent teeth similar to baby teeth), and 12 molars. Asian elephants have smaller tusks than those of African elephants and females have smaller tusks than males.\nEach adult male tusk weighs between 50 and 79 kg (110 - 175 lb.) and an adult female's tusk weighs between 18 and 20 kg (40 - 44 lb.). One of the heaviest tusks ever weighed was more than 100 kg (220 lb.).\nAfrican elephants have diamond-shaped ridges on their molars, whereas Asian elephants have long cylindrical ridges on theirs. The ridges help elephants grind course vegetation.\nMost mammals replace cheek teeth (premolars and molars) in a vertical manner. The new tooth develops and replaces the old one, from above in the upper jaw and from below in the lower jaw. In elephants, the replacement of the cheek teeth is a horizontal process. New teeth develop at the back of the mouth and progress forward until worn out at the front.\nEach molar tooth is about the size of a brick and weighs between 1.8 and 2.0 kg (4-4.5 lb.). Elephant molar teeth are replaced six times during its lifetime.\nElephants are born with temporary incisors (tusks) that are replaced with permanent ones between six and 13 months of age. Permanent tusks grow continuously at a rate of about 17 cm (6.7 in.) per year, reaching lengths of up to 3.5 m (7.7 ft.) for adult African male elephants.\nThe upper one-third of an elephant's tusk, where it is embedded in the bone of the upper jaw, is mostly hollow and carries a single nerve. The top third embedded portion of the tusk functions as an anchor when digging and uprooting vegetation and aids defense.\nElephant ivory is distinguished from other animal dentition by its unique cross section patterning. An elephant tusk cross section shows diamond-shaped striations, called \"engine turning\" and is unique to elephants.\nSimilar to humans, elephants may be \"left or right-handed,\" meaning there is a preference to use one tusk over the other. As a result, one tusk may be more worn than the other.\nMusth Gland/Temporal Gland\nAsian and African elephants have a musth gland located just beneath the skin's surface, halfway between the eye and ear on each side of their head.\nThe musth gland may be associated with sexual activity and/or communication.\nAnnually, musth glands secrete a dark, oily, musky substance and become inflamed. This physiological change is associated with a behavior observed in male elephants called musth.\nRefer to musth in the Behavior section.\nFoot\nThe skeleton of an elephant's foot is angled, with a large pad of fat and connective tissue at the heel. The angled foot structure means that elephants walk on their tiptoes with their body weight evenly distributed across the fatty/connective tissue at the heel. Ex: An adult male Asian elephant that is 2.88 m (9.5 ft.) in height and weighs about 4,167 kg (9,259 lb.) distributes just 3.8 kg (8.5 lb.) of weight per square inch on its heels.\nThe elephant's unique foot structure enables secure movement over uneven terrain and swampy ground.\nSkin\nElephant skin is wrinkled in appearance, with African elephants more wrinkled than Asian elephants. Wrinkles act as a cooling mechanism by increasing the skin's surface area. The additional skin and wrinkles trap moisture, which then takes longer to evaporate. Therefore, wrinkles keep elephants cooler, for longer, than if they had smooth skin.\nAsian elephants are less wrinkled in appearance than African elephants because they primarily inhabit forested habitats. Temperatures are not as hot in forested areas, thereby reducing the need for forest-dwelling elephants to cool themselves.\nElephant skin can be up to 3.8 cm (1.5 in.) thick in certain places. However, the skin is sensitive to touch, detecting insects and changes in its environment.\nThe combination of thick skin and a thin layer of fat beneath the skin enable the elephant to tolerate cold temperatures.\nOverall skin coloration for elephants is grey. However, Asian elephants have a freckled appearance due to distinct patches of depigmentation, especially on the trunk.\nHair\nElephants have sparse hair distributed unevenly on their body, with the most noticeable concentrations around the eyes, ear openings, chin, and tail.\nYoung elephants are hairier than adults and their hair is reddish-brown in color. As they mature, the amount of hair is reduced and becomes darker.\nInternal Organs\nBrain\nElephants have the largest brain of any land mammal, weighing between 4.5 to 5.5 kg (10-12 lb.).\nElephants have highly developed cerebrums and cerebellums- portions of the brain involved in movement and muscle coordination.\nElephants have large temporal lobes-portions of the brain which facilitate memory.\nElephants have excellent long-term memory and are capable of remembering experiences for long periods of time. Research has shown that elephants are able to recognize other herd members decades after they have last interacted with them.\nHeart\nThe average weight for an elephant heart is about 12 to 21 kg (26.5-46.3 lb.) and comprises about 0.5% of the animal's total body weight.\nElephants have an atypical shaped heart. Most mammals, including humans, have a single-pointed apex at the base (heart-shaped). Elephants have a double-pointed apex at the base, lessening the heart-shaped appearance, and giving it a more circular shape.\nStomach and Intestines\nElephants have a cylindrical-shaped stomach. The stomach primarily functions in food storage. Digestion takes place in the cecum (pouch connected to the large intestine). The combined length of the small and large intestines is about 35 m (100 ft.) in length.\nLungs\nMost mammals breathe air by expanding their chest, through muscular action. When the chest is expanded, a membrane (visceral pleura) attached to the lungs remains still while another membrane (parietal pleura) attached to the chest wall expands outward. The fluid-filled space between the two membranes is called the pleural cavity which widens during chest expansion. The widened pleural cavity helps create a vacuum-like effect, allowing air to be pulled into the lungs.\nThis process differs in elephants because they do not have a pleural cavity. Their lungs are directly attached to the chest wall and therefore rely on direct muscular action to expand the lungs. This direct muscular control enables underwater breathing with the trunk used as a snorkel."}

Elephants know every member of their herd and are able to recognize up to 30 companions by sight or smell.\n2. They can remember and distinguish particular cues that signal danger and can recall locations long after their last visit.\n3. An elephant\u2019s memory is not limited to its herd, nor is it limited to its species. In one instance, two circus elephants that performed together rejoiced when crossing paths 23 years later. Elephants have also recognized humans that they once bonded with after decades apart.\n4. The elephant boasts the largest brain of any land mammal as well as an impressive encephalization quotient (the size of the animal\u2019s brain relative to its body size). The elephant\u2019s EQ is nearly as high as a chimpanzee\u2019s.\n5. The elephant brain is remarkably similar to the human brain, with as many neurons and synapses, as well as a highly developed hippocampus and cerebral cortex.\n6. Elephants are one of the few non-human animals to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n7. The elephant\u2019s large cerebral cortex allows them to be great problem solvers, which elephants display in many creative ways.\n8. Don\u2019t try to outsmart an elephant! They have an understanding of basic arithmetic and can even keep track of relative quantities.\n9. Elephants communicate using everything from body signals to infrared rumbles that can be heard from kilometers away. Their understanding of syntax suggests that they have their own language and grammar.\n10. Elephants can recognize 12 distinct tones of music and recreate melodies.\n11. Elephants are the only non-human animals to mourn their dead, performing burial rituals and returning to visit graves.\n12. Elephants are one of the few species who can recognize themselves in the mirror.\nGiven what we now know about elephants, and what they continue to teach us about animal intelligence, it is more important than ever to make sure that these magnificent creatures do not vanish.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "The Intelligence of Elephants: How Smart Are They? - My Animals", "url": "https://myanimals.com/animals/wild-animals-animals/the-intelligence-of-elephants-how-smart-are-they/", "text": "The Intelligence of Elephants: How Smart Are They?\n4 minutes\nWe've all heard the phrase \"memory of an elephant.\" However, this isn't just by chance! In fact, many studies show that elephants have significant cognitive abilities and emotional intelligence.\nLast update: 15 June, 2020\nYou must have heard the expression \u201cthe memory of an elephant.\u201d Well, what may have just seemed like a saying is now supported by science. Various studies confirm the cognitive potential of these giant land mammals. To learn more about the intelligence of elephants, read on!\nThe brain structure of elephants\nElephants have the largest brains among land animals. In fact, their brains weigh more than 11 pounds. In addition, an elephant\u2019s brain has more intense gyral patterns than the brains of primates and humans. However, these patterns are less complex than those in dolphins and other cetaceans, for example.\nOn the other hand, the pure volume of an elephant\u2019s cortex allows for a huge range of cognitive processing. This is the result of a high level of neural capacity. In fact, experts believe that elephants have a superior neural capacity to any primate or cetacean. As we\u2019ll see below, this translates into different types of intelligence.\nA highly developed brain network\nAn elephant has a complex and sophisticated brain structure. With more than 250 billion neurons, their brain structure is similar to that of a human. In fact, an elephant\u2019s cerebral cortex actually has the same number of neurons and synapses as a human\u2019s does.\nSo what does all of this tell us? First, this indicates that the intelligence of elephants is on a par \u2013 in a general way \u2013 with the intelligence of dolphins and chimpanzees. Furthermore, elephants have the same cognitive capacity for the use and manufacture of tools as humans. In fact, they skillfully use their trunk as an arm to manipulate objects.\nBetter understanding the intelligence of elephants\nMany classical civilizations recognized and admired the intelligence of elephants. Aristotle, the Greek philosopher and author of Metaphysics, claimed that elephants outperformed all other animals in brainpower and ingenuity.\nWithout a doubt, these statements are due to the observation of the cognitive, social, and emotional capacity of these remarkable mammals.\nElephants, whether Asian or African, demonstrate a remarkable variety of behaviors and expressions. In addition, various studies verify that these animals experience psychological grief after the loss of a loved one.\nTheir empathy and sociability are so evolved that they understand altruism, maternal care, cooperation, and compassion for their brothers.\nGestures and non-verbal language\nA large number of synapses in their cerebral cortex allows elephants to understand nonverbal language very well. In addition, experts assume that the size of the cortex is also associated with a high capacity for mimicry.\nElephants not only imitate human gestures, but also the sounds of their environment. This is a skill that experts have only seen in cetaceans, primates, bats, and birds.\nAnother curious and prominent ability of elephants is the ability to understand games. For example, researches have observed African pachyderms playing with water or other objects from their habitat on several occasions.\nProblem solving\nPerhaps one of the most remarkable indications of intelligence in elephants is the ability to solve problems. For example, in their natural habitat, these mammals can radically change their behavior to deal with adverse situations.\nThese are all demonstrations characteristic of complex intelligence, similar to the intelligence of humans and primates.\nStudies and tests\nIn 2010, some elephants participated in an interesting study. The task was to simultaneously grasp both ends of a rope to win a prize.\nThe objective was to observe cooperative ability and the ability to work together. The results placed elephants at the same level as chimpanzees in terms of cooperative capacity. However, some accidental events also demonstrated their ability to deal with new challenges.\nOne of these studies looked at an Asian elephant in the United States. Nicknamed Bandula, this animal was incredible! He was able to open various devices that secured his chains. This includes an Inglefield clip, which must be perfectly aligned in order to open.\nElephant memory\nWe know that elephants have outstanding cognitive abilities, but is it true that they have very good memories?\nThese pachyderms also possess a large, complex hippocampus. The hippocampus is the brain structure that belongs to the limbic system. Its main function is to process certain types of memory, mainly spatial memory.\nThe dimensions of an elephant\u2019s hippocampus exceed those of any primate, cetacean, or human being. Furthermore, the hippocampus takes up more than 0.7% of their brain structures, compared to 0.5% in humans.\nAs a result of the neural volume and its significant functionality, elephants have a truly unique memory. Researchers have proven this in numerous scientific studies, but experts have also observed behaviors in the wild.\nIt might interest you..."}

It\u2019s a fact that usually doesn\u2019t make it into all those nature documentaries, but animals are alive\u2014and being alive is pretty disgusting.\nAnimals have all the filthy habits we humans enjoy, but they work in a few more that we\u2019d never even imagine. Some of your favorite animals are genetically built to do some absolutely retch-inducing things that we usually don\u2019t talk about. Once you\u2019ve read this article, you\u2019ll never look at an animal the same way again.\n10 Fruit Fly Swarms Are Really Just Massive Orgies\nIf you\u2019ve ever swatted your hand through a throng of fruit flies swarming over a random point in your house, we\u2019ve got news for you. To those fruit flies, you were a bigger buzzkill than you realized. You broke up their orgy.\nThose big, chaotic fruit fly swarms are basically swinger parties, and they\u2019re crazy. The fruit flies pair off and start building up the mood with what animal experts describe as\u2014and we apologize in advance for this mental image\u2014\u201coral sexual foreplay.\u201d Once they\u2019ve built up a little romance, they get right into it. Two fruit flies, who only live for 40 days, will make love for an impressive 20 minutes.\nBut it doesn\u2019t end there. After they\u2019re done with their first partner, the female fruit flies will try out a few of the other males there. With their biology, the last male she sleeps with is going to be the one who gets her pregnant, so they actually have these orgies to test out different lovers before settling on a baby daddy.\nSo, if you\u2019ve ever swatted your hand through a fruit fly orgy, you might want to wash it.\n9 Petting Birds Turns Them On\nHave you ever petted a bird? Have you ever stroked your finger down its back and had it cuddle up to you? It might\u2019ve seemed like a cute moment between an owner and a pet to you, but to your bird, that was a wildly different experience. That was foreplay.\nMost birds treat a stroke from the head down to the back as the start of a mating ritual. They don\u2019t take it as some cute scratches; they take it as a sign that you\u2019re game for anything. They get sexually aroused, and they\u2019ll often start heavily panting with excitement.\nIf they\u2019re really into it, they\u2019ll let you know\u2014by vomiting on you. If you really get a bird going, it\u2019ll want to offer you regurgitated food, so it\u2019ll throw up all over you and hope you get the signal. If you treat them right, they\u2019re telling you, there\u2019s more vomited-up food where that came from.\nThey\u2019ll even get violent when they realize that you aren\u2019t living up to your end of the bargain. When the bird realizes you\u2019re not going to put out, they can lash out, and you\u2019ll have an angry, horny, sexually frustrated bird pecking at you.\n8 You\u2019ve Probably Eaten Beaver Anal Secretions\nThere\u2019s a decent chance you\u2019ve taken a big bite of beaver anal secretions\u2014or at least sprayed some on your face. You probably didn\u2019t realize it because on the ingredient list, it comes up as \u201ccastoreum\u201d\u2014or, even more often, just as \u201cnatural flavors\u201d\u2014but that\u2019s exactly what castoreum is: beaver anal secretions. And it\u2019s what gives ice cream and perfume that extra kick.\nCastoreum is the yellowish secretion of a beaver\u2019s castor sac, which is basically the bladder they use to mark their territory. It\u2019s full of anal liquids and urine, all mixed together, and it\u2019s been used for years to bring out the flavor in vanilla ice cream, add a musky aftertaste to cigarettes, and add a fruity note to perfumes.\nIt isn\u2019t as common of an ingredient as it used to be, but that\u2019s not because it\u2019s gross. It\u2019s because adding a drip of beaver anal secretions to ice cream is costly. Today, a sprinkle of beaver anus is a delicacy reserved for the finest of luxury brands.\n7 Some Frogs Will Make Homes Out Of Elephant Dung\nThe ornate narrow-mouthed frog is a tiny animal, only 2.5 centimeters (1 in) long. It can be found in the forests and savannas of Southeast Asia, often making a home under a bed of fallen leaves\u2014or if there aren\u2019t any leaves handy, inside a giant, stinking mound of elephant dung.\nElephant dung, as it turns out, makes a great home so long as you can handle the smell. Not only does the frog get shelter from the Sun\u2019s beating rays, but they also get a smorgasbord of foods. They can pick away at the insects crawling through it, and when there aren\u2019t enough bugs to eat, they munch away at the leftover chunks of food the elephant didn\u2019t fully digest.\nThese amphibians aren\u2019t the only animals living in the dung. As respected biologist Ahimsa Campos-Arceiz wrote in his scientific report, \u201cShit Happens (to be Useful),\u201d \u201cA dung pile can become a small ecosystem on its own,\u201d because so many animals are eager to move right into a pile of elephant poop and make it a home they can call their own.\n6 Proboscis Monkeys Taunt Each Other With Rage-Ons\nWhen male proboscis monkeys are mad at you, they let you know. They\u2019ll jump up and down, shake branches, and bare their teeth\u2014and they\u2019ll sprout a boner of pure hatred.\nProboscis monkeys don\u2019t get turned on by being mad; they\u2019re permanently erect. Every moment of every day, proboscis monkeys are sporting a stiffy. When they get angry, though, they make sure you see it. They\u2019ll spread their legs apart as wide as they can and thrust it at you.\nThis isn\u2019t even one of those things that only happens some of the time. It\u2019s the proboscis monkey\u2019s go-to answer to every threat. When they think a fight is about to go down, they might hold off on snarling until things get really dangerous. But they\u2019ll immediately engage in\u2014to use the scientific term\u2014\u201cerect penis displays.\u201d\n5 Falcon Breeders Let Birds Copulate With Their Heads\nJet coppulating on hat\nWatch this video on YouTube\nIf a falcon was bred in captivity, there\u2019s a good chance its life didn\u2019t start with a mommy and daddy falcon who loved each other very much. Falcon breeders tend to take a slightly stranger approach to getting a new brood of babies in their home.\nIt starts with the falcon breeder \u201cimprinting\u201d a male falcon\u2014or, to drop the euphemism, trying to get it sexually aroused. The breeder will do mating dances and make calls at the falcon to get him in the mood, and if all goes well, that falcon will fly onto the breeder\u2019s head and get busy.\nThe breeders wear special hats that lets them catch the falcon\u2019s semen, which they can then inject into a female falcon\u2019s eggs. That sounds pretty clinical, but it\u2019s every bit as weird. Before the breeder can inject the female\u2019s eggs, he has to flirt with the female falcon, too. She won\u2019t let him inject the eggs unless she is, as one guide puts it, sexually aroused enough to \u201cpresent herself for copulation.\u201d\n4 The Greater Short-Horned Lizard Squirts Blood Out Of Its Eyes\nBlood Squirting Lizard | National Geographic\nWatch this video on YouTube\nWhen it feels threatened, the greater short-horned lizard has a defense mechanism straight out of a horror story. It fights back by shooting blood out of its eye sockets\u2014and the blood goes a good distance, too. These things can splatter their enemies with gore from 1.2 meters (4 ft) away.\nThe reptiles have muscles that can cut off the blood flow in the veins around their eyes and redirect it so that the blood goes shooting out like a water gun. This sounds like a suicide move, but for reasons nobody fully understands, they can pretty much shoot blood out of their eyes all day without getting tired.\nThey squirt blood out for everything, too. This isn\u2019t just something they do as an absolute last resort. If one of these lizards so much as gets a speck of dust in his eye, he\u2019ll get it out by weeping blood.\n3 Several Species Of Birds Keep Cool By Defecating On Themselves\nThere\u2019s a trick called urohidrosis (not \u201curohydrosis\u201d) that some birds\u2014including storks, condors, flamingos, and vultures\u2014use to keep themselves cool. Here\u2019s how it works, in case you want to try it at home: First, you defecate on your own feet. Then, you just kind of spend the rest of the day going around with poop on your feet and not doing anything about it.\nIt\u2019s a strange way of dealing with a sunny day, but it\u2019s so common that it\u2019s believed to be more or less the bird equivalent to sweating. Except that, instead of water, these birds sweat a mixture of feces and urine onto their own legs.\nThe white fecal powder left over helps protect them from the Sun\u2014but it\u2019s still a pretty terrible way to keep cool. If they don\u2019t clean it off in time, the birds can end up getting bruises on their legs from having too much poop on them.\nSo, next time you feel gross because you\u2019re all sweaty, just remember that it could be a whole lot worse.\n2 Bored Ducks Become Cannibals\nDucks don\u2019t like being bored. In nature, that\u2019s not a big problem. Ducks aren\u2019t addicted to iPads; if they\u2019re bored, they\u2019ll go out and find some interesting new part of a river to splash in. But when they\u2019re in captivity, it gets a lot harder for a duck to find a constructive way to use all that energy, so they find their own ways to keep themselves entertained\u2014by visiting their friends, murdering them, and cannibalizing their bodies.\nIn a firsthand account of a duck-on-duck massacre, one witness described a Muscovy grabbing another duck\u2019s soon-to-hatch egg: \u201cThe male Muscovy cracked the egg open and bit down on the fully formed chick within,\u201d he said. \u201cWith a snapping upturn of his head, he then swallowed the duckling whole.\u201d And all this while the parents were watching. Brutal.\nThe only way to stop a bloodthirsty duck on a cannibalistic killing spree is to trim his beak so that he can\u2019t use it anymore. And this is actually a common enough problem that you can buy beak-trimming machines, custom-made for the specific purpose of stopping the all-duck Donner Party reenactment from going on in your backyard.\n1 After Scorpions Shed Their Tails, They Die Of Constipation\nPLoS ONE : Scorpion Sheds \u2018Tail\u2019 to Escape: Consequences and Implications of Autotomy\u2026\nWatch this video on YouTube\nWhen scorpions get caught by their stingers, they can still get away. They will writhe and wiggle until their tails fall off. The severed stinger will keep trying to pierce the attacker, keeping it busy while the scorpion gets away. That all sounds like a supercool and practical defense mechanism\u2014as long as you stop reading right here.\nThe problem is that a scorpion\u2019s tail has more than just a stinger. It\u2019s where they keep their anuses, too, and the tail doesn\u2019t grow back. The scorpions are constipated for the rest of their lives. They\u2019re physically incapable of relieving themselves, so their insides gradually fill up with poop until they explode.\nBut even that doesn\u2019t happen quickly. The scorpions can spend eight months in agony before they finally get to die. When they get clogged up, the raw pressure of the excreta in their bodies gets so intense that another part of their tail blows off, and then they start filling up again.\nWhen every section of their tails have exploded in a disgusting mess, the scorpion will clog up one last time and explode, experiencing one of the most painful deaths imaginable. Finally, after eight months of agonizing pain, the scorpion will die\u2014because it is literally too full of crap to live.\nfact checked by Jamie Frater"}

The details of animal mating can be titillating, amusing, and just plain weird, all at the same time.\nMale Alligators Have Permanent Erections BirdImages / Getty Images Penises vary widely across the animal kingdom, but a universal theme is that this organ changes size or shape before or during the act of mating, then reverts to its \"usual\" configuration. That's not so for alligators. The males are endowed with permanently erect penises, layered with numerous coats of the stiff protein collagen, that lurk inside their cloacas (chambers that contain digestive and reproductive organs), then burst out suddenly like the baby alien from John Hurt's stomach in \"Alien.\" The six-inch-long penis of an alligator isn't everted, or turned outward, by muscles, but by the application of pressure on its abdominal cavity, clearly an essential bit of reptilian foreplay.\nFemale Kangaroos Have Three Vaginas Tom Brakefield / Getty Images Female kangaroos (all marsupials, for that matter) possess three vaginal tubes but only one vaginal opening, eliminating any confusion on the part of their mates. When males inseminate females, their sperm travels up either (or both) of the side tubes, and about 30 days later the tiny joey travels down the central tube, from which it slowly makes its way to its mother's pouch for the remainder of its gestation.\nAntechinus Males Copulate Themselves to Death Wikimedia Commons The antechinus, a tiny, mouselike marsupial of Australia, would be almost anonymous except for one odd fact: During their brief mating season, the males of this genus copulate with females for up to 12 hours straight, stripping their bodies of vital proteins in the process and dismantling their immune systems. Shortly afterward, the exhausted males drop dead, and the females go on to bear litters with mixed paternity (different babies have different fathers). The moms live a bit longer to nurture their young, but they usually die within the year, having had the opportunity to breed only once.\nFlatworms Fence With Their Sex Organs Wikimedia Commons Flatworms are among the simplest invertebrate animals on earth, lacking well-defined circulatory and respiratory organs and eating and pooping via the same body opening. But all bets are off during mating season: The hermaphroditic critters, which possess male and female sex organs, sprout pairs of dagger-like appendages and fence in slow motion until a \"hit\" is scored, straight into the other's skin. The \"loser\" is impregnated with sperm and becomes the mother, while the \"father\" often goes on dueling until it becomes a mother itself, further complicating the confused gender roles.\nMale Porcupines Urinate on Females Before Sex Lisa Barrett / EyeEm / Getty Images Once a year, male porcupines cluster around available females, fighting, biting, and scratching one another for the right to mate. The winner then climbs onto a tree branch and urinates copiously on the female, which stimulates her to go into estrus. The rest is somewhat anticlimactic: The female folds back her quills so as not to impale her partner, and more routine insemination takes only a few seconds.\nBarnacles Have Enormous Penises Pramothy Chiy Di / EyeEm / Getty Images You might imagine that an animal that spends its entire life tethered to one spot has a relatively sedate sex life. In fact, though, barnacles (one shouldn't say \"male\" barnacles since these animals are hermaphroditic) are equipped with the largest penises, relative to their size, of any creatures on earth, as much as eight times longer than their bodies. Essentially, frisky barnacles unfurl their organs and attempt to fertilize every other barnacle in their immediate vicinity, at the same time, presumably, being probed and prodded themselves.\nMating Snails Stab Each Other With 'Love Darts' Wikimedia Commons Some hermaphroditic species of snails and slugs wield the invertebrate equivalent of Cupid's arrows\u2014sharp, narrow projectiles made of calcium or hard proteins\u2014as a preliminary to the act of mating. One of these \"love darts\" pokes into the receiving snail's skin, sometimes penetrating its internal organs, and introduces a chemical causing it to be more receptive to the attacking snail's sperm. These darts don't introduce sperm into the \"female's\" body; that happens the old-fashioned way, during the act of copulation.\nFemale Chickens Can Eject Unwanted Sperm Paula Sierra / Getty Images Female chickens, or hens, tend to be smaller than roosters and often can't resist less-than-desirable males insistent on mating. After the act, though, enraged or disappointed females can eject up to 80% of the offending male's sperm, allowing for the possibility that they might then be impregnated by roosters higher up in the pecking order.\nMale Honeybees Lose Their Penises While Mating Rene Nortje / EyeEm / Getty Images Everyone talks about colony collapse disorder, which is devastating bee populations worldwide, but not many people seem to care about the peculiar plight of the individual drone honeybee. Before a queen bee can assume her exalted title, she begins her life as a virgin bee and must be inseminated by a male to step up to the throne. That's where the unfortunate drone comes in: In the course of mating with the heir apparent, the male's penis rips off, still inserted into the female, and he flies off to die. Given the gruesome fate of male honeybees, it's no surprise that full-grown queens deliberately breed them for use in their \"mating yards.\"\nSheep Have a High Rate of Homosexuality Apostoli Rossella / Getty Images Homosexuality is an inherited biological trait in some members of the animal kingdom, and nowhere is homosexuality more rife than among male sheep. By some estimates, almost 10 percent of rams prefer to mate with other rams rather than females. Lest you think this is the unintended result of human husbandry, studies have shown that the behavior of these sheep is reflected in a specific area of their brains, the hypothalamus, and is a hard-wired rather than learned behavior.\nMale Anglerfish Merge With Females During Mating Wikimedia Commons Anglerfish, which lure their prey with fleshy structures growing from their heads, live in the deep ocean and are relatively scarce, producing a limited supply of available females. But nature finds a way: The males of some anglerfish species are orders of magnitude smaller than the opposite sex and literally attach themselves to, or \"parasitize,\" their mates, feeding them a constant supply of sperm. It's believed that this evolutionary trade-off allows the females to grow to \"normal\" sizes and thus prosper in the food chain. What happens to males who don't find receptive females? They die, sadly, and become fish food."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "African Elephant Facts - Elephants For Africa", "url": "https://www.elephantsforafrica.org/elephant-facts/", "text": "Frequently asked questions Where do elephants come from?\nThere are three species of elephants in the world, and where each one can be found depends on the species.\nIn Africa, there are two species of elephant. The loxodonta africana African elephant lives in the African Savannah and in the Sahel desert in Mali. This is the biggest species of elephant in the world. The slightly smaller loxodonta cyclotis African elephant lives in the rainforests of Central and West Africa.\nWhere once elephants roamed across the whole of Africa, they are now limited to conservation areas and the Savannah. African and Asian elephants can currently be found in 37 African countries, and across 13 Asian countries.\nThe elephas maixmus species of elephant (Asian elephant) can be found in Nepal, India and Southeast Asia in scrub forests and rain forests.\nHow many elephants are there in Africa and why are African elephants endangered?\nThere are now only an estimated 400,000 African elephants left in the wild.\nAfrican elephants are endangered largely owing to man\u2019s greed for ivory which had to elephants being hunted and killed for their valuable tusks. To give you an idea of just how many elephants are lost to the ivory trade, in the 1970's there were 1.3 million elephants. Less than a third of that number are now left. African Forest Elephants living in the forests of the Basin are at the greatest risk from the threat of poachers than any other species and their numbers continue to steadily decline.\nMoreover, humans are responsible for huge habit loss of African elephants. As the human population in Africa increases, more and more land is converted to agriculture. A smaller habit has meant that elephants and humans are coming into contact with one another more than they did historically, and this is causing conflict. Elephants are very intelligent creature and sometimes raid farmers\u2019 crop for food. This can lead to both humans and elephants being killed in the conflict.\nHow much does the average elephant weigh?\nAfrican elephants are the largest land animals in the world today. The average African elephant will weigh between 5,000 to 14,000 lbs. (2,268 to 6,350 kg), according to the National Geographic. However, the largest African elephant ever recorded was found in Angola, rocking in at a massive 24,000 lb (11,000 kg).\nMale elephants can grow to be significantly larger than their female counterparts. Still a mighty animal, female elephants, or \u201cCows\u201d, only grow to weigh from 6,000 to 8,000 pounds.\nAsian elephants tend to be a smaller than their African counterparts, weighing between 4,400 to 11,000 Ibs (2,000 to 5,000 kg).\nHow tall is an elephant?\nAfrican elephants are the largest land animals in the world today. The average African elephant will grow to between 8.2 to 13 feet (2.5 to 4 m) tall, measured from shoulder to toe, according to the National Geographic.\nMale elephants can grow to be significantly larger than their female counterparts. Still a mighty animal, female elephants, or \u201cCows\u201d, only grow to somewhere between 9 and 13 feet.\nAsian elephants are smaller and tend to reach a shoulder height of between 6.6 and 11.5 feet (2 and 3.5 m) tall.\nWhat do African elephants eat?\nElephants are herbivores and only eat grasses, herbs, fruit, plants and trees.\nHow much does an elephant eat a day?\nElephants are gigantic animals and this means that they need to find an eat an awful lot of food. Their daily food intake is almost as much as 4-7% of their body weight. African elephants can eat as much as 330 Ibs (150 kg) of food a day.\nWhat is elephant dung and how much does elephant poop weigh?\nMuch of the grasses and plants that elephants eat aren\u2019t actually digested by elephants so this simply comes out in their dung. In fact, because of this, some animals like monkeys and dung beetles actually eat elephant dung!\nAnd there\u2019s plenty of it around. Our elephant friends can deposit upwards of 150 kg of dung daily! Eew!\nHow do elephants have sex?\nFemale elephants are generally ready to become a mum at around 15-16 years old. A male can tell when a female is ready to mate from the chemical signs she leaves in her urine and faeces. This, combined with the characteristic calls of that time, ensures that all the local males will know when the time is right to compete for her affections.\nFemale elephants must have a thing for the older man, as males do not come into their prime until they are between 30-35 years of age. Around this time, they experience period of \u201cmusth\u201d. Musth is a periodic condition in bull elephants that is characterised by highly aggressive behaviour and is accompanied by a large rise in reproductive hormones.\nRumour has it that elephants mate for life. Whilst this is not necessarily true, animal scientist have proven that they will never stray far from mating partners.\nHow do elephants give birth?\nLike other mammals, female elephants give birth to fairly developed babies via her birth canal.\nAn elephant pregnancy lasts around 22 months, meaning that new born baby elephants are not small! A baby elephant is called a calf and can weigh between 200 and 300 lbs and stand about 3 feet (1 m) tall.\nHow many babies do elephants have?\nTypically, elephants only give birth to one calf at a time, although twins do sometimes occur. In her lifetime (elephants can live for up to 70 years in the wild!), a female elephant can give birth to as many as 12 calves.\nNot as many as babies you might think? Well that\u2019s because the average gestation (pregnancy) period for a female elephant is a whopping 22 months. That\u2019s a long time!\nHow many teeth do elephants have?\nElephants usually have 26 teeth at any one time. Throughout their lives, elephants have six sets of teeth that grow one set after another. By the time they reach their 50's, most elephant have started to use their final set which is needed to last for the rest of their life.\nWhy do elephants flap their ears?\nAfrican elephants are famous for their very large ears. They are designed this way to pump blood around them to help cool the elephant down under the hot African sun. The more the ears flap, the hotter the elephant is.\nHow thick is elephant skin?\nThe skin of an elephant can be up to 2.5 cm thick in places. Despite this, elephants have very sensitive skin and use mud and dust baths to protect their skin from burning in the sun, and to get rid of skin parasites.\nHow far do elephants walk in a day?\nDespite their massive size, elephants are actually pretty nimble and can walk up to 195 km per day, although they usually only average is only 25 km on a daily basis.\nHow much does an elephant's brain weigh?\nElephants are extremely intelligent creatures and an elephant\u2019s brain can weigh as much as 4-6 kg. No wonder they say that an elephant never forgets!\nHow long is an elephant's trunk?\nAn elephant\u2019s trunk is usually around 6 feet in length, but can be up to 7 feet long. The trunk alone can weigh as much as 140 kg and can hold 12 litres of water.\nHow fast do elephants run?\nElephants can run faster than you would expect, easily reaching speeds of 40 mph - a lot faster than us humans can run!"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Amazing facts about elephants that you probably did not know", "url": "https://www.oysterworldwide.com/news/interesting-facts-about-elephants/", "text": "Elephants are fascinating creatures. Being the largest of all land mammals on Earth, many aspects of their huge anatomy are a source of amazement themselves, whilst their high level of social development makes them an intriguing subject for observation. Furthermore, we are increasingly learning that they play a vital role in the natural environment, and in maintaining the balance of fragile ecosystems. Unfortunately however, decades of negative interactions with humans have reduced the numbers of these gentle giants significantly. Read on to learn more about these incredible creatures, and what you can do to help protect and conserve their populations.\nBefore we begin however, it may be important to clear up the all important question of how many species of elephant are there? Quite simply, there are two distinct species: the African elephant and the Asian elephant. Over many years however, there have been debates about how many types of elephants are there \u2013 and the general consensus is that there are two further subspecies of the African elephant. These are forest elephants and savannah elephants.\n10 interesting facts about the anatomy of elephants:\nAsian elephants are slightly smaller than their African counterparts, and have proportionally smaller ears. Their skin is normally dark grey or brown, but they often have pink or yellow marks on their face, ears and trunk. The African elephant has the largest brain in the animal kingdom \u2013 it can weight up to 5kg! This is amazing when you consider how much does an elephant weigh (Asian elephants weigh about 5400kg, and African elephants up to 6000kg!). The human brain, however, is larger when measured as a proportion of our total body weight. The average life span of an elephant is 50-70 years, but the oldest known elephant in the world was 86 when he died. Elephants walk at about 4mph, and they are able to swim long distances. They are, however, the only mammal which can\u2019t jump. How fast can elephants run? Elephants have been clocked to run at 15 mph, however it is believed that, over a very short sharp distance, elephants could run as fast as 25mph. Adult elephants spend about 16 hours a day eating \u2013 they require up to 300kg of food and 160 litres of water each day. Elephants have 6 sets of molar teeth, upon which they depend for survival. When the last set is lost, the animal is unable to eat and eventually dies of starvation. An elephant\u2019s trunk is a very impressive multi-tool. Besides being a long nose used for smelling, breathing and trumpeting, it is also used as a hand to grab things \u2013 it is sensitive enough to pick up a blade of grass, and strong enough to rip the branches off a tree. The trunk is also used as a huge straw \u2013 elephants can suck up to 14 litres of water a time into their trunks and then blow this water into their mouths to drink. When bathing, they also use their trunk to spray themselves with water and mud. A great pub quiz question is how many muscles in an elephant\u2019s trunk? Amazingly the answer is 40,000! Elephants have very sensitive skin and use mud as a form of sunscreen. They need to take regular mud baths in order to protect themselves from sunburn, insect bites and moisture loss. Elephant feet are covered in a soft padding that helps to support their weight, as well as preventing them from slipping and dulling the sound of their footsteps. As a result, elephants can walk almost silently, despite their huge weight. Furthermore, elephants use their feet to listen to the sub-sonic rumblings made by other elephants through vibrations in the ground. They have been observed to listen by putting their trunks on the ground and carefully positioning their feet. Female elephants remain pregnant for 2 years \u2013 the longest gestation period of all mammals. Having a baby elephant is no small commitment either. You may ask how much does an elephant weigh at birth, and the answer is a staggering 120kg!\n10 interesting facts about elephant senses and social behaviour:\nElephants have small eyes and poor eyesight, but they make up for this with their amazing sense of smell \u2013 the best in the whole animal kingdom! An elephant can smell water from up to 12 miles away. Elephants communicate with one another using sound, touch and scent. Their hearing is excellent (they can hear a trumpeting call from up to 5 miles away), and they use a wide range of sounds to talk to each other \u2013 including those which humans are not able to hear. Elephants are highly sensitive and caring animals, and have been observed to express grief, compassion, altruism and play. They perform greeting ceremonies when a friend that has been away for some time returns to the group, and they sometimes \u2018hug\u2019 by wrapping their trunks together. Elephants will pay respect to the bones of their dead by gently touching the skulls and tusks with their trunks and feet. Elephants are able to recognise themselves using mirrors. Such displays of self-recognition indicates a very high level of awareness, and is something which only humans, apes, cetaceans and magpies are otherwise known to do. Being extremely sensitive creatures, elephants have been known to display behaviour patterns similar to post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Female elephants spend their whole lives living in tight family groups with their female relatives. The eldest female normally leads the group. Male elephants leave the herd between the ages of 12 and 15, and usually live alone (although may sometimes form small groups with other males). Elephants are extremely intelligent animals and have excellent memories. Matriarchs rely on this memory during dry seasons when they need to guide their herds, sometimes for tens of miles, to watering holes that they remember from the past. Elephants are able to recognise and distinguish human voices. They can tell the difference between human languages, male and female voices, friendly voices and those associated with danger. Unlike stories suggest, elephants are not afraid of mice. They are however, terrified of bees and ants, so some African farmers protect their fields from elephant damage by lining the borders with beehives.\nThe important role of elephants in the natural environment:\nAs well as having a fascinating anatomy and behaviour characteristics, elephants also play an essential role in delicate African and Asian ecosystems. Their huge size means that they can shape the landscape that they are in \u2013 as they move around and feed, they create clearings in wooded areas, which lets light in so that new plants can grow and smaller animals can survive. They are also a very important form of seed dispersal; elephant dung often contains undigested seeds which are then spread widely around the area as the animals travel \u2013 sometimes these seeds are too big for smaller animals to eat, making elephants a vital carrier for these plants. Elephant dung is also an important resource for humans \u2013 their nutrient-rich manure replenishes depleted soils so that humans can have a nutrient rich soil to plant crops in.\nElephants are important for other animals within the environment too. They dig waterholes when river beds are dry that other animals can use as a water source, and their large footprints can create deep holes for water to collect in. The wide trails that they carve through the vegetation as they move through the landscape can also act as fire breakers and water run-offs, and make it easier for humans and other animals to access the forest and brush.\nChallenges affecting elephant populations:\nSadly, elephant populations in both Africa and Asia are being threatened by negative interactions with humans. The word \u2018elephant\u2019 comes from the Greek word \u2018elephas\u2019 which means ivory, and unfortunately it has been the ivory trade which has caused about 90% of African elephants to be wiped out in the past century. Despite being illegal, elephant poaching has been getting dramatically worse in parts of Africa in the last 10 years, mainly because of growing demand for ivory in China and the Far East. It is thought that around 20,000 African elephants are killed every year for their ivory. Elephants rely on their tusks for survival. How do elephants use their tusks, you might ask? These desirable commodities are essential to the elephants for defense, offense, digging, feeding, lifting, gathering food and stripping back bark from trees \u2013 they cannot survive without them. The illegal wildlife trade also threatens to the Asian elephant population. As well as for ivory, elephants are also killed for their meat, skin and tail hair. It is estimated that poaching for such products caused Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam to lose three quarters of their wild elephants in the late 1980s and 1990.\nHabitat loss due to expanding human settlements is another challenge facing both African and Asian elephant populations. Elephants need a lot of land to find enough food and water \u2013 they can roam across more than 30,000 sq km \u2013 but as human populations grow, the amount of land available to elephants reduces. The space available to elephants in Africa has more than halved since 1979, while Asia, as the world\u2019s most densely populated continent, has experienced some of the highest rates of deforestation and habitat destruction in recent years. As human settlements expand and we start to move into the elephants\u2019 space, more negative interactions start to occur. Crop raiding by elephants is a particular problem in both Africa and Asia \u2013 this can result in a loss of income, food or even lives. Farmers will sometimes kill elephants to protect their family or income, further threatening the size of elephant populations. As a result of a combination of these challenges, Asian elephants are now just restricted to 15% of their original range, in a number of fragmented and isolated populations around south and south-east Asia.\nWhat can you do to help?\nHere at Oyster Worldwide, we run several elephant conservation and protection volunteer projects in both Asia and Africa, all of which seek to maintain and increase elephant populations in these areas. You can get involved in important elephant research, monitoring, education and community projects in Namibia and South Africa, or choose from volunteering at an elephant sanctuary in Thailand, or on an elephant conservation project in Thailand, Sri Lanka or Laos. Follow the links above to the relevant pages on our website to find out more about each of these extremely worthwhile projects and learn how you can get up close to these magnificent creatures and experience their intelligence for yourself."}

The elephant\u2019s large ears, which are much bigger than the Asian elephant\u2019s ears, are there to serve many different purposes. The size of the ears create a wide surface area to radiate excess heat in hot climates, they also help to improve the elephant\u2019s hearing to make out sounds from up to 4km in distance, and finally they are also used as a communication tool with other animals.\n6. The ears, along with the tail, eyes and trunk of an elephant are also used for communication. Rapid ear flapping can mean excitement or aggression, a swishing or wagging tail can signify happiness, and head shaking can mean that they feel threatened and/or are trying to intimidate. But please don\u2019t be too alarmed if you spot any of these actions on safari as sometimes elephants will flap their ears to cool themselves down \u2013 so it\u2019s all about reading their body language as a whole."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Facts About Asian Elephants You Won't Believe You Didn't Know - Animal Sake", "url": "https://animalsake.com/facts-about-asian-elephants", "text": "Did you know that female Asian elephants do not have tusks? And that only some male ones do? Here are some interesting facts about the Asian elephants.\nElephants are the largest living terrestrials of Asia. The scientific name of the Asian Elephant is Elephas maximus. It is the only living species of the genus Elephas. There are three subspecies of Elephas maximus that are collectively referred to as Asian elephants \u2013 the subspecies found in Sri Lanka, the subspecies found in India, and the subspecies found in the Sumatra islands. Here is a comprehensive account of different facts about Asian elephants.\nElephant Size\nCompared to the African elephant, Asian elephants are smaller in size \u2013 they are 7 to 10 feet tall and weigh about 4000 kg on an average. They have a smooth skin, gray to brown in color. They have distinctly smaller ears than African elephants.\nTrunks\nThe trunk of Asian elephants is harder than that of others. The tip of an elephant\u2019s trunk usually has two flaps of skin that are called \u2018lips\u2019. Asian elephants have only one of these lips, viz. the lower one. They have an average life-span of about 60 to 70 years. However, some even live beyond 80 years of age!\nLack of Tusk\nOne interesting fact about the Asian elephants is that the female elephants either completely lack tusks, or have only rudimentary tusks. Such rudimentary tusks are called \u2018tushes\u2019 in females. On the other hand, not all male elephants have tusks; some lack them completely. Almost 90% of male Asian elephants found in southern parts of India have tusks; while only about 5% of those found in Sri Lanka have tusks.\nBehavioral Traits\nElephants are very social animals and often move about in groups of 6 to 7 individuals. The group is led by the oldest and largest female; the social structure is hence, often referred to as \u2018matriarchal\u2019. Sometimes 2 or more groups come together and form herds, especially while migrating.\nAsian elephants are very gentle and docile animals. The social nature of the animal is even reflected in the way elephants communicate with each other. Mostly elephants trumpet. However, they even purr while feeding. These low frequency sounds are carried over long distance, sometimes even as much as 10 miles away!\nElephants have even been described as rather timid creatures. An elephant is more likely to flee from a site rather than stay and attack in case of danger. They have very few enemies \u2013 who would want to mess with a giant anyway! However, there have been instances of tigers attacking a weak elephant, or a calf.\nMating Traits\nMale Asian elephants usually reach sexual maturity around 14 years of age. Sexually mature males \u2013 called \u2018bulls\u2019 (singular \u2013 bull), undergo something called \u2018musth\u2019. It is a period during which the male is very aggressive. The testosterone levels during musth can be 100 times higher than those throughout the year. Captive elephants (used in circuses or zoos) need to be chained down during this period. or they can cause massive destruction.\nFemale Asian elephants reach sexual maturity earlier than males \u2013 at around 9 years of age. This is probably why elephants follow a matriarchal social structure. On an average, a sexually mature female \u2013 called a \u2018cow\u2019 \u2013 gives birth to a calf every 4 years. If the conditions they are living in are favorable, this period may be reduced to around 2.5 years. The calf feeds on its mother for up to 3 years. Females tend to stay in groups, while males drift away after they grow up.\nMemory and Intelligence\nIt may surprise you to know that the elephant brain is as complex as the human brain and even contains almost the same number of neurons! Such a highly complex brain allows elephants to mimic, play, crack a joke, remember, and even feel emotions like love, compassion and grief. Evidence of these traits is seen in the social behavior of the animal. Elephants also have a deep sense of altruism. They help elephants and other animals in distress, even humans.\nAnother interesting fact about elephants is that they exhibit \u2018death rituals\u2019. They are the only living creatures apart from humans to actually have death rituals. When an elephant dies, other elephants of the group gather around the deceased and cover the body with leaves, twigs and sand. They even weep and make loud screaming sounds. Elephants from one group also visit graves of elephants from another group.\nConservation\nThe main reason for elephants to become an endangered species is loss of their natural habitat! Human activities lead to encroachment of the elephants space and habitat. Apart from this, poaching activities have also led to significant reduction in number of wild Asian elephants. The ivory tusks are of great value, and elephants have been sacrificed in great numbers for their tusks. However, the ivory trade has been banned since 1975.\nThere are only about 40,000 wild Asian elephants now, dispersed throughout Asia. Many renowned institutes like World Wildlife Fund (WWF) are contributing to the conservation of endangered species, including Asian elephants.\nCaptivity\nAsian elephants have long been bred in captivity as well. This is mainly because they can be trained to follow instructions. Asian elephants have hence been used as beasts of burden, especially to carry wood from forests to workshops/factories. Historically, elephants have also been used on the battlefield. Asian elephants have also been trained to work in circuses.\nFood Favorites\nThe Asian Elephant inhabits grasslands, deciduous forests and even scrub-lands. This goes hand in hand with their strict vegetarian diet \u2013 elephants feed on grass, leaves, tree barks, tender stems and even fruits. Captive elephants may even have food favorites! Some particularly like to eat bananas, rice and even sugarcane! However, elephants may migrate, especially in search of water. An adult elephant needs about 80 to 200 liters of water every single day!\nElephants are rather interesting creatures. They have shared a special bond with human beings since old times and continue to do so. I hope you know at least a little more about elephants now, than you knew before reading this article. They truly are \u2018gentle giants\u2019, with their hearts in the right place!"}

A chicken with red ear lobes produces brown eggs, and a chicken with white ear lobes produces white eggs.\n2. Even though a polar bear\u2019s average body temperature is 37\u00b0C, they don\u2019t give off any detectable heat and don\u2019t show up in infrared photographs. They also have black skin. This is a protective adaptation to the climate. Black absorbs heat and keeps the polar bear from freezing. Most people also think the polar bear\u2019s fur is white. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s clear to allow the sunlight and heat through to the black skin underneath. It appears white due to a process known as luminescence. This happens when the sun\u2019s rays bounce off the transparent fur, and some of the light energy travels into the hair, getting trapped. The energy bounces around inside the hollow part of the hair causing luminescence which involves the emission of light.\n3. Male giraffes engage in same-sex sexual activity. Many young male giraffes have been observed courting other males, going through a series of attraction rituals including caresses and the touching of noses. In fact, scientists estimate that 94 percent of all giraffe sex happens between two males leaving the other six per cent of sex for procreation of the species. This responsibility falls to older, dominant males who mate with female giraffes during their breeding cycles.\n4. The Platypus, that unique Australian mammal that looks like a cross between a duck and beaver, swims with its eyes closed.\n5. Baby humans suck on their thumbs for comfort. Baby elephants do the same thing but with their trunks.\n6. Young goats are influenced by their peers. In fact, they pick up each other\u2019s accents. If a group of young goats spends enough time together, they all sound the same. Just like teenagers.\n7. Tardigrades are extremely durable microscopic animals that exist all over Earth. They are segmented and have eight legs. They can survive in any of the following environments: 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 Celsius), -458 degrees F (-272 C), the vacuum of space, pressure six times stronger than the ocean floor and more than a decade without food. They exist on top of the Himalayas and on the bottom of the deepest oceans. They are most common in moist environments and are commonly known as water bears or moss piglets.\n8. The now extinct colossus penguin stood an incredible six foot 8 inches tall. That\u2019s as tall as champion basketballer LeBron James. The colossus penguin could hold its breath for 40 minutes at a time, making it an uber fish hunter. By comparison, most whales and dolphins only hold their breath underwater for 20 minutes.\n9. A Wombat is another unique Australian marsupial that lives in a burrow, is about a metre in length and weighs as much as 35 kilograms (77lbs). It also poops in cubes.\n10. The growth of a moose\u2019s antlers is dependent on two things \u2013 the amount of testosterone that a particular male has and the length of the day. Moose shed their antlers (also known as paddles) every year and grow back new ones. The antlers are covered in velvet. This velvet is vascularised, permitting blood flow during the growing season. Then, during the mating season, they rub away the velvet to expose shiny new antlers to impress all the females. Made from bone, a moose\u2019s antlers weight about 40 pounds or about 18 kilograms. After a bull moose reaches his prime, the size of the antlers retracts each year until he dies.\n11. Flamingos are not pink. They are born grey; their diet of brine shrimp and blue green algae contains a natural pink dye called canthaxanthin that makes their feathers pink.\n12. The bat is the only mammal that can fly. The leg bones of a bat are so thin that out of the 1,200 species of bats, only two can walk on ground. These are the Vampire bat and the Burrowing bat.\n13. Elephants have a specific alarm call that means \u201cWatch out, humans about.\u201d Earlier this year, a group of scientists from Oxford University and Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom combined to investigate elephant communication. They played a recording of the human voices to a group of elephants, and they reacted with a clear and distinctive trumpeting call at the same time becoming more vigilant and alert. Having recorded this distinctive call, the team then played it back to another group of elephants. They also reacted to human voices, erupting with vigilance as they ran and trumpeted in the same way.\n14. Previous Oxford University research shows that African elephants also have a distinct warning call for bees, which prompts fellow elephants to flee while shaking their heads, an apparent attempt to prevent bee stings.\n15. Cows can sleep standing up, but they can only dream lying down.\n16. Hippos can run faster than human beings! Even though they weigh as much 4000 kilograms, hippos are one of the fastest creatures on earth reaching and incredible 30 kilometres an hour. They can hit top speed in a matter of just four seconds. This one of the reasons they are considered even more dangerous than lions.\n17. A reindeer\u2019s eyes turn blue in winter to allow them to see in lower light\n18. The most poisonous fish in the world is the stone fish. The stonefish, which reaches an average length of 30 to 40 centimetres and weighs up to up to 2 kg / 5 lbs, is the most venomous fish in the world, having venomous sacs on each one of its 13 spines. They are found throughout shallow coastal waters of the northern half of Australia. Their venom is so toxic that it will stop a human heart.\n19. African buffalo herds exhibit voting behaviour, in which individuals convey the direction in which they want to travel by standing up, looking in one direction and then lying back down. Only adult females vote in this process.\n20. Snakes always keep their eyes open, even when they are asleep. Snakes can\u2019t close their eyes because they do not have eyelids. They do have eye scales that cover their eyes and which they shed when it sheds their skin.\n21. A dog\u2019s sense of smell is incredibly acute. If you stood in a stadium crowded with 40,000 other people, your dog could find you by smell alone.\n22. At birth, a panda is smaller than a mouse and weighs about 110 grams (four ounces). Giant pandas are about 150cm long from nose to rump, with a 10-15cm tail. A large adult panda can weigh about 100-150kg (250-300 lbs), with males 10 per cent larger and 20 per cent heavier than females. An adult panda can spend up to 12 hours a day eating, and to meet their dietary needs, they need to eat at least 14 kilograms (28 pounds) of bamboo.\n23. Male mice are romantic little devils. They serenade their mate with a special mouse song to both entertain them and hold their attention.\n24. Female mice can reproduce at just two months old. A pair of mice can produce 500 offspring more each season, according to the CSIRO, with females birthing a new litter every three weeks. Australia is currently experiencing a mouse plague and while mice numbers of 800 to 1000 mice per hectare is usually considered a plague, an official recently said that trying to count the number of mice right now would be \u201clike trying to count the stars\u201d.\n25. Male dogs will raise their legs while urinating to aim higher on a tree or lamppost because they want to leave a message that they are tall and intimidating. Some wild dogs in Africa try to run up tree trunks while they are urinating to appear to be exceptionally large.\n26. There is a shark called \u2018goblin shark.\u2019 It was discovered in 1897 and is known as a living fossil as it is believed to be little changed in the past 125 million years\n27. Australian Koalas get their name from an Aboriginal/Indigenous Australian term that means \u2018no drink.\u2019 It\u2019s believed this is because koalas get almost all their moisture from the leaves they eat, and rarely drink water. However, eucalyptus leaves are incredibly tough, difficult to digest and poisonous. But koalas have a long digestive organ called a cecum which allows them to break down the leaves and absorb their nutrients unharmed.\nFor more animal facts check the story below:"}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "All About Elephants - Habitat and Distribution - SeaWorld", "url": "https://seaworld.org/animals/all-about/elephants/habitat/", "text": "Distribution\nAfrican elephants have a sub-Saharan distribution, with forest elephants primarily inhabiting western and central regions of Africa and savanna elephants inhabiting the eastern and southern regions.\nRange States for the Forest Elephant (L.a. cyclotis)\nBenin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, C \u03ccte d\u2019Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria, Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo, and Uganda.\nRange States for the Savanna Elephant (L.a. africana)\nAngola, Botswana, Burundi, Chad, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.\nAsian elephants inhabit the southern, eastern, and southeastern parts of Asia.\nRange States for the Indian Elephant (E.m. indicus)\nBangladesh, Bhutan, Borneo (Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, and Indonesia), Cambodia, China, India, Lao PDR, peninsular Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam.\nRange States for the Sumatran Elephant (E.m. sumatrensis)\nIsland of Sumatra\nRange States for the Sri Lankan Elephant (E.m. maximus)\nThe southwestern portion of Sri Lanka.\nHabitat\nAfrican elephants inhabit a diverse array of habitats including tropical forests, savannas, grasslands, and woodlands.\nTropical forests are characterized as having little variance in temperature (around 23\u00b0C) and length of daylight (around 12 hours). However, rainfall varies considerably in the tropics and is a primary factor as to the type of vegetation that grows in an area.\nSavannas are characterized as grasslands with widely scattered trees. They generally have distinct dry and rainy seasons.\nDry Season: Usually between June and November\nRainy Season: Usually from October to December and March to June\nGrasslands are characterized as having cold winter temperatures. Seasonal droughts, occasional fires, and grazing by large mammals prevent woody shrubs and trees from becoming established. Grassland soil is very nutrient rich and perennial grass roots are often deeply embedded.\nWoodlands are characterized as an area covered with trees and shrubs. Woodlands differ from forests by having a large, open canopy with sunlight filtering between treetops. Forests have a largely\u2014closed canopy in which sunlight does not readily filter through the treetops and almost continuous shade is provided.\nAsian elephants primarily inhabit tropical forest habitats.\nMigration\nBoth Asian and African elephants migrate and generally follow the same migratory routes annually. Migration distances vary considerably depending on environmental conditions. During a prolonged dry season in Africa, elephant migration distances were recorded to extend over 100 km (62 mi.). Studies documenting Asian elephants in deciduous forests of southern India, with numerous water sources, reported elephant migration to extend between 20 and 50 km (12 and 31 mi.).\nAfrican elephants usually migrate at the beginning of the dry season, between June and November; heading toward more hospitable locations near rivers and water sources that are not prone to drying. When the rainy season arrives, usually from October to December and March to June, elephant herds return to native regions to feed on the lush, green vegetation the rains helped regenerate. Elephant migration allows time for the re\u2014growth of vegetation in exhausted grazing areas.\nElephant migrations occur in one of the following three ways. The migration method depends on environmental conditions.\nIndividual family groups separate themselves from the larger herd. This method may be used in response to limited food supplies encountered during a dry season migration. If food sources are scarce along the migratory route, it is more efficient to travel as individual families, rather than large herds. Family groups traveling in this manner are generally led by a dominant female at the front of the group and another at the back, to guard the rear. The young travel between the dominant females for protection and supervision.\nSeveral family groups, usually between two and five, may form a larger group called bond groups for migration. Bond groups provide additional security due to more sets of watchful eyes. Females share leadership and supervisory responsibilities based on age, experience, and temperament. These groups require more food resources along the migratory route but benefit from increased protection.\nOccasionally, entire populations of elephant herds join together in mass migration, with estimates as high as 500 individuals reported. This method provides maximum protection for herds but food resources must be present along the migratory route in sufficient quantity.\nPopulation\nAfrican elephants are estimated to have a total population between 400,000 and 660,000 individuals. Individual forest and savanna populations have not been reported by the IUCN\u2014The World Conservation Union, pending further genetic and phylogenic research for various hybrid classifications. The IUCN currently lists the African elephant as threatened.\nCurrently, all Asian elephant subspecies are classified as endangered by the IUCN, with a total population estimate ranging between 25,600 and 32,750 individuals. The Indian elephant (E.m.indicus) is the most numerous with population estimates ranging between 20,000 and 25,000 individuals. The Sumatran and Sri Lankan elephants are critically endangered, with populations estimated to be between 2,440 and 3,350 for the Sumatran elephant and 3,160 and 4,400 for the Sri Lankan elephant. The most endangered of all Asian subspecies is the Borneo elephant with population estimates ranging from 1,000 to 1,500 individuals."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephant Facts - HubPages", "url": "https://discover.hubpages.com/animals/the-best-elephant-gifts", "text": "Image is Public Domain\nMajestic Animals\nAs the largest mammal on land, elephants are remarkable creatures. Many people cite them as their favorite animal, which is no surprise. They are incredibly intelligent and playful and they are generally peaceful. They are also very social, travelling in herds and greeting friends by wrapping their trunks together. In many ways, they are actually a great deal like people. Perhaps that's why we are so fascinated by them.\nCalves can often be seen playing together. They especially love playing in the water and enjoy using their trunks to spray each other. This is very endearing to see, especially when they seem to be smiling as they play! Further down this page you will find a video showing two calves playing together in the water, which I highly recommend watching.\nThe males are usually solitary, or sometimes form bachelor pods. However, the females travel in herds that have close social bonds. Even when the herd becomes too large, causing some to break away, they always remember and greet each other when they cross paths. Many elephants even \"keep in touch\" after leaving the herd, just as we do when we move away.\nIn some cultures, the elephant is symbolic of wisdom and altruism. It's easy to see why; the way they roam quietly but powerfully through their territory seems to demand respect.\nThese are only a few facts about these fascinating animals. Read on to learn more. Along the way you'll also be treated to some great videos and pictures.\nElephants fighting in Kenya, Africa\nElephants fighting in Kenya, Africa Photo was taken by my grandfather\nFighting Bulls\nMale elephants will fight each other to determine who gets to mate with a female. This fighting can be quite dangerous, but can also end relatively quickly and harmlessly, with the weaker male accepting the loss. These fights help to keep the gene pools strong, thereby ensuring the survival of the herd.\nResearchers are learning more about male elephants all the time. Until recently, they were thought to be antisocial and aggressive, but their true nature is slowly coming to light. While bulls certainly can be aggressive when they want to mate, they are more social and friendly with each other than was thought in the past.\nBulls also frequently play fight. As teenagers, they will find other males of their age to play fight with and will even sometimes join that family group for a time. They are not always accepted by this new herd, but can always leave to find a new herd until they are ready to be on their own.\nElephants at Play\nThis fantastic video is both informative and lighthearted. It talks about how elephants play and they can be quite mischievous and fun loving while showing footage of young calves splashing around in a small lake. Even as adults, they love to play in the water. It's only a couple of minutes long and is well worth the view. It'll make you want to go see them in person!\nImage is Public Domain\nElephants and the Heat\nHow do they keep cool?\nAfrican elephants especially live in such a hot climate. Many of their habitats are right on the equator, the hottest part of the earth. Unlike humans, elephants don't have sweat glands to help cool them off in the scorching temperatures. However, these fascinating creatures have developed wonderful ways to keep themselves cool.\nThe African elephant has larger ears than their Asian counterparts. These huge appendages are for a lot more than just show. Their ears are vital to helping them survive. The ears of an African elephant radiates heat, which helps to keep them cool. It's quite an amazing feature, isn't it?\nElephants also love to cool themselves off in the water. They fill their trunks with water and have a great time soaking themselves. As you saw in the video above, it's quite a treat to see. When they're finished their playtime, they will often put a coat of dirt on themselves, which further protects them from the heat.\nTheir wrinkles serve a purpose, too. If their skin was smooth, all the water from their playtime would evaporate more quickly. Their wrinkled skin actually traps the moisture better so that it takes longer to evaporate, keeping them cool for a longer time after they've been in the water. It also provides more surface area to their bodies, further helping them to beat the heat.\nImage is Public Domain\nCommunication\nSince elephants are so social, communication is essential for them. When herds grow too large, they break off into smaller groups. The herds still maintain communication, though. They can communicate for across a distance of several kilometers. When they do this, they make noises that are usually too low for humans to hear. They also stamp their feet and sometimes they even purr.\nTheir feet aren't just used to talk to other elephants--they are also used to listen. They can actually \"hear\" the rumblings of other elephants through their feet by picking up the vibrations through the ground. They will also put their trunks on the ground as another method of picking up messages.\nFirst Steps\nThis video shows a baby elephant trying to take his first steps, but having a few problems with his trunk! It's not hard to see why. I can only imagine how hard it is to learn how to walk with a trunk hanging in front of you! Calves actually have very little control over their trunk for the first few months of life, which explains why this little guy is having so much trouble. This video is definitely worth a watch and will leave you with a smile on your face.\nBaby Elephants\nBaby elephants are already about 250 pounds and 3 feet tall when they are born. They stay close to their mother for several months before gaining enough confidence to move about more on their own. They usually drink their mother's milk for about two years, but also begin to eat vegetation at around four months.\nMales stay with their herd until they are around fourteen years old. They then break off on their own, or sometimes join another family herd. Females remain with their herd for life, although they will sometimes break off with a section when the herd becomes too large.\nThere are actually a lot of similarities between human and elephant babies. Many animals are born with excellent survival instincts, but elephant calves must be taught many skills by their herd. They also will often suck their trunk, just like we suck our thumbs when we're young. They have \"milk tusks\" which are eventually replaced by adult tusks, and baby teeth which are replaced by stronger adult teeth.\nAt 22 months, elephants have the longest gestation period of any mammal. This might seem like a long time, but remember how big calves are when they're born. Usually, only one calf is born to each mother, although there are records of twins.\nDiet\nElephants can eat up to 400-660 pounds of vegetation a day. Because they need such a huge quantity of food, they sometimes spend nearly 80% of their day eating or looking for food. They are vegetarians, living off of grasses, leaves, bark, roots, bushes, and fruit. Their tusks help them break off bark from trees, which is a favorite and nutritious food. The rough material of the bark also helps push the rest of their food through their digestive system.\nOn an average day, they drink anywhere from 70-150 liters of water. Therefore, they usually stay relatively close to water sources. However, if they aren't able to find water, they can use their tusks to dig into the ground for it. This also helps out other animals, who can drink the water left behind.\nBecause elephants need to chew up so much vegetation, their teeth wear out rather quickly. Adults actually grow new sets of teeth at the backs of their mouths, which slowly move forward as the old teeth wear through.\nImage is Public Domain\nHabitat\nBecause elephants have such rich variety in their diet, they are able to live in many different environments. Their habitats range from grasslands and Savannah to to swamps and forests. They tend to roam through vast areas, eating as they go. During this process, they clear pathways that they can then follow year after year.\nNational Parks in Africa form a huge part of their habitat. This allows them to have as much space as they need while still remaining safe.\nThe main requirement for an ideal elephant habitat is an adequate food and water supply. Their only predators are humans, so they are not generally worried about safety like other animals are. This gives them a great deal of freedom to roam through different areas.\nHumans are a threat to elephants not only because of poaching, but because of habitat destruction. Since they eat such large quantities of food each day, it's easy for a herd to consume all of the vegetation in a small area very quickly. When humans destroy their habitats and therefore restrict them to such small areas, the vegetation is not able to regrow and sustain the herd. When the herd is able to move on when necessary, the vegetation can regenerate in time for the herd to circle back when they are ready.\nClimate change is also a danger, as it makes their habitats too hot and dry to support adequate vegetation growth.\nStephanie (author) from Canada on July 25, 2014:\n@marktplaatsshop: Thank you very much.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Asian elephant | Smithsonian's National Zoo", "url": "https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/asian-elephant", "text": "Physical Description\nAsian elephant skin is gray, but parts sometimes lack color, especially on and around the ears, forehead and trunk. This de-pigmentation is believed to be controlled by genetics, nutrition and habitat, and generally develops as an elephant ages. Brownish to reddish hair covers the bodies of young elephants. The amount of hair reduces with age, and the color darkens.\nElephant skin varies from paper thin in some places, such as on the inside of the ears, to as thick as 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) in other places, such as around the back. Despite its thickness, the skin is sensitive due to a rich nerve supply. Elephants protect their skin from the sun and bugs by regularly covering themselves with dirt, sand and mud. Their large ears function as cooling devices. The ears contain many blood vessels. As an elephant flaps its ears on hot days, the blood in these veins cools, which then cools the elephant's brain and travels back through the body, reducing body temperature by several degrees.\nAn elephant's brain is large, weighing between 9 and 13 pounds (4 and 6 kilograms). Elephants are thought to be highly intelligent animals, and they have a great capacity to learn. In fact, much of their behavior is learned behavior rather than instinctive behavior.\nUnlike other mammals, where the legs are in an angular position, the elephant's legs are stacked in an almost vertical position under the body. This positioning, along with the detailed anatomy of their long bones, provides a strong support for the animal's great weight. The vertical position of the limbs allows the elephant to remain standing for long periods without expending much energy. It also allows elephants to sleep while standing, as well as while lying down.\nIn most mammals, the bones contain a narrow cavity. In elephants, this cavity is lacking. Instead, a network of dense perforated bone occupies the space, which makes the bones stronger and able to withstand more pressure. The elephant's skeleton is designed for mobility as well as strength. An elephant must have physical structures and coordinated muscular and neurological systems to accomplish survival skills, such as standing on their rear legs and climbing up and down steep slopes.\nElephants actually walk on their toes and have a thick, fibrous pad on the bottom of each foot. This pad acts as a shock absorber, protecting the leg and toe bones from jarring under its weight and cushioning each step.\nThe trunk is a fusion of the nose and upper lip. It contains no bones, but is composed of muscles, blood and lymph vessels, nerves, little fat, connective tissues, skin, hair and bristles. Cartilage is found only at the base of the trunk, dividing the nostrils. The trunk has about 150,000 muscle units and tendons that provide the elephant precision, as well as strength of movement. These often tiny muscle units tend to be arranged radially or longitudinally and, by acting against one another, allow the trunk to be moved in any direction. Although delicate in its movements, the trunk is also a very powerful organ that can lift heavy objects with ease.\nAsian elephants have one small projection at the end of their trunk, called a \"finger,\" which aids with precision. Elephants use their trunks to take up water and squirt it into their mouths. The trunk is capable of performing many other functions as well, including feeding, snorkeling, dusting, smelling, sifting, sorting, touching, sound production and communication, lifting, pushing, defense and offense. It can hold about 2 gallons (7.57 liters) of water. Senses of smell and touch are very important for elephants. Their trunks help them \"know\" their world.\nAsian elephants have six sets of teeth, all six of which are present in the skull at birth. They are, however, very small. Each successive set of teeth is larger, more complex and lasts longer than the previous set. As a result, an elephant's skull grows throughout its lifetime to accommodate the new and ever-larger teeth. The teeth are replaced in a horizontal progression, similar to that of a conveyor belt. The worn teeth move forward, break and fall out of the mouth or are swallowed. An elephant's age can be estimated by examining molar sequence and wear.\nTusks are modified upper incisors that grow throughout an individual's life at a rate of several inches per year. They are composed of ivory, a material similar to bone that is made primarily of calcium and phosphate. The tusk has a pulp cavity containing nerve tissues. In an adult animal, about two-thirds of the tusk is visible while the remaining one-third is embedded in the socket, or sulcus, in the cranium.\nNewly developing tusks have a conical cap of smooth enamel that eventually wears off. Not all elephants develop visible tusks; in the Asian species, only some males have large, prominent tusks. Most female and some male Asian elephants have small tusks, called tushes, which seldom protrude more than an inch or two from the lip line. Tushes have a slightly different composition than tusks. They are small and brittle, causing them to easily break. A significant number of adult male Asian elephants are tuskless. The percentage of males with tusks varies by region, with less than 10 percent in Sri Lanka to approximately 90 percent in India. This disparity may be a reflection of the intensity of past ivory hunting.\nIn the African elephant species, generally, but not always, both the males and females have tusks. Tusks are extremely useful, multipurpose instruments. Elephants use them to dig for water, salt, minerals and roots; to debark trees; as levers to manipulate objects in their environment; for rescuing calves; for threat displays; as weapons for defense and offense; as trunk rests; and as protection for the trunk."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "African Elephants - Key Facts, Information & Pictures", "url": "https://animalcorner.org/animals/african-elephant/", "text": "African Elephants The African elephant, (Loxodonta Africana), is also known as the \u2018African Bush Elephant\u2019. Both the African Bush Elephant and the African Forest Elephant have usually been classified as a single species, known simply as the African Elephant. However, the African Forest Elephant resides in the Rainforests and the African Bush Elephant lives in the savannas, hence sometimes being called the \u2018Savanna Elephant\u2019.\nAfrican Elephant Characteristics\nAn African Elephants neck is quite high and slopes down towards its straight back. African elephants are more wrinkled and have much larger ears than the Asian elephant. In contrast to the Asian elephants protruding forehead, the African elephants forehead is flat without any bumps and slopes down smoothly towards its trunk. Their underlip is short, broad and rounded and both female and male African elephants have tusks which are thick and curved forward. African elephants are also larger in size as compared to male and female Asian elephants.\nThe largest African elephants recorded weight was over 9 tons and it stood more than 12 feet high at the shoulder. The African elephants average weight is up to 7 tons, about the equivalent of 78 adult human males weighing an average of 90 kilograms each.\nAfrican elephants have 4 nails on their fore feet and their hind feet have 3 nails, just like the Asian elephant, however, African elephants have 2 prehensile fingers at the tip of their trunks whereas the Asian elephant only has one.\nAfrican elephants are named for the peculiar shaped ridges of their molar teeth. The ridges of an African elephants teeth are coarser and fewer than those of the Asian elephant.\nHere are some facts about the anatomy of an African Elephant:\nHeart and liver: The elephant heart weights 22 kilograms and circulates about 450 litres of blood. Inner \u2018cleaning\u2019 is performed by a 77 kilograms liver.\nWater and trunk: To drink its 9 litres of water at a time, the elephant uses its trunk which weighs 113 kilograms.\nTongue: Helping the swallowing process is a 12 kilogram elephant tongue.\nFood and intestines: The approximately 250 kilograms food eaten every day passes through 18 metres of intestines. Eventually processed into about 100 kilograms of elephant dung per day. African elephants are herbivorous. Their diet varies according to their habitat. Elephants living in forests, partial deserts and grasslands all eat different proportions of herbs and tree or shrubbery leaves. Elephants inhabiting the shores of Lake Kariba have been recorded eating underwater plant life.\nDigestion: Elephants only digest about 40% of what they eat and therefore, they need to spend two-thirds of every day eating.\nGas: An elephant \u2018releases\u2019 2000 litres of methane gas per day.\nSkin: An elephants skin weighs 450 \u2013 750 kilograms.\nTail: An elephants tail weighs 11 kilograms.\nFighting: The longest recorded fight between two elephants was recorded at 10 hours and 56 minutes.\nMatriarch: Elephant herds consist of females and the young. A herd is led by a matriarch (grandmother). As young males reached maturity they are chased away by the herd. Bull elephants join the herd only for mating.\nGestation : An elephants gestation (conception to birth) is 23 months. Gestation period tends to be slightly longer than in the Asian elephant.\nSound: Most of the communication between elephants occurs at an infra sound level.\nCall: It is estimated that an area of 50 square kilometres is filled with particular elephant \u2018call\u2019 in infra sound. This might increase to about 300 square kilometres at dusk due to lower temperatures.\nEyes : An elephants eyes are very small in relation to its head. The eye contains very few photoreceptors and they cannot see very well further than a few hundred feet.\nSpeed: An elephant can walk rather fast and charge even faster.\nNo jumping: Elephants cannot jump.\nSwimming: Elephants love water and are excellent swimmers.\nTrunk: An elephants trunk is the most versatile of all mammalian creations being used as a nose, arm, hand and multipurpose tool. It is powerful enough to kill a lion with a single swipe, yet the finger-like lobes at the end are adept enough to pluck a feather from the ground.\nTrunk muscles: The trunk is boneless and is composed of an estimated 40 000 muscles.\nTusks: Elephants tusks are elongated upper incisor teeth, which grow continuously throughout the elephants life. They are not always an exact match, as this depends on which side they favour much like left and right-handed humans.\nEars: An elephants ears are covered in veins, which form distinct and unique patterns which can be used to identify individuals \u2013 much like human fingerprints. An elephants ears are packed with blood vessels and when flapped, they quickly lower the animals body temperature. This swiftly circulating blood is cooled by about 9 degrees Fahrenheit while in the elephants ear.\nThe African Bush Elephant is an intelligent animal. Experiments with reasoning and learning show that they are the smartest ungulates together with their Asian cousins. This is mostly due to their large brain.\nIn most places, the adult African Bush Elephant lacks natural predators thanks to its great size, however, the calves (especially the newborn) are vulnerable to lions and crocodile attacks and (rarely) to leopard and hyena attacks.\nAfrican Bush Elephant Conservation Status\nWhile the African elephant is classed as vulnerable, conditions vary somewhat by region within eastern and southern Africa.\nIn 2006, an elephant slaughter was documented in southeastern Chad by aerial surveys. A series of poaching incidents, resulting in the killing of over 100 elephants, was carried out during the late spring and summer of 2006 in the vicinity of Zakouma National Park. This region has a decades-old history of poaching of elephants, as one of Africa\u2019s big five game, which has caused the elephant population of the region, which exceeded 300,000 in 1970, to drop to approximately 10,000 today. The African elephant officially is protected by Chadian government, but the resources and manpower provided by the government (with some European Union assistance) have proven insufficient to stop the poaching.\nHuman encroachment into or adjacent to natural areas where bush elephants occur has led to recent research into methods of safely driving groups of elephants away from humans, including the discovery that playback of the recorded sounds of angry honey bees are remarkably effective at prompting elephants to flee an area."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the African Bush Elephant images!\nAfrican Bush Elephant Classification and Evolution\nThe African Bush Elephant is the largest of all living creatures on land today, with some individuals growing to weigh more than 6 tonnes. The Elephant is thought to have been named after the Greek word for ivory, meaning that Elephants were named for their uniquely long tusks. Although many of the ancestors of the African Bush Elephant became extinct during the last ice-age (including the Woolly Mammoth), there are three distinct species of Elephant remaining today which are the Asian Elephant (of which there are a number of sub-species), the African Bush Elephant and the African Forest Elephant. Although these two Elephant species are very similar, the African Bush Elephant is considered to be generally larger than the African Forest Elephant, which has rounder ears and straighter tusks.\nAfrican Bush Elephant Anatomy and Appearance\nThe African Bush Elephant is the largest known land mammal on Earth, with male African Bush Elephants reaching up to 3.5 metres in height and the females being slightly smaller at around 3 metres tall. The body of the African Bush Elephants can also grow to between 6 and 7 meters long. The tusks of an African Bush Elephant can be nearly 2.5 meters in length and generally weigh between 50 and 100 pounds, which is about the same as a small adult Human. African Bush Elephants have four molar teeth each weighing about 5.0 kg and measuring about 12 inches long. As the front pair of molars in the mouth of the African Bush Elephant wear down and drop out in pieces, the back pair shift forward and two new molars emerge in the back of the African Bush Elephant\u2019s mouth. African Bush Elephants replace their teeth six times during their lives but when the African Bush Elephant is between 40 to 60 years old, it no longer has teeth and will likely die of starvation, which is sadly a common cause of death of Elephants in the African wilderness.\nAfrican Bush Elephant Distribution and Habitat\nAlthough the historical range of its ancestors ranged right into the Arctic Circle, today the African Bush Elephant is mainly found in central and southern Africa in nomadic herds that wander the plains and grasslands of Africa grazing for food and searching for waterholes. Unlike the slightly smaller African Forest Elephant, the African Bush Elephant inhabits the grassy savanna plains and shrub-land of the African continent in groups that contain mothers and their calves. Generally, African Bush Elephant herds contain around 10 individuals but it is not uncommon for family groups to join together, forming a clan which can contain over 1,000 Elephants. This very social lifestyle means that the African Bush Elephants are less vulnerable on the open African plains.\nAfrican Bush Elephant Behaviour and Lifestyle\nNot only is the African Bush Elephant an incredibly sociable mammal but it is also a very active one. African Bush Elephants are nomadic animals meaning that they are constantly on the move in search of food, so moving within these family herds allows them to have greater protection both from predators and from the elements. The trunk of the African Bush Elephant is one of its most distinguishing features and this extra long nose is not only flexible enough to gather and handle food but can also collect water. Its trunk, along with its tusks can also be used to defend itself from predators such as Lions, and to fight with other male African Bush Elephants during the mating season. African Bush Elephants are also considered to be highly intelligent and emotional animals displaying behaviours that include giving and receiving love, caring deeply for the young and grieving for dead relatives.\nAfrican Bush Elephant Reproduction and Life Cycles\nAfrican Bush Elephants tend to live relatively long lives, with the average life span being between 60 and 70 years, Female African Bush Elephants reach sexual maturity (are able to reproduce) after 10 or 11 years, but are thought to be most fertile between the ages of 25 and 45. Male African Bush Elephants however, often don\u2019t reach sexual maturity until they are nearly 20 years old. After mating and a gestation period of up to 2 years, the female African Bush Elephant gives birth to a single calf (twins have been known but are extremely rare). The African Bush Elephant calf is nursed for 2 years but will remain under the guidance and protection of the herd until it is old enough to support itself (around 6 years old). It is at this point that the tusks of the African Bush Elephant calf will be starting to grow.\nAfrican Bush Elephant Diet and Prey\nDespite its immense size, the African Bush Elephant is a herbivorous mammal meaning that it survives on a diet that solely consists of plants and plant matter. The bulk of the African Bush Elephant\u2019s diet is comprised of leaves and branches that are stripped off the trees and bushes using its trunk. The African Bush Elephant also grazes on fruits and grasses and uses its immense tusks for digging for roots in the ground and to strip the bark of trees. Food is fed into its mouth using the trunk, and the large, flat teeth of the African Bush Elephant are then the perfect tool for grinding the vegetation and course plants down so that they can then be more easily digested.\nAfrican Bush Elephant Predators and Threats\nThe African Bush Elephant has no real natural predators to threaten its survival, mainly due to its sheer size and the fact that African Bush Elephants often remain within the safety of the herd. African Bush Elephants are Africa\u2019s peaceful giants and can be seen co-inhabiting the African wilderness with other large mammals and birds, without problem. In the animal world, Lions and Hyenas may occasionally be able to pick off a young African Bush Elephant that has been separated from its mother and have also been known to attack adults that are old and sick and therefore more vulnerable. Humans that poach the African Bush Elephants for their ivory tusks, classifying them as one of the \u201cAfrican Big Five,\u201d are the biggest threat to their survival along with habitat loss across the continent.\nAfrican Bush Elephant Interesting Facts and Features\nIn the early 19th century, the story of the African Bush Elephant was very different with their being up to 5 million individuals thought to have been roaming the African continent. However, due to the increased demand for ivory, Africa\u2019s Bush Elephant population is thought to have fallen as much as 85% in some areas. The large ears of the African Bush Elephant are said by some to be shaped somewhat like Africa, but these large flaps of skin are not just for hearing, they are a vital tool in keeping the Elephant cool in the African heat. Like many of the herbivores found throughout Africa, the calves can walk at birth to maximise their chances of survival. An adult African Bush Elephant can drink up to 50 gallons of water every day, and is able to take 1.5 gallons of water into their trunks at a time.\nAfrican Bush Elephant Relationship with Humans\nSadly, due to an increase of outside interest in Africa and its exotic wonders (particularly towards the mid 20th century), the African Bush Elephant population took a devastating decline towards extinction. After having been brutally killed by poachers for years for their ivory, African Bush Elephants had vanished from much of their native habitat. In 1989 a worldwide elephant ivory hunting ban fell into place, after the populations had dropped so dramatically across the continent. In northern and central parts of Africa, the African Bush Elephant is now rare and confined to protected areas, and although the story is similar in the south, South African Elephant populations are thought to be doing better with an estimated 300,000 individuals in the region.\nAfrican Bush Elephant Conservation Status and Life Today\nToday, although recovering, African Bush Elephant populations are still threatened from increasing levels of illegal poaching and habitat destruction. Deforestation in the African Bush Elephant\u2019s territory means that the African Bush Elephants lose both their food and shelter making them more vulnerable in the wild. Despite the ban, African Bush Elephants are also constantly threatened by poachers hunting the elephants for their ivory tusks.\nView all 122 animals that start with A"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "20 Mind-Blowing Animal Facts (2022 UPDATE) - Petpedia", "url": "https://petpedia.co/animals-facts/", "text": "The size and diversity of the animal kingdom might be incredible, but what these animals tend to do is often even more astonishing. That\u2019s why we had to prepare a list of the most exciting animal facts we know of today.\nThere\u2019s a lot of fascinating info we have for you, so get ready to have your mind blown.\nTop 10 Facts About Animals\nGeneral Animal Facts\nPlanet Earth is home to around 8.7 million species of animals. There are likely even more than that, but we still had to pick facts on only a handful of them, so here\u2019s a selection of facts on some of the most exciting animals in the world.\n1. The world\u2019s fastest land animal is the cheetah, reaching speeds of up to 75 mph.\n(African Wildlife Foundation, National Geographic, ThoughtCo)\nMany birds and sea creatures are faster, but the cheetah is the undefeated champion of the land.\nThough they can reach 75 mph, the maximum recorded speed is 61 mph. And, of course, cheetahs can only achieve this in short bursts of speed, so their average speed is closer to 40 mph.\nThe current record holder is Sarah, a cheetah that managed to run 100 meters in only 5.95 seconds.\n2. The most venomous snake in the world is the Inland Taipan.\n(Australian Museum, Australia Zoo)\nThe snake is also known as the Western Taipan, and a single bite of this animal has enough poison to kill as many as 100 adult men. What\u2019s more, the poison can kill you in only half an hour if you don\u2019t treat the bite.\nThankfully, the Inland Taipan is not the most dangerous snake, as it\u2019s pretty shy and rarely encountered.\n3. The animal that kills the most humans every year is the mosquito.\n(World Atlas)\nMoving on with the deadly facts about jungle animals, mosquitos are technically the deadliest animals in the world. However, it\u2019s only because they kill the most humans per year. The current estimate states that they kill around a million people every year.\nTo keep things interesting, the second-most deadliest animal for humans is, well, other humans. People kill around 475,000 people every year. This is only counting recorded homicides, of course. Otherwise, the number would be much higher.\n4. Hummingbirds are the only birds that can fly backward.\n(CGTN, ScienceNetLinks, Perot Museum)\nThe hummingbird can move its wings 180 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly backward, upside down, sideways, change directions mid-flight, and even hover in place.\nIt\u2019s the only known bird species that can do this.\n5. Common swifts can fly for ten months without landing.\n(Discover Wildlife)\nThey can both eat and sleep while in the air, and what\u2019s more, scientists have so far found three swift species that can fly for incredibly long periods.\nAnd if the sleeping part sounds impossible, they manage to do it after reaching higher altitudes, so they effectively glide and sleep simultaneously.\n6. Bees pollinate more than 30% of the world\u2019s crops.\n(Friends of the Earth, Global Giving)\nMoreover, stats reveal that 71 of the 100 crop species depend on bees to some extent. So, if you\u2019ve ever wondered how animals help humans, you don\u2019t have to look further than bees.\nThey help pollinate a massive portion of the crops we eat, provide us with countless amounts of honey, and more than 90% of wild plants depend on bees and other pollinators in order to reproduce.\nFacts About Animals in the Tropical Rainforest\nThe world\u2019s rainforests have always been incredibly fascinating, and it\u2019s not only for the flora. The fauna excites people just as much, so let\u2019s take a look at some facts.\n7. The largest spider in the world is the South American Goliath birdeater.\n(Live Science)\nYou can find this monstrosity in the Amazon rainforests of Suriname, French Guiana, Guyana, southern Venezuela, and northern Brazil.\nThis member of the Guinness Book of Records is as large as a man\u2019s fist or a young puppy. More precisely, they can have a leg span of 30 centimeters.\nWith all that in mind, it\u2019s not hard to understand why almost 500 million people are afraid of spiders.\n9. The sloth spends 98% of its life in the trees.\n(Animal Facts Encyclopedia, Mental Floss)\nIt might sound impossible, but these animals rarely need to leave the tree. They relieve themselves once a week, and that\u2019s one of the rare instances when they go down to the ground.\nIt\u2019s also when they are most likely to die. Some estimates state that up to half of all sloth deaths are linked to these dangerous trips to the bathroom.\nFacts About Hibernation and Sleep\nBoth hibernation and sleep can be fascinating in animals. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve prepared a few truly mind-blowing facts about the two.\n10. True hibernating animals can drastically reduce their body temperature and heart rate while sleeping.\n(Science World)\nThe true hibernators are animals that can drop their body temperatures to below freezing levels, but they don\u2019t sleep through the entire winter. They still wake up every few weeks to relieve themselves and eat small amounts of food.\nBears, even though associated with hibernation, actually go through a different, although very similar, process called torpor. It\u2019s effectively a state of deep sleep, from which they can awake fairly easily.\n11. Koalas sleep for 18\u201322 hours a day.\n(National Geographic)\nIt\u2019s primarily because of their limiting diet that consists of only eucalyptus leaves, which are low in nutrition and toxic to boot. This means that their digestive system has to work extra hard to get everything it needs \u2014 and they don\u2019t get much energy from such a diet.\n12. During hibernation, the heart rate of a chipmunk drops from 350 beats per minute to only four.\n(National Geographic, Science World)\nDwarf lemurs are close as well, as their heart rate drops from 300 to less than six per minute. Even their breathing slows down \u2014 they can go for as long as 10 minutes without taking a single breath.\nInteresting Facts About Animals\nYou\u2019ve seen a lot of fascinating facts on all sorts of animals, but now it\u2019s time to check some extraordinary facts that are so unique, you\u2019ve probably not heard of them before.\n13. Despite what most people think, flamingos are not born pink.\n(Britannica)\nWe always think of flamingos as pink-colored birds with long necks and legs. But they are, in fact, not born that way.\nThe birds are born grey, but they turn pink in time because of the food they eat. The algae, brine shrimp, and larvae that flamingos eat the most are filled with beta carotene, a specific red-orange pigment.\nThe flamingo\u2019s body breaks down these foods and deposits the pigments in the skin, which causes their feathers and skin to turn pink.\n14. Roosters could deafen themselves, but they prevent it by tilting their head backward.\n(Poultry World, Alpine Hearing Protection)\nTheir crowing is so loud that it could, theoretically, make them go deaf. Fortunately, they can cover their ear canals almost completely by tilting their heads backward.\nBy the way, the crowing can be as loud as 142.3 decibels, which is louder than some rock concerts and even thunder strikes.\n15. The only animal on the planet whose males give birth is the seahorse.\n(Scientific American)\nWhat is unique about this tiny sea animal is that the female deposits eggs into the male\u2019s brood pouch, where the male fertilizes them and carries them until giving birth.\nOne theory for this reversal of gender roles is that it allows the female to develop a new batch of eggs while the male takes care of one.\n16. Otters hold hands while sleeping.\n(North American Nature)\nYou might think that some cuddling is involved here, but otters actually hold hands while sleeping so they don\u2019t lose each other in the water during sleep. Another reason is to keep their mate close, as there is tough competition in the otter world.\n17. Horned lizards can shoot blood from their eyes.\n(Ask Nature)\nHorned lizards can do this thanks to sinuses filled with blood in their eye sockets, and they use this as a defense mechanism. They can build pressure in the sinuses until they burst and shoot blood up to 4 feet away.\nSurprisingly, they can do so a few times during a short period, if needed.\nMoreover, they use the same mechanism to clean their eyes \u2014 just without the auto-hemorrhaging.\n18. A salamander species, the Mexican axolotl, can regenerate body parts.\n(Karger)\nRegeneration is an essential ability of all living organisms. However, some can do it more effectively than others.\nThis aquatic species of salamander can regenerate limbs multiple times, and it can even regenerate internal organs, including the heart and the brain.\n19. Baby elephants are known to suck their trunks for comfort.\n(Treehugger)\nThis is effectively the same thing baby humans do with their thumbs. Both baby elephants and human babies share the same sucking reflex, which also helps them know how to get food when near their mothers.\nMoreover, this action helps young elephants learn how to use their trunks \u2014 which is not an easy task considering there are 50,000 individual muscles in them.\n20. The giant octopus has three hearts and nine brains.\n(BioGeoPlanet)\nOne of the strangest animals on the planet has to be the giant octopus for the sheer number of hearts and brains it has.\nIt uses those extra hearts to pump blood to all the gills, while the central heart sends oxygenated blood to the rest of the body.\nAs for the brain, it has one in each tentacle, which enables them to act independently of each other and take some load off the central brain.\n21. The kick of an ostrich can kill a lion.\n(Study, AllThingsNature)\nOstriches are the largest birds on the planet, and their kick can kill a lion for the sheer strength in their legs.\nMore precisely, considering they can weigh up to 350 lbs and kick with a force of about 2,000 psi, it\u2019s safe to say that there aren\u2019t many land animals they couldn\u2019t kill with a kick.\nFAQ\nWhat is the world\u2019s smartest animal?\nIt\u2019s impossible to determine which animal species is the smartest on the planet, but there are undoubtedly several contenders.\nCurrently, the most intelligent animals include the rat, octopus, pigeon, squirrel, pig, crow, elephant, orangutan, dolphin, and chimpanzee.\nChimpanzees are often cited as the world\u2019s smartest animals for several reasons. They can learn sign language, recognize themselves in mirrors, use tools, and even combine symbols for objects to express an entire idea.\n(How Stuff Works)\nIs there an immortal animal?\nBelieve it or not, the answer is yes. The most famous biologically immortal animal is the jellyfish called Turritopsis dohrnii. They achieve this by reverting to an earlier stage of their life cycle, which they can effectively do forever.\nThere are some other animals that have achieved immortality in other ways, like hydras who simply do not age. Turtles, as well, are more likely to die from a disease or injury than from old age, as their organs simply don\u2019t show any age-related damage.\n(Australian Academy of Science, Reader\u2019s Digest)\nWhat do animals do for fun?\nMany species of animals tend to do things that don\u2019t serve a clear purpose in their lives. Because of that, it stands to reason that they do these things for enjoyment.\nFor instance, dolphins are known to deliberately handle pufferfish in order to get them to release their toxins. The only thing these toxins do to dolphins is cause them to hallucinate or, to put it simply, get them high.\nThere are many more examples, from cats chasing lasers to crocodiles swimming with their smaller companions on their back.\n(ABC News, National Geographic)\nWhich animal is the laziest?\nIt\u2019s hard to choose the laziest animal, but there are certainly several contenders.\nThese include pygmy blue tongue lizards, lemurs, pigs, giant pandas, owl monkeys, hippos, house cats, koalas, and of course, sloths. The main factors considered are the number of hours they spend asleep and the amount of energy they use for fulfilling their needs.\n(A-Z Animals, One Kind Planet)\nWhy should animals be kept in zoos?\nHumans have been keeping wild animals in captivity for hundreds if not thousands of years. However, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s morally right to do so, nor is it suitable for animals.\nIt\u2019s becoming hard to justify keeping animals in captivity, but there are still a few reasons why this is the right choice in specific cases:\nZoos save endangered species of animals by keeping them protected from predators, poachers, and hostile environments.\nBringing people and animals together can help educate the public about the importance of animals in our ecosystem.\n(Treehugger)\nWhat animals live in the tundra?\nThe tundra is a specific biome characterized by the lack of trees, very low temperatures, and very little rain. In short, it is one of the harshest environments in the world.\nHowever, some animals still manage to live in these regions, including species like:\nArctic hare\nPolar bear\nCaribou\nArctic fox\nSnowy owl\nChinchilla\nMarmot\nKea\nArctic ground squirrel\nMountain goat\nMusk ox\nYak\nAntarctic Penguin\n(NHPBS, World Atlas)\nThe Bottom Line\nSo there you have them, our picks for the most exciting animal facts the scientific community can give us today.\nWe hope you had as much fun reading them as we had compiling them!\nSources:"}

Elephants are vegetarians (eat only plants).\nElephant's favorite food is acacia. If ants crawl on the tree, elephants will move away from the tree because ants can injure elephant's sensitive trunk.\nTrunk is a large and muscular fusion of elephant's nose and upper lip.\nYoung elephants (babies) suck their trunks just like human babies suck their thumbs. This provides comfort.\nElephants that live in captivity can use their trunks for the artistic purposes. They can hold the brush and paint various pictures.\nElephant's skin is one inch thick, but it can burn on the sun if it is not protected. Elephants use mud to cover their skin and protect it from the sun.\nElephants communicate by producing the sounds that humans can't hear and by producing vibrations in the ground using their feet.\nElephants perform \"burial ceremony\" when they lose a member of the herd. They gather around the body and stay in silence for a while. They will use branches to cover the body before they leave.\nElephants can recognize themselves in the mirror.

Elephants also have a tail that with one swish can whisk away flies and other insects making it the perfect fly swatter.\nOn the left is an anatomy diagram of the internal organs of a female elephant. Click on the image for a larger look at it.\nThe larger image will open in a new window, use the close button when finished.\nBelow you can see some distinct differences between the African elephant and the Asian elephants body structures. The African is larger, with much larger ears and larger all round in height and length. For more detailed information on either the African Elephant or the Asian Elephant, click on the individual images in the picture below.\nElephant Trunks\nOne of the most interesting features of an elephant is its trunk. An elephants trunk is both an upper lip and an extension of the nose with two nostrils running through the whole length.\nThe trunk has more than 40,000 muscles in it which is more than a human has in their whole body. A human being only has 639 muscles in total. An elephants trunk is both strong and very agile. It can perform multiple tasks from pushing over heavy trees to picking up the smallest twig. An elephant uses its trunk to pick up and throw objects, rub an itchy eye or ear, fills it with water and then pours it into its mouth to drink and also as a snorkel when swimming under water. Elephants also use it for feeding and for friendly wrestling matches with other elephants.\nThe trunk plays an important role in an elephants life by being used as an exploratory organ. The trunk is extremely flexible and can be used with the finest touch. At the first sign of danger, an elephant raises its trunk to smell the air and detect the smell of what is threatening. An elephant uses a whole range of smelling tasks as it is one of the elephants primary sensory organs, along with the ears. An elephants trunk is so important and vital to its life that it would be almost impossible for the elephant to survive should it ever get damaged.\nMost animals use their nose solely for breathing, however, the elephant also uses its trunk for water storage and for drawing in mud and dust to spray over themselves to clean or cool down. An average elephant can hold and store 4 litres of water inside its trunk. The trunk has a sparse covering of fine sensory hairs and the skin covering the front of the trunk has rings of deep crevasses and resembles a slinky.\nThe African elephant has two prehensile fingers at the tip of its trunk which are used to grab hold of objects and smaller items. The Asian elephant has only one finger at the end of its trunk and usually only uses its trunk to scoop things up. Elephants can lift very heavy weights with its trunk, but it is important to remember that each elephant is individual and unique and the amount of weight each can lift varies. The trunk is not usually used in combat or for fighting with, but it can be used to make threatening gestures. However, elephants do use their trunks to play fight which can be quite interesting to observe.\nAnother interesting observation is when an elephant is charging. If its trunk is stretched out in front, then the elephant is just bluffing. However, it the trunk is curled or tucked downwards then it means business and is serious about its intentions. Like all vertebrates, elephants possess the Jacobson\u2019s organ in its mouth (a smelling organ).\nThe elephant tests and experiments with different odours by touching a particular object with its trunk and then placing the trunk in its mouth. Elephants are very inquisitive creatures.\nElephant Tusks\nElephant tusks are very elongated incisor teeth. Elephants do not have any canine teeth at all. Both male and female African elephants have tusks, however, only the male species of the Asian elephant has them. Tusks continue growing for most of the elephants life. They are an age indicator \u2013 much like the elephants feet, the age of the elephant can be estimated by observing their tusks. The size of an elephants tusks is an inherited characteristic, however, because of ivory hunters, it would be quite rare today to find and elephant whose tusks weigh more than 100 pounds.\nThe total length of the tusks is not apparent on the outside of the elephant, about a third of the length of the tusk lies hidden inside the elephants skull. This is the unfortunate reason ivory hunters destroy the elephant for their tusks instead of just cutting them off. Ivory is really only dentine and is no different from ordinary teeth. It is the diamond shaped pattern of the elephants tusk which can be distinguished when viewed from a cross-section which gives elephant ivory its distinctive lustre.\nElephants are either \u2018left-tusked\u2019 or \u2018right-tusked\u2019, just like a human being might be \u2018left-handed\u2019 or \u2018right-handed\u2019. The favoured tusk is usually shorter than the other due to constant use. Tusks on an individual elephant can differ in shape, length, thickness and growth direction. Male elephants tend to have heavier, longer and more stouter tusks than females do.\nAn elephant uses its tusks to many many tasks just like its trunk. They use their tusks for digging, ripping bark of trees, foraging, carrying heavy objects and for resting a wary, heavy trunk on. They will also use them as weapons should they ever encounter conflict.\nTusks in a baby elephant (Calf) are present at birth and are really only like milk teeth. They measure only about 5 centimetres long. These \u2018milk tusks\u2019 will fall out around their first birthday. Their permanent tusks will then start to protrude beyond their lips at around 2 \u2013 3 years old and will continue to grow throughout their lives.\nTusks grow at about 15 \u2013 18 centimetres per year, however, they are continually worn down with constant use. Should they be allowed to continually grow without use, they would grow into a spiral shape (similar to those of the extinct woolly mammoth) as they typically grow following a curved growth pattern.\nInterestingly, some elephants are born without tusks. This hereditary condition causes huge differences in the musculature and shape of the neck and the head of the elephant. Also, the carriage of the head is different and the bones at the back of the skull are less developed.\nNot all male Asian elephants have tusks, there is approximately 40 \u2013 50% of male Asian elephants that are tuskless. These particular males are known as \u2018Makhnas\u2018 in India.\nElephant Teeth\nAn elephants teeth are very unique in the manner in which they proceed from the back of each half jaw towards the front. The teeth follow a linear progression. As the front teeth continuously become more worn down they are slowly replaced with new teeth that give the elephant an ability to chew the coarse foods it eats particularly tree bark. The elephant has a total of 24 teeth, but only 2 are usually in use at any one time.\nWhen an elephant is born, a calf has four developing teeth in each side of its jaws. These consist of their smallish first and second teeth which are present after birth and the end of a third and a forth which is still below the gum. As each tooth wears out, it is pushed forward to the front of the mouth and it slowly wears into a shelf as the roots are absorbed. The shelf eventually will break off and the remaining piece will be pushed out of the mouth.\nAfter the first two teeth are gone, parts of the two adjacent teeth are being worn down in each half of the jaw. This process continues until the 6th and sometimes 7th molar appears. The 6th molar weighs on average an incredible 4 kilograms and has a maximum grinding length of 21 centimetres (and a width of 7 centimetres). This 6th molar will be present for around half the elephants life. When the last molar tooth is worn down and the elephant can no longer chew properly, unfortunately it will usually starve or develop malnutrition and eventually die. This does not happen until the elephant is at least 60 \u2013 70 years old. Below is a table showing the onset and loss of each tooth and age the above process usually occurs:\nMolar Molar Appearance Molar Loss 1 At birth 2 years old 2 At birth 6 years old 3 1 year old 13 \u2013 15 years old 4 6 years old 28 years old 5 18 years old 43 years old 6 30 years old 65 years old +\nThe molars of an elephant differ between the African and Asian species. Both have a series of ridges (laminae) which run across the tooth. However, in the Asian elephant the ridges are parallel as opposed to the diamond shaped ridges in the African elephant. Although the Asian elephant has grazing teeth, it is usually spends most of its time in forests as opposed to plains like the African elephant.\nIn both species of elephant, the movement of the jaw during chewing is forwards and backwards, unlike cows who use sideways movements to chew their cud. Therefore, the ridges act as two rasps grating upon one another and is made more effective by the teeth being slightly curved along the lengths.\nElephants Brain\nThe brain of the elephant is larger than any other land mammal and is located in the back of the skull well away from the forehead. An elephants brain is about four times the size of a humans brain. (See diagram on the left). Out of all the animals that have ever lived on earth, the brain of the elephant is the largest known.\nElephants are born with 35% of the mass of the adult brain. The elephant is among the more intelligent animals. The brain weight of the male African elephant is 4.2-5.4 kilograms. The brain weight of the female African elephant is 3.6 \u2013 4.3 kilograms. Both are quite heavy in comparison to the adult human brain although brain development in elephants is quite similar to that of human beings.\nHumans are born with small brain mass, so are elephants. As a human brain grows and develops, so does an elephant calfs brain. Likewise, the learning ability of a human increases with growth, so does that of an elephant calf. It is not surprising that elephants are such intelligent creatures. Although the female elephant brain is smaller than the male elephant brain, this does not suggest that the male is more intelligent than the female. Studies have revealed that the female elephant is equal to or even more intelligent than the male. Given the fact that female elephants are generally smaller to male elephants, the brain mass in proportion to the body size indicates the larger female brain.\nAlso, the brain and consciousness of the female elephant is much different than that of a male as they are reared and interact with their mothers in very different ways right from birth and while the females form a very close knit bond with each other which is constantly maintained, the males are more solitary and independent.\nAlthough the brain of the elephant is the largest in size among all of the land mammals, it actually only occupies a small area at the back of the skull. However, in proportion to the size of the elephants body, the elephant brain is smaller than the human brain. Despite this, the elephant is one of the only animals along with all apes (including ourselves), sperm whales and a few other creatures who has a large brain relative to body size.\nElephant Hair\nAlthough elephants are generally considered hairless animals, both African and Asian elephants are born with thick hair. The elephant fetus is covered with \u2018Lanugo\u2019, a mass of long, downy hair, however, most of this is shed before the elephant is actually born. The hair on an elephant calf sheds more as the elephant calf grows. The hair is not designed to provide warmth for the elephant, however, it does allow the elephant to sense the closeness of objects the hair touches.\nThe hair on an elephant is thickest on the tail and more visible on the head and back. The hair on the tail can reach a length of up to 100 centimetres.\nThe hair that appears around the eyes and nose have a protection purpose. It helps to keep out particles and germs from invading the body through the ears and nose. An elephant also has small sensory hairs along its trunk.\nBaby elephants (calves) have lots of small fine hairs that cover most of their body. In the photo on the left, you can see the fine hair on the calfs forehead and lower back. These hairs will last in the same density long after the elephants first birthday and then as the elephant grows the hair will gradually become thinner and become less visible.\nElephant Ears\nThe African elephant has ears that are at least 3 times the size of the Asian elephants ears. The African elephant uses its ears as signaling organs. Ears are also used to regulate body temperature and are used as a protective feature in the African elephant to ward off potential threats. Each elephants ear is unique and different to any other elephants ear. They are used just like fingerprints on a human as a type of identification. The ears serve several important functions in the elephant. When a threat is perceived by the elephant, the ears are spread wide on each side of the head, which produces a huge frontal area.\nBecause the elephant is such a large bulbous shape and contains large organs, their insides generate a lot of heat, particularly the digestive system. The surface area of an elephant is a lower ratio compared to the elephants volume. Therefore, there is not enough skin area to cope with the heat that needs expelling. So elephants use their ears to perform this function. When an elephant flaps its ears, it can lower their blood temperature by 10 degrees Fahrenheit . Both the African and Asian elephants use their ears for this purpose although it is more effective in the African elephant due to the larger ears.\nThe wider surface area of outer ear tissue on the African elephants ears consists of a vast network of capillaries and veins. Hot blood in the arteries are filtered through these and cooler blood is returned to the elephants body.\nIt is not uncommon to see an elephant facing down on a windy day with its ears extended to allow the cool wind to blow across the hot arteries. The physical structure of the elephant ear is simply a sheet of cartilage covered by thin skin. Another amazing function of the elephant ear is its \u2018infra sound capabilities\u2019. This is used for long range communication between the elephants. Elephant ears are extremely sensitive and studies have proved that elephants can communicate over great distances with each other. Elephants can use this communication which is unhearing to human ears to warn of impending dangers in the far distance. So do not forget, if you have the opportunity to ever touch the ears of an elephant, be very careful as they are very soft and sensitive.\nElephant Feet\nElephants feet are unique and very interesting. They are quite different from other animal feet. An elephants foot is designed in such a way that elephants actually walk on the tips of their toes. Because of the way it walks, elephants are also known as \u2018Digitigrades\u2019 and belong to a group of animals that also includes horses, cattle, sheep, camels and rhinos. All elephants do not have the same number of toes on each foot. The African elephants have 4 toes on their front feet and 3 toes on their back feet. Asian elephants on the other hand, have 5 on the front and 4 at the back.\nElephants toes are buried inside of the flesh of the foot and not all toes have toenails. An elephants foot generally measures 40 \u2013 50 centimetres in length and width and has a circumference of about 1.34 metres. The sole of an elephants foot is made of a tough, fatty connective tissue which acts like a spongy shock absorber and allows the elephant to move about silently.\nThe sole of the foot is also ridged and pitted which gives the elephant stability when walking over a variety of terrains. Its design prevents the elephant from slipping on smooth surfaces such as ice and snow. The reason that elephants can walk so quietly is in part due to the \u2018elastic spongy cushion\u2019 on the bottom of the foot smothering any objects beneath itself. This causes most noises (including the cracking of sticks and twigs) to be muffled.\nThe fore feet of an elephant have a circular shape whereas the back feet are a more oval shape. The footprint of an elephant can tell you a few things about that particular elephant. For example, elongated oval footprints usually indicates that they belong to a male elephant, whereas a more rounded footprint indicates a female elephant. Male elephants tend to leave double footprints as their rear leg falls slightly to the side of their front leg. Females tend to walk more precisely in the same spot with both legs.\nThe footprint can also tell you what age the elephant might be. Younger elephants leave a more crisp and defined footprint. Older elephants leave a more undefined footprint because of smoother ridges and worn heels. The height of the elephant can also be determined by its footprint. Twice the circumference of the footprint suggests how tall the elephant is to the height of its shoulder. Elephants footprints can play a beneficial role for other animals. Their large, deep prints create holes in which water can be collected in providing water holes for small animals, roots can be dug up from the ground and navigation on difficult terrain can be made easier.\nThe structure of the foot allows an elephant to walk in deep mud without difficulty, because when it is being withdrawn the circumference becomes smaller which in turn reduces the suction preventing the elephant from being drawn deeper into the mud.\nElephant Skin\nAlthough elephants belong to the Pachyderm species which means \u2018thick-skinned\u2019 animals, they actually have very thin skin except in certain places such as the back and the sides where it is about 2 \u2013 3 centimetres thick. The thinnest parts of skin are behind their ears, around their eyes, on the chest, abdomen and shoulders. On these parts, their skin is as thin as paper. Skin provides a protective function for all animals, however, there are some unique characteristics about the elephants skin. Elephants skin is very sensitive to the sun. Elephant calves are constantly shadowed by their mothers to avoid sunburn.\nElephants naturally love water, however, one of the reasons they enjoy wallowing in mud, lakes and rivers is to keep cool when it is very hot. Elephants also use their trunks to draw up cool water and squirt it over their backs and heads to wet the skin most exposed to the sunlight. The absence of sweat glands is also another important reason for elephants to spend a lot of time in water and mud.\nAn elephants skin is so sensitive and rich in nerves that it can detect even the smallest fly landing upon it. As we all know, elephants skin is very wrinkly. These wrinkles have their purpose too. They help the elephant in controlling its body temperature and keeping itself cool.\nWrinkles increase the surface area of the skin so when the elephant bathes in water, there is more skin to wet. When the elephant comes out of the water, the cracks and crevices of the wrinkles trap the water and because it takes longer to evaporate in the heat it keeps the elephants skin moist longer than it would if it had smooth skin.\nSkin structure on an elephant can also distinguish whether they are Asian or African. Asian elephants have finer skin than African elephants and it is sometimes colorless except for some \u2018white spots\u2019 around the ears and forehead.\nThe natural skin color of the African elephant is greyish black, but all elephant skin color changes and is determined by the color of the soil of the land where their habitat is. Elephants have a habit of throwing mud over their backs and this gives them their apparent coloring.\nElephant Senses and Communication\nBy better understanding an elephants view of the world we can become more aware of how amazing these animals really are. As human beings, the impact our senses have on the nature of our experiences such as what we see, hear, smell and touch, play a huge part in determining our world. Likewise, it is important that we recognize the world of an elephant is much different from our world. For instance, the eyesight of an elephant is not as far reaching as a humans eyesight, however, an elephants sense of smell is unparalleled. The elephants acute sense of smell is also used in communication along with its other senses of vision, touch, hearing and the amazing ability to detect vibrations.\nAn elephant is capable of hearing sound waves well below the human hearing limitation. They communicate using both high and low frequency sounds. Low frequency rumbles are made to warn other elephants at long distance of a current situation whereas high frequency sounds such as trumpeting, barking, snorting and other loud calls are used to communicate to those nearer.\nUsing their heads, bodies, trunks, ears and tail for communicating is the elephants natural language. Visual communication includes movements of the head, mouth, tusks and trunk. For example, when a female elephant feels threatened, she will make herself appear larger by holding her head as high as she can and spreading her ears wide. Chemical communication is the use of the trunk. The elephant will lift its trunk to smell the air or root around the floor usually searching for urine spots and urine trails.\nTactile communication usually involves the whole body, feet, tail, ears, trunk and tusks and is mostly to do with touch. An elephant will use its tusks to provoke aggression or to lift a baby elephant out of a mud wallow. The rubbing together of ears shows affection. Depending on how the elephant moves and uses its body parts depicts the mood of the animal. Such moods and body movements show if the elephant is angry, happy, anti-predator, parental, excited or sad. Every observation of the elephant senses shows an insight to the world the elephant lives in. It is important to remember that the elephants world is a completely different world from ours based on its sensory experiences."}

The name elephant bird is also known as Aepyornis Maximus and was derived from Marco Polo\u2019s description of a giant bird that could grab an elephant by its claws. This description describes the Rhuk, though it does not describe the Elephant bird as the bird could not fly. The Rhuk is a bird talked about in the Middle East of whose existence is a myth. In Madagascar, the bird was named Vorompatra, which means bird of southern Madagascar. The birds were reported to be seen mostly in the less populated parts of southern Madagascar.\nPhysical Description\nElephant birds were giant birds that at one time lived in Madagascar Island. The elephant bird weighed between 770 to 1,100 pounds and was more than 9.8 feet tall making it the largest and heaviest bird to have ever walked the Earth. The bird looked like an ostrich but way bigger and was herbivorous. The only bird to nearly weigh the same as the elephant bird was the Dromonis Stirtoni found in Australia, they too are extinct.\nBehavior\nRatites are a group of birds lacking the ability to fly. A flat breastbone lacking a keel makes these birds unable to fly, and the elephant bird was classified into this group. Evolution through the years has led to a group of birds that cannot fly. Some of the ratites include the ostrich and kiwi. The African Ostrich is the largest ratite today.\nReproduction\nThe bird\u2019s egg weighed around 22 pounds with a fluid content of about two gallons and was 13 inches long, and this is reported as the largest egg ever laid by an animal. The egg could feed a whole family. Several species of the elephant bird eggs and eggshells have been discovered and collected to be preserved in different museums around the world.\nExtinction\nThe birds went into extinction either in the 17th or the 18th century. Humans are believed to have caused the extinction of the birds. Archaeologists have found remains of the bird\u2019s eggshells in human fires indicating that the eggs were a source of food for humans at the time. The birds were also hunted for food. Agriculture and the growth of human population leading to humans needing more land to inhabit may have destroyed the habitats of the bird homes also leading to their extinction."}

This page contains African elephant facts and information. If you enjoy learning about this (usually) gentle giant, then visit our African Animals page and find out about more amazing animals.\nAfrican Elephant Information\nAfrican Elephants are the world\u2019s largest land animal. These gentle giants can be distinguished from their Indian counterparts by their huge ears. African elephants can reach heights of 13 feet (4 meters) at the shoulder. They can weigh as much as 14,000 pounds (6,350 kilograms).\nThere are two species of African elephant: the African Bush (or Savanna) elephant and the African Forest Elephant. (Until recently, scientists considered Bush Elephants and Forest Elephants to be subspecies, rather than separate species in their own right.)\nAfrican Elephant Features\nTheir huge ears help keep African elephants cool in the African sunshine by radiating heat. Perhaps the best known feature of elephants are their multi-functional long trunks, which can be used for smelling, breathing, trumpeting, drinking and grabbing things.\nBoth male and female African elephants have long upper incisor teeth which develop into ivory tusks which they can use to dig for food and water, and also strip bark from trees. Males will also use their tusks during fights with other males.\nYou can get an idea just how big and powerful African elephants are in the video below:\nAfrican Elephant Facts: Where do African Elephants live?\nNo big surprise, but African elephants can be found wandering their way through 37 African countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and the rain forests of central and west Africa. A small population exist further north in the Sahel desert of Mali. Forest elephants are smaller than Savannah elephants and are uniquely adapted to the forest habitat found in the Congo Basin.\nAfrican Elephant Habitat\nAfrican elephants inhabit tropical and sub-tropical broadleaf forests, flooded grasslands and savannahs as well as Miombo woodlands and Acacia savannahs.\nAfrican elephants have a strong impact on the habitats they inhabit, and can help to make them suitable for other species. In the forests, it is estimated that 30% of tree species benefit from dispersal and germination via elephants.\nWhat Do African Elephants Eat?\nAfrican elephants roam vast distances, foraging as they go. They eat fruit, grasses, bark and roots in huge quantities, consuming up to 300 pounds (136 kilograms) per day. They will also consume 30 to 50 gallons of water a day.\nAfrican Elephant Population\nThe African elephant population is estimated at around 470,000 individuals, however, numbers in the last century were estimated to be between 3 and 5 million. Elephant pregnancies are the longest of any mammals, a full 22 months. Females (cows) generally have a single calf every 2 to 4 years. At birth, baby elephants already measure 3 feet (1 meter) in height and weight a massive 200 pounds (91 kilograms).\nFemale and young elephants live and travel in groups called herds led by an older matriarch female, while males (bulls) are more likely to be found on their own, or in a loose \u2018bachelor\u2019 herd. In the wild,\nAre African Elephants Endangered?\nAfrican elephants are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. In the 1980s, intensive hunting resulted in the loss of up to 80% of some herds, and 100,000 elephants every year. The ivory trade is the biggest problem facing wild African elephants today. African elephant tusks are made of ivory and many have been killed illegally by poachers who want to sell the ivory.\nDue to expansion of human populations, the range of African elephant habitat has shrunk dramatically. Between 1979 and 2007, the range shrank from just over 3 million square miles to just over 1 million square miles.\nOrganisation such as the International Elephant Foundation have been set up to help save elephants.\nTop Ten African Elephant Facts\nThe tip of the African elephant trunk has two opposable extensions which act like fingers. Elephants are born with \u2018baby tusks\u2019 which fall out and are replaced with permanent adult tusks which grown throughout life. On average, elephants can here calls of others from 2.5 miles (4 kilometres away). Elephants care for the wounded and grieve the dead. To greet returning friends, elephants spin in circles, flap their ears and trumpet. Savanna elephants have tusks that curve, forest elephants have tusk pointing straight downward. Elephants a very wrinkly and have sparse hair across the body. African elephants can live to be 70 years old in the wild. There are more than 40,000 muscles and tendons in the elephant trunk. The scientific name of the African elephant is Loxodonta africana. Loxo is from the Greek for oblique sided, and donta is tooth.\nEnjoyed these African elephant facts?

They use them to strip bark and soft wood off trees, which they subsequently eat. Their tusks can also help them to survive through dry spells, as they use them to bore down into the earth and find water in dry riverbeds. In addition, they use them to dig in the ground and uncover salts and other minerals that are vital to their diets."}

They are pampered. Revered. Loved. And worshipped. India is a home for elephants. Currently, the country has 55% of the population of Asian elephants. Amongst which South Indian states Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu have 44% of the elephants. Karnataka has the highest number of elephants in India. The number speaks of myriad observations why Indians worship elephants. Come join us as we demystify this and learn more fascinating facts about elephants.\nWhy are elephants sacred in India?\nIndians consider taking the blessings of an elephant as an obstacle remover. They are also considered as the form of Goddess Lakshmi Devi and Lord Ganesha who are considered to be prosperity bringers.\nElephants have been worshipped and pampered during the kings\u2019 times in India. The number of elephants in the army of a king resembled its strength and warfare stamina.\nHistorical tales indicate that even the army of mighty Alexander the Great could not win over the Indian war elephants.\nNot only in warfare, but the role of elephants in building ancient Indian architectural marvels like Brihadeeswara temple and Konark temple is notable. They played a crucial role in carrying heavyweights to the construction sites and helped engineers of ancient India.\nEven today, in places where modern engineering equipment cannot reach due to poor roads or terrain, elephants are widely used for transporting heavy loads and timber.\nVarious cave paintings, coin inscriptions, and images from early civilizations like Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro contain elephants. They prove that elephants are worshipped and cared for in ancient India.\nTemples in South India also have their role to play in passing on their sanctity. Temple goers do take blessings from these temple elephants believing that they are divine.\nNot only in India, but elephants are regarded as spiritual symbols across many global cultures too. The elephant is considered a sacred animal in Asian countries such as Thailand and Burma, and Africa. There are instances where Burman kings waged wars over the possession of white elephants.\nThai kings on Elephants\nWhat does an elephant symbolize?\nElephants symbolize royalty, majesty, strength, divinity, abundance, fertility, wisdom, observation, destructive power, and learning. Along with these, elephants symbolize various qualities that we should learn:\nAn elephant is the strongest mammal. It is slow, patient, and vegetarian.\nElephants are the advanced stages of evolution when it comes to brain structure. Amongst all animals, the brain of elephants is the most advanced in complexity on par with humans.\nThe eyes of an elephant are small, and its ears are big. It indicates that one should be attentive and listen more.\nThe trunk of an elephant is long, and the sound reflects the OM sound, the celestial sound revered in Hinduism.\nAn elephant lives in groups, teaching us the importance of social life. They are very patient, mellow, and friendly unless you threaten their young ones or the herd.\nElephants are vegetarian and prove that one can grow strong and wise with vegetarian food and without killing other creatures.\nElephants are known for their loyalty. In Kerala and Karnataka, you can hear stories about elephants that refuse to eat or do anything when their mahouts die.\nThough elephants are big in size, they never threaten other animals or humans unless they sense danger. Thus, they teach us that it is a coexistence that is important but not dominant.\nDue to such elephant symbolism, they find a place in Vastu, Fengshui, mandala, and other spiritual practices that help to infuse health and happiness to humans.\nAn elephant with its trunk up symbolizes blessings and fulfillment of wishes. Keeping elephant pics, idols, and paintings are considered lucky according to such beliefs.\nSignificance of Elephant in Hinduism\nThe Sanatana Dharma of Hinduism holds utmost prominence to elephants. Though we do not find direct mention of elephants in Vedas, there are various instances where we find the tales of their greatness.\nAccording to Hindu beliefs, the Earth is protected by 8 divine elephants on eight sides on their backs.\nThe Gajendra Moksham of Bhagavata Purana is widely known. According to this epic, Lord Vishnu himself comes from Vaikuntha to Earth to save his ardent devotee, Gajendra \u2013 an elephant, from the clutches of a crocodile.\nLord Indra has Airavata, a white elephant with wings, as his vehicle. Airavata originated during the Sagara Mathan, the churning of the cosmic milk ocean by Gods and Demons. Airavata is a milky white elephant and is considered the sibling of Goddess Lakshmi. The elephant is five-faced with ten tusks.\nThe elephant is also a vehicle for Goddess Lakshmi and Vishwakarma \u2013 the divine engineer who designed the Universe. One of the eight forms of Goddess Lakshmi is Gaja Lakshmi \u2013 which means Lakshmi who comes on an elephant to bless her devotees with abundance.\nThe story of lifeless little Ganesha coming back to life with the help of an elephant head needs no introduction. Ganesha, the divine son of Goddess Parvati, finds his second life with the help of the head of Gajasura \u2013 the elephant demon blessed by Lord Shiva. Ganesha is the supreme God for Hindus in seeking removal from obstacles and Ganesh Chaturthi marks the significance of this event. Thus, the elephant head primarily represents Ganesha as an obstacle remover.\nAccording to Hindus, one cannot easily get an elephant ride. A ride on an elephant is destined only for those with luck, raja yoga, and good karma. It was a tradition to respect scholars with a ride on the elephant to honor their knowledge and wisdom.\nEven today, the practice of offering a gandapenderam ( a form of jewelry adorned to the legs of scholars similar to the one that an elephant wears to its foot) is the utmost respect one gives to the learned.\nAll these reasons explain why Hindus worship elephants.\nGanesha \u2013 the elephant faced God\nSignificance of Elephant in Indian religions\nA white elephant is considered an auspicious sign if it appears in one\u2019s dream. The mythical white elephant is revered not only by Hindus but also by people of all religions of India owing to its religious significance.\nIslam: According to Islam, Prophet Muhammad was born in the year 570, recognized as the Year of Elephant. A chapter called White Elephant in Quran mentions how a white elephant of Abraha, ruler of Yemen, led 40,000 soldiers but refused to enter Mecca when he planned to demolish the Kaaba.\nBuddhism: According to Buddhism, the mother of Buddha \u2013 Queen Maya Devi did not become pregnant till she saw a white elephant in her dream. In the dream, a white elephant circled her three times, offered her a lotus flower, and then sought her blessings before it entered her womb. The royal priests then decoded this dream as the most auspicious one that leads to the birth of a world conqueror and an Enlightened one who is none other than Gautama Buddha.\nChristianity: According to Christians, the elephant is a symbol of docility, sobriety, and piety. Christian kings wear a collar with an elephant symbol as a symbolism of the same.\nBuddhists revere elephants\nSignificance of temple elephants of India\nTemple elephants of India have always been an interest of curiosity for foreigners. The way they are adorned with jewelry and clothes, the respect and joy people shower at their sight piques curiosity to the onlookers.\nIn temples of Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka, you can find many temple elephants. Generally, a mahout always stays with them and cares for them. These temple elephants bless people who approach them. In return, they pay a little amount or offer fruits as a token of gratitude and maintenance.\nThe Guruvayoor Temple in Kerala alone has more than 50 elephants. The temple elephants are an integral part of the Keralites\u2019 lifestyle. No festivity happens either in personal life or in the temples without the involvement of an elephant procession.\nNot only for Hindu festivals, but they are integral for Muslim and Christian celebrations too. Pattambi mosque in Palakkad and Jacobite Church in Thrissur are examples that use them for their festive celebrations.\nGajarajan Guruvayur Keshavan (1912\u20141976) is perhaps the most famous and celebrated temple elephant in Kerala, India. Initially captured in the Nilambur forest, this elephant served the royal families before they donated it to the Guruvayur temple. It is the only elephant to have served the temple longest to date in helping the procession of the Utsava Murthi (idol that is meant for processions). One should not miss the event of elephant decoration and race during Onam festival.\nEven during the world-renowned Tirumala Brahmotsavam, it is a custom to take the Lord Malayappa idol on an elephant around the Mada streets.\nElephants in Kerala temples\nSignificance of elephant in Indian art\nThe elephant symbol is one of the most widely used symbols in Indian art and handicrafts. Many Indian ethnic works include elephant symbols in their making \u2013 for instance, in saree designs, home d\u00e9cor, block prints, idols, statues for decoration of public places, etc.\nElephant carvings are also one of the prominent attractions in ancient Indian monuments. The Elephanta caves near Mumbai attain their name from the huge rock-cut of elephants at its entrance.\nSimilarly, the Ganga Avtaran carving (the descent of Ganges onto the Earth) near Mahabalipuram is also world-renowned for its intrinsic work depicting the majestic animals.\nElephants at Mahabalipuram Ganges Descent Carving\nFacts about Elephants\nAs interesting as they can be, facts about elephants say that elephants are fun-loving and joyous animals.\nThe gestation period of an elephant is 22 months, which is approximately two years! Interestingly, elephant calves stand up as soon as 20 minutes after their birth.\nThe birth weight of a baby elephant is 95 kgs. An adult Asian elephant weighs 4000kgs.\nThe smelling power of an elephant is very sharp. Its trunk can sniff water from as far as 12 miles.\nElephants sleep only 2-3 hours per day. Adult elephants need 300kg of food and 160 liters of water per day.\nElephants sprinkle dust on their back after a long clean bath. Do you know why? This dust acts as a sunscreen for them as their skin is sensitive to sunlight.\nThe lifespan of an elephant is around 70 years.\nThe trunk of an elephant alone weighs 140kg and can hold 12 liters of water.\nThe tusks of elephants are actually their teeth. They help in food gathering and self-defense. Unfortunately, they are also the main reason why elephants are hunted.\nEver wondered why an elephant\u2019s skin is wrinkled? It is because it stores water amidst the wrinkles to provide moisture to its body.\nThe memory power of elephants is amazing. They can even distinguish languages.\nBy looking at the size, you may assume elephants can\u2019t swim. But do you know? Elephants are excellent swimmers!\nWorld Elephant Day is celebrated on 12th August every year. The day honors their contribution to the ecosystem and reminds us about their conservation."}

The differences between most mammals and elephants, however, is that elephants' incisors eventually become tusks as they grow into full-grown adults! This is the case for all elephants except female Asian elephants.\nElephants have a total of 26 teeth, their tusks counting for two. Unlike humans, elephants lose their molars--not once in their lives--but six times! Each time they lose these teeth, the new ones that come in a larger, allowing them to chew even tougher vegetation (like roots, shoots, and tree bark). They chew their food for long amounts of time--this is why they are eating 22 hours of the day!\nThough their tusks are long, come out of their mouths, and are important for digging up roots, breaking off bark, and moving away unwanted vegetation, they are basically made of the same ivory as the rest of their teeth! Unfortunately this precious ivory is what has resulted in the deaths of thousands of these beautiful animals."}

Please see our disclosure policy for more details.\nSharing is Caring!\nAs the largest animal on land, it\u2019s not hard to be mesmerized and amazed by elephants! But, did you know there\u2019s even more to these majestic critters?\nIf you\u2019re curious to know about what makes these super-sized mammals tick, you\u2019ve come to the right place! These fascinating elephant facts for kids will fill you in on their unique quirks!\nFun & Interesting Elephant Facts For Kids\nElephants are a special part of our ecosystem, playing their role along with all the animals of the wild. Browse through these interesting elephant facts for kids to find out more about them!\n1. There Are Two Main Species of Elephant!\nThough there are actually a few species of elephants, they fall into two main classifications. These higher classifications are the African elephant and the Asian elephant!\nAsian elephants include the Indian, Borneo, and Sri Lankan elephants. African elephants include the African bush and smaller African forest elephants!\nAs hinted in their names, African elephants are native to Africa and Asian elephants to the Asian continent. In terms of looks, each of these types of elephants is slightly different, too!\nThe Asian elephant is smaller in size with smaller ears, whereas the African elephant is larger. In fact, African bush elephants weigh on average around 2200 tons more than Asian elephants!\n2. Elephants Use Their Trunks Much Like We Do Our Hands!\nElephants have up to 40,00 muscle units in their trunk alone, making them very nimble! To compare, the human body only has around 600 muscles!\nAs such, elephant trunks get plenty of use \u2013 be it for foraging, drinking water, or being used as a snorkel! Elephants also use their trunks to shower themselves with water and mud to cool down.\nApart from this, elephants use their trunks to communicate and be affectionate to one another, too! In fact, elephants will go to grieving herd members and stroke them with their trunks!\nYes, you could say an elephant would be lost without his trunk! Elephants can even hold a paintbrush with theirs and paint a picture, using both their trunk and incredible intelligence!\n3. Elephants Have \u201cFingers\u201d on Their Trunk For Grasping\nYes, both African and Asian elephants have little protruding \u201cfingers\u201d on their trunks to grasp things! However, Asian elephants only have one finger, and African elephants have two!\nOf course, these \u201cfingers\u201d don\u2019t look like human fingers but do have a similar purpose. In fact, these \u201cfingers\u201d allow elephants to nimbly pick up small objects, such as a grass blade or peanut!\n4. Only Some Male Asian Elephants Have Tusks\nOne fun elephant fact for kids is that Asian and African elephants differ considerably as far as looks go. But, did you know that only some Asian male elephants have tusks?\nLuckily for them, this makes these elephants less appealing to poachers. Unfortunately, both African male and female elephants have tusks, putting them at higher risk from Ivory poachers.\n5. Some African Elephants Can Grow Up To Almost A Story Tall!\nThe average African elephant is around 9 to 13 feet tall! So, that means that the taller of these African elephants are almost as tall as your average 14-foot one-story building!\nYes, elephants have definitely earned their place in the Big 5, along with the Lion, Buffalo, Rhinoceros, and Leopard! These majestic mammals are lofty, unique, and powerful!\n6. Elephants Weigh The Same As A Car or Two!\nIf you\u2019ve never seen an elephant, then you\u2019re likely wondering how big they really are? Well, at least as tall as your average basketballer and, at the minimum, as heavy as a few cars!\nAfrican elephants weigh 8800-15,400 tons, while Asian elephants come in at a slightly smaller 6600-13,200 tons! To compare, the average car only weighs around 4000 tons.\n7. Elephants Are Vegetarians!\nNot all big animals need meat to bulk up! Elephants are the largest land animal but only eat a herbivorous diet, including roots, grasses, fruit, and bark!\nOf course, much like cows or goats, they also need to forage and eat all day long to eat their fill! Only in this way can they maintain their considerable body weight, nutrition, and health.\n8. Elephants Are Mammals, Just Like Us!\nMammals are a select group of living beings that include humans and all species of elephants, too! Yes, elephants are furry, warm-blooded vertebrates that nurse their young \u2013 just like us!\n9. Newborn Elephants Calves Are Quite Capable!\nIn the wild, a vulnerable baby animal is the ideal soft target for all the predators. As such, baby elephant calves have to learn to stand quickly to survive!\nLuckily, they\u2019ve got this down pat \u2013 the average baby elephant can stand within around 20 minutes of birth! Luckily, their herd will also stand guard while the baby finds his feet.\n10. Elephants Can Eat Up to 300 Lbs of Food Every Day!\nOn the topic of elephant facts for kids, your average elephant sure can eat a considerable amount! Yes, an elephant can consume up to 300 lbs worth of food per day!\nTo compare, the average adult human only eats around 3-5 lbs of food per day. Yes, that means that an elephant can eat around 100 days worth of your food in just one day!\n11. Elephants Can Communicate Via Vibrations!\nElephants communicate through both sound and touch, among other things. But, did you know that they can also communicate via inaudible vibrations called \u201crumbles\u201d?\nYes, elephants can pick up sounds that even we humans cannot hear by picking these up with their bones. These vibrations are usually in the infrasonic range of 30 Hertz.\nElephants don\u2019t just hear these frequencies in their bones, though; they can also produce them to communicate! In fact, elephant \u201crumbles\u201d can travel just over 2km away!\n12. Elephants Are Some of The Smartest Animals Out There!\nWith an estimated 257,000,000,000 neurons in their whole nervous systems and around 11,000,000,000 in the cerebral cortex alone, it\u2019s not hard to guess elephants are clever!\nTo compare, humans only have an estimated 86,000,000,000 neurons in their whole nervous system. And, around 21,000,000,000 in their cerebral cortex.\nThe only other animals that beat both elephants and us are the long-finned pilot whale and fin whale! Elephants also have the largest brains \u2013 6.5 kg for African and 5.5kg for Asian elephants.\nOf course, neurons and brain size aren\u2019t the only or most accurate measure of intelligence! However, research on elephant behavior, communication, and memory further prove theirs!\n13. Elephants Really Do Have Thick Skin!\nElephants, particularly African elephants, live in tough climates, where it\u2019s hot, and water is often scarce. As such, they\u2019ve evolved to manage these harsh conditions with a thick skin!\nThe average elephant\u2019s skin can be around 2.5 cm thick all over its body. Plus, certain parts of African elephants\u2019 skin, especially wrinkles, can also retain a lot of water to keep them cool.\nYou see, elephants have no sebum or glands with which to sweat and cool down. They also take good care of their skin, taking regular mud baths to keep it clean, hydrated, and protected.\n14. Elephants Have Ears Shaped Like Africa!\nHere\u2019s another fun elephant fact for kids \u2013 yes, elephants really do have Africa-shaped ears! What\u2019s even more interesting is that this feature is more pronounced on African elephants!\nYes, their large ears look exactly like the African continent! Interestingly, the Asian elephant\u2019s ears aptly look like the continent of India, too!\n15. There Used to be a Straight-Tusked Elephant Roaming Europe!\nLong ago, in the Middle and Late Pleistocene period, a large species of elephant \u2013 the straight-tusked elephant, roamed! This species was slightly larger than an African elephant.\nPalaeoloxodon antiquus had long, straight tusks, too! Perhaps this elephant\u2019s above-average height is what contributed to its tusks being able to grow down straight, as well?\n16. Both African and Asian Elephants Are Under Threat!\nThough elephants surely are majestic, drawing visitors from all around the world, they\u2019re also dwindling in numbers. This is due mainly to the demand for ivory and the urbanization of land.\nUnfortunately, the African elephant is now vulnerable, and the Asian elephant is endangered. Asian elephants may not be the main target for poaching due to some male having small tusks.\nHowever, their species is mainly affected by the destruction of their natural habitat due to mass urbanization. Only thanks to conservation efforts to help do both elephant species still exist!\n17. There is a Black Market Market for Ivory!\nIvory poaching involves killing elephants for their tusks, which are then carved into jewelry or statues or made into medicine. Tusks are valued at hundreds to thousands of dollars per kg.\nLegal ivory markets around the world allow the sale of antique ivory and certain legal ivory stockpiles. However, this legal market is sometimes used as a cover to sell illegal ivory.\nIvory trading was banned worldwide in 1989, with many countries banning the trade of ivory domestically thereafter. Illegal ivory comes from illegal poaching and the black market.\nThe black market ivory trade has had a severe impact on elephant populations. Besides being claimed to have medicinal effects, buyers believe that ivory is a symbol of wealth and affluence.\n18. Elephant Tusks Are Teeth Just Like Ours, Just Bigger!\nOne interesting elephant fact for kids is that elephant tusks aren\u2019t actually that strange, though they may be large! You see, tusks are actually enlarged incisor teeth, much like ours.\nSimilar to a sharp set of predators\u2019 teeth, tusks are mainly a form of protection. Elephants use their tusks to protect themselves, as well as to forage, rip off tree bark, and dig for roots!\n19. Some Female African Elephants Are Born With No Tusks!\nDid you know, though most African elephants are born with tusks, be they male or female, some females aren\u2019t?\nAs many as 4% are born like this; however, more and more are being born without any tusks! These tuskless elephants don\u2019t appeal to ivory poachers, so they have a high survival rate.\nAs such, these elephants live to procreate, passing on their tuskless genes to their babies. This phenomenon is resulting in a higher and higher tuskless female African elephant population.\nLuckily, this evolution is favorable for elephants as it boosts their chances of survival. Perhaps this evolution and natural selection will help to keep the elephants around for years to come?\n20. Elephant Herds Are Matriarchal, Not Patriarchal!\nAnother very interesting elephant fact for kids is that elephant herds are matriarchal, not patriarchal. This means the herd is headed by a female elephant, not a bull!\nYes, elephant herds are led by an older female elephant! In fact, herds are usually made up of around a handful, up to two dozen mothers, sisters, daughters, and baby elephants!\nConclusion:\nElephants are such majestic animals.

It uses excellent sense of hearing, smell and eyesight to detect both food and predators.\nCleared areas on the ground also serve as exit routes in the case of danger. When it is confronted with predators, elephant shrew often bangs the ground with its legs and tail.\nNatural enemies of elephant shrews are snakes, lizards and birds of prey.\nElephant shrews live in pairs (that mate for a lifetime). They occupy territory of few acres, but spend most of the time alone (they gather only to mate).\nElephant shrews use scent glands under the tail to mark their trails and point out toward direction of food. They aggressively defend their territory against other elephant shrews (both males and females scream and fight with intruders).\nFemales have menstrual cycle that resembles the menstrual cycle of a woman. They produce several litters per year.\nPregnancy lasts 45 to 60 days and ends with 1 or 2 babies which spend first few days in the nest. Mashed insects are introduced at the age of 5 days (while babies are still on a milk-based diet). Young elephant shrews become ready to seek food on their own at the age of 15 days and to reproduce at the age of 41 to 46 days."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephant Seal Facts, Worksheets, Taxonomy & Etymology For Kids", "url": "https://kidskonnect.com/animals/elephant-seal/", "text": "Not ready to purchase a subscription? Click to download the free sample version Download sample\nAlso known as sea elephants, elephant seals (genus Mirounga) are large aquatic mammals residing in sub-Antarctic regions. They are very sociable animals and get their name from their massive size and the male\u2019s trunk-like snout.\nSee the fact file below for more information on the elephant seals or alternatively, you can download our 20-page Elephant Seal worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\nKey Facts & Information\nTAXONOMY AND ETYMOLOGY\nThe elephant seal is classified in the genus Mirounga under the suborder Pinnipedia. It has two recognized species in existence \u2013 the Mirounga angustirostris (northern elephant seal) and the Mirounga leonina (southern elephant seal).\nBritish zoologist John Edward Gray established the genus Mirounga in the year 1827. The term is said to have been derived from the word miouroung, which means \u201cseal\u201d in an Australian Aboriginal language.\nPHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES\nThe two species of elephant seals can be distinguished from each other through various features. Male adult northern elephant seals or bulls can reach 4.3 to 4.8 meters in length and can weigh up to about 2,500 kilograms.\nElephant seals, similar to other types of seals, are generally characterized by having short limbs and no external ears. However, they are significantly larger than other seals.\nMale southern elephant seals can be as long as 6 meters and can reach up to 4,000 kilograms in weight, while female seals or cows measure around 3 meters and weigh 900 kilograms on average.\nThe northern elephant seal displays a yellowish or gray-brown color, while the southern elephant seal is blue-gray. Adult males of the northern species also tend to have larger snouts compared to the southern species.\nBEHAVIOR\nElephant seals have the ability to hold their breath for more than 100 minutes, enabling them to spend about 80% of their lives in the ocean.\nThese animals can dive up to 1,550 meters below the surface of the ocean, and they only spend 2-3 minutes on land in between their dives.\nThey also undergo a molting period for about a month during which their outer skin and hair peel off in large patches. Due to the thinner layer of covering from the molting process, these animals are more susceptible to colder temperatures. Thus, they have to stay on land until their new skin regrows.\nThe northern species of elephant seals are non-migratory, which means that they do not leave their territories when the seasons change.\nOn the other hand, southern elephant seals spend their winters at sea, although they also molt on land.\nHABITAT AND DIET\nThe two species of elephant seals differ in their habitat based on location. The northern elephant seals occupy areas in the Pacific coast, while the southern seals can be found throughout the sub-Antarctic regions.\nElephant seals hunt for their prey during their dives into the sea. Their typical diet includes a variety of sea creatures, such as squid, eel, octopus, rays, and large fish.\nTheir stomachs contain gastroliths that help grind the food since elephant seals lack teeth suitable for breaking down their food.\nREPRODUCTION\nIn the spring, male elephant seals arrive at locations suitable for breeding. They use their large proboscis or snouts to make vocal noises in order to determine who will be the dominant male. This is often accompanied by fighting and altering their postures.\nWhen the female seals arrive, the more dominant males will already have secured their places in the breeding grounds.\nThe females will then cluster around the alpha males to create harems, which consist of up to 50 female seals. The less dominant male seals will then be left with the task of helping the alpha males by preventing other males from mating with the females in his harem.\nEach female seal\u2019s pregnancy lasts a total of 11 months, so mothers can only give birth to one brownish black pup each year.\nThe birthing process only takes a few minutes. The mother and pup form an instant connection because of their unique smell and sound. Mothers will then nurse their pups for up to 28 days.\nCONSERVATION\nElephant seals are listed under the International Union for the Conservation of Nature as being of least concern. This means that both species of elephant seals are neither threatened nor endangered.\nNonetheless, elephant seals are still prone to entanglement in marine debris, collisions of sea vessels, and interactions with fishing industries.\nFortunately, both species of elephant seals are protected in all countries where they can be found.\nElephant Seal Worksheets\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about the elephant seals across 20 in-depth pages.

The species as a whole is recognized as being the largest land animal in Asia and the Sri Lankan type is the largest of the species. With a population that only includes a few thousand individuals, these elephants are actively conserved and are considered at risk of further population decline. Geographically, they are limited to the island of Sri Lanka situated off the southern coast of India. Fragmentation of their habit, narrowing of geographic range and frequent lethal interactions with humans are all contributing factors in their decline.\nSri Lankan Elephant Facts\nMassive Proportions: This subspecies has the biggest height and weight of all Asian elephants. They can weigh over 10,000 pounds and reach a height of over 10 feet at the shoulder.\nThis subspecies has the biggest height and weight of all Asian elephants.

They are only found in select regions of the island of Sri Lanka.\nThese animals may be big, but their natural geographic range is not. They are only found in select regions of the island of Sri Lanka. Big Appetite: These animals need to eat hundreds of pounds of food each day to maintain their massive body.\nSri Lankan Elephant Scientific Name\nSri Lankan elephants are genetically distinct from other members of their species, but can also simply be called Asian elephants like their brethren found elsewhere on the continent. In taxonomic terms, these animals are known as Elephas maximus maximus. The word \u201celaphas\u201d has Greek and Latin roots that indicate an antlered animal or \u201cbig arch.\u201d The word maximus is also Latin and simply means \u201cbiggest\u201d or \u201cgreatest,\u201d which is an appropriate choice given their size. The subspecies belongs to the Elephantidae family in the Mammalia class.\nSri Lankan Elephant Appearance\nSri Lankan elephants are the largest of the Asian elephant subspecies and the biggest land animals on the continent. Adults can reach a height of 11.5 feet, which is about twice as tall as an average human man. Body weight can range from 4,400 to 12,000 pounds. There is generally a big size difference between male and female elephants. Males are typically 20 to 30 percent taller and can weigh almost twice as much as a female of comparable age.\nThese elephants have a mostly grey body with lighter spots or flecks caused by a lack of pigment in some of the skin cells. They have a rounded torso that is supported by strong, cylindrical legs. They have small, angular ears that are generally tucked next to their heads, which has a distinct double-dome shape. Like all elephants, these animals are also equipped with a long and flexible trunk that serves many practical purposes.\nThey are also set apart from other Asian elephant subspecies in that only a small fraction, about 5 to 10 percent, of males grow pronounced tusks. Also, unlike African elephant species, female Sri Lankan elephants never grow tusks beyond short nubs. The longest tusks reported on a Sri Lankan elephant were 7.5 feet long and belonged to Raja, a nationally-recognized animal in India who served a ceremonial role in a local religious center.\nSri Lankan Elephant Behavior\nLike other elephant species, these animals have complex and integrated social behaviors that serve a critical role in their development and survival. Groups of related females and their calves, collectively called a clan, typically travel together and share in the responsibilities of caring for young. Male elephants leave their clan when they reach sexual maturity and live solitary lives or in small, loosely-bonded groups with other males.\nAll Asian elephants rely on a combination of communication methods to interact with their clan members and potential mates. Their mouth and trunk are both involved in making a variety of noises for short and long-distance communication. They also rely on several glands to secrete chemical signals and may use their trunks to communicate via touching.\nSri Lankan Elephant Habitat\nAs their name suggests, this subspecies is found only on the Indian island of Sri Lanka off the country\u2019s southern coast. While the elephants were once distributed throughout the entire island, from coasts to mountains, they are now mostly found in the lowland regions. They are migratory by nature, so only spend some of their time in areas that have been designated as protected parks and preserves.\nDue to the hot and dry nature of their native habitat, these elephants engage in several types of behaviors designed to manage their internal temperature. They can frequently be seen submerging themselves in freshwater bodies and may cover themselves with mud. They also repeatedly flap their ears as a way of releasing body heat.\nSri Lankan Elephant Diet\nSri Lankan elephants are considered megaherbivores due the vast quantity of plant matter they consume on a daily basis. Adults can eat over 300 pounds of food in a single day or up to 10 percent of their body weight. Their massive appetite requires over 12 hours of foraging every day and frequent migrations to find fresh feeding grounds throughout the year.\nWhat does the Sri Lankan elephant eat?\nThese elephants are generalist foragers, which means they are willing and able to eat many different kinds of plants. Researchers have identified over 100 different plant species that compose part of their diet, including dozens of species used in human cultivation. Regenerating forests are usually better for foraging than mature ones.\nSri Lankan Elephant Predators and Threats\nA small and declining population has prompted conservationists to classify the Sri Lankan elephant as endangered. Continued habitat fragmentation due to the expansion of human settlements and growing agricultural areas is a significant threat. Historically, these elephants were frequently targeted for hunting and extermination until the 20th century, which decimated the natural population.\nPoaching by humans and attacks from natural predators are a minimal threat to Sri Lankan elephants. The rarity of tusk-bearing males in this subspecies limits their appeal for ivory poachers. However, clashes with humans are still a leading cause of death for these elephants. Loss and fragmentation of their habitat has forced migration through populated areas, which may become violent and lead to the death of the animal. Some farmers also intentionally shoot or poison elephants who could damage their crops.\nWhat eats Sri Lankan elephants?\nAside from human hunting in the past, these elephants have few natural predators due to their massive size. Their only known predator is the Bengal tiger, but even these voracious and powerful carnivores usually limit their targets to young elephants.\nSri Lankan Elephant Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nMating rituals are typically competitive between males with females making the final selection of the most desirable mate. Reproduction can occur throughout the year, but is largely influenced by the hormonal state of the two individuals involved. Females have a brief estrus period of 3 to 7 days when they are fertile and ready to mate. Males also enter a similar hormonal phase called musth, which greatly increases their potential as a mate.\nSri Lankan elephants have a long gestation period that can extend for up to 680 days. They typically give birth to a single calf, which exits the womb weighing 200 to 300 pounds. Males don\u2019t participate in raising or caring for the offspring. Instead, females and their young tend to linger around related adult females in clans lead by a single matriarch. All members of this \u201cnursing unit\u201d look after and help raise the calves.\nCalves must nurse to survive for about 2 years and complete weaning is usually finished after about 4 years. Calves become independent within a year or two of weaning, with males leaving their clan to lead solitary lives or in small groups with other males. Elephants of both genders generally reach sexual maturity when they are around 10 to 15 years old and can live well over 60 years in the wild.\nSri Lankan Elephant Population\nCurrent population estimates for this subspecies is between 2,500 and 4,000 adult individuals. The population has been on a declining trend since the colonial period and conservationists believe it will continue in the years ahead. In fact, some experts believe that the animal will be extinct in the wild within decades. Their need for vast migratory tracts and possibility of negative interactions with humans makes conservation efforts very challenging.\nView all 180 animals that start with S"}

Click to download the free sample version Download sample\nThe African elephant is the largest land animal on Earth. Their herds wander through 37 countries in Africa. Their species appeared about 1.5 million years ago.\nSee the fact file below for more information on the African elephant or alternatively, you can download our 28-page African elephants worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\nKey Facts & Information\nOrigin\nThe word \u2018elephant\u2019 has both Greek and Latin origins. This applies specifically to the elephant\u2019s scientific genus name \u201cElephas\u201d. In Greek linguistics, elephos represents an antlered beast or stag.\nThe roots of the word elephant in Latin is divided into two words: \u201cele\u201d, which means arch, and \u201cphant\u201d, which means huge.\nThe genus name, Loxodonta, for the African elephant means lozenge-shaped teeth and describes the chewing surface of the teeth.\nClassification/Taxonomy\nThe taxonomy of African elephants, according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS), is: Kingdom: Animalia Subkingdom: Bilateria Infrakingdom: Deuterostomia Phylum: Chordata Subphylum: Vertebrata Infraphylum: Gnathostomata Superclass: Tetrapoda Class: Mammalia Subclass: Theria Infraclass: Eutheria Order: Proboscidea Family: Elephantidae Genera & species: Loxodonta africana (African savannah elephant) and Loxodonta cyclotis (African forest elephant)\nPhysical Characteristics\nAfrican elephants can grow 8.2 to 13 feet (2.5 to 4 meters) from shoulder to toe and weigh 5,000 to 14,000 lbs (2,268 to 6,350 kg), according to the National Geographic.\nThe African elephant can be identified by its ears which resemble the shape of the African continent.\nHeat radiates from the elephant\u2019s massive ears, which have many veins, acting as a cooling mechanism.\nAn elephant\u2019s skin can be as thick as 1 inch, but it is sensitive to the sun. To protect it, elephants cover themselves with mud or dust.\nAn African elephant\u2019s trunk is actually a long nose used for smelling, breathing, trumpeting, drinking and also for grabbing things \u2014 especially a potential meal.\nReproduction\nFemale African elephants start reproducing at around 10 to 12 years of age.\nThey are less likely to reproduce in times of drought than when water is plentiful. They also do not mate at a specific time of year.\nThe fertile females usually give birth every 3 \u2013 6 years. Elephants have a longer pregnancy than any other mammal \u2013 almost 22 months!\nAt birth, baby elephants already weigh around 200 pounds and stand about 3 feet tall.\nTwo Subspecies of African Elephants\nSavanna (or bush) elephant Savanna elephants are larger than forest elephants, and their tusks curve outwards compared to forest elephants, which have straighter tusks that point downward. There are also differences in the size and shape of the skull and skeleton between the two subspecies.\nForest elephants Forest elephants, also called call Loxodonta cyclotis, are a distinct subspecies of African elephants. They are uniquely adapted to the forest habitat of the Congo Basin, such as being smaller in stature and darker in color. They also tend to have small, rounded ears. It is estimated that probably one quarter to one third of the total African elephant population is made up of forest elephants. They are in sharp decline because of poaching for the ivory trade and deforestation.\nDiet\nAfrican elephants are heavy and powerful and need hundreds of pounds of vegetation daily to sustain its massive size.\nAn adult elephant can consume up to 50 gallons of water and 220 lbs (100 kg) of food every day.\nTheir main food is fruit but they also consume grasses, small plants, bushes, twigs and roots.\nHabitat\nThe majestic African elephant occupies many areas of Africa. They live in large groups referred to as herds.\nThey prefer settling in regions where there are is abundant water.\nThe African savanna elephants roam the grassy plains and woodlands of Botswana, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Mozambique, while African forest elephants live in the tropical rainforests of central and western Africa.\nThreat to the Lives of African Elephants\nThe African elephants\u2019 range has shrunk considerably in the last decades from three million square miles in 1979 to just over one million square miles in 2007, this is due to expanding human populations converting land for agriculture, settlements and development.\nCommercial logging, plantations for biofuel and extractive industries like logging and mining not only destroy habitat but also open access to remote elephant populations for poachers.\nIn 1980-1990, the population of African elephants was more than halved, from 1.3 million to around 600,000.\n1973-1989, the African elephant population of Kenya declined by 85%.\nIn Chad, the population declined from 400,000 in 1970 to about 10,000 in 2006.\nIn Tanzania\u2019s Selous Game Reserve, once the largest of any reserve in the world, the population dropped from 109,000 in 1976 to 13,000 in 2013.\nThe government of Tanzania estimated that more than 85,000 elephants were lost to poaching between 2009 and 2014, representing a 60% loss.\nThe illegal demand for ivory is the biggest driver of elephant poaching.\nFighting Illegal Wildlife Trade\nIn 1989, CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) banned international trade in ivory to fight the massive illegal trade. After the ban came into force in 1990, major ivory markets were eliminated.\nConflict between elephants and a growing human population are a major issue in elephant conservation.\nNature reserves have a hard time containing bull elephants, who like to wander vast distances and easily break through perimeter fences.\nTo reduce the illegal killing of elephants through improved protection and management, WWF equips and trains law enforcement teams so they can conduct regular and effective anti-poaching patrols.\nIn countries such as South Africa, where elephant populations are growing, too many elephants can also pose a threat to the environment as they have destructive eating habits.\nFun Facts\nThe African elephant usually sleeps standing up. They sleep an average of two hours every day, usually broken into several episodes.\nElephants make powerful low-frequency rumblings to communicate over long distances.\nBaby elephants are dependent on their mother\u2019s milk for the first 2 years of life.\nStructures in the elephant brain are strikingly similar to those in humans.\nAfter a death, elephants family members show signs of grief.\nInstead of losing baby teeth one at a time like us humans, elephant teeth move from the back of the mouth, like a conveyor belt, to push out and replace front teeth.\nAfrican Elephants Worksheets\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about African Elephants across 28 in-depth pages.

This isn't surprising when you consider that they weigh seven tonnes.\nLast update: 23 November, 2018\nThe elephant, despite being an enormous animal, appears to be gentle and doesn\u2019t try to scare people. Most people know that these animals are tame and approachable, which is why they\u2019re very popular animals. Continue reading if you would like to know some curious facts about elephants?\nSome curious facts about elephants\nTheir ears\nDid you know that elephants use their ears to regulate their body temperatures? Due to having such a slow metabolism and they\u2019re enormous size, it\u2019s hard for them to keep cool, especially because they live in very hot climates. So, they use their ears to help keep themselves cool.\nAfrican elephants also use their ears as a threat. They\u2019re bigger than other species of elephant and they can move them with ease to scare away potential predators.\nTheir ears are unique\nAn elephant\u2019s ears are unique to each individual. No two elephants will have the same ears. They have different markings on their ears just like humans do with their fingerprints.\nThey always move in herds\nYou\u2019ll never see an elephant on their own. They live, walk, emigrate, and eat in herds. In fact, when the elephant is a baby, the herd surrounds them as a way to provide them protection. If the mother dies, other members of the herd will be ready to take care of them.\nThey sleep standing up\nAdult elephants sleep standing up. This is a way of protecting themselves from predators. If they slept lying down, they could be mauled just trying to lift themselves up from the ground.\nHowever, when baby elephants sleep, they\u2019re always surrounded by adults.\nThey bathe in mud\nWhile you may have seen many reports, photos, and accounts of elephants bathing in rivers and lakes, they also often bathe in mud. This is because it\u2019s cooler and helps get rid of parasites.\nTheir weight\nThe African elephant is the largest known pachyderm and can reach a body weight of seven tonnes. Can you imagine an encounter with one of these animals? There is even one known case of an elephant weighing 11 tonnes.\nDivided herds\nWhen a male elephant reaches the age of 12 years old, he abandons the herd. This means that in the herds there are only females and the young. The males can meet in pairs or groups of three and fight to win a female.\nConstant eating\nIf it surprised you to know that a koala spends 22 hours sleeping, how would you feel to know that an elephant spends 16 hours eating? No mother elephant has to tell her child to \u201ceat all of their greens to grow up big and strong\u201d. In fact, it\u2019s estimated that an elephant can eat on average 220 kilograms of food per day!\nTheir sound\nNope, elephants aren\u2019t mute. They make a trumpeting sound.\nTheir trunk\nYou probably already know that the main use for their trunks is to drink water. However, it\u2019s much more useful than just that. They also use it to scratch their eyes, ears, and to grab and throw things.\nDwarf elephant\nThey say that animals have been constantly evolving. We don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not, but there is evidence of a species of elephants that are the size of a pig, which dated back from prehistoric times.\nAge\nAn elephant can live for up to 70 years, however, the oldest elephant ever recorded was 82 years old.\nPregnancy\nAn elephant pregnancy lasts 22 months, the longest gestation period of all animals on earth!\nFood\nMany people may be wondering about what elephants eat. Their diet is based on grasses and tree bark.\nHopefully, after reading these curious facts about elephants, you may develop a liking towards these amazing animals."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Oakland Zoo | African Elephant", "url": "https://www.oaklandzoo.org/animals/african-elephant", "text": "Characteristics\nElephants are the heaviest land animal and the second tallest land animal on earth. An elephant's skin is grayish-brown and may be up to one inch thick in some places on the body. The trunk has two prehensile tips. Elephants walk on their tiptoes, called digitigrade, with thick fibrous pads on their toes to cushion the bones.\nSpecies Specifics\nThe African elephant has a dip between its fore and hindquarters, giving its back a concave look. Its ears are larger than an Asian elephant's. Both sexes of African elephant have large tusks. There are two distinct species of African elephants: L. a. africana (savannah) and L. a. cyclopis (forest). The two subspecies have been evolving separately for 2.5 million years.\nPhysical Characteristics\nThe majority of the skull is honeycombed with sinuses to minimize weight. Tusks are elongated second upper incisors and grow throughout the lifetime. They can grow up to seven inches a year. They are used for food gathering and carrying, defense, play, and digging. Molars make up other dental equipment; six consecutive sets of two upper and two lower molars are produced throughout life. The first set has three enamel layers, increasing to ten layers in the sixth set. The trunk is an elongation of the nose and upper lip; in adults it contains 150,000 muscles. It is used for eating, drinking, dust and water bathing, as well as communication. The sense of smell is highly sophisticated; they are believed to locate underground water by smelling the earth above. Vision is poor. Long lashes and nictitating lids protect the eyes from dust. Hearing is acute. Recent studies establish the use of infrasound (tones lower than humans can hear) for long-range communication. Ears are also used to control body temperature; blood circulating through the large vessels in the ears is cooled by flapping.\nEcology\nHabitat\nMarshes, river valleys, forests, deserts, savannas\nDistribution\nHome range in the wild is up to 500 miles. Migratory routes are passed down by elders to offspring.\nDiet\nElephants have an inefficient digestive system and digest only about 40 percent of what they eat. They eat enormously. Estimates in the wild range from 100-1000 pounds of vegetation per day (a 16 hour period). Zoo elephants are estimated to eat approximately 50 pounds of food per ton of elephant per day. The wild elephant is a destructive eater, uprooting and scattering as much as is eaten, often breaking down whole trees. Elephants eat almost anything green, but green grass, shoots and buds of trees and shrubs are preferred. Farms are often raided for fruits and vegetables of all types. Average daily consumption of water for full-grown animals is between 30 and 50 gallons.\nEcological Web\nElephants have no true predators except humans. Baby elephants may be preyed on by lioness but the adults will protect it most of the time. Elephants are a keystone species in their habitat. Their dung provides food and shelter to insects while also fertilizing the soil and spreading seeds. The African eggplant only grows after passing through an elephant. They dig new water sources and make existing ones bigger. They dig out caves in search of salt. By stomping out new pathways and tearing up whole trees, elephants alter their ecosystem in massive ways. This provides pathways for smaller animals, homes and food in the downed trees, and allows vegetation to grow back healthier than before. This behavior also affects humans however because elephants will destroy farms and crops in the same manner.\nActivity and Behavior\nActivity Pattern\nMost African elephants are diurnal though some herds who live near human populations have become mostly nocturnal to avoid human interactions.\nBehavior\nElephants have the largest brain size versus body weight other than man. Most mammals, excluding primates, are born with a brain weight of 90% of adult weight. A human brain at birth is 26% of adult weight, and the elephant's is 35% of adult weight. These statistics are used to distinguish instinctive from learned behavior, and are examples of higher intelligence. To cool down on hot days, elephants flap their large ears, cooling the blood in the many veins. An elephant's skin is extremely sensitive to sunburn and insect bites; they roll in dust and mud and throw dust on their backs to help protect their skin.\nSocial Behavior\nElephants live in a complex matriarchal society normally composed of 8 to 15 related members and led by a dominant cow. Three or four generations of cows and calves spend their entire lives together with the exception of males, who leave the group at 8-12 years of age. Groups of related families stay in fairly close range of each other and communicate often; these are called \"kin groups.\" In times of danger, kin groups will mass and form \"clans\" of 200 or more. Ongoing studies at Amboseli Research Center in Kenya indicate a complex bull dominance structure which determines mating success as well as everyday life. The largest males with the largest tusks, around 50 years of age, do most of the breeding, while the younger males roam. Males will stay with a female for a few weeks and then move on. Elephants communicate in many different ways. They may show submission to a more dominant individual by rubbing their eyes, swaying, lowering their head, and leveling their ears. The dominant elephant will raise their head, ears, and trunk. By snapping their ears, shaking their head, trumpeting, and rumbling elephants can also communicate with each other. Acoustic communication can happen through high and low frequency noises made with their trunk and mouth. Their large size, unique skull and cochlear structure, and trunk all allow elephants to make this wide range of calls and noises. Elephants' cochlear structure is more like a reptiles than all other mammals, which may aid in hearing low frequencies. They can also pick up seismic vibrations using their unique cochlear structure, sensitive receptors in the toes and feet, and the sensitive tip of their trunk.\nReproductive Behavior\nOngoing studies at Amboseli Research Center in Kenya indicate a complex bull dominance structure which determines mating success as well as everyday life. Another primary mating factor is \"musth,\" a periodic hormonal cycle. Physical manifestations in males include heavy secretions from temporal glands, high blood testosterone levels, urine dribbling (marking) and aggression. Cows seem to prefer a musth bull, but can successfully breed whether the bull is in musth or not. According to keepers our cows' estrus cycles are roughly every 15-16 weeks with a 3 day window for conception. Males in musth will rub a female's genitals with his trunk and inhale, then exhale into his mouth. The chemicals travel to the Jacobson's organ in the roof of his mouth and he can determine if she is ready to breed. The birth is usually a single one; twins are born only 1.35% of the time. Birth weight is 175 to 250 pounds. The mother is often assisted by another cow during birthing. Mating can happen year-round but usually coincides with the rainy season. Females will give birth every 4 to 9 years.\nOffspring\nThe calf can stand shakily and nurse (with mouth, not trunk) a few hours after birth. They are precocial, as they can see, smell, and walk after birth, though they stay with their herd for many years. Mammary glands are located between the front legs. Calves may be nursed by many different females in the herd. Although calves usually start eating other food in their first year and could survive if weaned at two and a half years of age, they will nurse until the birth of the next calf (usually 4-5 years) and are very dependent on their mothers for eight to ten years. Adolescence occurs at 12 to 14 years of age. Most physical growth is reached at 20, but growth continues throughout life. Top mental ability is at age 30 to 45. Death comes at age 65 to 70 when the last set of teeth wear out. Elderly elephants will have sunken-in faces and turned-in ears.\nConservation\nStatus\nAfrican elephants are listed on Appendix I of CITES (endangered), expect for populations in Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa which are listed on Appendix II (threatened). They are considered Vulnerable by the IUCN and Threatened by the USFW.\nHistorical\nAfrican elephants' historical range was the area south of the Sahara. Now they are mostly confined to parks and preserves because of agricultural expansion. They are adaptable however and can survive in the bush, forest, and savannah. The biggest point in time for ivory trade was in the 18th and 19th centuries, coinciding with the slave trade and colonial expansion (Moss, et al). The CITES ban on ivory in international trade in 1989 made a huge difference but there has still been illegal hunting. The largest tusks are found on the largest males and oldest females, who respectively do most of the breeding and carry the most knowledge. The loss of these individuals in particular can have devastating effects on elephant populations. The USA passed an ivory domestic trade ban in 2016 and China will follow suit in 2017. These are currently the two biggest ivory markets.\nCurrent Threats\nOur Role\nOakland Zoo has three partners in Africa that work with elephants. 96 Elephants is a Wildlife Conservation Society project aimed at ending the ivory trade. They estimate 96 elephants a day are lost to poaching. Big Life Foundation recruits and supports rangers to monitor elephants in a cross-border effort to end ivory poaching. The Amboseli Trust for Elephants is a project of elephant researcher, Cynthia Moss, which studies the elephants in Kenya's Amboseli National Park since 1972. In 1991, Oakland Zoo pioneered the \u201cprotected contact\u201d methodology in animal husbandry, which places barriers between zookeepers and elephants and incorporates persuasion through rewards rather than discipline, and we continue to adhere to this practice to this day.\nNo items found.\nHow You Can Help\nBe educated about your purchases. When you say no to ivory, whether antique or modern, you are saying yes to elephants.\nDo not support or visit businesses that offer elephant rides or mistreat elephants. When traveling, look for reputable conservation centers, sanctuaries, national parks, or wildlife reserves \u2014 places where tourists and animal lovers are educated about these special creatures in a space that is safe for everyone involved.\nSee how we are taking action for African elephants here.\nFascinating Facts\nOne of the elephant's closest living relatives is the hyrax! Found in Africa, hyraxes look like rodents but they have similar bones and teeth to elephants. Their incisions grow into long tusks and their skull structure is similar. Elephants are also related to manatees and dugongs, both marine mammals. Elderly and dying elephants are often found near swamps. The food there is lacking in nutrition but it is softer and easily for an elephant with missing teeth to eat. An elephants tail is 4 feet long!\nReferences\nUniversity of Michigan.

For humans, our bodies need rest to restore, repair tissues and synthesize hormones. That is why humans need on average, seven to nine hours of sleep every night.\nAnimals that are mammals require different amounts of sleep. Some animals like possums sleep up to 18 hours a day while others like giraffes sleep for three hours a day.\nElephants are also one of those mammals that require less sleep. How many hours do elephants sleep? To learn more about elephants sleeping habits, we have gathered these five fun facts about elephants.\nWild elephants get an average of two hours of sleep each night.\nYes, believe it or not, wild elephants can get up two hours of sleep a night. A study was conducted by Paul Manger and his colleagues at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, to monitor wild elephants' sleep.\nThis team monitored the two African elephant matriarchs in the Chobe National Park for 35 consecutive days. They discovered that these elephants sleep an average of two hours.\nWhy do these wild elephants sleep so little? Well, scientists believe that they sleep less because they need to eat large amounts of food. Plus, there are a lot more dangers they have to avoid like poachers and lions.\nElephants in zoos sleep an average of four to six hours a day.\nHow many hours do elephants sleep in zoos? Elephants that are in captivity sleep between four to six hours a day. Why do these elephants sleep more compared to their wild counterparts? For one, elephants in zoos do not have pressures like finding food and water sources.\nZookeepers provide elephants with the amount of food and water they need throughout the day and night. Elephants in the wild must search and find food and water, even in drought conditions.\nAnother reason elephants in zoos sleep more is they do not have to worry about dangers. In the wild, elephants have to be on a constant lookout for poachers and lions that might invade their herds. This gives elephants less time to sleep.\nElephants can sleep both lying and standing up.\nElephants can sleep both standing up and lying down. However, researchers have discovered that elephants in captivity tend to sleep more lying down than elephants in the wild.\nElephants in the wild sleep more time standing up because it is easier for them to move. Since elephants are so large, it takes them much longer to get up.\nWild elephants tend to sleep in groups.\nTo protect one another from potential dangers, a herd of wild elephants sleeps in groups. Typically, one group of elephants will sleep while another group of elephants stays awake. The elephants that remain awake will watch for danger and warn the sleeping elephants of any potential dangers.\nWild elephants can go up to 46 hours without sleep.\nAs stated above, a wild elephant can get an average of two hours of sleep each night. However, there are times when elephants go without sleep for 46 hours. Researchers discovered that elephants could go up to 46 hours walking without sleep.\nThese animals can go long distances without sleeping to avoid dangers. Elephant herds want to avoid lion attacks and human poachers. Since the matriarch elephant is the leader, this elephant gets the least sleep because they are leading the herds.\nWould you like to learn more fun facts about elephants?\nContact For Elephants to learn more about African elephants and how we are working with zoos across the United States to provide the best conservation strategies.

WWF works to secure this elephant population for the long-term by maintaining habitat, significantly reducing existing and contiguous threats, and building support for conservation of the population and its habitat. Bhutan\u2019s old-growth forests extend into northeast India, where a growing population and infrastructure projects threaten some of the largest and last intact forests in Asia.

In Cambodia, WWF is trains, equips, and supports local staff to patrol protected areas and assess elephant distribution and numbers.\nIn Vietnam, WWF supports an average of 20 forest guards that have been deployed by Vietnamese government authorities. WWF supports these teams with equipment and allowances so that they can better execute their duties and spend more time out on patrol. The increased presence of park guards benefits a small number of wild Asian elephants and tigers that also live in the park, as well as the many other endangered species that have disappeared from other parts of Asia, but still remain in Cat Tien National Park."}

They are intelligent, family-oriented and very strong. However, elephant eyesight is not the best. How can such a large animal have poor eyesight? Our African elephant research has rounded up some facts about an elephant\u2019s vision that will help you understand better.\nElephant eyesight facts\nThe size of an elephant's eye is 3.8 cm in diameter.\nElephants are the largest land mammal. An adult elephant can be as large as 8.2 to 13 feet tall and weigh 5,000 to 14,000 lbs. Although these animals are enormous, their eyes are not large.\nThe average size of an elephant's eye is 3.8 cm (1.5 in) in diameter. Their eyes are on the side of their head rather than in front. In comparison, elephant eyes are only slightly larger than a human's eye, which is on average 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter.\nElephants have different colored eyes.\nJust like humans, the eyes of elephants also come in different colors. The four most common eye colors that elephants have are dark brown, light brown, honey and gray. However, there are occasions when elephants have blue-gray, golden, green and even yellow-colored eyes. In some instances, they have different eye colors in each eye.\nElephants have poor eyesight.\nAn elephant\u2019s sight is not the best. These animals only see for short distances of up to 20 m (65.6 feet). Having poor eyesight has not stopped elephants from surviving. Elephants have other heightened senses that help them successfully navigate the grasslands and forests. These large animals have amazing hearing, smell and touch.\nBaby elephants are born nearly blind.\nOne commonly asked question is, how long is an elephant\u2019s pregnancy? The average gestation period of an elephant is 18 to 22 months. This long period helps the baby elephant (calf) develop fully ready to walk and learn from its herd.\nAlthough it takes almost two years for an elephant to develop in the womb, an elephant calf is born nearly blind. Their vision starts to expand throughout the years. In the early stages, they rely heavily on their mothers for guidance.\nElephants are colorblind.\nOne of the less known elephant eyesight facts is that elephants are colorblind. During the day, elephants are dichromic, which means they have two kinds of color sensors in their retina. They have one type of cone for red and another for green. Elephants can see similarly to colorblind humans. They can see the colors blues and yellows but cannot tell the difference between reds and greens.\nElephants can see in the dark.\nElephants eat up to 300 pounds of food in a single day. That means these animals spend most of their day and night eating. Believe it or not but wild elephants get on average two hours of sleep each night.\nSince they spend a lot of time in the dark, they need to see in the darkness. Researchers have found that elephants exhibit arrhythmic vision, which changes with the time of day. At night, elephants are more sensitive to blue and violet lights, making it easier to see with less light.\nSupport our African elephant research!\nAs you can tell from above, elephants are amazing creatures.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "33 Shocking Wild, Pet Animal Abuse Cruelty and Neglect Facts", "url": "https://www.rhinorest.com/animal-abuse-facts/", "text": "(Last Updated On: September 21, 2021)\nThere are many shocking animal abuse facts. Each year, about 100 million animals are tortured and mutilated by industries. Most of them perish on industrial farms, never seeing the light of day, while others become lab test subjects or circus performers. Humans steal endangered species and damage ecosystems even in the wild.\nNo animal deserves to be treated in this manner. All of this mortality adds to the frightening rate of extinction, and there will soon be no turning back. As a result, assist these animal cruelty statistics to reach more caring individuals by treating each creature with compassion and respect.\nIndustries all across the world mistreat animals in various ways to meet their own needs. Isn\u2019t there a more compassionate solution? Farmers, without a doubt, look after their livestock and keep them safe.\nIn truth, farm animals live in appalling conditions. For the sake of profit, they are mass-produced and made to consume, procreate, and live in their own feces. Statistics on animal mistreatment demonstrate how it\u2019s all done for business and to meet the demand for meat and dairy products.\nStatistics on animal cruelty and neglect make it difficult to appreciate the circus as we once did. Animal attacks on humans in the entertainment business are all the result of performers abusing the species in the first place. Even in the wild, no animal is secure.\nIllegal hunting is on the rise as a result of many people believing in the magical qualities of rare animal body parts, and we\u2019re starting to feel the effects.\nAnimal abuse facts\nHere are 33 shocking animal abuse facts you should know about to stand against it!\n1. 90% of broiler chickens (chickens developed particularly for meat production) have difficulty walking due to genetic modification. To protest, encourage your school cafeteria to go vegetarian on Mondays. Become a member of Meatless Mondays.\n2. Every year, between 900 and 2,000 new incidents of animal hoarding are reported in the United States, resulting in the deaths of 250,000 animals.\n3. Every year, about 115 million animals, including mice, rats, dogs, cats, rabbits, primates, and birds, are killed in laboratory studies for chemical, pharmacological, food, and cosmetics research.\n4. Animals are also tortured in laboratories all around the world. Many of the animals used in studies are never disclosed, and there are no restrictions in place.\n5. Around 75,000 dogs are abused by pharmaceutical companies in the United States each year.\n6. Elephants, however, are not the only ones who suffer. Since 1990, 126 large cats have been harmed and murdered by circuses in the United States. Tigers and lions are frequently beaten and pulled by chains because the government does not inspect the training sessions.\n7. According to data on animal cruelty in zoos, 75 percent of the time, laws for animal-human interactions are broken. People should not be permitted to approach the animals too closely, as this causes them to worry and anxiety.\n8. 96% of circus animals are born and die there.\n(9) 97 percent of all abused animals are farm animals.\n10. There are ten times as many dead birds in US slaughterhouses as there are other animals.\n11. According to data from the pet business, 75% of wild reptiles die within a year of being pets. For a regular and healthy life, these creatures require a natural habitat.\n12. After the Civil War, dogfighting became popular in the United States, with professional pits springing up all across the country in the 1860s. It was also a source of fun for cops and firefighters.\n13. There were 35 elephant-related accidents in circuses between 2000 and 2021. The animals are mostly seeking to get away from a life of tiny cages and severe electric prod training. Elephants attack humans who are fleeing, resulting in injuries and deaths on both sides.\n14. Every year, 35,000 elephants are poached to meet the demand for ivory.\n15. Meanwhile, there are approximately 19,000 cats in laboratories. Many of them are taken from shelters and dissected at schools around the United States.\n16. However, cats make up a minuscule percentage of the 10 million animals who die in classrooms.\n17. Up to 120,000 animals might be used in a single scientific test.\n18. Denmark justified the slaughter of 17 million minks with Covid-19 in their fur. Although it was intended to keep the virus from spreading to people, the ethical dilemma remains in the animal cruelty and mortality figures.\n19. Every year, approximately 115 million animals are experimented on in laboratories all around the world. However, that is simply an educated assumption because governments seldom provide information about their animal testing data. We know that the United States utilizes 15.6 million animals, but the European Union uses more than 23 million.\n20. Dogfighting has been documented in all parts of the country, in urban, suburban, and rural settings.\n21. Every major circus that utilizes animals has been penalized for failing to meet the United States Animal Welfare Act\u2019s minimum standards of care (AWA).\n22. Thousands of greyhounds die each year before ever touching a racecourse, some in the name of \u201cselective breeding.\u201d Many dogs do not live to the age of four or five, which is considered \u201cretirement.\u201d\n23. More than half of the fur sold in the United States originates in China, where millions of dogs and cats are bled to death and skinned alive for their fur. Because Chinese fur is frequently mislabeled, there\u2019s no way of knowing whose skin you\u2019re wearing if you wear any.\n24. Puppy mills are large-scale commercial dog breeding enterprises that prioritize money over the puppies\u2019 health. As a result of the circumstances in which they are maintained, many dogs develop diseases such as renal or heart problems.\n25. The majority of rodeo activities rely on inducing stress in the tamed and generally docile animals involved. To get animals to perform, participants use severe handling techniques (such as yanking calves\u2019 tails or administering unpleasant electric shocks).\n26. In the United States, the exotic pet trade is a multibillion-dollar business, and while some wild animals are reared in captivity, many are kidnapped from their natural habitats. Many people die young as a result of the trauma of being forcefully taken from their homes.\n27. The exotic bird trade is responsible for the loss of one-third of all parrot species. These birds are sold for illicit commerce or combat. Birds are losing habitat at the same time, and the two together might soon add parrots to the endangered species list.\n28. Someone reports animal mistreatment to the RSPCA in the United Kingdom every 30 seconds. Despite their tireless efforts, the group is only able to resolve about 100,000 cases every year.\n29. Cows are often wounded and harmed by milking machines, causing them to produce 10 times more milk than they should. This causes a slew of health problems. While cows typically live for 20\u201325 years, they can only have a maximum of five children on farms across the world.\n30. As the demand for meat and dairy products grows, more and more animals are being slaughtered. Statistics reveal that numerous species are mutilated every day as animal mistreatment in industrial farms grows, thus even a modest modification in your diet may make a difference in the long term.\n31. Pigs on factory farms are forced to live, eat, and sleep in tiny cages.\n32. Fin Soup is prepared every year after approximately 100 million sharks are killed illegally. Furthermore, according to animal cruelty statistics, fishing gear kills or injures approximately 650,000 marine animals each year.\n33. In the entertainment business, sloths have a six-month average lifetime. These creatures like a peaceful existence and are irritated by the hordes of humans that gather around their cage to take selfies. Most sloths are unable to cope with the event since it is extremely stressful.\nMore Interesting Articles\nTags\nanimal cruelty facts\nanimal rights facts\ndog abuse facts\n100 facts about animal abuse\nanimal cruelty facts and statistics\nanimal abuse facts 2020\nanimal neglect facts\nwild animal cruelty facts\nanimal abuse facts 2019\npet abuse facts"}

The heels of their back feet have spurs that can release venom, making these wild animals one of the few types of poisonous mammals. While the venom isn\u2019t strong enough to kill a human, it\u2019s extremely painful and can cause swelling and even hyperventilation, and that\u2019s definitely enough to make platypuses one of the innocent-looking animals that are actually dangerous.\n4 / 60 Parkol/Shutterstock Sloths You probably think of sloths as one of the slowest wild animals out there\u2014and they are pretty slow, to be sure!

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephant History Facts - Complete History Through Time - Animal Corner", "url": "https://animalcorner.org/elephant-history/", "text": "Genus Mammuthus\nThe genus mammoths, in latin \u2018Mammuthus\u2019, was a group of species, belonging to the family of elephants, entirely separated in taxonomy from the Mastodons and the genus family \u2018Mammutidae\u2019, although they sometimes shared the same environment. (For scientific reasons, the mastodons was renamed to family \u2018Mammutidae\u2019, which became a source for future confusion and misunderstandings).\nThe Mammoth probably has origin from \u2018Stegodon\u2019 and started to develop during upper Pliocene, (some 4 million years ago) in Africa. Mammoths spread to Europe and Asia, and Mammuthus meridionalis went over the Bering Strait to North America about 1.8 million years ago, (the woolly Mammoth went over much later) and became extinct during lower Holocene, probably exterminated by prehistoric humans who hunted them.\nThe modern-day African and Asian elephants belong to the order \u2018Proboscidea\u2019. In the past there were some 350 members in this order, however, over time the majority of the members succumbed to extinction. Today, there are only two final survivors to this order, Elephas maximus (Asian elephant) and Loxodonta africana (African elephant).\nMuch like their predecessors, these two species are facing a grim future that is heading very near to another man-propelled extinction.\nMammoth Characteristics\nMammoths had bumps on their head.\nBoth male and female mammoth had tusks.\nSome of the Mammoths tusks were straight, some were curved.\nThe longest Mammoth tusks were up to 13 feet (4 metres) long.\nMammoths had longer tusks than Mastodons, a wider head, a sloping back and flat chewing teeth.\nThe Mammoths trunk had two finger-like projections like African elephants.\nMammoths teeth were flat like asian elephants.\nMost species of Mammoth were not larger than recent elephants.\nMore Elephant History: The Jarkov Mammoth\nThere is probably no animal more widely acknowledged as symbolizing the prehistoric North than the woolly mammoth. Although the remains of many mammoths have been discovered, none have excited the publics imagination like Siberias Jarkov Mammoth. The distinct possibility that with the current state of cloning technology, a new mammoth can be created has fired many peoples imagination.\nWoolly mammoths roamed the northern plains for most of the last 2 million years or so, until just 10,000 years ago. A subject of controversy for many years, it is generally agreed now that mammoths died out from a combination of changing climate, hunting pressure from humans and probably disease. Most of the 100 or so mammoths found to date appear to have gotten trapped and died in swamps or soft soil, or to have been buried by avalanches.\nThe Jarkov Mammoth seems to have become stuck in mud in the bottom of a creek. Found on Siberia\u2019s Taimyr Peninsula in 1997 by a 9 year old boy, this mammoth was about 47 years old when he died just over 20,000 years ago. Finding mammoth bones is not at all unusual for the native people of the region, the Dolgan. Roaming the land with their herds of reindeer, they often come across partial skeletons as they melt out of the permafrost. The apparent condition of the Jarkov Mammoth, however, makes it a unique find.\nA French mammoth-hunter, Bernard Buigues spearheaded the successful project to recover the Jarkov Mammoth. Encased in a 23 tonne block of ice and mud, the remains were flown 200 miles to Khatanga, hoisted under the worlds largest helicopter. The contents of the block of ice and mud are still not known in detail, however, hair sticks out at many points, indicating that the body may be virtually complete. It is being thawed out by a team of 25 scientists in an ice cave at Khatanga. Although the mammoth was found by a Dolgan boy, interest in his people seems to have faded quite quickly.\nTodays Elephant Status:\nElephants once were common throughout Africa, even in northern Africa as late as Roman times. They have since disappeared from that area due to over hunting and the spread of the desert. Even though they are remarkably adaptable creatures, living in habitats ranging from lush rain forest to semi desert, there has been much speculation about their future. Surviving populations are pressured by poachers who slaughter elephants for their tusks and by rapidly increasing human settlements, which restrict elephants movements and reduce the size of their habitat.\nToday it would be difficult for elephants to survive for long periods of time outside protected parks and reserves. However, confining them also causes problems without access any longer to other areas, they may harm their own habitat by overfeeding and overuse. Sometimes they go out of protected areas and raid nearby farms.\nToday, both the African elephant and the Asian elephant are in danger. Under the Endangered Species Act, the African elephant is listed as a threatened species and the Asian elephant is listed as an endangered species. Endangered means a species is considered in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, and threatened means a species is considered in danger of becoming endangered."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephant Pregnancy Facts | SPANA", "url": "https://spana.org/blog/elephant-pregnancy-facts/", "text": "How long are elephants pregnant for?\nHow long an elephant is pregnant for depends a little on the species. African elephants are pregnant for up to 22 months, while Asian elephants are pregnant for 18-22 months. This is actually the longest gestation period of all mammals, which makes sense when we think about how big elephants are. A blue whale is only pregnant for 10-12 months, nearly half the length of an elephant pregnancy. Compare this to a hamster \u2013 those little guys are only pregnant for 16 days at a time!\nHow many babies can an elephant have at once?\nUnlike other animals, elephants usually only have one baby at a time. However, there are cases where elephants can have twins, but this only happens in one per cent of elephant births. This is only slightly smaller compared to humans, where 1.6 per cent of births are twins. As you can imagine, carrying two huge babies can be very dangerous for the mother. However, we do see this happening, particularly with wild African elephants.\nHow big is a baby elephant when it\u2019s born?\nAt birth, elephants can weigh up to 268 pounds and stand about 3ft tall. That\u2019s about the same weight as a fully grown panda bear, reindeer or warthog. Asian elephants are a little skinnier at around 200 pounds, although they\u2019re about the same height. For context, human children don\u2019t get to 3ft tall until they\u2019re 2-3 years old. Imagine the poor stork having to carry all that weight!\nHow many babies can an elephant have?\nElephants give birth around every four years, and given their pregnancies can last around two years, that is quite a lot! Although elephants can live for 60-70 years, they typically only have about four or five babies during their lives. Even so, that\u2019s still a large chunk of their lifetime spent being pregnant."}

Hawk moths are also known as sphinx moths because the caterpillar resembles the Great Sphinx of Giza when resting, with legs held off the surface and head bowed as if in prayer.\nFast Facts: Elephant Hawk Moth Scientific Name: Deilephila elpenor\nDeilephila elpenor Common Names: Elephant hawk moth, large elephant hawk moth\nElephant hawk moth, large elephant hawk moth Basic Animal Group: Invertebrate\nInvertebrate Size: 2.4-2.8 inches\n2.4-2.8 inches Lifespan: 1 year\n1 year Diet: Herbivore\nHerbivore Habitat: Palearctic region\nPalearctic region Population: Abundant\nAbundant Conservation Status: Not Evaluated\nDescription\nThe elephant hawk moth starts life as a glossy green egg that hatches into a yellow or green caterpillar. Eventually, the larva molts into a brownish-gray caterpillar with spots near its head and a backward curving \"horn\" at the back. Fully grown larvae measure up to 3 inches long. The caterpillar forms a speckled brown pupa that hatches into the adult moth. The moth measures between 2.4 and 2.8 inches in width.\nWhile some hawk moths display dramatic sexual dimorphism, male and female elephant hawk moths are difficult to distinguish. They are the same size as each other, but the males tend to be more deeply colored. Elephant hawk moths are olive brown with pink wing margins, pink lines, and a white dot on the top of each forewing. The head and body of the moth are olive brown and pink, too. While a hawk moth does not have particularly feathery antennae, it does have an extremely long proboscis (\"tongue\").\nThe large elephant hawk moth may be confused with the small elephant hawk moth (Deilephila porcellus). The two species share a common habitat, but the small elephant hawk moth is smaller (1.8 to 2.0 inches), more pink than olive, and has a checkerboard pattern on its wings. The caterpillars look similar, but the small elephant hawk moth larvae lack a horn.\nThe small elephant hawk moth is closely related to the large elephant hawk moth. Svdmolen / Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\nHabitat and Distribution\nThe elephant hawk moth is particularly common in Great Britain, but it occurs throughout the palearctic region, including all of Europe and Asia as far east as Japan.\nDiet\nCaterpillars eat a variety of plants, including rosebay willowherb (Epilobium angustifolium), bedstraw (genus Galium), and garden flowers, such as lavender, dahlia, and fuchsia. Elephant hawk moths are nocturnal feeders that forage for flower nectar. The moth hovers over the flower rather than landing on it and extends its long proboscis to suck up nectar.\nBehavior\nBecause they need to find flowers at night, elephant hawk moths have exceptional color vision in the dark. They also use their sense of smell to find food. The moth is a swift flyer, attaining speeds up to 11 mph, but it cannot fly when it's windy. It feeds from dusk until dawn and then rests for the day near its final food source.\nThe elephant hawk moth larva might look like an elephant's trunk to people, but to predators it more likely resembles a small snake. Its eye-shaped markings help ward off attacks. When threatened, the caterpillar swells up near the head to enhance the effect. It can also eject the green contents of its foregut.\nReproduction and Offspring\nMany species of hawk moth produce multiple generations in a single year, but the elephant hawk moth completes one generation per year (rarely two). Pupae overwinter in their cocoons and metamorphose into moths in late spring (May). The moths are most active in midsummer (June to September).\nThe female secretes pheromones to indicate readiness to mate. She lays her green to yellow eggs singly or in pairs on a plant that will be the caterpillar's food source. The female dies shortly after laying eggs, while the males live a bit longer and may mate additional females. The eggs hatch in about 10 days into yellow to green larvae. As the larvae grow and molt, they become 3-inch spotted gray caterpillars that weigh between 0.14 and 0.26 ounces. About 27 days after hatching from an egg, the caterpillar forms a pupa, usually at the base of a plant or in the ground. The speckled brown pupae are around 1.5 inches long.\nElephant hawk moth larvae look like an elephant's trunk with eyes. Jasius / Getty Images\nConservation Status\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has not assigned a conservation status to the elephant hawk moth. The species is threatened by pesticide use, but is common throughout its range.\nElephant Hawk Moths and Humans\nHawk moth caterpillars are sometimes regarded as agricultural pests, yet the moths are important pollinators for many types of flowering plants. Despite the moth's bright coloring, neither the caterpillar nor the moth bite or are toxic. Some people keep the moths as pets so they can watch their fascinating hummingbird-like flight.\nSources\nHossie, Thomas John and Thomas N.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Can Elephants Swim? - Wild Animal Park", "url": "https://www.wildanimalpark.org/can-elephants-swim/", "text": "Elephants are excellent swimmers like all other mammals. The only mammals that have to learn to swim are humans and the primates. The pachyderm\u2019s massive body, very surprisingly, gives them enough buoyancy to float easily. They swim completely submerged, with their head above the water and their mouths below, and use all four legs to paddle. The biggest advantage that elephants have above all other mammals is their trunk. A very versatile proboscis, they use their trunk like a snorkel. This enables them to breathe normally when swimming and allows them to swim long distances.\nNew research suggests that elephants are great at swimming because they could have evolved from mammals like the sea cow. And the reason they have trunks is because they used them as underwater snorkels!\nElephants love water\nElephants love water and are great divers. You will often see an elephant sticking its trunk up for breath and disappearing under water for a considerable amount of time. Baby elephants enjoy playing in water. They will often try to climb on the backs of older and bigger elephants and then splash back in the water. Calves will suck water into their trunks and spray each other playfully. Elephants also love to cool themselves by having a mud bath. They will scoop wet soil from the bottom of a lake or the river and spray it on to their body to get respite from heat.\nLong distance swimmers\nElephants are indeed bulky, but deceivingly so. We must remember that elephants can walk up to eighty miles a day or more in search of food and water. That means that their legs, that have to carry the weight of the body, are very muscular and strong. This, coupled with their ability to use their trunk as a snorkel allows them to swim for hours on end. They can also splay the soles of their feet to help propel their huge bulk when in water.\nElephants do not tire easily when swimming, but if they do, they will just rest in the water for some time. Because of their buoyancy they do not drown. Elephants in Africa have been recorded to have travelled a distance of 48 kilometers across water, as also swimming for six hours continuously. Experts believe that the elephants that live in Sri Lanka are the progeny of elephants that swam across from Southern India across the sea. What appears as the only constraint that would make an elephant seek land when swimming is hunger and thirst when in sea water.\nThe swimming elephants of South and South East Asia\nWhile African elephants are rarely tamed, Asian elephants across India, Thailand and Malaysia are. The swimming ability of elephants is put to good use here. The Andaman and Nicobar islands in of India are located where the Bay of Bengal meets the Andaman Sea. The distance between these islands can sometimes be several miles. Mahouts, or elephant care takers use elephants to transport people, goods and haul lumber from one island to the other.\nThe mahouts will take an expecting female elephant to an island where food is available in plenty, and stay with the female. As baby elephants cannot swim till they are four or five months old, and the mother and calf will have to stay there for the duration, the mahouts will choose the island carefully. Later the pair will swim back to the parent island. If a whole herd is to be moved across the sea, the mahouts will ride atop the biggest elephants whereby they get a ride without any effort. When distances between islands are too long the mahouts will guide the herd towards an island in between for a rest , which can sometimes be one or two days. Elephants in Malaysia too are widely employed to transport lumber across water bodies."}

As of March 2021, African forest elephants have been classified as critically endangered and African savanna elephants as endangered. Losing these animals would be devastating to the world.\nOne way to help save elephants is by building awareness. Sharing fun facts about African elephants and why they need to be saved can encourage others to step up to save them. Researchers, who are a part of our African elephant community, have gathered some elephant facts you can share with friends and family to show just how cool elephants are.\nFun facts about African elephants\nElephants are the largest land mammals.\nThe largest land mammals are elephants, but African savanna elephants are the largest if you want to get technical. This kind of elephant can get as tall as 10 to 13 feet and can weigh as much as four to seven tons. The second-largest type of elephant is the Asian elephant which stands at 6.6 to 9.8 feet. In last place comes the African forest elephant, which averages at eight feet tall.\nElephants spend 16 to 18 hours eating.\nWhen you are the largest land animal globally, you need a lot of food to power that body. That is why elephants spend 16 to 18 hours eating each day. Since elephants eat most of the day, they can eat between 330 to 375 pounds of food a day. Their diet consists of vegetation like grasses, fruits, bark and roots.\nElephants sleep for two to three hours each night.\nHumans need around seven to eight hours of sleep each night to function. In the wild, elephants get two to three hours of sleep each night. Why do elephants sleep so little? Well, these giant animals spend most of their day eating and walking to find food. Elephants can travel up to 1.9 to 7.4 miles a day.\nElephants have the longest pregnancy period of all mammals.\nThe gestation period of an African elephant is on average 22 months and 18 to 22 months for Asian elephants. These animals spend lots of time in the womb so their brains can fully develop. Elephants are intelligent creatures capable of remembering things, problem-solving and displaying emotions.\nElephants grieve the dead.\nFamily is a critical part of an elephant\u2019s life. When it comes to the death of one of their own, elephants get very upset. Whether it is the dead body of an elephant they know or not, elephants will pay their respects. If an elephant from their herd dies, they usually stay with the body for several days and perform a funeral.\nElephants are not self-sustaining in captivity.\nEven though you see elephants in zoos, knowing that they are not self-sustainable in captivity is essential. In recent years, researchers have discovered that African elephants are not self-sustaining in zoos. There have been more elephant deaths than births (three births vs. five deaths annually). One contributing factor to this problem is an increase in infertility rates in female elephants (cows).\nSupport our African elephant community of researchers!\nAt For Elephants, we are working to improve the infertility rates of zoo elephants through our endocrine research. We work with zoos across the country to provide specialized reproduction and care services. To help us continue our mission, join the Herd of Heroes to make a monthly donation. Join down below!"}

This species lives in various parts of southern Asia. Researchers recognize three different subspecies, the Indian Elephant, the Sumatran Elephant, and the Sri Lankan Elephant. Read on to learn about the Asian Elephant.\nDescription of the Asian Elephant\nThis elephant species has an incredibly large body, thick legs, and along trunk. Unlike African elephants, their ears are relatively short. Their skin is grey and amazingly thick. Male elephants also have tusks, while females usually do not.\nMale elephants stand about 9 ft. tall, while females stand about 8 ft. tall. From their heads to their tails, these massive mammals measure between 18 and 21 ft. long. Most weigh about 6,000 lbs., but the heaviest recorded individual weighed over 15,000 lbs!\nInteresting Facts About the Asian Elephant\nThese elephants have a number of different traits and adaptations that make them unique.

Males use their tusks to fend off attackers, dig in the ground, and even knock down trees. Female Tusks \u2013 Though most females do not have tusks, a small percentage do. In those females with tusks, they are known as \u201ctushes\u201d! Most tushes are incredibly short, and sometimes only visible when the female opens her mouth.\nHabitat of the Asian Elephant\nThese massive creatures utilize a number of different habitat types. They live in savannas, grasslands, rainforests, scrub forests, deciduous forests, and more. Their range extends from sea level all the way to 1,000 ft. high elevations.\nDistribution of the Asian Elephant\nBefore humans decimated their populations, these creatures used to live throughout vast areas in southern Asia. They once lived from the Middle East along the coast of the Indian Ocean, throughout India, and virtually all of southeast Asia.\nNowadays, small pockets of populations live in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, and parts of the surrounding areas.\nDiet of the Asian Elephant\nElephants are herbivores, which means they eat plants. They eat a wide variety of different plants and plant parts. Their diet depends heavily on where they live, what is available, and what season it is. Some common foods include grasses, palms, legumes, flowers, fruits, roots, bamboo, and more. Some feed on farmers crops, like sugarcane.\nAsian Elephant and Human Interaction\nHumans use these large mammals to help move and fell trees. They have also used them to transport armies in the past. Nowadays, ecotourism is also a large industry in southern Asia.\nSadly, humans also kill these creatures for their hide and tusks. Some also kill them in retaliation for damaging crops. However, their greatest threat is the destruction of their forest habitats. Because of this, the IUCN lists this species as Endangered.\nDomestication\nHumans have been taming this species for hundreds of years. However, humans have not selectively bred these creatures for a long enough period of time for researchers to consider them domesticated.\nDoes the Asian Elephant Make a Good Pet\nNo, these animals do not make good pets. They are incredibly large, and they eat a lot of food! It would be nearly impossible to keep one as a pet.\nAsian Elephant Care\nZoos house herds of elephants together in large enclosures. Most facilities have multiple outdoor areas, or yards, with various trees and water sources to swim in. They also provide indoor areas to protect the animals from the weather.\nZookeepers train elephants using positive reinforcement. They teach the animals to help participate in their own care. For example, they might teach the elephant to hold still while they file its nails, or check its teeth.\nBehavior of the Asian Elephant\nThis species is most active during dawn and dusk, which makes them \u201ccrepuscular.\u201d They are quite social, and live in groups known as herds.\nHerds contain several females and their offspring, and males leave the group when they reach sexual maturity. Groups of males form bachelor herds together. Some adult males live solitary lives, and only interact with others while breeding.\nReproduction of the Asian Elephant\nWhen the breeding season approaches, males go into musth. This is when their testosterone levels increase, and they begin fighting with other males. A female breeds once every 4 years, when she chooses the strongest male to breed with. The males fight with one another to attract the attention of the females, and she chooses the winner.\nThe gestation period lasts about 21 months, and females give birth to a single calf. The calf nurses from its mother until it is several years old. At 5 yrs. the calf is fully independent, but females remain with their herd for life while males disperse."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "African Elephant Facts: Elephant Tusks - Safari Ventures", "url": "https://www.safariventures.com/african-elephant-facts-elephant-tusks/", "text": "Elephants are one of the most recognizable animals in the world. African elephants are the largest living land animal and can be seen throughout eastern and southern Africa. An incredible physical feature found on elephants are their ivory tusks.\nWhat are African elephant tusks?\nThe tusks of elephants are elongated incisor teeth and are made of Ivory. One third of an elephant\u2019s tusk is hidden from view and is embedded deep in the elephant\u2019s head. This part of the elephant\u2019s tusks is a pulp cavity made up of nerves, tissues, and blood whereas the visible part of the elephant tusk is made up of dentine with an outer layer of enamel.\nAre tusks found on both male and female African elephants?\nFor African elephants, tusks can be found on both males and females compared to Asian elephants where tusks are mainly seen only on males. About half of Asian female elephants have short tusks known as tushes. However, looking at an elephant\u2019s tusk, the average size of tusks has decreases over the past hundred years due to the poaching of elephants for their ivory tusks. This has caused the African elephant\u2019s \u201cbig tusk gene\u201d to evolve and become progressively rare. Additionally, hunting of African elephants has resulted in \u201ctusklessness\u201d to become increasingly common among African elephants.\nAt what age do African elephants grow tusks?\nElephant tusks are present at birth but are only milk teeth and eventually the \u201cbaby tusks\u201d fall out after one year of age. The permanent tusks of African elephants first start to appear at around two years of age by protruding from the lips and will continue to grow throughout the elephant\u2019s lifetime. As long as an elephant\u2019s tusks has not been broken or damaged, it can reveal an elephant age relative to other elephants.\nWhat do African elephants use their tusks for?\nThe tusks on elephants can be used for many purposes. African elephant tusks are mainly used for protection, digging, lifting objects, and gathering food. African elephants will use their tusks as a defense mechanism against other wildlife predators or when another elephant charges toward them. During the dry season elephants will use their tusks to dig water holes in dry riverbeds to get water. To help gather food, elephants will use their tusks to strip bark from trees to eat. Also, elephant tusks are used to protect their sensitive trunk. Interestingly, just like humans tend to be right-hand or left-hand dominate, there is evidence to believe elephants tend to be right-tusked or left-tusked with the dominate tusk being known as the master tusk. The more worn-down tusk is an easy way to tell which tusk an elephant prefers to use.\nCan an elephant regrow their tusks?\nUnfortunately, an African elephant only grows one set of tusks during its lifetime. Elephant tusks are rootless similar to human baby teeth and therefore cannot regrow. However, elephant tusks do continue to grow in length throughout an elephant\u2019s lifetime as long as they are not damaged. Elephant tusks grow in layers with the most inside layer being the last produced. The head of the tusks has a hollow cavity, but gradually becomes solid with a narrow nerve running through to the tip of the tusk.\nHow big are African elephant tusks?\nAfrican elephant tusks are curved forward and average around 5 to 8 feet (1.5-2.5 meters) in length and can weight around 50 to 99 pounds (23-45 kg) each. Male elephants grown significantly larger tusks than female elephants.\nWhy do we need to protect African elephants?\nAfrican elephants have become an icon for Africa and are among the most intelligent animals in the world. Being the largest land animal, elephant play an important part in balancing the natural ecosystem. However, due to their beautiful ivory tusks poaching continues to take place. According to the Great Elephant Census, the Savanna African elephant population has declined by 30% between 2007 and 2014 and the current rate of decline is 8% every year, primarily due to poaching. Therefore, more than ever we need to protect them magnificent animals."}

If that\u2019s not enough, we found even more facts on circus animals and how their treatment can lead to tragedy.\nCircus Accidents With Animals\nBy now, you know what the treatment of circus animals is like. But what happens when they fight back?\n6. Between 1987\u20132019, Captive Elephants Killed 20 People.\n(Source: PETA)\nThese elephants injured over 140 people , including trainers and innocent bystanders.\n, including trainers and innocent bystanders. Since elephants can live for decades, many suffer beatings from birth that would kill a human. But when an animal has had enough, it will fight back. Since elephants are huge, they can cause horrendous damage to towns, roads, and people.\nOn 25 May 2021, two circus tigers in China mauled and killed a handler. But they didn\u2019t make it out alive after being shot by the police.\nThe cycle of circus animals and mistreatment can sometimes lead to innocent people and animals getting caught in the crossfire.\nHow many circuses are there in the US?\nThere are 45 well-known circuses in the US, but we can\u2019t get an exact number as there may be smaller and usually illegal operations throughout the US.\nWhat we do know is that there are over 300 exotic animals used in US circuses. While exotic animals are amazing to see, they are not made for captive life.\nStill, the exotic pet industry is worth over $15 billion a year.\nBut there\u2019s a glimmer of hope as organizations close down these circuses.\nCircus Animal Rights\nPressure from animal rights groups saw some of the longest-standing circuses, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, close for good in 2017. Let\u2019s have a look at what else is done to help the animals.\n7. Bolivia Was the First Country to Ban Circus Animals in 2009.\n(Source: Treehugger)\nIn 2019, the UK joined the list of 26 countries that ban the use of animals in the circus.\nUnfortunately, the US is falling far behind. The Animal Welfare Act covers these animals only at a minimal level. Plus, there are so many loopholes that little is done to stop the abuse.\nBut there are a few good facts about circus animals. Some local governments ban circuses that use animals, including Los Angeles, New York City, and Huntington Beach.\nYou might feel helpless after reading all this, but there are still things you can do to help.\nWhat You Can Do To Help Circus Animals\nHere are a few tips on how to help the circus animal ban and save these poor creatures from a life of torture and abuse:\nDon\u2019t go to any circus that uses live animals.\nSign petitions like PETA and Care2.\nEducate those around you about what\u2019s happening to circus animals.\nIf you have children, explain why you don\u2019t support circuses with animals in a way they can understand. If kids knew what was going on, they wouldn\u2019t want to go.\nGo to an animal-friendly circus, like Circus Vargas, Circus Finelli, and New Shanghai Circus.\nIf you know an animal trainer that uses inhumane methods, suggest an alternative like a humane dog training collar that won\u2019t hurt the animals.\nFinal Thoughts on Circus Animals\nIt\u2019s time to stop the detriment of animals in the entertainment industry.\nCircus animals are abused, tortured, and mistreated from an early age. No matter how \u201chumane\u201d some circuses say they are, no wild animal should spend its life in a cage, performing tricks for humans\u2019 amusement.\nElephants, bears, lions, and tigers deserve the right to a free life in the wild, away from handlers\u2019 abuse. And we shouldn\u2019t overlook the animal cruelty in zoos, too.\nFAQ\nDo circuses still have animals?\nUnfortunately, yes. There are hundreds of circuses worldwide that can still legally use wild animals. The US has many. Although the pressure to close down all animal-driven circuses is rising, it\u2019s still not enough to stop them.\nWhat countries still use animals in circuses in 2022?\nThere are 195 countries globally. And out of those, only 48 have total bans on circus animals. But some are on a per state or per town basis, so it can be tricky to get precise numbers. Still, countries like France, Germany, Spain, and Italy have no restrictions on circus animals as of 2022.\nHow many circuses are there?\nThere are around 45 well-known circuses still operating in the US. Plus, hundreds of schools teach and perform the same tricks that have brought so much joy over the last century. Internationally, there are well over 100 circuses. Some still use animals but others, like Circus Roncalli in Germany, are using technology to their advantage.\nAre there circus animals in the UK?\nIn 2019, the UK government banned the use of wild animals in traveling circuses. Marking a great victory for animal activists in Europe. However, UK medical research kills over 3,000 monkeys a year for lab testing, so out of the tent and into the lab."}

There are now thought to be less than 1500 pygmy elephants left in Borneo, and as conservationists strive to stop these gentle giants from becoming extinct, scientists are in a similar race to discover where the Borneo pygmy elephant came from in the first place.\nThe World\u2019s Smallest Elephant\nBorneo pygmy elephants, or Bornean pygmy elephants as they are also known, are the smallest elephants in the world with the males reaching around 2.5 meters in height. They are also noticeably tamer than other elephant subspecies\u2013often allowing Borneo\u2019s many wildlife tourists to get within a few meters of them without showing any signs of aggression.\nAlong with their laid back nature, the fact that the Borneo pygmy elephant population is confined to a small area on the north-eastern tip of Borneo has led many scientists to theorize that they are descendants of a domestic population abandoned on the island in the 17th century. Local belief is that these elephants were originally imported as gifts to the Sultan of Sulu, as was the custom hundreds of years ago in Asia.\nAdding weight to this theory is a marked lack of any archaeological evidence supporting an ancient population of elephants anywhere else in Borneo, meaning the historical population must have remained in exactly the same area without dispersing \u2013highly unusual behavior for such large mammals.\nAsian Elephant DNA Evidence\nWhilst we have long been able to distinguish the species of elephants \u2013 African and Asian \u2013 from one another, placing the many elephant populations into subspecies has proved much trickier. The Borneo pygmy elephant has been variously grouped with the mainland Asian subspecies (Elephas maximus indicus, also known as the Indian elephant) and the Sumatran subspecies (Elephas maximus sumatrensis); however, a 2003 DNA analysis project by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Columbia University proved once and for all that the Borneo pygmy elephants are genetically distinct from both of these populations.\nExisting DNA data shows there are four extant (surviving) subspecies of Asian elephant:\nIndian Elephant ( E. m. indicus Cuvier, 1798)\nCuvier, 1798) Sri Lankan Elephant ( E. m. maximus Linnaeus, 1758)\nLinnaeus, 1758) Sumatran Elephant ( E. m. sumatranus Temminck, 1847)\nTemminck, 1847) Borneo Elephant (E. m. borneensis Deraniyagala, 1950)\nBorneo Pygmy Elephants Could Be Javan Elephants\nDespite the consensus that Borneo pygmy elephants are a distinct subspecies, the debate over their origin rages on, with a 2008 paper \u2018Origins of the Elephants Elephas Maximus L. of Borneo\u2019 by Cranbrook et al continuing to argue the case for a domestic ancestor. \u201cJust one fertile female and one fertile male elephant, if left undisturbed in enough good habitat, could, in theory, end up as a population of 2,000 elephants within less than 300 years,\u201d said Junaidi Payne of WWF, one of the paper\u2019s co-authors. \u201cAnd that maybe what happened in practice here.\u201d\nThe prospect of Borneo pygmy elephants being the descendants of elephants imported from Sulu, an island province in the Philippines, is an exciting one. Sulu elephants were in turn thought to have originated in Java, where the subspecies were hunted to extinction in the 1800s. If it turns out Borneo pygmy elephants really are misplaced Javan elephants \u2013an entire subspecies has essentially come back from the dead.\nWhether or not Borneo pygmy elephants are a distinct Bornean subspecies, or whether they represent a surviving population of a previously extinct subspecies remains to be seen. DNA analysis has proved they do not belong to the Indian or Sumatran subspecies. What they are, or where they came from still remains a mystery, and with the current threats of habitat loss and fragmentation, there is a strong possibility these enigmatic giants will disappear before anyone manages to solve the riddle."}

The species as a whole is recognized as being the largest land animal in Asia and the Sri Lankan type is the largest of the species. With a population that only includes a few thousand individuals, these elephants are actively conserved and are considered at risk of further population decline. Geographically, they are limited to the island of Sri Lanka situated off the southern coast of India. Fragmentation of their habit, narrowing of geographic range and frequent lethal interactions with humans are all contributing factors in their decline.\nSri Lankan Elephant Facts\nMassive Proportions: This subspecies has the biggest height and weight of all Asian elephants. They can weigh over 10,000 pounds and reach a height of over 10 feet at the shoulder.\nThis subspecies has the biggest height and weight of all Asian elephants.

They are only found in select regions of the island of Sri Lanka. Big Appetite: These animals need to eat hundreds of pounds of food each day to maintain their massive body.\nSri Lankan Elephant Scientific Name\nSri Lankan elephants are genetically distinct from other members of their species, but can also simply be called Asian elephants like their brethren found elsewhere on the continent. In taxonomic terms, these animals are known as Elephas maximus maximus. The word \u201celaphas\u201d has Greek and Latin roots that indicate an antlered animal or \u201cbig arch.\u201d The word maximus is also Latin and simply means \u201cbiggest\u201d or \u201cgreatest,\u201d which is an appropriate choice given their size. The subspecies belongs to the Elephantidae family in the Mammalia class.\nSri Lankan Elephant Appearance\nSri Lankan elephants are the largest of the Asian elephant subspecies and the biggest land animals on the continent. Adults can reach a height of 11.5 feet, which is about twice as tall as an average human man. Body weight can range from 4,400 to 12,000 pounds. There is generally a big size difference between male and female elephants. Males are typically 20 to 30 percent taller and can weigh almost twice as much as a female of comparable age.\nThese elephants have a mostly grey body with lighter spots or flecks caused by a lack of pigment in some of the skin cells. They have a rounded torso that is supported by strong, cylindrical legs. They have small, angular ears that are generally tucked next to their heads, which has a distinct double-dome shape. Like all elephants, these animals are also equipped with a long and flexible trunk that serves many practical purposes.\nThey are also set apart from other Asian elephant subspecies in that only a small fraction, about 5 to 10 percent, of males grow pronounced tusks. Also, unlike African elephant species, female Sri Lankan elephants never grow tusks beyond short nubs. The longest tusks reported on a Sri Lankan elephant were 7.5 feet long and belonged to Raja, a nationally-recognized animal in India who served a ceremonial role in a local religious center.\nSri Lankan Elephant Behavior\nLike other elephant species, these animals have complex and integrated social behaviors that serve a critical role in their development and survival. Groups of related females and their calves, collectively called a clan, typically travel together and share in the responsibilities of caring for young. Male elephants leave their clan when they reach sexual maturity and live solitary lives or in small, loosely-bonded groups with other males.\nAll Asian elephants rely on a combination of communication methods to interact with their clan members and potential mates. Their mouth and trunk are both involved in making a variety of noises for short and long-distance communication. They also rely on several glands to secrete chemical signals and may use their trunks to communicate via touching.\nSri Lankan Elephant Habitat\nAs their name suggests, this subspecies is found only on the Indian island of Sri Lanka off the country\u2019s southern coast. While the elephants were once distributed throughout the entire island, from coasts to mountains, they are now mostly found in the lowland regions. They are migratory by nature, so only spend some of their time in areas that have been designated as protected parks and preserves.\nDue to the hot and dry nature of their native habitat, these elephants engage in several types of behaviors designed to manage their internal temperature. They can frequently be seen submerging themselves in freshwater bodies and may cover themselves with mud. They also repeatedly flap their ears as a way of releasing body heat.\nSri Lankan Elephant Diet\nSri Lankan elephants are considered megaherbivores due the vast quantity of plant matter they consume on a daily basis. Adults can eat over 300 pounds of food in a single day or up to 10 percent of their body weight. Their massive appetite requires over 12 hours of foraging every day and frequent migrations to find fresh feeding grounds throughout the year.\nWhat does the Sri Lankan elephant eat?\nThese elephants are generalist foragers, which means they are willing and able to eat many different kinds of plants. Researchers have identified over 100 different plant species that compose part of their diet, including dozens of species used in human cultivation. Regenerating forests are usually better for foraging than mature ones.\nSri Lankan Elephant Predators and Threats\nA small and declining population has prompted conservationists to classify the Sri Lankan elephant as endangered. Continued habitat fragmentation due to the expansion of human settlements and growing agricultural areas is a significant threat. Historically, these elephants were frequently targeted for hunting and extermination until the 20th century, which decimated the natural population.\nPoaching by humans and attacks from natural predators are a minimal threat to Sri Lankan elephants. The rarity of tusk-bearing males in this subspecies limits their appeal for ivory poachers. However, clashes with humans are still a leading cause of death for these elephants. Loss and fragmentation of their habitat has forced migration through populated areas, which may become violent and lead to the death of the animal. Some farmers also intentionally shoot or poison elephants who could damage their crops.\nWhat eats Sri Lankan elephants?\nAside from human hunting in the past, these elephants have few natural predators due to their massive size. Their only known predator is the Bengal tiger, but even these voracious and powerful carnivores usually limit their targets to young elephants.\nSri Lankan Elephant Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nMating rituals are typically competitive between males with females making the final selection of the most desirable mate. Reproduction can occur throughout the year, but is largely influenced by the hormonal state of the two individuals involved. Females have a brief estrus period of 3 to 7 days when they are fertile and ready to mate. Males also enter a similar hormonal phase called musth, which greatly increases their potential as a mate.\nSri Lankan elephants have a long gestation period that can extend for up to 680 days. They typically give birth to a single calf, which exits the womb weighing 200 to 300 pounds. Males don\u2019t participate in raising or caring for the offspring. Instead, females and their young tend to linger around related adult females in clans lead by a single matriarch. All members of this \u201cnursing unit\u201d look after and help raise the calves.\nCalves must nurse to survive for about 2 years and complete weaning is usually finished after about 4 years. Calves become independent within a year or two of weaning, with males leaving their clan to lead solitary lives or in small groups with other males. Elephants of both genders generally reach sexual maturity when they are around 10 to 15 years old and can live well over 60 years in the wild.\nSri Lankan Elephant Population\nCurrent population estimates for this subspecies is between 2,500 and 4,000 adult individuals. The population has been on a declining trend since the colonial period and conservationists believe it will continue in the years ahead. In fact, some experts believe that the animal will be extinct in the wild within decades. Their need for vast migratory tracts and possibility of negative interactions with humans makes conservation efforts very challenging.\nView all 180 animals that start with S"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "In Depth Facts About Elephants - Global Sanctuary for Elephants", "url": "https://globalelephants.org/in-depth-facts/", "text": "Elephants are the only animals to have a temporal gland. When this gland becomes active the elephant enters a state of behaviour known as \u2018musth\u2019. In the languages of northern India, musth (originally a Persian word) means a state of drunkenness, hilarity, ecstasy, desire or lust.\nMusth is a condition unique to elephants, which has still not been scientifically explained. It affects sexually mature male elephants usually between the ages of 20 and 50. It occurs annually and lasts for a period of between 2-3 weeks in the wild, usually during the hot season. During this time, the elephant becomes highly agitated, aggressive and can be dangerous. Even normally placid animals have been known to kill people and other elephants when in the full throes of musth. It generally lasts 4 to 6 weeks in captivity but has been said to have lasted as long as 2 months.\nThe reasons for its occurrence are not fully understood. The animal is sexually agitated, but musth is not thought to be entirely sexual in nature. Elephants mate outside the musth period and it is not the same as the rutting season common in some other mammals. When in musth, a strong smelling oily secretion flows from a gland above the eye and elephants will also constantly dribble urine.\nThe temporal gland discharge can be quite free flowing and run down the elephant\u2019s face dripping down their chin. While in musth everything changes with the elephant; the way they walk, their interactions with other elephants, the degree of aggression, and as mentioned, the odor they exude. In rare circumstances, if two male elephants in musth cross paths the ensuing fight can turn into a fight to the death.\nIt is difficult to describe just how extreme musth can affect an elephant\u2019s normal disposition. Captive elephants experiencing musth are usually kept securely chained or isolated and managed from a distance until the torment subsides, after which they will return to their usual character.\nHistorically, captive male elephants in musth have been chained by all four legs, with chains from their tusks down to their feet, and from tusk to tusk in front of their trunks to prevent them from lunging with their heads and swinging their trunks at trainers. From the age of 45-50 musth gradually diminishes, eventually disappearing altogether. On very exceptional occasions, a form of musth has been recorded in females but little is known about its purpose.\nBoth sexes may become sexually mature at as early as 9 years, but males usually do not reach sexual activity until 14-15 years, and even then they are not capable of the social dominance that usually is necessary for successful reproductive activity. There is usually competition among the males for females that are in estrus.\nIf there is a male in musth present around females in estrus, non-musth males will generally back away from the competition; the level of testosterone in a musth male creates an unmatched degree of anger, aggression and strength. Often more than one male will gather around the area of a female that is ready to breed, and the most dominant male is the one who is allowed to carry out breeding. This can be decided peacefully, especially if the size and strength difference is obvious, or sometimes the elephants will fight over that rite.\nISSUES WITH BREEDING CAPTIVE ELEPHANTS\nIn recent years, most zoo pregnancies are created through artificial insemination. This is an invasive procedure that the elephants have to be trained for. The elephant needs to stand still for long periods with minimal movement, sometimes necessitating the use of chains. A long, flexible hose is then inserted into the elephant\u2019s winding, 3-foot-long reproductive tract, then sperm is pumped through the hose.\nFemales are only fertile for a few days each year, typically 2-3 days every 14-16 weeks. Blood samples are collected repeatedly to monitor hormone levels, to most accurately depict when to attempt artificial-insemination. The most attempts at artificial-insemination on record was an elephant who underwent the procedure 91 times in a 4 year time span.\nMiscarriages and premature and stillborn deaths from artificial-insemination pregnancies reach approximately 54%. Out of 27 artificial-insemination pregnancies since 1999, documents show that eight resulted in miscarriages or stillborn deaths and an additional six calves died from disease, including from the herpes virus (The Seattle Times).\nINFANT MORTALITY IN CAPTIVE-BRED ELEPHANTS\nThe infant-mortality rate for elephants in zoos is almost triple the rate in the wild. The overall infant-mortality rate for elephants in zoos is a staggering 40%. There are several causes behind this statistic, one is an elephant herpes virus known as EEHV, a disease that is most deadly in elephants under the age of 10. The virus, believed to spread by contact, could lie dormant for years, then move so swiftly it could destroy internal organs in hours.\nResearchers have yet to develop a test to detect the virus in its dormant stage. An emerging theory is that the dormant virus may already reside in the bodies of elephants; when it turns active, it can spread by contact or be passed from mother to calf during pregnancy. This problem is compounded further by circulating elephants around the country to try to breed much-desired offspring. This disease has now been reported in over a dozen zoos throughout the country, as of 2012.\nThis link contains a brief description and animation that defines some of the harsh realities of captive elephant breeding programs.\nOther causes of calf deaths can be related to psychological reasons. Elephants in captivity are not surrounded by a nurturing herd of their relatives, who instinctively aid in child rearing and pass down their knowledge and experiences throughout generations.\nSome elephants just do not know how to be mothers and there have been instances of mothers killing their own calves, a behavior that has never been reported in the wild.\nAs a result, some institutions chain the mothers during birth, to ensure the safety of the calf, and closely monitor their interactions. Calves sometimes are removed from their mothers and supplemented with bottle feeding when the mother acts out toward the calf or is resistant to nursing.\nFrequently captive females are bred at a much younger age than they would breed in the wild. Not only can this potentially compromise the health of the calf and mother but with limited life experience, can cause complications with the care the young mother provides to her calf."}

In Hindu puranas, the god Indra has a white elephant. Although often depicted as snow white, their skin is normally a soft reddish-brown, turning a light pink when wet. They have fair eyelashes and toenails. The traditional \"white elephant\" is commonly misunderstood as being albino, but the Thai term chang samkhan, actually translates as 'auspicious elephant', being \"white\" in terms of an aspect of purity.\nWhite elephants are only nominally white. Of those currently kept by the Burmese rulers\u2014General Than Shwe regards himself as the heir of the Burmese kings\u2014one is grey and the other three are pinkish, but all are officially white. The king of Thailand also keeps a number of white elephants, eleven of which are still alive. Former U.S. Vice President Spiro Agnew once presented a white elephant to King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia.[citation needed]\nPersia [ edit ]\nThere were white elephants in the army of the Sasanian king Khusrau II. According to al-Tabari, a white elephant killed the commander of the Arab Muslims Abu Ubayd al-Thaqafi in the Battle of the Bridge. White elephants were considered royalty by Arabs and rode by caliphs. Abul-Abbas, a white elephant was gifted to Charlemagne by Harun al-Rashid, the fifth Abbasid caliph.\nHinduism [ edit ]\nRajasthan Indra (alias Sakra) and Sachi riding the five-headed divine elephant Airavata , folio from a Jain text, c. 1670\u20131680, painting in LACMA museum, originally from Amber\nThe god Indra is said to possess a white elephant named Airavata, which possesses the ability to fly. Airavata is made king of all elephants by Indra.\nKing Bimbisara had a white elephant, which he had captured in a forest when the elephant was in his musth period. He named the bull elephant Sechanaka, which means \"watering\", as the elephant used to water the plants by himself without any prior training. It is said the cost of this elephant was more the half of Magadha. He later gave it to his son Vihallakumara, which made his other son Ajatashatru jealous. Ajatashatru tried to steal it many times, which resulted in two of the most terrible wars, called the Mahasilakantaka & Ratha-musala (see Ajatashatru).\nThailand [ edit ]\n\"According to Brahmanic belief, if a monarch possessed one or more 'white' elephants, it was a glorious and happy sign.\" King Trailok possessed the first. In the Thai language, they are called albino, not white, indicating \"pale yellow eyes and white nails\", with white hair. The \"rough skin was either pink all over or had pink patches on the head, trunk, or forelegs.\" \"They were not worshipped for themselves and were regarded as an appendage to the King's majesty.\": 39\nIn Thailand, white elephants (\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e07\u0e40\u0e1c\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e01, chang phueak) (also known as Pink Elephants) are considered sacred and are a symbol of royal power; all those discovered are presented to the king (although this presentation is usually a ceremonial one\u2014the elephants are not actually taken into captivity). Historically, the status of kings has been evaluated by the number of white elephants in their possession. The late king Bhumibol Adulyadej owned as many as 21 white elephants \u2014 considered an unprecedented achievement, making him the monarch who owned the greatest number of Chang Phueak in Thai history. The first elephant found in King Bhumibol's reign was regarded as the most important elephant in the whole realm; it received the royal title which bears his majesty's own name: Phra Savet Adulyadej Pahol Bhumibol Navanatta-parami (\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e28\u0e27\u0e15\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e38\u0e25\u0e22\u0e40\u0e14\u0e0a\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e25 \u0e20\u0e39\u0e21\u0e34\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e19\u0e27\u0e19\u0e32\u0e16\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e23\u0e21\u0e35). However, the King did not bestow royal titles to all of the white elephants in his possession. Today eleven of these elephants are still alive and only five have royal titles.\nA white elephant in Thailand is not necessarily albino, although it must have pale skin. After being discovered, the elephants are assigned to one of four graded categories before being offered to the king, although the lower grades are sometimes refused.\nIn the past, lower grade white elephants were given as gifts to the king's friends and allies. The animals needed a lot of care and, being sacred, could not be put to work, so were a great financial burden on the recipient - only the monarch and the very rich could afford them. According to one story, white elephants were sometimes given as a present to some enemy (often a lesser noble with whom the king was displeased). The unfortunate recipient, unable to make any profit from it, and obliged to take care of it, would suffer bankruptcy and ruin.\nMyanmar [ edit ]\nA white elephant outside of Yangon in 2013\nIn Myanmar as well, white elephants have been revered symbols of power and good fortune. The announcement by the ruling military regime of the finding of white elephants in 2001 and 2002 was seen by opponents as being aimed at bolstering support for their regime. As of 2010 , Myanmar has nine white elephants (as of February 2014).[when?] The last white elephant was found in Basein area, in the South-Western part of Myanmar on 27 February 2015.

The animals are mainly poached for ivory, which is used to make jewelry, religious ornaments and items for decorative purposes. In the black market, ivory price starts at $1,500 and the rate increases depending on its size. The sale of ivory has been banned in many countries.\nThe two well-known species of this animal are the African elephant and the Asian elephant. They are both in danger. The African elephant is the largest land mammal on Earth.\nHere are some quotes about elephants, collected from Everyday Power, to share on this day:\n1. \"Nature's great masterpiece, an elephant \u2013 the only harmless great thing.\" \u2013 John Donne\n2. \"If elephants didn't exist, you couldn't invent one. They belong to a small group of living things so unlikely they challenge credulity and common sense.\" \u2013 Lyall Watson\n3. \"But perhaps the most important lesson I learned is that there are no walls between humans and the elephants except those we put up ourselves, and that until we allow not only elephants, but all living creatures their place in the sun, we can never be whole ourselves.\" \u2013 Lawrence Anthony\n4. \"Elephants love reunions. They recognize one another after years and years of separation and greet each other with wild, boisterous joy. There's bellowing and trumpeting, ear flapping and rubbing. Trunks entwine.\" \u2013 Jennifer Richard Jacobson\n5. \"I have a memory like an elephant. I remember every elephant I've ever met.\" \u2013 Herb Caen\n6. \"Primate and elephant and even pig societies show considerable evidence of care for others, parent-child bonding, solidarity in the face of danger, and so on.\" \u2013 Christopher Hitchens\n7. \"Elephants don't know anything about the world of ants; the peaks of mountains are oblivious of what is happening on the plains!\" \u2013 Mehmet Murat ildan\n8. \"The elephant can survive only if forests survive.\" \u2013 Mark Shand\n9. \"I feel as if I go to Africa, I may never come back.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "15 Hippopotamus Facts - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/hippopotamus/", "text": "Hippo Profile\nThe hippopotamus, or hippo, is native to sub-Saharan Africa and is a large, mostly herbivorous mammal.\nThe name hippopotamus comes from an ancient Greek word that translates to mean \u2018river horse\u2019 and the hippo is the third-largest land mammal following the elephant and rhinoceros.\nHippo Facts Overview\nHabitat: Rivers, lakes & mangrove swamps Location: sub-Saharan Africa, Colombia Lifespan: 40 \u2013 50 years Size: 13 \u2013 18 ft (4 to 5.5 m) Weight: 1,760 \u2013 3,530 pounds (800 \u2013 1,600 kg) Color: Grey, black, brownish purple Diet: Herbivore \u2013 Grass & fruit Predators: Crocodiles, lions & hyenas can prey on baby hippo. Adults, don\u2019t generally have predators. Top Speed: 40 Kph (30 mph) No. of Species:\n2 Conservation Status:\nVulnerable\nThe hippo can be found in lakes, rivers and mangrove swamps. Male hippos are known as \u2018bulls\u2018, female hippos are \u2018cows\u2018, and babies are \u2018calves\u2018.\nTerritorial males will control a pre-determined stretch of water, which will include a group of five to thirty females and their young. This group of hippos is actually known as a \u2018bloat\u2018.\nThe main reason why hippos are often found near bodies of water is that this is how they stay cool and prevent sunburn. During the hot daytime a hippo will either stay in water or mud in order to cool down.\nHippos may be seen near each other at rest, but feeding is done in solo and they are not territorial on land. The hippo generally grazes after dusk when it is cooler.\nThey are characterized by their barrel-shaped torsos. The hippo mouth is wide and open which contains large canine tusks. They have bodies that contain little hair, short columnar legs and can weigh up to 4,400 pounds for males and females are slightly smaller at 2,800-pounds.\nThere are two species of hippo, the modern hippopotamus and the pygmy hippopotamus, which is native to the forests and swamps of West Africa, primarily in Liberia.\nThe female hippo has a gestation period of eight months. Baby hippos are born underwater and will weigh between 55 and 100-pounds and will be about 4-feet long. They must swim to the surface in order to take their first breath of air. A normal birth rate is a single calf, but twins are not uncommon.\nMothers are very protective of their young and calves are often left together in \u2018nurseries\u2019 which are usually watched by one or more adults. While in these nurseries, the baby hippos will engage in play fights which prepare them for when they must fend for themselves.\nWhile the hippo used to be found all over the sub-Saharan area of Africa, their modern habitat is much smaller \u2013 barely a fraction of the size! This loss of habitat is one reason why they\u2019re now considered a vulnerable species.\nInteresting Hippo Facts\n1. Hippos are the deadliest large land animal on the planet\nThe Hippopotamus is one of the most dangerous animals in the world, killing an estimated 500 people a year in Africa.\nThey are extremely aggressive, unpredictable, have sharp teeth and can crush a human or predator to death with relative ease due to their size.\nIn one 2014 case in Niger, a boat was capsized by a hippo and 13 people were killed.\n2. Hippos love the water!\nThe hippopotamus is a semi-aquatic mammal. This means that even though they\u2019re a mammal like humans, dogs, cats, and other similar species, they spend a majority of their life in the water. Their historic habitat even included the Nile River.\nThey love the water so much that the Greeks had named them river horses!\nHowever, they only spend their days in the water. By night, they\u2019re on the land and grazing for up to 6 hours.\n3. There\u2019s only one wild herd famous outside of Africa\u2026\nAnd it has its roots entangled with Pablo Escobar!\nDuring his time, Escobar ran a private zoo which featured hippopotamuses. After he left, however, they escaped into the wild and continued to thrive in Colombia, where they are now part of a herd of at least 80.\nSince the hippo is an invasive species in this area that could damage the river ecosystems and native wildlife, there are now efforts to help reduce their ability to reproduce, providing a more humane way to halt the growth of the herd.\n4. The hippo is a victim of ivory poaching\nWhen you think about poaching and ivory, you probably think about rhinos and elephants. However, the hippopotamus is also a victim of this crime, which is another reason aside from habitat loss that they\u2019re endangered.\nWhile they may not have tusks or horns, the hippo\u2019s front teeth are made of ivory. This ivory is harder than an elephants, making it more durable but more difficult to carve.\nThe incisors can reach 40 cm (1 ft 4 in), while the canines reach up to 50 cm (1 ft 8 in).\n5. They can eat around 35 kg of grass in a single night\u2026every night!\nEver heard the saying \u201chungry as a hippo\u201d? There\u2019s more truth to that than meets the eye!\nDuring the night, when hippos return to land, they spend up to six hours grazing on grass and any fallen fruit they might stumble across. In a single night, a single hippopotamus can easily eat 35 kilograms of grass!\nNot sure just how impressive that is? Some other things that weigh around 35 kilograms are a small sofa, a chest freezer, a single twin bed (frame and mattress included), and medium size dryer.\nImagine eating an entire dryer\u2019s worth of weight in your favorite food every day!\n6. Hippos can open their mouths at almost 180 degrees\nHippos can open their mouths over 50cms wide, and their jaw hinge is located far back, allowing them to open at almost 180 degrees.\nHippopotamus bite force measures 12 600 kPa. By comparison, a lion\u2019s bite force is only 4500 kPa.\nThe hippopotamus, with his ferocious jaw force, unique mouth size and sharp teeth, can easily bisect a human body in a single bite!\n7. They can reach top speeds over 40 kph\nAt a first glance, you may think that the hippopotamus is one of the slowest animals around. After all, they have odd proportions and weigh a ton (literally).\nHowever, while they\u2019re not the fastest animal by far, the hippopotamus can reach top speeds over 40 kph when they\u2019re running on land. This is around the same speed as a moped!\nAs a result, a human has no hope of out running one of these massive mammals. That\u2019s one reason why hippos kill more humans in Africa each year than any other species, including big cats.\n8. Predators are only really a threat when a hippo is alone\nTaking a quick look out our hippopotamus profile, you\u2019ll notice that these mostly water dwellers have quite a few predators both in the water and on land. From big cats to hyenas to crocodiles, there are many animals that pose a threat to the hippopotamus.\nHowever, only when they\u2019re alone.\nThere\u2019s a reason that hippos travel in dense herds. While they\u2019re easy targets alone, an entire herd of hippopotamuses can easily throw their weight around.\nWith the strongest bite strength of all land animals and a knack for aggression, the hippopotamus can easily defend itself so long as its not out numbered. They\u2019ve even been known to chase down human boats!\n9. Hippos can\u2019t swim\nThe most surprising fact of them all? Hippos can\u2019t swim!\nThat\u2019s right, despite how much they love the water and having webbed feet, hippos aren\u2019t actually the best swimmers. They aren\u2019t even swimmers at all! Instead, they have such a high body density that they sink right to the bottom of the river where, instead of swimming, they gallop through the water.\nTurns out they earned the name \u201criver horse\u201d for many reasons! Fortunately hipppos can hold their breath for up to 5 minutes.\n10. They weigh as much as a car\nAdult male hippos can weigh about 3,300-pounds with females reaching 2,800-pounds. Very large males can grow to 4,400-pounds with exceptional large ones reaching 5,800-pounds.\n11. A Hippo can live to become a senior citizen\nThe average lifespan of a hippopotamus is between 40 and 50 years.\nHowever, the oldest living hippo in captivity set a record when she died in 2017. Bertha was a resident of the Manila Zoo in the Phillipines. At the time of her death she was 65.\n12. Hippos can be traced back about 52-million years ago\nA total of six species of Hippopotamus are extinct with three of them being subspecies of the Malagasy Hippopotamus.\nThese species were much smaller in size than the modern hippo with the last of them disappearing in the past century.\nThere are also three species of the European Hippopotamus that have become extinct.\n13. Hippos engage in \u2018muck-spreading\u2019\nThis involves marking territory with their own faeces \u2013 by spinning their tail which acts as a fan to spread their faeces over a greater area!\nGross!\n14. They can sleep underwater\nHippos are able to sleep while fully submerged underwater, intermittently surfacing to the surfce using a reflex that allows them to take a breath, before sinking back down \u2013 without waking up!\nWhen completely submerged, their ears and nostrils fold shut to keep water out.\n15. The IUCN lists hippos as vulnerable\nHippos are thought to have a stable population estimated between 115,000 and 130,000 animals.\nSadly however, hippos are considered vulnerable due to loss of access to fresh water and being subject to poaching.\nHippo Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification"}

It\u2019s how our bodies manage temperature, cooling us down when it\u2019s too hot. But unlike humans, elephants don\u2019t have sweat glands to help keep them cool on those scorching summer days in Thailand. So, how do elephants keep cool?\nWhen looking for answers about the behaviour and characteristics of animals, we need data. So we observe and monitor animals to gain a better understanding of why they do what they do.\nBut how do we gather data to find out these facts about Asian elephants?\nWell, when you work with Asian elephants on GVI\u2019s Chiang Mai internships, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to observe, monitor and record data on the natural behaviour of Asian elephants every day. As a GVI intern, you\u2019ll also be able to lead your own research project. And this is exactly what GVI alum Sophie Whipp did.\nSophie conducted an intern project in Huay Pakoot, Chiang Mai, where she spent six weeks observing and recording data on two semi-wild Asian elephants.\nThe aim of Sophie\u2019s internship research project was to determine if existing data is representative of the current behaviours and needs of the elephants.\nTypically, GVI volunteers in Chiang Mai will head out into the mountainous forests of Northern Thailand in the morning and collect data on the activities and behaviours of these Asian elephants. However, Sophie\u2019s aim was to find out if the activities displayed by the Asian elephants in the morning were the same as those displayed in the afternoon. This is because the weather is much warmer in the afternoon, which led Sophie to believe that the elephants may display more cooling behaviours than they would earlier in the day.\nData was collected in the afternoons during the dry season between the months of January and March, when the overall temperature was rising.\nSo, what are the cooling behaviours of Asian elephants?\nWith the absence of sweat glands to regulate temperature, Asian elephants have evolved their own efficient cooling mechanisms, or adaptations. These can be divided into two categories \u2013 physical and behavioural.\nWhat physical adaptations allow Asian elephants to cool themselves down?\n1) Skin\nAlthough Asian elephants only have sweat glands in the cuticles of their toenails, their skin has an extremely high permeability. This means that water can actually evaporate through the skin, allowing the skin to cool without the need for sweat glands.\nThe wrinkled, uneven and textured skin of elephants also plays a major role in cooling by allowing any moisture from their environment to stay on the surface of their leathery skin for longer, rather than evaporating off straight away.\n2) Ears\nOne of the best physical cooling adaptations of both African and Asian elephants are their ears.\nYes, you heard right \u2013 ears.\nIn fact, elephants can lower their overall temperature by more than ten degrees celsius by simply flapping their massive ears to create wind.\nThe backs of their ears are also covered in a network of capillaries and veins that carry blood.\nSo, how exactly does this keep Asian elephants cool?\nWell, when the warm blood from the rest of the elephant\u2019s body reaches this capillary network and is filtered through the ears, it\u2019s cooled by the wind and released back to the elephant\u2019s body. This helps to regulate their overall body temperature.\nBecause of this, it can be quite a common sight to see an elephant facing the wind with its ears extended. This increases the surface area of the ears, allowing the cool breeze to access all the veins and capillaries found in the ear.\n3) Trunk\nOn a hot summer\u2019s day, it\u2019s not unusual to hear your dog audibly panting from the other room. This is a cooling mechanism for them to regulate their body temperature.\nBut with elephants breathing through their trunk rather than their mouth, they aren\u2019t quite able to achieve this temperature relief by simply panting.\nThe trunk does however play an important role in regulating the overall temperature of elephants. This is because the trunk is the physical adaptation that\u2019s used for dusting and spraying \u2013 two of the behaviours that help Asian elephants keep themselves cool.\nWhat behavioural adaptations allow Asian elephants to cool themselves down?\n1) Elephants are crepuscular\nAsian elephants are crepuscular animals, meaning they are most active around dusk and dawn, when the temperatures are usually much cooler. During these \u201cactive\u201d hours, Asian elephants will usually spend their time foraging for food, moving around and socialising.\n2) Dusting\nDusting is the act of elephants scraping the ground to collect sand, soil or dust, curling their trunk around it and then throwing it onto their body.\nAccording to Sophie\u2019s research, Asian elephants dust at temperatures above 13 degrees celsius, with the frequency of dusting increasing as the temperature increases.\nAlthough this is a behavioural cooling adaptation that\u2019s used by elephants during the warmer hours, dusting could have some social meaning too.\n3) Mudding\nSimilar to dusting, mudding involves the elephant covering its skin with mud, either by rolling in a pool of wet mud or using its trunk to spray the body with mud.\nThis helps these majestic mammals to regulate their body temperature but may also hold other functions such as:\nprotection from insects and parasites\ncreating a UV-barrier to reduce the amount of energy absorbed into the elephant\u2019s skin.\n4) Spraying\nSimilar to both dusting and mudding, elephants also use spraying as a way of cooling themselves down throughout the day.\nThey will often find bodies of water such as a river or lake, collect the water in their trunks and, as the name suggests, spray it all over their bodies. Since the temperature of the water is a lot lower than the water in their cells, it speeds up the process of cooling.\nWhy is data collection important?\nAfter analysing and comparing her data with GVI\u2019s existing data on the cooling behaviours of the Asian elephants, Sophie was able to accept her hypothesis and conclude that these Asian elephants do in fact display more cooling and drinking behaviours in the afternoon, compared to the morning.\nWithout the monitoring, data collection and research project\u2019s like Sophie\u2019s, we wouldn\u2019t know these Asian elephant facts that help us to better understand the needs of the species.\nAnd in turn, without this knowledge, we wouldn\u2019t be able to effectively conserve and spread valuable information about these magnificent land mammals to members of the public.\nFurther reading: Four reasons why the environment needs elephants\nGVI\u2019s elephant conservation internships give you an opportunity to work closely with an elephant herd, traditional elephant-keepers and the local community in an effort to promote sustainable eco-tourism.\nSo, if you\u2019re keen to make an impact and develop your own research project to increase our access to Asian elephant facts, sign up to our Conservation Internship with Elephants in Thailand today."}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephants | WWF", "url": "https://wwf.panda.org/discover/knowledge_hub/endangered_species/elephants/", "text": "Elephant populations\nInstantly recognised around the world thanks to their trunks and tusks, elephants are the world's largest land animals. African elephant males are the biggest of the bunch, weighing in at up to 6 tonnes, while smaller Asian elephants can still tip the scales at 5 tonnes.Female elephants are social animals, living in herds with their relatives. Males usually live alone but sometimes form small groups with other males. All elephants need a lot of space, sometimes roaming over incredible areas to find enough food and water to sustain them.But their habitats are shrinking. African elephant habitat has declined by over 50% since 1979, while Asian elephants are now restricted to just 15% of their original range.Add in growing human-wildlife conflict and an upsurge in ivory poaching in recent years and it's easy to see why elephants are under threat.While some populations of African elephant are secure and expanding, primarily in southern Africa, numbers are continuing to fall in other areas, particularly in central Africa and parts of East Africa. With an estimated 415,000 elephants left on the continent, the species is regarded as vulnerable, although certain populations are being poached towards extinction. Asian elephant numbers have dropped by at least 50% over the last three generations, and they\u2019re still in decline today. With only 40,000-50,000 left in the wild, the species is classified as endangered.And it is critical to conserve both African and Asian elephants since they play such a vital role in their ecosystems as well as contributing towards tourism and community incomes in many areas.So by helping protect elephants, we\u2019re helping conserve their habitat, supporting local communities, and making sure natural resources are available for generations to come."}

This makes it easier to recognize and study them from a scientific standpoint and allows us to understand them much more. Today we'll look at the behavior of wild elephants.\nElephants that live in their natural habitat have the ability to fully develop their ethological behavior. By observing them, we can recognize numerous attitudes that are representative of this species in nature. Below, we\u2019ll share some interesting facts about the behavior of wild elephants.\nInteresting facts about the behavior of wild elephants\nAnti-predator behavior\nGiven their gregarious size and nature, elephants\u2019 matriarchal societies don\u2019t tend to fall prey to predators. However, having said that, their young can sometimes be quite vulnerable.\nJust like hoofed animals, newborn elephants are able to walk quite quickly. This trait allows them to keep up with the rest of the herd. Just the same, young elephants are vulnerable to predators\u2019 attacks, especially when they stray from the group.\nAdult elephants tend to deal with threats by dissuading the threatening predator, going after it as a group until it runs away. However, they aren\u2019t often alert to all dangers, meaning that predators can sometimes catch them off guard. Healthy adult males are very intimidating, and their mere presence tends to frighten off any predator. This is especially interesting considering that elephants are a peaceful species most of the time. Just like their young, wild elephants that are sick or injured are more susceptible to falling behind and suffering attacks. Elephants\u2019 social behavior includes helping the weakest members of the heard.\nWe can affirm then that the pressure of predators\u2013with the exception of hunting by humans\u2013is not a decisive factor in the control of wild elephant populations.\nForaging or finding food\nWe find elephants living in a variety of habitats, which means that their diets are very diverse. Foraging includes everything from grass to fruits, bark, roots, leaves, and branches. The combination of their trunk, their powerful tongue, and an incredibly strong body allow elephants to feed off small plants as well as trees.\nFactors that influence foraging\nAge : The ability to enjoy such a varied diet becomes more and more limited as wild elephants advance in age. Baby elephants, at first, get their nourishment exclusively from their mother\u2019s milk. But little by little, they start experimenting with other foods while still maintaining lactation, which lasts until the age of 2.\n: The ability to enjoy such a varied diet becomes more and more limited as wild elephants advance in age. Baby elephants, at first, get their nourishment exclusively from their mother\u2019s milk. But little by little, they start experimenting with other foods while still maintaining lactation, which lasts until the age of 2. Sex: Among elephants, there exists a sexual dimorphism that favors males. We can observe this particularly when it comes to the possibilities of finding food.\nStudies show that groups of male wild elephants are much less selective in their search for food than females. Males tend to prioritize quantity while females are more inclined to look for quality food sources. This tendency may have to do with improving the quality of the milk they produce for their young.\nThe reproductive behavior of wild elephants\nBoth males and females mate with more than one partner when in heat. On the other hand, females tend to have only one baby per pregnancy\nThis system of multiple mating partners is known as polygamy.\nFemale elephants offer shelter for their young during the first 10 to 15 years of life. In other words, until they reach sexual maturity in the case of females, and until the period of dispersion in the case of males. In other words, until they reach sexual maturity in the case of females, and until the period of dispersion in the case of males.\nWhen it comes to courting, male elephants don\u2019t necessarily have to be in musth. However, studies show that they are more reproductively dominant than those who aren\u2019t. Musth is a phase during which male elephants (or \u201cbulls\u201d) display a more haughty and aggressive attitude. They hold their heads higher, stretch their ears, and puff their chests.\nPlayful behavior in wild elephants\nPlay among animals has no vital function, but it serves to prepare individuals for unexpected or stressful situations. Although young elephants have been observed carrying branches, running around, and chasing small animals, experts actually know very little about the playful behaviors of this species.\nSource: http://bebesdelreinoanimal.blogspot.com\nThe only thing experts do know is that males have a much more aggressive way of playing. They tend to initiate false fights with other male individuals of the same age, including males from other family groups. Females, on the other hand, have more peaceful encounters, usually with younger females.\nIt might interest you..."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "African Elephant | The Maryland Zoo", "url": "https://www.marylandzoo.org/animal/african-elephant/", "text": "Overview \u201cWhere I live\u201d There are two subspecies of African elephant: the savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis). The savanna elephant is found in eastern and southern Africa, living in varied habitat including marsh, savanna, woodlands, and semi-desert. All four elephants at the Maryland Zoo are African elephants of the savanna type. In March 2007, the Zoo celebrated the first elephant birth in its 132-year history. \u201cSamson,\u201d a male calf, was born to \u201cFelix,\u201d one of 2 adult females in the Zoo\u2019s herd. \u201cAnna\u201d is the other adult female, and \u201cTuffy\u201d is the adult bull. You can see the elephants on exhibit in the Zoo\u2019s African Journey area. \u201cHow I Live There\u201d Elephants are family-oriented animals with complex social lives. Related females live together for life in herds and raise offspring together. All members of a herd defer to one leader, the oldest and wisest female in the family group, known as the matriarch. She leads the others to water and food, decides when to sleep and when to move, responds first to threats, and basically takes charge in every conceivable situation. As male elephants reach adolescence, they strike out on a different path from their female relatives. They leave their birth herds. Young males often seek out other males their age and form close bonds. Younger males also may associate with older males in loose groups known as bachelor herds. While the social lives of both male and female elephants remain mysterious in many ways, and while there are still many questions to be answered, it appears that male elephants learn and practice how to \u201cbe male\u201d while in the company of other males in bachelor herds. Adult male elephants also are inclined instinctively to spend much of their time alone. This is especially true when a male elephant enters musth, a period of heightened aggression that paves the way for asserting dominance and competing successfully for females. All male elephants are in constant search of mates, but only those that assert their dominance over other males will win the right to breed. Elephants require a tremendous amount of food to maintain their massive bodies. In a single day, one elephant may eat 300 pounds of vegetation, including grasses, roots, bark, leaves, and fruit, and drink 30 to 50 gallons of water. In order to find this much food and water, wild elephants are almost always on the move. Elephants can communicate with each other over long distances through sound, including low-frequency infrasound that we can\u2019t hear. Standing up close to an elephant making an infrasonic call, you might hear or feel a low rumble. Another elephant would be able to hear that infrasonic call up to 12 miles away! Elephants also communicate through touch, sight, smell, and chemical processing. Body language is highly developed in elephants. Their sense of smell is as exceptional as their sense of hearing, and they also exhibit long-term memory. They are extremely social animals that protect their weakest, help their injured, and seem to mourn their dead. \u201cMaking My Mark\u201d Elephants affect their environment perhaps more than any other creature on earth. Their size, strength, and food needs make this inevitable. They can completely change a landscape just by feeding. They strip bark and leaves from trees and bushes, pull trees straight out of the ground, trample underbrush, dig for roots, dig holes in dry riverbeds to reach water, and spread plant seeds over many miles with dung deposits. There can be no mistaking when an elephant herd has passed through an area. Because of their tremendous environmental impact, elephants also greatly influence the survival and adaptive strategies of many other plant and animal species sharing the same ecosystem. \u201cWhat Eats Me\u201d Given their tremendous size and strength, and because they gather in groups, elephants have few predators to worry about. Lions, hyenas, and crocodiles may attempt to prey on young or sick elephants. However, elephants are often successful at fending off predators, protecting their young, and defending sick or injured herd mates. For example, when a matriarch detects a nearby predator, she will herd offspring together and all other adult females in the group will form an outward facing circle around them, providing many layers of protection from the would-be attacker. Elephants are most vulnerable to, and threatened by, humans. Demand for elephant tusks \u2013 the main source of commercial ivory \u2013 has led to aggressive poaching that has decimated elephant populations across Africa. Elephants may also fall victim to farmers defending their crops or local residents fearful of interactions with elephants. Although it is illegal to kill wild African elephants, it has proven extremely difficult to eradicate poaching and other elephant killings. Raising Young Female elephants reach sexual maturity at about age 10 but may not mate for several more years. When females come into estrus, they attract breeding bulls. Bulls of the highest rank will gain access to females and breed. After an exceptionally long pregnancy of about 22 months, a female will give birth to usually one calf, and very rarely to twins. She will nurse her offspring for about 4 years, usually until she gives birth again, but she will care for each offspring for many years more. Baby and juvenile elephants in a herd have the benefit of multiple caregivers, as all female relatives share in raising the young. In particular, young females take on the role of allomother, which is comparable to babysitter. They keep watch over the youngest elephants, help them, comfort them, play with them, and gain mothering experience all the while. Research has shown that elephant family groups with few or no allomothers suffer higher infant mortality than those with allomothers. Conservation African elephants are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN, the world\u2019s leading conservation organization. Conservation issues affecting African elephants are complicated. Despite an international ban on ivory trade passed in 1989, poaching remains a significant threat. Competition with humans for limited space and resources is an equally significant threat. African elephants once ranged freely from south of the Sahara Desert to northern South Africa. Today, they are mostly confined to parks and reserves. As a result, their natural habitats are fragmented andthere can end up being too many elephants in too little space, yet those that range outside of protected borders are quite likely to come into conflict with people or to be killed by poachers. In order to insure that African elephants continue to walk the earth for many generations to come, successful long-term resolution to human-elephant competition and conflict must be achieved. The Story Continues Taxonomy\nTaxonomy Kingdom: Animalia\nAnimalia Phylum: Chordata\nChordata Subphylum: Vertebrata\nVertebrata Class: Mammalia\nMammalia Order: Proboscidea\nProboscidea Family: Elephantidae\nElephantidae Genera: Loxodonta\nLoxodonta Species: africana The Story Continues Skin\nSkin Elephants are known as pachyderms along with hippos and rhinos. The name is derived from the Latin words for \u201cthick\u201d (\u201cpachy\u201d) and \u201cskin\u201d (\u201cderm\u201d) and means, quite literally, \u201cthick-skin.\u201d Yet although the skin is almost one to two inches thick in some areas, it is less than one millimeter thick in others. One such area is behind the ears where large amounts of blood vessels are found close to the skin surface. Warm blood passing through these blood vessels is cooled before recirculating throughout the body. The skin also helps to disperse an elephant\u2019s body heat, cooling the animal. (Elephants lack sweat glands.) Elephants have evolved many folds in their skin layers, giving them their \u201cbaggy\u201d and wrinkled appearance. The folds serve an important purpose by increasing the overall surface area of the skin, which provides more space to allow for the dispersion of body heat. The wrinkles also are the main reason elephants will mud bathe. The initial cooling of the wet mud helps the elephant cool down instantly. Moisture trapped in all of the wrinkles continues to cool the elephant even after it leaves the mud source. The mud also protects the elephant\u2019s skin from insects, sun, and moisture loss. The Story Continues Food\nFood Elephants are herbivores, which means that they only eat plant material. African elephants eat a huge variety of plant material including grasses, bark, twigs, roots, leaves, fruits, and vegetables. They are even capable of eating the wooden trunks of trees and logs by chipping off pieces with their tusks or by simply chewing on them with their huge grinding teeth. Elephants maintain their large size by ingesting an enormous amount of food. Elephants have highly inefficient digestive systems; nearly 60% of the food they eat goes undigested. The trunk, tusks, and teeth are highly adapted to help them acquire and process the large amounts of food they need. The Story Continues Trunk\nTrunk The trunk is a modification of the upper lip and the nose combined. At the end of the trunk are two fingerlike projections that are used to pinch and grip both small and large food items and objects. The trunk is composed of over 100,000 individual muscles that make it a very strong appendage. It is an especially amazing adaptation when you consider that the entire human body has less than 800 individual muscles total and that so far, there is no other appendage in the entire animal world known to be as specialized as an elephant\u2019s trunk. An elephant uses its trunk to suck up water and blow the water into its mouth or onto its body for bathing and cooling purposes. However, an elephant cannot drink water through its trunk. In addition to food gathering, drinking, and bathing, the trunk is used for social interactions among herd mates. Elephants make regular contact with one another using their trunks. Such social interactions may include greeting, caressing, and demonstrations of dominance or submission through subtle positioning of the trunk and different trunk postures. The trunk can also act as a resonating tube, producing the classic sounds of an elephant trumpet or the sounds of a subtle, reverberating communication rumble. Perhaps one of the most interesting and yet lesser known facts about an elephant\u2019s trunk is that it is able to detect and distinguish smells several hundred times better than any dog on the planet! Smell is one of an elephant\u2019s greatest senses and it is all located in the trunk. The Story Continues Tusks\nTusks An elephant\u2019s tusks are modified teeth. They are an elongation of the second incisors and continue to grow throughout the life of the elephant. Tusks are used for digging, debarking trees, moving objects, making contact with one another, intimidation in dominance displays and for general tools in elephant life. Males use their tusks when sparring with each other and establishing dominance. Tusks are made of ivory, which is an incredibly dense form of bone. It forms in a cross thatch pattern, making it very hard. There continues to be great demand for ivory tusks because of their unique properties and inherent beauty. Because they will fetch a high price, poachers continue to illegally kill elephants for their tusks. This is a major factor in the decline of wild elephant populations worldwide. The Story Continues Teeth\nTeeth An elephant has only four teeth in its mouth. They are considered molars and are found in each section of the jaw, two on each side of the mouth. One tooth can be the size of a brick and has a large surface area of ridges specifically adapted for grinding the large volume of plant material that elephants eat every day. The teeth get worn down with all the grinding and chewing of fibrous plant material. To compensate, elephants have evolved replaceable teeth! An elephant has six sets of teeth in its lifetime. Replacement teeth come in horizontally rather than vertically like ours. The older tooth is pushed forward by the newer tooth and eventually falls out in pieces. The Story Continues Communication\nCommunication Elephants are considered one of the most intelligent of all land animals. They have the largest brain of any mammal. The temporal lobes of the elephant\u2019s brain, which function in recognition, storage, and retrieval of information related to sight, touch, smell, and hearing, are especially large and enormously complex. Relative to brain size, these temporal lobes appear to be larger, more convoluted, and denser than those of all other animals except humans. Based on scientific evidence, elephants seem to remember individuals, places, and learned skills for years. It really is true that \u201can elephant never forgets.\u201d Elephants have a highly developed system of communication through sounds. Elephants produce a broad range of sounds from very low frequency, inaudible infrasound to soft rumbles, trumpets, snorts, roars, and even growls. The low frequency, or infrasound, allows elephants to communicate across miles. It is below the range of sound that the human ear can detect. Elephants detect the low vibrations through their ears, feet, and trunk tip. Special adaptations in each of these parts of the body pick up and transmit sounds to the hearing centers of the brain. Elephants also possess one of the most well-developed senses of smell in the animal kingdom. This keen sense of smell is used not only to locate food and water sources but also for communication. Elephants detect and process many chemical signals in a wide variety of smells throughout their environment. Sources of odors used in chemical communication between elephants include urine, feces, saliva, and secretions from the temporal gland. Elephants are family-oriented. Herds are made up of adult female groups and their offspring. Older, more experienced females lead elephant families. They are called dominant females or matriarchs of the herd. Each herd consists of mostly related females (mothers, aunts, grandmothers, and cousins) and their calves, including young male offspring and occasionally non-related individuals. Herd sizes range from 20 to 100 individuals. Female family members stay together for life.Young males entering adolescence leave their family groups to join bachelor herds, but at times lead a solitary life due to a natural condition called \u201cmusth\u201d. Musth in adult bull elephants is characterized by a significant increase in reproductive hormones (specifically testosterone) that results in strong changes in behavior. Bachelor herds are important for teaching young males how to become strong, adult bulls. Adult bulls associate with female herds for breeding purposes only. One of the most important functions of the female herd is to raise calves. A female usually has her first calf while in her teens. A male becomes reproductively mature on average at age 13 but usually won\u2019t breed with females until his late 20s when he is large and strong enough to compete with other bulls for the opportunity. Once a female is pregnant, gestation lasts about 22 months. She will give birth to a calf that weighs 150 to 300 pounds and stands two to three feet tall. At birth, a calf is almost helpless and does not have full use of its trunk yet, but will quickly get to its feet and stand on its own. The new calf begins nursing within a few hours of standing and quickly gains the strength and coordination needed to keep pace with its mother as she moves around in search of food. Elephants have a very long adolescence, with a developmental rate similar to humans, and a long life expectancy. The Story Continues Social Structure"}

They form small groups of 8 individuals on average, which are dominated by females. However, on riverbanks and other open feeding areas, these animals can be seen in larger groups. Groups of this species are family units, typically consisting of mothers, daughters, sisters and immature males (occasionally - an adult male). Mature males tend to live solitarily or form temporary bull herds. Family units occasionally gather together. This association is highly beneficial for them, helping keep genetic diversity, which, in turn, is vital for their further evolution and survival. These active elephants are known to wander throughout their habitat, travelling up to 25 - 30 miles a day. Borneo elephants are migratory animals. Seasonal migration helps the elephants keep themselves in good physical shape. In addition, when travelling, Borneo elephants often cross rivers and prove themselves to be excellent swimmers."}

A government enforced regulation has allowed around 400 shops to continue selling \"legal\" ivory that was procured before 1989 until those stocks ran out. The report calculated that at the predicted sale rate, stocks should have run out by 2004. Though a recent survey found that 90% of ivory purchases in Hong Kong were made by mainland Chinese tourists, ivory stocks have remained relatively stable (by weight) up until 2014. It is thought that these shops have been replacing their \"legal\" ivory with illegal stocks bought on the black market. A WildAid inquiry into the ivory licence of 94 of these shops found that all but 1 had tampered with their licence, hiding or altering both the expiry dates as well as the maximum quantity of ivory they were allowed to stock. These shopkeepers are not malicious or wildlife haters -- the only reason that they go through the black market to increase their stock is because the demand for ivory products still exist. In an act of defiance, the Obama Administration destroyed the US reserve of elephant tusks destroying 5.4 tonnes of \"blood-ivory\", with an estimated market value of USD $11.34 million, to send a message to the world that they have absolutely no demand. The destruction of ivory is a common practice by conservationists and authorities in Eastern Africa, Hong Kong and the world around."}

The animals are beaten into submission when young and then forced to let travelers take rides on their backs and to perform confusing and sometimes painful tricks, including walking on tightropes, balancing on two legs on a small drum, painting pictures, and dancing. But if tourists knew what elephants endured for their vacation photos, they would hit \u201cdelete\u201d\u2014on both the pictures and the industry.\n1. When they\u2019re babies, elephants are taken from their mothers and families in the wild. Because they have a high sale value, not only are babies illegally captured, their protective mothers are also often killed as they try to save them.\n2. \u201cTraining\u201d begins immediately. The babies are tied down and beaten with bullhooks and other instruments designed to inflict pain until their spirits are broken and they\u2019re willing to obey their \u201ctrainers\u201d to avoid pain.\n3. Researchers have found that elephants who are subjected to this \u201cbreaking\u201d or \u201ccrush\u201d process often develop post-traumatic stress disorder.\n4. Elephants in nature live in matriarchal herds in which they forage for fresh vegetation, play, bathe in rivers, and travel many miles a day. Held in captivity, they can move only in small circles in an arena or along a short path while carrying humans on their backs, even on the hottest days.\n\u00a9 iStock.com/martinhosmart\n5. When they aren\u2019t working, the animals are usually kept in sheds or shacks\u2014often with concrete floors that damage their legs\u2014and they\u2019re bound by chains that can be so tight they can barely move.\n6. Captive elephants are routinely denied nutritious food, adequate water, and needed veterinary care, especially for their feet.\n7. The lack of exercise and long hours spent standing on hard surfaces are major contributors to serious foot problems, arthritis, and back injuries. Most captive elephants die decades short of their normal lifespan.\n8. According to World Animal Protection, \u201cBetween 2010 and 2016 in Thailand alone, 17 fatalities and 21 serious injuries to people by captive elephants were reported in the media. Unreported incidences involving local elephant keepers are likely to make this figure much higher.\u201d\n9. Because public awareness of cruelty to captive elephants has increased, many attractions are trying to dupe tourists by adding words such as \u201csanctuary,\u201d \u201crescue center,\u201d \u201crefuge,\u201d and \u201cretirement facility\u201d to their names. But the abusive training methods and deprivation are often the same and make the elephants follow the trainers\u2019 commands to let people ride, feed, touch, or bathe them.\nIn a survey of 13,000 people, one of the primary reasons travelers gave for wanting to patronize elephant rides and shows was \u201clove of animals.\u201d But anyone who shares any concern for the dwindling elephant population or captive elephant abuse should work to end these tourist attractions\u2014not fund them.\nFollowing a series of meetings with PETA, the world\u2019s largest travel site, TripAdvisor, announced that it would end all ticket sales to elephant encounters as part of a broad-sweeping policy change that also prohibits sales for \u201cswim with dolphins\u201d programs and tiger encounters.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Rare Video Shows Elephants 'Mourning' Matriarch's Death - Animals", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/elephants-mourning-video-animal-grief", "text": "It has become rare for wild African elephants to live to old age, thanks to their brutal slaughter by ivory poachers. Rarer still is the chance for scientists to observe elephants as they cope with the death of their family leader.\nShifra Goldenberg, a Colorado State University doctoral student, is among the lucky few. She watched the final days as Queen Victoria, one of the last surviving old matriarchs in the Samburu National Reserve in northern Kenya, died of natural causes in 2013, with her family members close by. When Goldenberg returned to the carcass a few weeks later, she encountered elephants from three separate families inspecting the bones. Were they paying respect?\nGoldenberg\u2019s 15-minute video of the elephants\u2019 investigation, made available exclusively to National Geographic for the first time, is an important new addition to the growing body of research about the complexity of elephant thought and perception and their responses to death. The video not only captures an important ritual of elephant behavior, but reveals new insights about the strength of social bonds.\nAlthough the three families were not related to Victoria, they knew her, Goldenberg says, and clearly showed a connection to her by lingering over her carcass.\n\u201cWhat the family was doing was interesting, but what her non-relatives were doing is also important,\u201d Goldenberg says. \u201cYou see their investigation of the body. You see calves walking past and smelling it. It is amazing to see that level of fascination. Her family was distressed that she wasn\u2019t getting up. But the larger population also was interested in her death.\u201d\nRespect for the Dead?\nElephants have long been regarded for their ability, along with dolphins and chimpanzees, among others, to express emotion, even empathy. But their response to death remains a mystery. Do they have the human characteristic of grief? The examples are mounting, though the science remains incomplete.\nOther animals do not show great interest in the bodies of their dead. African elephants do. They have scattered their family members\u2019 bones. They have been known to raise a foot over an elephant body. The relatives of Eleanor, another matriarch at the Samburu Reserve, pulled and pushed her carcass for nearly a week after she died in 2003. Some rocked back and forth, while others stood silently.\nElephants also distinguish between elephant remains and other large mammals. In tests to measure their interest, they chose the skull of an elephant over the skulls of a buffalo and rhinoceros.\nGeorge Wittemyer, a Colorado State University conservation biologist who has been studying elephants at the Samburu Reserve since 1997, says elephants have \u201ca fascination with death\u201d that is difficult to interpret.\n\u201cElephants have respect for their dead, but their interaction with their dead is not something we fully understand,\u201d says Wittemyer, who also heads Save the Elephants\u2019 scientific board.\n\u201cEvery time it happens, it\u2019s not the same, but it is striking behavior\u2014not based on survival or necessity, but based on some sort of emotion,\" he says. \"The fact that they interact and have behavioral interactions with their dead in a form that is not explainable in any simple, evolutionary context speaks to the deeper emotional lives of elephants that we can\u2019t easily study.\u201d\nBut he stops short of diagnosing grief. To know that is to know what animals are thinking.\nBarbara King, emeritus professor of anthropology at William & Mary in Virginia and author of How Animals Grieve, disagrees.\n\u201cI have no doubt that elephants grieve,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know these are smart and emotional creatures. We don\u2019t need to know what they are thinking. With grief, we have to know that the survivor\u2019s behavior is significantly altered from normal baseline, such as altered social withdrawal, feeding, sleeping, body posture that is sustained in some way.\u201d\nIn the three years since her book was published, King says, reports of animal grief, based on altered behavior, are accelerating and a database is gaining heft. She adds: \u201cIt\u2019s also very important to know when there isn\u2019t grief.\u201d\nA Peaceful Death, With Family\nVictoria headed an elephant group known on the Samburu Reserve as the Royal family, a group of about 20 elephants all named after kings, queens, and other royalty around the world. The Royals is one of the largest and most dominant families in the reserve, with four large breeding females, including Victoria\u2019s sisters, Anastasia and Cleopatra, now the new de-facto heads of the family.\nVictoria was born in 1958, five years before Kenyan independence. When she died on June 12, 2013, at age 55, the reserve had been under siege for several years from poachers targeting older matriarchs, and enduring a severe drought that killed an additional number of older elephants, leaving a much younger elephant population today.\n\u201cFamilies like the Royals remind us of what the society should look like,\u201d Goldenberg says. \u201cWhile it saddened us to see her die, dying naturally on a quiet afternoon by the river, surrounded by her family was a far more peaceful way to go than what other elephants have been experiencing across Africa.\u201d\nGoldenberg saw Victoria the day before she died when the family stopped for water in the heat of the day in a favorite spot along the banks of the Ewaso Ngiro River.\n\u201cShe looked stressed, but she was feeding and seemed relatively normal,\u201d she says. \u201cHer temporal glands behind the eyes were streaming, which they do when elephants are emotionally elevated.\u201d\nThe next day, when Goldenberg returned, Victoria lay in the bushes near the river, and when the family moved away from the river bank, she did not get up. Her daughter Noor, 10, lingered before rejoining the group. Victoria\u2019s son Malasso, 13, poked her with his tusks, possibly in an effort to help raise her onto her feet. The day after Victoria died, other family members, including Malasso and Margaret, an adult female, visited her body.\nPredators moved in immediately, and by the time Goldenberg returned, the carcass had been worked over. Still, the other elephant families were undeterred from their inspection of the bones.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say they were mourning,\u201d she says. \u201cThat would be to know what they are thinking. But there is clear interest there and they are taking it in. There is something going on.\u201d\nFollow Laura Parker on Twitter."}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephant Memory - Elephant Memory | HowStuffWorks", "url": "https://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/elephant-memory1.htm", "text": "\" \" There's more going on up there than meets the eye. Matthias Clamer/ Getty Images\nScientists haven't been able to measure elephants' intelligence precisely. Nevertheless, for decades, experts have observed the pachyderms' behavior and concluded that they rank among the smartest in the animal kingdom. That said, the theory of elephants never forgetting is an exaggeration, but doesn't stray terribly far from the truth.\nElephants have the largest brains by mass of all mammals, weighing in at a hefty 10.5 pounds (4.7 kilograms) for an adult [source: Shoshani et al]. While we can't judge how effectively a brain works based solely on its size, it can offer a decent approximation and give us a hint as to the power of elephant memory. One conventional way of estimating an animal's intelligence is examining the encephalization quotient (EQ). The EQ compares the actual size of an animal's brain against the size scientists would project its brain to be based on body weight. To better understand this measurement, think of an apple and an avocado. Both fruits are relatively the same size, but an apple has tiny seeds, while an avocado's seed resembles a golf ball.\nAdvertisement\nThe logic follows that the smaller the ratio of brain to body mass (think of the apple example), the dumber the animal and vice versa. For instance, people have an average EQ above seven, while pigs have an EQ of around .27 [source: Shoshani et al].\nElephants score relatively high on this scale, coming in at a cross-species average of 1.88 [source: Shoshani et al]. For comparison, chimpanzees have an EQ of 2.5. Female elephants, the leaders of the herds, often have greater EQs than males. This is probably linked to the matriarchal social structure of elephant herds. Studies have also found that the elder female elephants exhibit signs of a superior memory, alerting the herd if a familiar danger arises or an old feeding site is recognized [source: Briggs].\nThe olfactory, or smell-related, region of an elephant's brain is extremely developed in relation to its other senses. Elephants can distinguish between the urine scents of up to 30 female relatives, even if they've been separated for years [source: Briggs]. This trait helps elephants stay together when traveling in large herds, with the urine serving as a bread crumb trail for the nose -- or trunk in this case.\nWhile elephants' utilitarian memories help them retain essential survival information, they also allow these animals to recognize the past. Elephants' show signs of grief over dead relatives such as gently touching the corpses with their feet and caressing the bodies with their trunks [source: Shoshani et al].

With their characteristic long noses, or trunks; large, floppy ears; and wide, thick legs, there is no other animal with a similar physique.\nMost experts recognize two species of elephant: the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and the African elephant (Loxodonta africana), who live on separate continents and have many unique features. There are several subspecies that belong to one or the other of these two main species, though experts argue over how many subspecies there are and whether or not they constitute separate species, according to the San Diego Zoo.\nAfrican and Asian elephants\nAfrican elephants live in sub-Saharan Africa, the rainforests of Central and West Africa and the Sahel desert in Mali, according to National Geographic. Asian elephants live in Nepal, India and Southeast Asia in scrub forests and rainforests. [Elephant Images: The Biggest Beasts on Land]\nAfrican elephants are the larger of the two species. They grow to between 8.2 and 13 feet (2.5 and 4 meters) tall at the shoulder and weigh 5,000 to 14,000 lbs. (2,268 to 6,350 kilograms), according to National Geographic (opens in new tab). Asian elephants are just a little smaller, growing to between 6.6 and 9.8 feet (2 and 3 m) tall at the shoulder and weighing between 4,500 and 11,000 lbs. (2,041 and 4,990 kg). In the wild, African elephants can live up to 70 years, and Asian elephants up to 60 years.\nAfrican and Asian elephants also have a few different physical features.\nThe ears of African elephant are larger and resemble the shape of the African continent, while Asian elephants have smaller, rounder ears, according to the San Diego Zoo.\nBoth male and female African elephants have large tusks and two \"fingers\" on the end of their trunks to help them pick items up. Asian elephants have a single \"finger\" on the end of their trucks. But typically, only male Asian elephants will grow large tusks, while the females and a few males have much smaller tusks called tushes that don't always grow outside the mouth.\nTusks are large, deeply rooted teeth that evolved to assist the elephant in digging, lifting, gathering food, and defense while also protecting the trunk, according to World Wildlife Fund. In the same way that humans tend to be right-handed or left-handed, elephants can be right-tusked or left-tusked. Their dominant tusk is easy to identify, because it will be more worn down than the less dominant tusk, according to the World Wildlife Fund.\nBoth species eat all types of vegetation, including a variety of grasses, fruits, leaves, bark and roots. They spend about about 16 hours eating, consuming anywhere from 165 to 330 lbs. (75 to 150 kg) of food per day, according to the San Diego Zoo.\nAn African elephant with an impressive set of tusks. (Image credit: Shutterstock)\nElephant life\nGroups of elephants, or herds, follow a matriarchal structure with the eldest female in charge. Herds are composed of primarily female family members and young calves, according to the San Diego Zoo, and include 6 to 20 members depending on the food supply. When the family gets too large, herds often split into smaller groups that stay within the same area.\nThe matriarch relies on her experience and memory to recall where the best spots for food, water are, and where to find protection from the elements. The matriarch is also responsible for teaching the younger members of her family how to socialize with other elephants.\nElephants are very social and can communicate with one another and identify other elephants from distances of up to 2 miles using rumbling, low-pitched sounds that fall below the audible range of humans, according to the National Zoo.\nElephants readily show good manners to members within its herd and other herds, according to the San Diego Zoo. For example, they use their trunks to greet one another, either by holding it out high or by inserting the end of their trunk into another elephant's mouth.\nElephants also pay close attention to the well-being of all the members of their herd, and will do what they can to take care of and protect weak or injured members.\nThey're considered an extremely intelligent species, and have been observed showing advanced problem-solving skills and demonstrating empathy, mourning and self-awareness, according to an article in Scientific American.\nAfrican elephants (Loxodonta africana) at a waterhole in the Greater Kruger National Park in South Africa. (Image credit: Mark Wright/University of Hawaii M\u0101noa)\nNext generation\nMale and female elephants become sexually mature between 8 and 13 years of age. Male elephants will leave their herd around this time, as long as they're able to find their own food and protect themselves, according to the Smithsonian National Zoo. Adult males either live on their own or in small bachelor herds.\nFemales may not have their first calf until their middle teen years, while males may not father a calf until they are in their 30s, when they are large and strong enough to compete with other males, according to the National Zoo.\nUsually, only a single calf is born following a 22-month pregnancy. A newborn calf weighs between 150 and 350 lbs. (68 and 158 kg) stands about 3 feet tall. Calves also tend to be hairy with long tails and very short trunks.\nElephant calves grow quickly, gaining 2 to 3 lbs. every day in their first year, according to the San Diego Zoo. By the time they are 2 or 3 years old, calves are ready to be weaned.\n(Image credit: Chintan Mehta/Shutterstock)\nClassification/Taxonomy\nAll elephants are mammals belonging to the elephantidae family. There are two subspecies of the African elephant: the savanna (or bush) elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis). However, forest elephants may in fact be a distinct species of elephant instead of a subspecies, according to Cornell University.\nThere are three subspecies of Asian elephant: the Indian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus), the Sri Lankan elephant (Elephas maximus maximus), and the Sumatran elephant (Elephas maximus sumatranus). Another possible subspecies is Elephas maximus borneensis (Borneo pygmy elephant). The World Wildlife Fund has determined that DNA evidence suggests that the Borneo pygmy elephant is genetically different from other Asian elephants.\nConservation status\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the Asian elephant as endangered. Though it is not known exactly how many Asian elephants remain, experts believe that the population is decreasing.\nThe African elephant is considered vulnerable, according to the IUCN, and the species' population is increasing. According to the African Wildlife Foundation, there are around 415,000 African elephants in the wild.\nThreats against the survival of both African and Asian elephants include poaching and habitat loss, according to World Wildlife Fund.\nAdditional resources:\nCheck out more interesting facts about African elephants on the Elephants for Africa website.\nLearn more about elephant conservation from the International Elephant Foundation.\nMeet the adorable baby elephants being cared for at Elephants Without Borders elephant orphanage in Botswana.\nThis article was updated on March 18, 2019, by Live Science Contributor Rachel Ross."}

Musth causes bull elephants to become sexually hyperactive and attempt to show their dominance over other male elephants.\nMore specifically, an elephant in musth shows some or all of these signs:\nFrequent urination, with a steady trickle down the back of their legs.\nStandoffs and fights with other bull elephants.\nDigging their tusks into the ground, to deal with the pain from their glands.\nMaking a rumbling noise through their mouth, known as \u2018musth rumble\u2018.\nTrying to mate with females \u2013 whether they are sexually active or not.\nRampaging around any local villages.\nMusth duration\nMale elephants don\u2019t experience musth until they are around 30 years old. For young male elephants, musth happens over the course of a few days or weeks, while musth in older males can last for months (know how long elephants live for?).\nThere are three stages of musth. For a typical mature elephant schedule is something like:\nPre-musth: 3 to 4 week Peak musth: 4 to 5 week Post-musth: 4-5 week\nIn their natural habitats, mature bull elephants tend to show these three stages properly. In domesticated or zoo environments musth is often very irregular in its appearance and length.\nThe biology behind musth\nMusth is generally associated with the elephant mating season, but it\u2019s a little more complex than that.\nBull elephants enter into musth each winter due to a number of physiological reasons. However, a female elephant\u2019s sexual activity is not linked with seasons, rather she is able to mate whenever her body gets heated. This means that females are often not able to mate whilst a male is in musth, or are able to mate whilst a male is not in musth.\nMusth depends on three key biological events. Let\u2019s look at them now:\n1. Testosterone surge\nWhen an elephant is about to enter musth, the testosterone levels inside its body rises significantly \u2013 up to 60 times its natural level. For some bull elephants, it reaches 140 times higher than normal.\nThe presence of such a high amount of sexual hormone inside the elephant\u2019s body heats it up from its usual 35.9 \u00b0C. It becomes hot and its behavior changes to become aggressive and unpredictable as a result of the hormonal upsurge.\n2. Temporin secretion\nOn each side of the male elephants\u2019 forehead is a gland called the temporal gland. It is from these glands that a bull elephant in musth secretes a thick tar-like chemical called temporin, which leads to an increase in their aggression.\n3. Swelling of the temporal glands\nDuring musth, the temporal glands swell in size, and its thought this causes acute pain to the elephant\u2019s eyes. To subdue this intense pain the bull elephant shows aggression towards all other animals near him. In simple words, the swelling of their glands makes a bull elephant mentally frustrated and physically agitated.\nFrequently asked questions about musth\nWhat is elephant musth?\nElephant musth is a term referring to a bull elephant\u2019s biological condition. In musth, an elephant starts to behave oddly and shows aggression towards male elephants and other animals. It lasts for up to three months. Other periods are non-musth.\nWhy do elephants go into musth?\nBull elephants go into musth for several reasons. The reasons are:\nRising testosterone levels\nTemporin (a kind of hormone) secretion\nSwelling of their temporal glands (between their eyes and ears)\nDo female elephants have musth?\nFemale elephants don\u2019t have musth in their lifecycle. Only males elephants over 30 years old go into musth \u2013 usually during winter \u2013 for several physiological reasons.\nHow do you know if an elephant is in musth?\nAn elephant in musth shows excessive aggression and behaves oddly, often indulging in fights with other bull elephants.\nPhysically they have secretions from their temporal glands between their eyes and ears, and often have continual trickles of urine down the backs of their legs. Sometimes, they are seen crying or digging the ground to subdue their physical pain.\nOrigins of the word \u2018musth\u2019\nUnusual word, isnt\u2019 it?! Musth comes from a Persian word with the same pronunciation \u2013 \u2018mast\u2019, which literally means drunk or inebriated.\nMore recent usage of musth refers to a state of enjoyment or pleasure. In the animal world, it is specifically applied to bull elephants, where it refers to the overexcited behaviour they exhibit during their musth period."}

Currently, they face habitat loss and degradation of their natural habitat due to forest clearing. In addition, they are now unable to follow their migratory routes as a result of human development. The Sri Lankan elephant is identified by patches of depigmentation, which are portions of skin without color, found on the ears, face, trunk and belly of the animal. This elephant is the largest and meanwhile the darkest of 4 sub-species of Asian elephant. This animal differs from the African elephant by smaller ears and more curved spine. As opposed to their African relatives, females of this species usually lack tusks. Females that do have tusks, grow very small ones that are almost invisible, seen only when the mouth is open. Males grow rather long tusks, which can be longer and heavier that these of the African elephants."}

Their groups consist of 2 - 8 individuals and are usually smaller than these of other elephants. Meanwhile, family units consist of 3 - 5 elephants on average, which are often female relatives: a female with her offspring or several females and their offspring. Reaching maturity, male calves leave the group, whereas females are philopatric, remaining in their family group. Groups of this species avoid each other, as opposed to these of the African savanna elephant. Males live under a size-based dominance hierarchy. They live alone and socialize only when mating. The most common form of communication in these elephants is low calls. These vocalizations are perceived by conspecifics through several kilometers of dense jungle. However, they are too low to be heard by human ear."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephant Shrew - Description, Habitat, Image, Diet, and Interesting Facts", "url": "https://animals.net/elephant-shrew/", "text": "Elephant shrews, sometimes known as \u201cjumping shrews,\u201d or \u201csengis,\u201d are small, rodent-like mammals. They get their traditional common name from the resemblance between their elongated nose (a \u201cproboscis\u201d) and the trunk of an elephant; as well as an incorrect assumption of a close relationship with the true shrews. There are 19 species of elephant shrews, and they are found across southern Africa.\nDescription of the Elephant Shrew\nElephant shrews are not rodents, but do resemble hunchbacked mice, or gerbils in their shape. They are also not true shrews but are more closely related to tenrecs, golden moles, and aardvarks. Their most noticeable feature is an elongated snout, which they can twist and turn when searching for invertebrate prey (insects, worms, and other creatures without spines). Their rear legs, which they use for hopping like rabbits, are considerably longer then their forelegs.\nElephant shrews have scaly, almost furless, tails under which is a scent gland they use for marking their territory. They have large, erect ears and many species have a pale circle around their relatively big eyes. Some of the larger elephant shrews are rather brightly colored, such as having an almost black body, but a ginger neck and head. The smaller elephant shrews tend to be brown or gray.\nSome species have a \u201cdermal shield\u201d of thickened skin on the rump. The skin there is three times thicker than the skin on the back, and provides protection against the bites of other elephant shrews.\nInteresting Facts About the Elephant Shrew\nBecause elephant shrews are unusual in that, unlike most small mammals, they are active during the day, they have several unusual adaptations related to escaping predators. These adaptations are further effected by the wide variety of habitats in which they are found.\nGreat Speed \u2013 They have been recorded to run at speeds of 18 mph (29 km/h)\n\u2013 They have been recorded to run at speeds of 18 mph (29 km/h) Great Leapers \u2013 When running, they make leaps of over 3 feet (1 meter)\n\u2013 When running, they make leaps of over 3 feet (1 meter) Warning Signals \u2013 Many species foot-drum or tail-slap the earth if approached by a predator\n\u2013 Many species foot-drum or tail-slap the earth if approached by a predator Scent Glands \u2013 They have scent glands at the base of the tail, in the genital and anal regions, on the soles of the feet, the chest, behind the ears, and the corners of the mouth\nHabitat of the Elephant Shrew\nElephant shrews are not particularly common anywhere but can be found in a wide range of habitats. These include deserts, semi-arid mountains, rocky outcrops, and thick forests.\nDistribution of the Elephant Shrew\nElephant shrews are only found in the wild in Africa. They live throughout the continent, except for western Africa, and the Sahara.\nDiet of the Elephant Shrew\nElephant shrews mainly eat invertebrates, including earthworms, spiders, insects, centipedes, and millipedes. Some species also eat green plant matter, seeds, and small fruits.\nElephant Shrew and Human Interaction\nIn some countries, such as Kenya, elephant shrews are trapped and eaten by humans. Their main threats are from deforestation, habitat loss, and habitat fragmentation due to agriculture and logging.\nThe gray-faced elephant shrew (Rhynchocyon udzungwensis) is the largest of the elephant shrews, and was only discovered in 2005. They were the first new elephant shrew species identified in more than 120 years. The population, estimated to be fewer than 100, is restricted to a single African mountain range.\nDomestication\nThe elephant shrew has not been domesticated, possibly because they mate for life, with just a single partner (monogamous).\nDoes the Elephant Shrew Make a Good Pet\nDue to their very shy nature and endangered conservation status, elephant shrews do not make good pets.\nElephant Shrew Care\nWhen kept in zoos, a tank of 20 x 32 in (0.5 x 0.8 m) is considered suitable for a single elephant shrew, but if they are kept as pairs for mating, as much room as possible should be provided to reduce aggression. A heat lamp should be provided in the tank.\nBehavior of the Elephant Shrew\nElephant shrews, unlike most small mammals, are diurnal (active during daylight), or crepuscular (some activity during both daylight and night-time), which means they are usually very well camouflaged, often wary, and have well-developed senses and escape behaviors. Several species make interconnecting pathways through the undergrowth in their territories. They use these either as high-speed escape routes, or patrol them when hunting for invertebrate food. Some species build leaf nests, whereas others create burrows, or use the burrows of other species. New nests are built every 1-3 days, and take approximately 2 hours to construct.\nElephant shrews are not very sociable: females ward off females, and males fight off other males. Although they sometimes live in pairs, it often appears the sole purpose of this association is for reproduction, as social behaviors are uncommon. In some species, the male and female have adjoining home territories of approximately 4 acres (1.7 hectares), and may even have separate nests.\nReproduction of the Elephant Shrew\nThe mating period for elephant shrews lasts for several days. After a pregnancy gestation period (the time the babies remain in the mother\u2019s body), varying from 45 to 60 days, females give birth to a litter of one to three young. She may have litters several times a year. The young are relatively well developed when they are born (precocial), and can run just a few hours later. However, they remain in the nest for several days before leaving for the first time. After about 14 days, the young begin to migrate and develop their own home territories. They become sexually active within 40 to 45 days. Reproduction is continuous at low latitudes, but seasonal at higher latitudes."}

Instead, elephants suck up a trunkful of water, curl the trunk to their mouths, and pour the water in.\nHabitat of the African Elephant\nAfrican bush elephants live in a number of different ecosystems. They can be found in flood plains, savannas, montane forests, woodlands, and more. The smaller African forest elephants inhabit semi-deciduous, moist rainforests.\nDistribution of the African Elephant\nAfrican elephants can be found scattered across sub-Saharan Africa. The bush elephants are found throughout central, eastern, and southern Africa. The forest elephants are found in the denser forests of the Congo basin and West Africa. Larger African bush elephant species cannot spread into these areas, as their large size makes it difficult to travel through dense forest.\nDiet of the African Elephant\nElephants are herbivores, and will eat a wide variety of vegetation. Some common food items include fruit, leaves, bark, grass, flowering plants, leaves, shrubs, and even small trees. African forest elephants feed more heavily on fruits, seeds, leaves, bark, and branches.\nThey use their prehensile trunks to pick leaves from branches, pull mouthfuls of grass, and rip entire branches from trees. A single elephant can consume over 900 lbs. of plants in a day. That\u2019s nearly half a ton!\nAfrican Elephant and Human Interaction\nHumans cause extreme African elephant population decline and fragmentation. Indirectly, land development and urbanization push elephants out of their habitat. Farming also reduces available natural foraging, and this leads to conflicts with farmers. Elephants can decimate crop production in just a few nights, and farmers will retaliate with attempts at killing the elephants.\nSadly, these conflicts aren\u2019t even the most pressing danger to African elephant survival. Illegal poaching and sale of ivory on the black market decimated elephant populations. In Tanzania alone, it is estimated that 60% of the elephant population was lost between 2009 and 2014. We humans are fighting back, by protecting the African elephants that are left, and battling the illegal trade of ivory.\nDomestication\nUnlike Asian elephants, which have been somewhat domesticated for use by native peoples, African elephants have not been domesticated in any way.\nDoes the African Elephant Make a Good Pet\nNot only is it illegal to own an African elephant as a pet, but it is also extremely dangerous and expensive! Such large animals are simply impractical to own as a pet.\nAfrican Elephant Care\nIn zoos, African elephants are provided with large amounts of space to roam, and plenty of browse to feed on. Because they are social animals, they are kept in small herds. Because they are extremely intelligent, they must be provided with lots of environmental enrichment in the form of toys, puzzles, water hoses, and training.\nTo keep them healthy, they are trained using positive reinforcement to perform behaviors that help zookeepers take care of them. These behaviors are called husbandry behaviors. Some examples include nail trimming and foot care, dental examinations, standing on a scale for weighing, ultrasounds, and voluntarily allowing their blood to be drawn for testing.\nIn zoos, elephants don\u2019t have to search for food all day, so they burn much fewer calories! At the San Diego Zoo, elephants are fed 125 lbs. of food each day. This includes hay, commercial herbivore pellets, celery, lettuce, acacia branches and leaves, and cucumbers. They are also provided with fresh water, and can drink between 20 and 50 gallons in a day.\nBehavior of the African Elephant\nElephants have very tight knit social bonds, and live in groups called herds. The leader of the herd is the oldest female, and she is known as a matriarch. The matriarch is responsible for remembering where the most reliable food and water sources are.\nMale elephants are less social, and once they reach sexual maturity they usually leave the herd. They will live on their own, or with other males in bachelor herds. The only time they interact with females is to mate.\nReproduction of the African Elephant\nAfter mating, the female elephant has a gestation period of 22 months \u2013 nearly 2 years! The male elephant takes no part in the care of the calf, and leaves after mating. When the calf is born, the entire herd takes part in protecting and raising it. For the first year, the calf will gain between 2 and three 3 per day! It can take between 2 and 3 years before they are fully weaned."}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Amazing Facts about Sumatran Elephants - OneKindPlanet", "url": "https://onekindplanet.org/animal/elephant-sumatran/", "text": "Amazing Facts About the Sumatran Elephant\nThe Sumatran Elephant is the smallest subspecies, but the largest mammal existing on the island of Sumatra. They can weigh up to 5tonnes and reach 9ft in height!\nWith a stranger appearance to their African cousins, the Sumatran Elephant is almost completely bald with small rounded ears. Female Sumatran Elephants rarely have tusks, but the females that do keep them hidden away from sight until they open their mouths!\nWhere do Sumatran Elephants live?\nThese creatures love to roam the luscious lowland forests of Sumatra, sometimes venturing uphill to mid-altitudes so long as it is below 300m!\nThe island of Sumatra is located within Indonesia, and contains a wide range of animal and plant species. Unfortunately many of these species have become endangered as a result of tropical forest loss. Currently, there are only 2,400-2,800 Sumatran Elephants left.\nWhat do Sumatran Elephants eat?\nAs herbivores, these noble animals spend their days munching on 150kg of plants as seeds as they move through the forests. That\u2019s the weight of two entire male humans in plants\u2026 every day!\nDo they need to worry about predators in Sumatra?\nDue to their enormous size they have very few predators, however on the odd occasion a courageous tiger will prey on baby Sumatran Elephants.\nAre Sumatran Elephants social?\nJust like other elephants, Sumatran Elephants are sociable animals and need large areas of land with enough food and shelter for populations to flourish. Females travel and gather in groups, looking after one another whilst the males live solitarily. Check out our Elephant family page for more facts on Elephant behaviour.\nWhat conservation threats do Sumatran Elephants face?\nHabitat loss is the main cause of population decline, with 69% of potential Sumatran Elephant habitat lost between 1980 and 2005. In a similar time frame, Sumatra also lost 50% of it\u2019s Elephants as a result. Increasing human populations and need for land are the main drivers of tropical forest loss, and you can find out more about this conservation crisis here.\nPoaching is also a problem in Sumatra, most notably from agriculturists who own or are setting up palm oil plantations. This illegal act of killing occurs through poisoning, electrocution and trap methods. Although Sumatran Elephants are categorised as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List, this act continues, and organisations have called on the Sumatran Agriculture Ministry to tighten restrictions.\nIf you want to be an Elephant ethical tourist, read our latest blog!"}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "75 Animal Facts That Will Change the Way You View the Animal Kingdom", "url": "https://bestlifeonline.com/animal-facts/", "text": "With an estimated 7.77 million species of animals on the planet, the animal kingdom is an undeniably diverse place. But while the breadth of earthly biodiversity may be well known, the incredible things our animal counterparts can do are often hidden to humans. From furry creatures you never realized kissed to those who enjoy getting tipsy, these amazing animal facts are sure to wow even the biggest animal lovers out there.\n1 Koala fingerprints are so close to humans' that they could taint crime scenes.\nKoalas might not seem to have a lot in common with us, but if you were to take a closer look at their hands, you'd see that they have fingerprints that are just like humans'. In fact, they're so similar when it comes to the distinctive loops and arches, that in Australia, \"police feared that criminal investigations may have been hampered by koala prints,\" according to Ripley's Believe It or Not. Any koalas who want to commit crimes would be wise to do so wearing gloves.\n2 Parrots will selflessly help each other out.\nParrots may be associated with pirates, but it turns out African grey parrots are nothing like the infamously greedy, treasure-seeking criminals. Instead, researchers have discovered that the colorful birds will \"voluntarily help each other obtain food rewards\" and perform \"selfless\" acts, according to a 2020 study published in Current Biology. Study co-author Auguste von Bayern noted, \"African grey parrots were intrinsically motivated to help others, even if the other individual was not their friend, so they behaved very 'prosocially.'\"\n3 Prairie dogs kiss.\nPrairie dogs are quirky creatures for a number of reasons: They're giant rodents, they dig massive interconnected underground homes, and they kiss. While they're actually touching their front teeth in order to identify each other when they seem to be sweetly sharing a smooch, the BBC explains that scientists believe prairie dogs \"'kiss and cuddle' more when they are being watched by zoo visitors,\" because they \"appeared to enjoy the attention.\"\n4 Ghost crabs growl using teeth in their stomachs.\nCrabs may be able to intimidate other creatures with their claws, but if that's not enough, ghost crabs will growl at their enemies like a dog. However, unlike our canine friends, crabs make these fearsome noises using teeth located in their stomachs. \"There are three main teeth\u2014a medial tooth and two lateral teeth\u2014that are essentially elongated, hard (calcified) structures. They are part of the gastric mill apparatus in the stomach, where they rub against each other to grind up food,\" Jennifer Taylor, from the University of California, San Diego, told Newsweek. She and her colleagues were able to nail down the source of the noise after noticing that \"the crabs [were] 'growling' at\" them.\n5 The mantis shrimp has the world's fastest punch.\nYou might think that boxers have the most impressive jabs, hooks, and uppercuts on the planet, but it's the mantis shrimp that boasts the world's fastest punch. Traveling at about 50 mph, when a shrimp punches, its little fist of fury (which, of course, isn't a fist at all) is \"accelerating faster than a .22-caliber bullet,\" according to Science. National Geographic shared the tale of one such small smasher, explaining that \"in April 1998, an aggressive creature named Tyson smashed through the quarter-inch-thick glass wall of his cell. He was soon subdued by nervous attendants and moved to a more secure facility in Great Yarmouth. Unlike his heavyweight namesake [former professional boxer Mike Tyson], Tyson was only four inches long. But scientists have recently found that Tyson, like all his kin, can throw one of the fastest and most powerful punches in nature.\"\n6 Female lions do 90 percent of the hunting.\nWhile male lions attract their fair share of attention thanks to their impressive manes, it's the female lions who do the bulk of the work when it comes to feeding their families. \"Lionesses, not male lions, do the majority of hunting for their pride,\" according to CBS News. \"Lionesses hunt around 90 percent of the time, while the males protect their pride.\"\n7 Narwhal tusks are really an \"inside out\" tooth.\nNarwhals are unlike most other whales because they have what appears to be a giant tusk. But that's not actually a tusk at all\u2014what you're seeing is a tooth. Harvard University's Martin Nweeia told the BBC that the \"tooth is almost like a piece of skin in the sense that it has all these sensory nerve endings,\" adding that it's \"essentially built inside out.\"\n8 The world's oldest known breed of domesticated dog dates back to 329 BC.\nDogs are well known for being man's best friend, and it turns out that's a relationship that goes back longer than you might expect. According to Guinness World Records, the oldest known breed of domesticated dog goes all the way back to 329 BC. \"Saluki dogs were revered in ancient Egypt, being kept as royal pets and being mummified after death,\" they note. \"There are carvings found in Sumer (present-day southern Iraq) which represent a dog, closely resembling a saluki, which date back to 7000 BC.\"\n9 And the oldest evidence of domesticated cats dates back 9,500 years.\nCats have also been hanging around humans for thousands of years. Guinness World Records reports that we've been domesticating cats for 9,500 years. Proof of this came in 2004 when the \"bones of a cat were discovered in the neolithic village of Shillourokambos on Cyprus. The position of the cat in the ground was next to the bones of a human, whose similar state of preservation strongly suggests they were buried together.\"\n10 Puffins use twigs to scratch their bodies.\nPuffins surely have enough to be proud of with their beautiful beaks, but the seabirds also happen to be quite clever. According to a 2019 study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), Atlantic puffins in both Wales and Iceland were observed \"spontaneously using a small wooden stick to scratch their bodies.\" Indeed, in a video shared by Science, a little puffin can be seen picking up a tiny twig before using it to scratch an itchy spot on its belly.\n11 Bottlenose dolphins are even more right-handed than humans.\n\"Most humans (say 70 percent to 95 percent) are right-handed, a minority (say 5 percent to 30 percent) are left-handed,\" according to Scientific American. And the same holds true for bottlenose dolphins. In fact, the savvy swimmers are even more right-handed than we are. A team led by Florida's Dolphin Communication Project took a look at the feeding behavior of bottlenose dolphins and found that the animals were turning to their left side 99.44 percent of the time, which \"actually suggests a right-side bias,\" according to IFL Science. \"It places the dolphin's right side and right eye close to the ocean floor as it hunts.\"\n12 There's a kind of ant that only lives in a small area of Manhattan.\nIf you're ever in the area of \"the Broadway medians at 63rd and 76th streets\" in New York City, keep an eye on the ground for crawling critters and you might spot something rare. That's where the \"ManhattAnt\" can be found, an ant that only lives in the one small area of the city. \"It's a relative of the cornfield ant, and it looks like it's from Europe, but we can't match it up with any of the European species,\" Rob Dunn, a biology professor at North Carolina State University, told the New York Post. Dunn and his team discovered the isolated ant variety in 2012.\n13 Cows painted with zebra-like stripes can avoid being bitten by flies.\nCows have to deal with pesky flies that are beyond annoying for the docile creatures. Luckily, farmers can now protect their animals by painting them with zebra-like stripes. According to a 2019 study published in PLOS One, \"the numbers of biting flies on Japanese Black cows painted with black-and-white stripes were significantly lower than those on non-painted cows and cows painted only with black stripes.\" IFL Science suggests this might work because \"the stripes may cause a kind of motion camouflage targeted at the insects' vision, confusing them much in the way that optical illusions \u2026 confuse us.\"ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb\n14 Capuchin monkeys wash their hands and feet in urine.\nMonkeys are undeniably cute. They can also be pretty darn gross. Capuchin monkeys, for example, urinate on their hands and feet when they're feeling \"randy.\" \"We think the alpha males might use urine-washing to convey warm, fuzzy feelings to females, that their solicitation is working and that there's no need to run away,\" primatologist Kimran Miller told NBC News. \"Or they could be doing it because they're excited.\" Either way, ew!\n15 Sperm whales in the Caribbean have an accent.\nPeople who come from different areas around the world tend to speak with inflections, fluctuations, and patterns that are specific to their home regions. Apparently, the same can be said for whales. Researchers from Dalhousie University in Canada and the University of St. Andrews in the UK have found evidence that seems to show whales in the Caribbean have a different \"accent\" than whales in other oceans.\n16 Some pigs in China are the size of bears.\nIn Nanning, the capital of China's Guangxi province, a man named Pang Cong has a rather remarkable animal living on his farm: a 1,102-pound pig. That's roughly the same size as a full-grown adult male polar bear. According to Bloomberg, massive swine of that size \"can sell for more than 10,000 yuan ($1,399), over three times higher than the average monthly disposable income\" in the area.\n17 Some sharks glow in the dark.\nSharks boast some enviable\u2014and terrifying\u2014features, like their sleek design and razor-sharp teeth. And while glow-in-the-dark sharks sound like something you'd see in a sci-fi film, they're totally real, as noted in a 2019 study published in iScience. Researchers were already aware that some shark species produce a glow that only other sharks can see, but now scientists have discovered that \"previously unknown small-molecule metabolites are the cause of the green glow,\" according to CNN. This glow \"helps sharks identify each other and even fight against infection on a microbial level.\"\n18 Some snails have hairy shells.\nWhile it's not a secret that snails have shells, you probably didn't know that some actually have hairy shells. These hairs are rather handy to have, as they help a snail stick to wet surfaces like leaves.\n19 Cowbirds use secret passwords to teach their young.\nCowbirds lay their eggs in other bird species' nests, which means that the little ones eventually need to reconnect with their own kind when the time is right. And when that time comes, the young birds have a trick for figuring out who to reach out to. \"Juvenile cowbirds readily recognize and affiliate with other cowbirds. That's because they have a secret handshake or password,\" according to Science Daily. To put it more simply, they use \"a specific chatter call\" to beckon each other.\n20 Baby Tasmanian devils make life-long friendships.\nIf you have best friends who have been around since you were a child, then you have something in common with Tasmanian devils. Research has shown that Tasmanian devils form bonds when they're young that last for the rest of their lives. As Zoos Victoria's Marissa Parrott told IFL Science, \"In the wild, when baby devils leave their mums, we believe they all socialize together.\" As the website notes, \"young devils have their own dens,\" \"engage in friendly sleep-overs,\" and when given the chance, they prefer \"to share with their \u2026 original friends.\"\n21 A grizzly bear's bite is strong enough to crush a bowling ball.\nThose who find themselves in the presence of a grizzly bear will surely want to stay out of reach of this animal's super sharp claws. But they'll certainly also want to keep out of the grizzly's mouth, because these creatures \"have a bite-force of over 8,000,000 pascals,\" according to National Geographic. That means grizzly bears can literally crush a bowling ball between their jaws. Yikes!\n22 Humpback whales use bubbles to hunt.\nYou might think that a whale's massive size is the only edge they'd need when it comes to hunting in the open waters. But humpback whales actually team up to use a \"bubble-net\" technique in order to catch their prey. \"Sometimes, the whales will swim in an upward spiral and blow bubbles underwater, creating a circular 'net' of bubbles that makes it harder for fish to escape,\" Science News reports.\n23 A housefly buzzes in an F key.\nWhen you hear a housefly buzzing around your home, you might be annoyed by the persistent sound. However, the next time it happens, try to soothe yourself by noting that the airborne pest is actually buzzing in an F key. How melodious!\n24 Moray eels have a second pair of \"Alien-style\" jaws.\nIf you already thought that eels were kind of creepy, then this fact isn't going to make you feel any better about them. Moray eels have what's called pharyngeal jaws, which are a second pair of \"Alien-style\" jaws that are located in the throat and emerge to grasp prey before pulling the unfortunate meal down into the eel's gullet.\n25 Ducks can surf.\nOver in New Zealand, surfers have noticed the same thing that those who ride the waves in California have witnessed: ducks can surf. The birds do so in order to catch food or simply to move through the water quickly. Sports reporter Francis Malley spotted a female duck and her babies catching a wave and told the New Zealand Herald, \"The mother was surfing on her belly on the whitewash. I've never surfed with ducks before so this was a first.\"\n26 Slow lorises are the only venomous primates.\nThey may be cute, but their bite can kill. According to Popular Science, these adorable animals secrete toxins from a gland in the crook of their inner arms. Their bites have caused anaphylactic shock and even death in humans. Better watch out!\n27 Pigeons can do math.\nYou might think of pigeons as\u2026 not that smart. But it turns out, they're actually quite intelligent. In fact, one 2011 study published in the journal Science found that the birds are capable of doing math at the same level as monkeys. During the study, the pigeons were asked to compare nine images, each containing a different number of objects. The researchers found that the birds were able to rank the images in order of how many objects they contained. Put simply, they learned that the birds could count!\n28 Zebra stripes act as a natural bug repellant.\nCows may benefit from artificial stripes, but zebras have the real deal. One 2012 report published in the Journal of Experimental Biology suggests that zebras' black and white stripes may be an evolutionary feature to fend off harmful horsefly bites. \"A zebra-striped horse model attracts far fewer horseflies than either homogeneous black, brown, grey or white equivalents,\" the researchers wrote.\n29 Wild chimps like to drink.\nHumans aren't the only animals who enjoy a drink or two. A 2015 study published in the journal Royal Society Open Science reveals that chimpanzees in Guinea had a fondness for imbibing fermented palm sap and getting tipsy in the process.\n30 Sea otters are adept at using tools.\nWhile many scientists believe that tool use among dolphins is a relatively new phenomenon, a 2017 study published in Biology Letters suggests that otters may have been using tools for millions of years. Sea otters frequently use rocks to break open well-armored prey, such as snails.\n31 Frogs can freeze without dying.\nWhy tolerate the cold when you could just freeze yourself solid? According to Kenneth Storey, a professor at Carleton University in Ottawa, frogs undergo repeated freeze-thaw cycles. \"We have false springs here all the time where it gets really warm and all the snow melts and then suddenly\u2014bam\u2014the wind comes from the north and it's back down to minus 10, minus 15 [Celsius], and they're fine,\" Storey told National Geographic.\n32 Male horses have way more teeth than their female counterparts.\nMale horses have 40 to 42 permanent teeth, while females have just 36 to 40. According to the VCA Animal Hospital, the original purpose of these extra teeth was as fighting weaponry.\n33 Koalas sleep up to 22 hours a day.\nIf you thought your cat was sleepy, just wait until you hear about koalas. According to the Australian Koala Foundation, these cuties sleep between 18 and 22 hours a day. The koalas' diets require a lot of energy to digest, which is why they've got to nap so much.\n34 A group of ferrets is called a business.\nNo, it's not because they're so professional\u2014it's a modernized form of \"busyness,\" the word originally used to describe a group of these weasel-related mammals.\n35 Octopuses can taste with their arms.\nAnd yes, they are called arms, not tentacles. According to the Library of Congress, the animals can taste and grab with the suckers on their arms. Even more impressive? Octopuses are capable of moving at speeds of up to 25 miles per hour.\n36 Dolphins have names for one another.\nYou already know that dolphins are smart. But did you know that they even have their own names? One 2013 study published in PNAS found that bottlenose dolphins develop specific whistles for one another.\n37 Reindeer eyes turn blue in the winter.\nReindeers have beautiful baby blues\u2014but only in the winter! According to the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, \"the eyes of Arctic reindeer change color through the seasons from gold to blue, adapting to extreme changes of light levels in their environment.\" The change in color impacts how light is reflected through the animals' retina, and improves their vision.\n38 Giraffes have black tongues.\nScientists believe that it's so they don't get sunburns while they eat. The animals' tongues are also around 20 inches long.\n39 Alligators will let manatees swim ahead of them.\nIn busy waters, manatees will nudge alligators to get in front, and alligators generally oblige.\n40 Sloths can take up to a month to completely digest a single leaf.\nEverything about life is slow for these sleepy mammals. Most sloths will only have a bowel movement once a week, and it can take them up to 30 days to completely digest a single leaf. For comparison, it takes the average human 12 to 48 hours to ingest, digest, and eliminate waste from food.\n41 Adult cats only meow at humans.\nYou probably know that cats love to talk to their humans. But did you know you're unlikely to see your feline friend interact the same way with another cat? That's because other than kittens meowing at their mothers, cats don't meow at other cats.\n42 Elephants and humans have similar self-soothing techniques.\nElephant calves will suck their trunks to comfort themselves. The babies do it for the same reason humans do (it mimics the action of suckling their mothers).\n43 Female bats give birth to babies that weigh up to a third of their weight.\nAccording to Bat Conservation International, bats give birth to babies\u2014known as pups\u2014that can weigh as much as one-third of the mother's weight. If that doesn't sound like a lot, imagine a person giving birth to a baby that weighed 40 pounds.\n44 Painted turtles survive winter by breathing through their butts.\nNot all creatures head to warmer climates when it gets cold out, and that means they need to learn to survive in chilly conditions. Painted turtles need to adapt to frozen ponds, which restrict their access to the air above the water. They do that by breathing through their butts\u2014specifically, the all-purpose orifice called the cloaca. Thanks to a process called cloacal respiration, the turtles are able to get oxygen directly from the water around them.\n45 Dogs have way fewer taste buds than humans.\nWhile you may think that Fido has the same dinnertime experience as you do, he's actually got a much different taste bud arrangement. Humans have about 9,000 taste buds, while dogs have only around 1,700. And while they can identify the same four taste sensations as people, dogs are not fond of salt.\n46 Otters have the world's thickest fur.\nThey're thought to have up to one million hairs per square inch. Their fur consists of two layers and is designed to trap a layer of air next to their skin so their skin doesn't get wet.\n47 Alligators can grow for more than 30 years.\nAccording to a 2018 study published in Copeia, alligators often haven't hit their full size until 33.\n48 A group of owls is called a parliament.\nTheir legislative powers, however, are still up for debate.\n49 Snow leopards don't roar.\nSnow leopards have less-developed vocal cords than their fellow large cats, meaning that they can't roar, but make a purr-like sound called a chuff instead. For a 2010 study published in the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, scientists researched why some cats have a higher-pitched meow than others. They found that it's not size that determines a kitty's call, but habitat.\n50 Axolotls can regenerate their parts.\nThe salamanders are the only vertebrates that can replace their skin, limbs, tail, jaws, and spines at any age. On the flip side, humans can regenerate lost limb buds as embryos and fingertips as young children.\n51 A group of rhinos is called a crash.\nIndividual male rhinos are referred to as bulls, and females as cows.\n52 Squirrels will adopt orphans.\nTurns out, squirrels have an intense motherly instinct. One 2010 study by researchers at the University of Guelph found that the animals will take in the orphaned pups of their late family members.\n\"Social animals, including lions and chimpanzees, are often surrounded by relatives, so it's not surprising that a female would adopt an orphaned family member because they have already spent a lot of time together,\" said lead researcher Andrew McAdam, an evolutionary biologist. \"But red squirrels live in complete isolation and are very territorial. The only time they will allow another squirrel on their territory is the one day a year when the females are ready to mate or when they are nursing their pups.\"\n53 Giant anteaters have two-foot tongues.\nAccording to National Geographic, it's the longest tongue of any known mammal.\n54 Cows have best friends.\nCows have stronger social ties than you might think. One 2013 study conducted by researchers at the University of Northampton found that when cows were separated from their BFFs, their heart rates increased as a sign of stress.\n55 Moths experience love at first scent.\nWhen a male moth catches a whiff of a female moth, he'll travel miles to find her\u2060\u2014based off her scent alone. According to the experts at Audobon, \"they don't know what the female sounds like, or even what she looks like. But when they smell her, boy, do they know it, and they use her seductive musk to track her down.\"\n56 Horses have distinct facial expressions.\nHorses can make 17 facial movements, which is 3 more than chimps and only 10 fewer than humans, according to a 2015 study published in PLOS One.\n57 Deer can run up to 35 miles per hour.\nYes, white-tailed deer can hit top speeds of 35 miles per hour. Think that's fast? Reindeer can run up to 50 miles per hour.\n58 An octopus has three hearts.\nOctopuses have two more hearts than you do. Two hearts are used to pump blood to their gills, while the third brings blood to the rest of their body. If that's not enough, they also have nine brains.\n59 Some worms can jump.\nCertain species of the Amynthas worm, which have recently been identified in the Midwestern United States, can jump and detach their tails when disturbed.\n60 Crocodiles can live up to 100.\nNile crocodiles can live for a full century. And they can do a lot of damage over the course of those 100 years: Approximately 200 people die every year from Nile crocodile attacks.\n61 Ravens are masters of deception.\nJust how smart are ravens? A 2002 study published in Animal Behaviour found that these tricky birds have the ability to deceive each other. The entire corvid family\u2014which includes crows, ravens, and jays\u2014is exceptionally intelligent. These birds have also been known to play pranks on one another, and to tease other animals.\n62 Rats laugh.\nWhile scientists don't exactly think they have a sense of humor, rats will make a laugh-like sound when tickled.\n63 Tigers have striped skin.\nYou might think it's just their fur, but no, tigers have striped skin. And speaking of those stripes, much like our fingerprints, they're unique to every tiger.\n64 Cats recognize their own name but choose not to respond.\nSorry, cat owners, you're not just being paranoid: Your pet does know when you're calling their name, and they're ignoring you anyway. In a 2019 study published in Scientific Reports, researchers discovered that while cats can distinguish their own name, they don't necessarily feel obligated to respond.\n65 Cows produce more milk when listening to slow music.\nCall it a moo-d. Researchers at the University of Leicester School of Psychology found that cows produced 1.54 more pints per day\u2014a 3 percent increase\u2014when they were played slow music, as opposed to more upbeat tunes.\n66 Butterflies taste with their feet.\nNot only do butterflies taste using their feet\u2014the receptors on their legs are also 200 times stronger than human taste buds. When a butterfly lands on a plant, they use these sensors to determine whether or not what they're standing on is edible.\n67 The spur-winged goose's diet makes it poisonous.\nDon't plan on eating a spur-winged goose if you happen to come across one during your travels. These birds, natives of sub-Saharan Africa, have flesh that's often poisonous to humans, thanks to their diet of blister beetles, which contain the deadly cantharidin poison.\n68 Vampire bat saliva keeps blood from clotting.\nVampire bats do more than just bite their prey\u2014they also keep the other animal's blood from clotting. Their saliva works as an anticoagulant, so that the blood can flow freely as they feed. Here's another fun fact: The protein in the anticoagulant has been nicknamed \"Draculin.\" Spooky!\n69 Wombat poop is cube-shaped.\nWombats use their droppings to warn other animals to stay off their turf. Luckily, their cube-shaped poop makes it easy to see that a spot is governed by wombats, as the little squares tend to stay put more easily than spherical droppings would.\n70 Giraffes with darker spots are more dominant.\nYou can learn a lot from the color of a giraffe's spots. According to a 2019 study in Animal Behaviour, giraffes with darker spots are more dominant than giraffes with lighter spots. And not only that: Dark-spotted giraffes also tend to be more solitary.\n71 Orcas can learn to speak dolphin.\nGroups of killer whales have their own dialects that are further influenced by the company they keep. A 2014 study published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America revealed that orcas housed with bottlenose dolphins over a long period of time were able to replicate the dolphins' language.\n72 Queen mole rats make other female mole rats infertile.\nTo ensure her dominance, the queen mole rat works to make it impossible for other female mole rats to have litters. In fact, the queen can produce a substance in her urine that renders other female mole rats infertile.\n73 Horned lizards squirt blood from their eyes.\nThe horned lizard has a pretty impressive trick for evading predators. When a horned lizard finds itself in a perilous situation, it can squirt a stream of blood from its eyes. The predator then runs off, because, well, wouldn't you?\n74 Catfish have taught themselves how to kill pigeons.\nRelax, pigeons\u2014it's not all catfish. But yes, in southwestern France, a group of European catfish have learned to kill pigeons, launching themselves out of the water to grab the sunbathing birds.\n75 Primitive crocodiles could gallop.\nIf you think crocodiles aren't frightening enough, consider this: They used to gallop. While modern-day crocodiles can move surprisingly fast, giant crocodiles during the Cretaceous period could use their legs to chase and kill dinosaurs.\nAdditional reporting by Desir\u00e9e O."}

Indian elephants are large, herbivorous mammals, which means that they eat plants, not animals. Their immense size means they are often classified as one of the \u201cmega-fauna\u201d animals. The Indian elephant\u2019s most striking features are the long trunk, which is prehensile (the elephant can grip objects with it), large ears, and tusks (on males). Read on to learn about the Indian elephant.\nDescription of the Indian Elephant\nIndian elephants have large heads, but only short necks. They have short, but powerful legs that support their entire body-weight, like columns. Indian elephants have large ears to help them regulate their body temperature, and to communicate with other elephants; however, their ears are smaller than those of African elephants. Indian elephants also have a more curved spine than the African elephant, and their skin color is lighter than that of the Asian elephant, having smaller patches of skin without pigment.\nThese elephants have long tails that grow down below their knees. Female Indian elephants rarely have tusks, and if they do, the tusks do not grow beyond the mouth. Females reach full weight at 25-30 years of age, whereas the males are not fully grown until they are 35-45 years of age.\nInteresting Facts About the Indian Elephant\nDue to their great size, and the wide variety of habitats in which they live, Indian elephants have several adaptations which make them unusual animals. These often relate to food and water gathering behaviors.\nTrunk \u2013 There are around 150,000 muscles in the trunk, but no bones\n\u2013 There are around 150,000 muscles in the trunk, but no bones Tusks \u2013 Tusks, which are often used to dig up roots, grow about 6 in (15 cm) a year\n\u2013 Tusks, which are often used to dig up roots, grow about 6 in (15 cm) a year Drinking \u2013 They can drink 53 gallons (200 liters) of water each day during the summer\n\u2013 They can drink 53 gallons (200 liters) of water each day during the summer Sociality \u2013 Elephant herds have \u201caunties\u201d who look after the babies of other females\nHabitat of the Indian Elephant\nIndian elephants can be found in a wide range of habitats, including grasslands, forests (moist, tropical or dry), and also cultivated forests and scrublands.\nDistribution of the Indian Elephant\nIndian elephants are the most widely distributed of the three sub-species of Asian elephants. They are found throughout southeast Asia, including countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma, Cambodia, China, Laos, parts of Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Thailand, and Vietnam.\nDiet of the Indian elephant\nElephants are classified as mega-herbivores, i.e. they are plant-eating mammals that weigh more than 2,200 lb (1,000 kg). They can consume up to 330 lb (150 kg) of plant material each day. They are considered to be generalist feeders, as they are both grazers (feeding on grasses), and browsers (feeding on trees and shrubs). In one study, Indian elephants were recorded as feeding on 112 different plant species. They also graze on tall grasses; when the new growth appears, usually in April, they skillfully remove the tender blades and shoots. When the grasses are taller, the elephants pull up entire clumps, shake the dust of them and then eat the fresh leaf tops but throw away the roots. They also eat farmed crops such as sugarcane, rice, and bananas.\nIndian Elephants and Human Interaction\nOne of the most significant threats to Indian elephants is the expanding human population, which results in habitat fragmentation, degradation, and habitat loss. Some building projects, such as hydroelectric plants, reservoirs, and mining, can impede the Indian elephants\u2019 free movements.\nFarmers with only a small amount of land can lose the entirety of their crops overnight from Indian elephant raids. For this reason, elephants are sometimes killed or harassed when they trample or eat crops.\nIndian elephants are poached for their ivory tusks. Because only male elephants have tusks, their deaths from poaching are having a serious impact on the ratios of male to female elephants in the wild. As there are though to be only 20,000 Indian elephants in the wild, this upset in the breeding population could bring on their extinction.\nIndian elephants are used widely in logging camps and also in the tourist industry.\nDomestication\nElephants have been used by humans for hundreds of years for purposes such as foresting, working in logging camps, as animals of war, and more recently for the tourist industry. However, elephants in general are considered to be semi-domesticated, rather than fully domesticated. This is because the elephant\u2019s very long life span makes it difficult for humans to select them for desirable characteristics.\nDoes the Indian Elephant Make a Good Pet\nIndian elephants can be trained to a high degree, and tamed; however, due to their immense size and strength, they are not good pets. Elephants are usually kept as livestock in heavily fortified enclosures.\nIndian Elephant Care\nWhen keeping elephants captive, there should be sufficient space (in the wild, they usually walk tens of miles each day to gather food and water). They also require a suitable floor substrate as, on hard surfaces, they frequently develop foot problems, such as cracked toes and ulcers. Their diet must be watched carefully, as they tend to over-eat to the point of becoming over-weight. This, in turn, may lead to other health problems.\nBehavior of the Indian Elephant\nIndian elephants may spend up to 19 hours a day feeding. From this, they defecate about 16-18 times each day, producing about 220 lb (100 kg) of dung. Indian elephants migrate each year, following strict migration routes, while being led by the eldest member of the herd. The migration usually occurs between the wet and dry seasons.\nReproduction of the Indian Elephant\nFemales (called \u201ccows\u201d) can usually breed when they are 10-15 years old. After a pregnancy (called the \u201cgestation period\u201d) of 22 months, they give birth to a single baby (called a \u201ccalf\u201d) which weighs about 220 lb (100 kg). Elephant calves are cared for by their mothers, and also by other females in the herd (called \u201caunties\u201d). Calves stay with their mothers until they are about 5 years old, at which time males often leave the herd, but females remain.\nBeliefs, Superstitions, and Phobias About the Indian Elephant\nThe Hindu God, Ganesh, has the head of an elephant."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the African Bush Elephant images!\nAfrican Bush Elephant Classification and Evolution\nThe African Bush Elephant is the largest of all living creatures on land today, with some individuals growing to weigh more than 6 tonnes. The Elephant is thought to have been named after the Greek word for ivory, meaning that Elephants were named for their uniquely long tusks. Although many of the ancestors of the African Bush Elephant became extinct during the last ice-age (including the Woolly Mammoth), there are three distinct species of Elephant remaining today which are the Asian Elephant (of which there are a number of sub-species), the African Bush Elephant and the African Forest Elephant. Although these two Elephant species are very similar, the African Bush Elephant is considered to be generally larger than the African Forest Elephant, which has rounder ears and straighter tusks.\nAfrican Bush Elephant Anatomy and Appearance\nThe African Bush Elephant is the largest known land mammal on Earth, with male African Bush Elephants reaching up to 3.5 metres in height and the females being slightly smaller at around 3 metres tall. The body of the African Bush Elephants can also grow to between 6 and 7 meters long. The tusks of an African Bush Elephant can be nearly 2.5 meters in length and generally weigh between 50 and 100 pounds, which is about the same as a small adult Human. African Bush Elephants have four molar teeth each weighing about 5.0 kg and measuring about 12 inches long. As the front pair of molars in the mouth of the African Bush Elephant wear down and drop out in pieces, the back pair shift forward and two new molars emerge in the back of the African Bush Elephant\u2019s mouth. African Bush Elephants replace their teeth six times during their lives but when the African Bush Elephant is between 40 to 60 years old, it no longer has teeth and will likely die of starvation, which is sadly a common cause of death of Elephants in the African wilderness.\nAfrican Bush Elephant Distribution and Habitat\nAlthough the historical range of its ancestors ranged right into the Arctic Circle, today the African Bush Elephant is mainly found in central and southern Africa in nomadic herds that wander the plains and grasslands of Africa grazing for food and searching for waterholes. Unlike the slightly smaller African Forest Elephant, the African Bush Elephant inhabits the grassy savanna plains and shrub-land of the African continent in groups that contain mothers and their calves. Generally, African Bush Elephant herds contain around 10 individuals but it is not uncommon for family groups to join together, forming a clan which can contain over 1,000 Elephants. This very social lifestyle means that the African Bush Elephants are less vulnerable on the open African plains.\nAfrican Bush Elephant Behaviour and Lifestyle\nNot only is the African Bush Elephant an incredibly sociable mammal but it is also a very active one. African Bush Elephants are nomadic animals meaning that they are constantly on the move in search of food, so moving within these family herds allows them to have greater protection both from predators and from the elements. The trunk of the African Bush Elephant is one of its most distinguishing features and this extra long nose is not only flexible enough to gather and handle food but can also collect water. Its trunk, along with its tusks can also be used to defend itself from predators such as Lions, and to fight with other male African Bush Elephants during the mating season. African Bush Elephants are also considered to be highly intelligent and emotional animals displaying behaviours that include giving and receiving love, caring deeply for the young and grieving for dead relatives.\nAfrican Bush Elephant Reproduction and Life Cycles\nAfrican Bush Elephants tend to live relatively long lives, with the average life span being between 60 and 70 years, Female African Bush Elephants reach sexual maturity (are able to reproduce) after 10 or 11 years, but are thought to be most fertile between the ages of 25 and 45. Male African Bush Elephants however, often don\u2019t reach sexual maturity until they are nearly 20 years old. After mating and a gestation period of up to 2 years, the female African Bush Elephant gives birth to a single calf (twins have been known but are extremely rare). The African Bush Elephant calf is nursed for 2 years but will remain under the guidance and protection of the herd until it is old enough to support itself (around 6 years old). It is at this point that the tusks of the African Bush Elephant calf will be starting to grow.\nAfrican Bush Elephant Diet and Prey\nDespite its immense size, the African Bush Elephant is a herbivorous mammal meaning that it survives on a diet that solely consists of plants and plant matter. The bulk of the African Bush Elephant\u2019s diet is comprised of leaves and branches that are stripped off the trees and bushes using its trunk. The African Bush Elephant also grazes on fruits and grasses and uses its immense tusks for digging for roots in the ground and to strip the bark of trees. Food is fed into its mouth using the trunk, and the large, flat teeth of the African Bush Elephant are then the perfect tool for grinding the vegetation and course plants down so that they can then be more easily digested.\nAfrican Bush Elephant Predators and Threats\nThe African Bush Elephant has no real natural predators to threaten its survival, mainly due to its sheer size and the fact that African Bush Elephants often remain within the safety of the herd. African Bush Elephants are Africa\u2019s peaceful giants and can be seen co-inhabiting the African wilderness with other large mammals and birds, without problem. In the animal world, Lions and Hyenas may occasionally be able to pick off a young African Bush Elephant that has been separated from its mother and have also been known to attack adults that are old and sick and therefore more vulnerable. Humans that poach the African Bush Elephants for their ivory tusks, classifying them as one of the \u201cAfrican Big Five,\u201d are the biggest threat to their survival along with habitat loss across the continent.\nAfrican Bush Elephant Interesting Facts and Features\nIn the early 19th century, the story of the African Bush Elephant was very different with their being up to 5 million individuals thought to have been roaming the African continent. However, due to the increased demand for ivory, Africa\u2019s Bush Elephant population is thought to have fallen as much as 85% in some areas. The large ears of the African Bush Elephant are said by some to be shaped somewhat like Africa, but these large flaps of skin are not just for hearing, they are a vital tool in keeping the Elephant cool in the African heat. Like many of the herbivores found throughout Africa, the calves can walk at birth to maximise their chances of survival. An adult African Bush Elephant can drink up to 50 gallons of water every day, and is able to take 1.5 gallons of water into their trunks at a time.\nAfrican Bush Elephant Relationship with Humans\nSadly, due to an increase of outside interest in Africa and its exotic wonders (particularly towards the mid 20th century), the African Bush Elephant population took a devastating decline towards extinction. After having been brutally killed by poachers for years for their ivory, African Bush Elephants had vanished from much of their native habitat. In 1989 a worldwide elephant ivory hunting ban fell into place, after the populations had dropped so dramatically across the continent. In northern and central parts of Africa, the African Bush Elephant is now rare and confined to protected areas, and although the story is similar in the south, South African Elephant populations are thought to be doing better with an estimated 300,000 individuals in the region.\nAfrican Bush Elephant Conservation Status and Life Today\nToday, although recovering, African Bush Elephant populations are still threatened from increasing levels of illegal poaching and habitat destruction. Deforestation in the African Bush Elephant\u2019s territory means that the African Bush Elephants lose both their food and shelter making them more vulnerable in the wild. Despite the ban, African Bush Elephants are also constantly threatened by poachers hunting the elephants for their ivory tusks.\nView all 122 animals that start with A"}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Top 10 Facts About Elephants - Listverse", "url": "https://listverse.com/2012/03/05/top-10-facts-about-elephants/", "text": "Elephants are a huge part of popular culture and show up as metaphors across all media. They form a part of religious beliefs and are often associated with wisdom or altruism. However, many people who live outside the normal range of elephants are unfamiliar with the many interesting facts about them. This list gives an overview of ten interesting areas about elephants.\n10 Types of Elephant\nIn English, when we say \u2018elephant,\u2019 we are actually referring to several different species. Until 2010, only 2 species of elephant were scientifically recognized. However, genetic testing has revealed that there are at least 3 species. These are the Asian elephant alphas maximus, the African bush elephant loxodonta Africana (also called the savannah elephant), and the African forest elephant loxodonta cyclones. The Asian elephant is the smallest, and has small ears and tusks. They have two prominent bumps on their foreheads. They hold their heads more erect than both African elephants, have no protruding upper lip, and have a single short finger-like lip at the end of their trunk which they use for fine manipulation of objects. Both African elephants have larger ears, although the forest elephant has much rounder ears, are less hairy, have larger tusks, rounded foreheads, and have two finger-like lips on their trunks. The forest elephant has relatively straight, downward-pointing tusks whilst the bush elephant has magnificently curved ones. Most elephants are crepuscular, meaning that they are most active during dawn and evening, although this varies due to local climate. Unfortunately, all elephant species are endangered.\n9 Reproduction\nHomosexual elephants, which are well-documented, mate year-round, but an elephant cow (female) is fertile for only a few days each year. During this time, bulls (males) will try to court her by using rituals involving various affectionate gestures and nuzzles. If she accepts one, she will respond with similar gestures and after 20 minutes or so of a courting ritual they will mate. If she conceives, she will be pregnant for 22 months, longer than any other land animal. Some elephants induce labour by self-medicating with certain plants. The calf (baby), when born, weighs over 100kg. Elephants are quadrupeds, so unlike humans, they can have relatively much wider pelvises which gives them lower infant and mother mortality rates and birth complications than in humans. Baby elephants are initially blind and some take to sucking their trunk for comfort in the same way that humans suck their thumbs. Infants have few survival instincts and are instead taught by their mothers and the more experienced members of their herds. The mother will selectively appoint several babysitters to care for the baby so that she has time to eat enough to produce sufficient milk for it.\n8 Social Lives\nFemale elephants live in a herd of about 10 individuals lead by the most experienced matriarch, whereas the males are normally solitary and move from herd to herd. The females in each herd help each other find food and care for calves. They do not lie down to sleep because of the excellent support their very straight legs give them. Elephants communicate within their herds or between herds many kilometers away mostly using sounds too low for human ears to perceive and by stamping their feet. Within their herds, elephants are believed to have the same or similar levels of cooperation as chimpanzees. An elephant herd is considered one of the most closely-knit societies of any animal, and a female will only leave it if she dies or is captured by humans. Males will leave the herd as they become adolescent, around the age of 12, and live in temporary \u2018bachelor herds\u2019 until they are mature and live alone.\n7 Death\nElephant graveyards are not supported by any hard evidence, but death is important to them nonetheless. Their normal lifespan is 60-80 years. Elephants, humans, and Neanderthals are the only animals known to have death rituals. If an elephant becomes sick, herd members will bring it food and help support it as it stands. If it dies, they will try to revive it with food and water for a while. Once it is clear that an elephant is dead, the herd will become very quiet. They often dig a shallow grave and cover the deceased elephant with dirt and branches, and will stay at the grave for days afterwards. If the elephant had a particularly close relationship with its deceased peer, it can show signs of depression. Even herds that come across an unknown lone elephant who has died will show it similar respects. There are also reported cases of elephants burying dead humans they have found in this way.\n6 Extinct Elephants\nThe elephant taxonomic order, proboscidea, has only 3 members today, but it used to have over forty. Most of these thrived until the end of the last glacial period 12500 years ago. These creatures were generally similar in size to modern Asian elephants, although there were tiny dwarf elephants and the humongous deinotherium, 4.5m tall and weighing 14 tones. For comparison, the largest African bush elephant recorded was 4m tall and weighed 12 tones. Within proboscidea, the mastodon family mammutidae contains modern elephants and the very famous mammoths. Mammoths had long curved tusks and were much hairier than even modern Asian elephants. The last mammoth to go extinct was the woolly mammoth, whose numbers had dwindled as the climate warmed and was finally hunted to extinction in Europe, Asia, and the Americas 12000 years ago, although some populations isolated from humans persisted until as recently as 4000 years ago.\n5 Jumbo the Elephant\nThere have been many famous individual elephants in the world, but one of the largest was Jumbo, whose name is now used to mean \u2018huge.\u2019 His name is thought to be derived from the Swahili word for \u2018boss\u2019 or \u2018chief.\u2019 He was an African bush elephant born in 1861 and taken to a French zoo as an infant. He was later transferred to a British zoo where he gave children rides on his back and was greatly admired. Jumbo\u2019s caretaker even gave him an occasional gallon of whisky which he believed was good for Jumbo\u2019s health. Eventually Jumbo was sold and exported to the USA, and such was his popularity that one hundred thousand children wrote to the Queen asking her to keep Jumbo for them. In the USA he achieved his full fame and was widely exhibited until his death at the age of 24. His health had been steadily declining for years, and when he was hit by a train going at full speed he could not recover, dying soon after. Jumbo was 4m tall at the time of his death.\n4 Teeth and Tusks\nHumans are born toothless, grow a set of milk teeth, and finally lose these as they grow permanent adult teeth. Similarly, elephants are born without tusks, grow milk tusks, and replace these with adult tusks. In Asian elephants, females are usually tusk less. Elephants use tusks for digging and lifting heavy objects, and sometimes as a part of mating rituals. Although now illegal, there is heavy poaching of elephants for their tusk ivory. This is believed to be why the average size of elephant tusks is gradually decreasing \u2013 elephants with smaller tusks are not poached and live to reproduce more. Elephants normally only sleep 2 or 3 hours each day because they need to spend time eating to support their huge size, as they can eat up to 150kg of vegetation every day. Due to their herbivorous diet, elephant teeth wear out quickly and they have 6 or 7 sets instead of only 2 like humans. New teeth grow in the back of the mouth and move forward to replace old worn sets. After the last set has been worn out, solitary elephants will usually die of starvation whereas herd elephants will help feed starving members of their group.\n3 Trunks\nThe elephant trunk, a specialized nose, is analogous to an octopus tentacle in terms of dexterity. It allows them a high degree of manipulation of objects and elephants are adept tool-users. Elephants have been taught to paint with their adroit trunks and produce some fascinating artwork. In captivity, elephants easily learn how to open simple locks and many master more complex ones, something impossible for most other animals due to a lack of dexterity and intellect. Elephants in zoos have worked together to take advantage of this, by having many act as lookouts as another undoes the lock, or in one instance an elephant feigned injury as a distraction while another elephant helped the others escape. Once all the elephants were out, the distraction elephant climbed to its feet and ran for the door, surprising its tenders who had been unaware of the ruse.\n2 Feet\nEach elephant foot has 5 toes, but not every toe has a nail. An easy way to tell the two African elephant species apart is by counting toenails. The African forest elephant and the Asian elephant both have 5 toenails on the front feet and 4 on the back feet. The larger African bush elephant has 4 or sometimes 5 on the front feet and 3 on the back. An X-ray of an elephant\u2019s foot will reveal that its bones are actually standing on tip-toe. Their feet are flat because of a large pad of gristle under each heel which acts as a shock absorber and helps them walk quietly. Their legs are much straighter than those of other animals and support their weight so well that elephants sleep while standing. Elephants spend most of their lives walking huge distances, and their feet are suitably adapted to such a lifestyle. Zoos which keep elephants often find they develop foot problems due to a lack of constant walking, and treatments include tailored shoes to protect their softened feet.\n1 Intelligence\nElephants are some of the most intelligent animals on Earth. Their brains weigh 5kg, much more than the brain of any other land animal. Their brains have more complex folds than all animals except whales, which is thought to be a major factor in their intellect. They commonly show grief, humor, compassion, cooperation, self-awareness, tool-use, playfulness, and excellent learning abilities. An elephant in Korea surprised its zoo keepers by independently learning to mimic the commands they gave it by verbalizing on the end of its trunk, successfully learning 8 words and their context. Elephants have a more developed hippocampus, a brain region responsible for emotion and spatial awareness, than any other animal, and studies indicate that they are superior to humans in keeping track of multiple objects in 3D space. There are many reports of elephants showing altruism towards other species, such as rescuing trapped dogs at considerable cost to themselves. As mentioned above, they respect their dead and have death rituals. There are stories of the herds of elephants killed by humans retrieving the poached bones and returning them to the place of death to bury them."}

They are the West African manatee (T. senegalensis), the Amazonian manatee (T. inunguis) and the West Indian manatee (T. manatus). The West Indian manatee is the species seen frequenting the Florida Coast. 2. The common nickname for the manatee is the sea cow. 3. Manatees are believed to account for at least some of the early-explorer\u2019s mermaid sightings. 4. They can reach 13-feet long and weigh as much as 3,000 pounds. 5. But don\u2019t be fooled by their size: they are gentle giants. They graze on water grasses, weeds and algae. They are the only aquatic herbivore. 6. In fact, an adult manatee can eat 1/10 of its weight in a day. 7. Manatees use their flippers to walk along the bottom of the body of water, feeling for food. When they find it, they scoop it up toward their mouths with their flipper. 8. Manatees are mammals, and they have one baby every two to five years. The babies are born underwater. Females are pregnant for about 1 year. The young nurse for 1-\u00bd-2 years. 9. Manatees live in the water but they need air to survive. They surface every few minutes when active and can stay under for as long as 20 minutes if still. 10. Babies need help getting up to the surface for their first breath. Shortly after birth they are able to swim on their own: usually within an hour. 11. Most mammals have seven neck vertebrae but the both the manatee and the sloth have just six. This means that manatees can\u2019t turn their heads. 12. Besides the dugong, the manatee's closest living relative is the elephant. 13. Manatees can actually swim up to 20 MPH. 14. Manatees face a number of dangers in their native waters: boating accidents can harm or even kill manatees and things like plastics in the water can cause health problems. You can learn more about how to protect manatees even if you live thousands of miles away, by visiting Save the Manatee.\niStock 10 Things to Know About Narwhals 1. Narwhals are basically whales that sport a spiraled horn, or tusk, that juts out of their head much like a unicorn horn. Some narwhals actually have two tusks. 2. The narwhal\u2019s tusk is actually a long jutting tooth. It even has nerves. 3. The tusk can grow as long as 10 feet. A narwhal can be 17 feet in length (plus the tusk!). 4. Narwhals sometimes use their tusks to joust. 5. They live in the Arctic waters of Greenland, Norway, Canada and Russia. 6. Narwhals weigh as much as 4200 pounds. 7. They eat squid, shrimp, halibut and cod. 8. There are about 80,000 narwhals throughout the Arctic waters. 9. Historians actually think that the narwhals are what the unicorns myth is base on. During the Middle Ages, unicorn horns were so coveted that royalty would pay extraordinary prices for them, often the weight of the horn in gold. Hunters traveled to Northern Europe to try and capture the narwhals and bring back their horns (which they would tell the royals were from unicorns). 10. Narwhals are still hunted today for their tusks, and in addition face other environmental threats like pollution. You can help by adopting a narwhal (bonus: you get a plush narwhal as a keepsake!).\nNorman Tsui via Unsplash 13 Fascinating Facts About Reindeer 1.Rangifer tarandus is the scientific name for the animal we most commonly call reindeer. They are in the same family as deer, and there are more than a dozen sub-species. 2. In the wild, some reindeers travel more than 3000 miles in a single year. 3. In North America, reindeer are also known as caribou, although the current \"taxonomic jury\" is out on that all species of reindeer are caribou. Most people use the terms interchangeably. 4. Reindeer like it cold! They are native to Arctic and subarctic regions as well as tundra and boreal (read: snow, snow, snow!) to northern Europe, Siberia and North America. 5. The indigenous people of Finland, the Saami, have more than 400 words for the food, tools and other products taken from reindeer. Their word for reindeer, raingo, may be where the common name is derived. 6. Reindeer beards? In the winter time for reindeer grow their facial hair long enough to cover their mouths, which protects their muzzles when grazing in the snow. 7. Male reindeer have louder calls than females. Males use a small pouch under the skin of their throats which they inflate to blast out a loud bellow. 8. Reindeer grow new antlers every year. 9. For almost all kinds of reindeer, both male and female reindeer have antlers. Females shed their antlers when they give birth in the spring. 10. The Finnish Forest Reindeer, arguably the reindeer of Santa Claus fame, are the largest reindeer species. They are over 7 \u00bd feet long. 11. Finnish Forest Reindeer hooves have a special scoop that helps them forage through the snow for lichen and moss. 12. In warmer months, reindeer feast on grasses, mushrooms and plants. In the winter they feast mainly on moss and lichen.Reindeer have a strong sense of smell, which helps them sniff out food underneath layers of snow. 13. In many cultures, Reindeer are used pull sleds and sleigh. There's evidence of this dating back 7,000 years ago in Siberia!\nAdvertisement\nMathias Appel via Flickr 17 Sloth Facts You Can Take Your Time Reading 1. Sloths really are slow. So slow, in fact, that in the humidity of their native climate an algae actually grows on their fur. This gives them a greenish hue, which acts as camouflage. 2. Sloths, moths and algae have a beneficial relationship: The pyralid moth is a species of moth that lives in the sloth\u2019s fleece. There is also an algae species that grows in the grooved hair of the sloth. Scientists believe that the moth transports nutrient-rich waste from the sloth\u2019s poop to fertilize the algae. In other words, the moths are algae farmers on the sloth\u2019s back. And guess what else? The algae is a key source of food for the sloth! 3. Sloths have 10 upper teeth and 8 lower teeth. 4. They can weigh between 8-17 pounds and grow to be between 21\u201329 inches in length. 5. Two-toed sloths can live up to 20 years in the wild and 30-40 years in captivity! 6. Sloths cannot shiver to stay warm, and so have difficulty maintaining their body temperature on rainy days. 7. Sloths see better at night than in the day and they have very poor hearing. They rely on their sense of smell to locate food and other sloths. 8. Sloths come down from their canopy about once a week to pee and poo unless there is a danger or predator. If that\u2019s the case they do it from the trees! 9. They are good swimmers, especially the backstroke. 10. While they are very quiet in general, if scared they will hiss or moan. 11. Sloths eat leaves, twigs, berries, fruits and the occasional insect or small animal. 12. Females sloths are pregnant for six months. 13. Sloths usually mate and give birth while hanging in trees. Mothers will birth their babies either on the ground upside down in a hanging position. After it is born the infant grabs onto the mother\u2019s fur and makes its way to her chest to nurse. 14. Sloth mother\u2019s milk is higher in fat (6.9 %) and protein (61%) than cow's milk.\niStock 15. There are also four species of three-toed sloths including Bradypodidae pygmaeus, a pygmy species. The other three are B. torquatus, which has a mane; B. tridactylus also known as the pale-throated, three-toed sloth; and B. variegatus, the brown throated, three-toed sloth. They share many characteristics with their two-toed cousins, but a few things are different. 16. Three-toed sloths are better swimmers than their two-toed relatives. 17. They change trees up to four times a day. 18. The are diurnal, meaning they are awake either day or night. Two-toed sloths are nocturnal.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "What Do Elephants Eat? Their Diet Explained - AZ Animals", "url": "https://a-z-animals.com/blog/what-do-elephants-eat/", "text": "Elephants are herbivores that eat tree bark, grasses, fruits, and leaves A-Z-Animals.com\nAs the largest land mammals on the planet, elephants have similarly large diets to sustain their massive bodies on long treks through their native habitats.\nIncredibly, these herbivorous gentle giants typically graze for up to 18 hours a day, using their powerful trunks and tusks to retrieve and eat hundreds of pounds of various grasses, shrubs, fruit, and other plant material! In addition to their massive size, their digestive systems aren\u2019t particularly efficient, so they only digest and utilize around 40% to 60% of the food they eat each day.\nToday, three unique species of elephants are recognized by biologists: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Let\u2019s explore what each species of elephants eats, as well as where they live and their morphological and dietary differences.\nWhat Do Elephants Eat: The Full List\nAn elephant taking a fruit tiverylucky/Shutterstock.com\nElephants eat foods that include:\nTree bark\nSavanna grasses\nFruits (like mangoes and figs)\nRoots\nFlowers\nLeaves\nSoil (for salt and minerals like iron and potassium)\nStems and roots\nGrasses\nLocal crops such as rice, bananas, and sugar cane\nYet, a list of what elephants eat wouldn\u2019t be complete without analyzing what different elephant species eat. After all, Asian elephants that live in dense rainforests have very different diets than African bush elephants living in sub-Saharan Africa! Let\u2019s examine the diet of each elephant species individually.\nWhat Do African Bush Elephants Eat?\nThe African bush elephant, also commonly known as the African savannah elephant, is one of two remaining species of African elephants.\nThese elephants occupy 37 different African countries, most of which are located in sub-Saharan Africa. Their habitats are primarily made up of grasslands, forests, wetlands, and farmland of various elevations. Many will scale mountain ranges to find food; they have even been found at altitudes of over 8,000 feet!\nBecause these elephants often move between various types of habitats, they have very diverse diets made up of the plants they find during their long daily grazing sessions. African bush elephants eat meals are usually made up of the following types of plant material:\nTree bark\nSavanna grasses\nLeaves\nFruits (like mangoes and figs)\nRoots\nFlowers\nSoil (to consume its salt and other minerals like iron and potassium)\nWith their strong trunks and large, flat teeth, these animals are perfectly suited to ripping bark right off of trees and pulling entire branches into their mouths! They will also use their tusks and feet to dig into the ground to find underground water sources or near trees to pull up their roots and mineral-rich soil to munch on.\nElephants can eat for 18 hours per day! Teo Tarras/Shutterstock.com\nWhat Do African Forest Elephants Eat?\nThe African forest elephant is quite similar to the African bush elephant; in fact, for many years, the two species were lumped together, with both being considered simply African elephants.\nHowever, in recent years, scientists have found that the two species have more differences than they initially thought! Namely, African forest elephants are smaller and shorter than African bush elephants and have differently shaped tusks, skulls, and skeletons.\nAs you might imagine, their diet is also very similar to that of the African bush elephant, being mostly made up of various kinds of leaves, branches, fruits, and tree bark. They also use their tusks to dig up roots and soil to supplement their diet with salt and other minerals found in the earth.\nAfrican forest elephants also live throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa, primarily occupying countries with more densely forested areas like Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nBecause they haven\u2019t been studied as closely as their African bush counterparts, we don\u2019t know as much about their behavior and diet, but this is slowly changing!\nWhat Do Asian Elephants Eat?\nAsian elephants are the third currently recognized species of elephants. They occupy 13 different countries and mostly live in India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and Nepal, though they are also sometimes found in parts of China, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam, among others.\nBecause they tend to live in grasslands and heavily forested areas throughout Asia, Asian elephants commonly eat a wide range of plant material native to those areas. Specifically, Indian elephants eat a diet that includes:\nGrasses\nBamboo\nLeaves\nTree bark\nStems and roots\nLocal crops such as rice, bananas, and sugar cane\nMineral-rich soil\nWhile they look similar, these elephants are smaller than both types of African elephants, and they have smaller, less powerful tusks. Other differences include smoother skin than African elephants, rounder ears, and a longer, more tapered lower lip shape.\nAlthough Asian elephants are a bit smaller than their African cousins, they are still known to eat over 300 pounds of food each day! They prefer eating smaller plants like grasses and twigs more than tree bark and roots, as their trunks aren\u2019t quite as strong or flexible as those of African elephants."}

Conservation Status: Least Concern\nOther interesting southern elephant seal facts: The southern elephant seal is not only the largest pinniped, but also the largest member of the Carnivora order. A male southern elephant seal weighs up to SEVEN times as much as a polar bear!\nSouthern Elephant Seal Video\nWatch the video below to see southern elephant seals in the wild (warning: some scenes are quite violent, and may not be suitable for young children):\nMeet The Southern Elephant Seal: Introduction\nThere\u2019s no mistaking the southern elephant seal; its size alone distinguishes it from other Antarctic seals. The male is particularly large, and has a large, fleshy nose. The combination of large size and prominent nose gives the elephant seal its name.\nThe southern elephant seal\u2019s nose can be inflated to impress females! It also helps the seal to produce loud roars and growls, which are used to intimidate rival males.\nThe southern elephant seal is the most \u2018sexually dimorphic\u2019 of all mammals. (Sexual dimorphism is the difference between males and females). The male southern elephant seal can be an incredible 10 times the weight of the female!\nThe southern elephant seal ranges in color from gray to brown. Its skin often bears scars; the results of the animal\u2019s savage mating battles. Under the tough skin is a layer of blubber.\nThe southern elephant seal\u2019s front flippers are used to haul the animal about on land, while the back flippers provide propulsion in the water.\nAlthough the southern elephant seal is big and cumbersome on land, in the water it is a master swimmer. We\u2019ll find out more about its incredible diving abilities further down the page \u2026\nWhere Do Southern Elephant Seals Live?\nThe southern elephant seal lives in subantarctic and Antarctic regions. There are three main populations. The largest is found in the South Atlantic, with breeding colonies on South Georgia, the Falkland Islands and the Valdes Peninsula, Argentina.\nYou can see where South Georgia is on the map below. Zoom out to see where it is in relation to Antarctica!\nOther groups of southern elephant seals are found in the southern Indian Ocean, and in the subantarctic Pacific Ocean.\nSouthern Elephant Seal Behavior\nThe southern elephant seal spends most of its life at sea, making lone foraging trips during which it travels distances of several thousand kilometers. Between feeding trips, the southern elephant seal regularly comes onto land (known as \u2018hauling out\u2019).\nWhile on land, the southern elephant seal molts (changes its coat and skin) and socializes. Molting can take between 3 and 5 weeks.\nThe southern elephant seal\u2019s blubber not only provides insulation from the cold: on land the seal doesn\u2019t eat, and relies on its blubber for energy. No other seal can stay out of the water for as long as the southern elephant seal.\nSouthern Elephant Seal Diet\nThe southern elephant seal\u2019s diet consists of squid, fish (including cod icefish and lantern fish), krill, crustaceans and sea squirts. It hunts by sight and by using its vibration-sensitive whiskers.\nSouthern elephant seal Diving Abilities\nThe southern elephant seal is a master swimmer and diver, and spends up to 80% of its life underwater. Its torpedo-shaped body helps it cut through the water.\nNo other seal dives as deep, or for as long, as the southern elephant seal. It can dive to depths of over 2,000 m (6562 ft.), and stay underwater for 2 hours.\nThe average dive, however, takes the seal to depths of between 300 and 800 meters (984 and 2625 ft.) and lasts for around 30 minutes.\nSouthern Elephant Seal Family Life\nThe southern elephant seal breeding season takes place between August and November (winter and early spring in the subantarctic). The male is first to return to the breeding grounds. Females arrive later, and form groups called \u2018harems\u2019.\nMales fight for control of the harems. This is a noisy, impressive process, as the huge males \u2013 each weighing over 3 tons \u2013 square up to each other, growling threats and making themselves look tall.\nIf neither backs down, a fight will ensue, in which each male will attack the other by biting and goring.\nThe biggest, toughest male on the beach is known as the \u2018beachmaster\u2019. In small colonies, only he will breed with the females. In larger colonies, other males may get a look in.\nThe female southern elephant seal gives birth to a single pup. It is born with black fur, and feeds on its mother\u2019s milk for 3 to 4 weeks. At this time, the pup will molt, losing its fur, and the female will return to the sea, leaving the pup on the ice.\nSouthern Elephant Seal Predators\nThe adult southern elephant seal is a big and powerful animal, and has little to fear from most other sea animals. Its only enemies are the orca and the great white shark.\nSouthern elephant seal pups are more vulnerable to predation, and have to steer clear of leopard seals and New Zealand sea lions.\nIs The Southern Elephant Seal Endangered?\nThe southern elephant seal is not endangered, and its conservation status is \u2018Least Concern\u2019. Its population is thought to be stable.\nSouthern Elephant Seal Facts For Kids: Questions\nQ1.

Modern taxonomies include three genera (Aepyornis, Mullerornis, and Vorombe), with the species V. titan being both the largest member of the family and the largest bird that ever lived.\nAepyornis skeleton Aepyornis maximus, a member of the extinct elephant bird family Aepyornithidae, weighed about 450 kg (1,000 pounds). Digital Morphology/National Science Foundation Digital Library at the University of Texas at Austin\nFossil remains of elephant birds have been known since the 19th century, and the first full descriptions were made by French zoologist Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. During the 19th century, 13 species were described and classified into three genera\u2014Aepyornis, Mullerornis, and Flacourtia. By the 21st century, however, studies using molecular and morphological techniques consolidated several species, reducing the count to between four and eight.\nBritannica Quiz Animals: Fact or Fiction? Curiosity may have killed the cat, but kinkajous, bluebacks, and mustelids are alive and well in these questions! They\u2019re just some of the amazing animals featured in this fact or fiction quiz.\nElephant bird remains are abundant, and fossil evidence indicates that each species was massively constructed, with conical beaks, short thick legs, three-toed feet, and relatively small wings that were useless for flight. Thus, researchers suggest that these birds were probably slow-moving inhabitants of forests. Some forms of Aepyornis attained very large size, approaching 3 metres (10 feet) high and weighing about 450 kg (1,000 pounds). The largest known species, V. titan, stood at least 3 metres high and weighed on average about 650 kg (1,400 pounds); however, some estimates suggest that the largest individuals could have weighed as much as 860 kg (1,900 pounds), making it the world\u2019s largest known bird.\nThe fossilized remains of elephant bird eggs are also relatively common. Their eggs were the largest eggs laid by any animal. The egg length and width of A. maximus ranged between 26.4 and 34 cm (10.4 and 13.4 inches) and 19.4 and 24.5 cm (7.6 and 9.6 inches), respectively.\nElephant birds occurred relatively late in the fossil record. They were primitive members of the ratites, an evolutionary lineage that includes ostriches, rheas, and emus. Elephant birds survived on Madagascar well into the period of the island\u2019s human occupation, and carbon dating studies suggest that the longest-surviving elephant bird species, A. hildebrandti, lasted in the island\u2019s central highland region until roughly 1,560\u20131,300 years ago. Scientists note that the group\u2019s demise likely resulted from a combination of climate and vegetation change, hunting pressure from humans, and habitat loss due to deforestation."}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Mammoth Compared to the Elephant - Animal Creative Facts", "url": "https://animalcreativefacts.com/mammoth-vs-elephant/", "text": "Mammoth vs elephant both are massive animals with long and big tusks. Some of the experts suggest that elephants degenerate from mammoths, but mammoths are their ancestors. The last population of woolly mammoths left the earth several years ago. At the same time, the population of elephants has seen roaming throughout Asia and Africa.\nIn this article, we will see how these two animals differ when a mammoth compared to the elephant and what will happen if they both fight.\nWhat Does an Elephant Look Like?\nUndoubtedly, elephants are the most unique looking animals and the most significant land animal surviving today on earth. They can be identified with their long characteristic trunks, long floppy ears, and wide thick legs. There is no other animal that can resemble this similar physique. There are two different species of elephants that habitat in two different continents.\nAfrican and Asian elephants also differ in physical features. The ears of African elephants are more significant as compared to Asian elephants. Asian elephants have smaller and rounded ears. Both male and female African elephants have enormous tusks and two fingers on the end of their trunk. On the other hand, Asian elephants have a single finger at the end of their noses.\nWhat is the difference between a lamb and a sheep?\nWhat Does a Woolly Mammoth Look Like?\nWoolly mammoths are known to be closely related to Asian\u2019s elephant that is surviving today. They look much similar to their cousins except for one difference. Woolly mammoths were covered with brown hair of thick coating to keep themselves warm. Their ears were fur-lined, and they had curved tusks that may have been used for fighting. These tusks may also be used for digging to forage their meals under the snow.\nHow Big is a Mammoth Compared to an Elephant?\nAs discussed above, there are two species of elephants, Asian and African elephants. African elephants are the largest among the two species. That grows between 8.2 and 13 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh from 5000 to 14000 pounds. However, Asian elephants are smaller and measure between 6.6 and 9.8 feet tall and weigh 4500 and 11000 pounds.\nOn the other hand, when we compare woolly mammoth vs. elephant size, woolly mammoths were around 13 feet tall and weighed about 6 tons.\nElephant Habitat:\nAfrican elephant inherits in Sub-Saharan Africa, the rainforests of Central and West Africa, and the Sahel desert of Mali. Whereas the Asian elephants can be found in Nepal, India, and Southeast Asia in scrub lands and rain forests.\nWoolly Mammoth Habitat:\nTill now, we have known that woolly mammoths have lived in the frigid range of Arctic. However, mammoths are derived initially from a warmer place. Research has shown that the ancestors of both mammoths and Asian elephants originated in Africa millions of years ago. Later, they spread out into the areas which are today known as Siberia and Northern Canada.\nElephant Diet:\nThe diet of elephants consists of all types of vegetation that includes a variety of grasses, fruits, leaves, roots, and barks. Both the species of elephants are known to consume 165 to 330 of food every day. They spend around 16 hours in eating only.\nWoolly Mammoth Diet:\nWoolly mammoths mainly depend on plant food, and their food has included grasses and sedges, which were enriched with flowering plants, shrubs, mosses, and trees.\nElephant Reproduction:\nThe gestation period in female elephants is 22 months, after which a single calf is born that weighs between 150 and 350 pounds. They stand around 3 feet tall. Calves are born with a short trunk and long tails.\nAre Elephants Endangered?\nAccording to the IUCN list, Asian elephants are classified as endangered. However, it is not known how many Asian elephants are remaining, but their numbers are decreasing.\nOn the other hand, African elephants are considered vulnerable. According to the International Union for Conservation of Natural Resources (IUCN), around 415,000 African elephants survive in the wildlife.\nAccording to the World Wildlife Fund, both species of elephants are threatened, which includes their habitat loss and poaching.\nAlso read difference between male and female rabbits.\nWoolly Mammoth vs Elephant:\nScientific Relationship-\nMammoths and elephants belong to the same family, the Elephantidae, and considered close cousins. Both of them have deviated from 3 to 5 million years ago to create three genera in the Loxodonta family.\nTusk and Teeth-\nThe most observed difference between a mammoth and an elephant is their tusks. Mammoth\u2019s tusks were more extensive than an elephant and more twisted and curved than an elephant\u2019s tusk. The recorded tusk length of a mammoth is 16 feet, while the tusk length of an African elephant is 11 feet. Both the male and female species of mammoth and African elephants carry tusks.\nPhysical Profile-\nMammoths had a humped profile because of their long forelimbs and higher shoulder. While the back of Asian elephants usually appears more rounded. On the other hand, the African elephant has an outline because its rear limbs are longer.\nThe ears of African elephants are more significant than the Asian elephants and mammoths. However, the woolly mammoths had smaller ears that protected them from cold weather. The trunks of these members also differ. African elephants and mammoths have two finger-like extensions at the tip. However, they both have different shapes, while the Asian elephant has only one.\nElephant vs Mammoth: Fight Comparison\nWe have discussed and compared both elephants and mammoths and have seen that both differ in most aspects. Mammoths are way more substantial and more massive than elephants. However, mammoths had an extinct species, and today, only African and Asian elephants had seen in the wild. There is no possibility that mammoths can come back to fight against elephants. But we have to imagine a fight between them; mammoths could have easily won because of their vast size and aggressive behavior.\nAlso read about black lab mixed with golden retriever."}

As Asia\u2019s largest land mammal, hunters seeking ivory tusks and the loss of habitat from deforestation threaten this unique elephant species.\nThe pygmy elephants of Borneo have always been a mystery to science. As a gift to the Sultan of Sulu, many speculated that the animals were shipped from Sumatra or Java and set free on Borneo Island during the elephant trade from the 16th to 18th centuries. It was not until DNA testing took place that scientists realized that these animals were a separate wild population.\nBorneo is the world\u2019s third largest island. But the pygmy elephant occupies only a small portion of rainforests in Sabah, Malaysia. Requiring mineral salts and water, elephants need to be near rivers to maintain their health. Other areas of Borneo are too populated with settlements. This increases hunting pressure and leads to more human-wildlife conflicts, especially when these massive mammals trample gardens and plantations during nightly feeding forays.\nConcentrated in northeastern Borneo, less than 1,000 animals remain in the wild. Satellite tracking along the tributaries of the Kinabatangan River revealed a dramatic decline in elephants, as large forest patches disappeared. Logging also cut off traditional pathways to other food sources and reduced contact among elephant family groups, usually from 40-50 animals, for breeding. Unfortunately, elephants prefer the same floodplain forests sought by logging and oil palm plantation companies.\nConservation groups, such as the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), work with local forestry and wildlife agencies to set up sanctuaries in suitable habitats across the \u201cheart\u201d of Borneo. The recent proof of the pygmy elephant as a separate subspecies was a remarkable achievement. Now the real riddle is how to protect the last remaining wild populations."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Seal Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Seal-facts.html", "text": "seal Facts\nPortrait of a Seal\nThe true seals, also known as the earless seals and the crawling seals, are over 18 species of semi-aquatic marine mammals of the family Phocidae. They are one of three families within the super family known as pinnipeds.\nPinniped means feather(pinni) foot(ped) in Latin. The other two families are the walrus, alone in its own genus, and the sea lions.\nSea lions and fur seals are known as eared seals or walking seals. True seals differ from sea lions in that they have no external ears, and are unable to walk on all-fours as the sea lions can.\nThe fur seals are also in the sea lion family and are not true seals, although they are called by the name \"seal\", but all the pinnipeds, seals, walruses and sea lions, are all seals, as lions and cheetahs and domestic cats are all cats. So it is not wrong to call a sea lion or a walrus a seal, just as it would not be wrong to call a jaguar or a mountain lion a cat, just a little less accurate.\nThe seals ancient ancestors were land animals, probably somewhat similar to otters.\nFor reasons unknown, these terrestrial creatures returned to the ocean about 20 million years ago, where they have since become the most successful and widely distributed family of carnivores in the world.\nSeals live mostly in very cold, often frozen environments, and their bodies are layered in blubber to protect them from the elements. Blood actually migrates to the exterior layers of blubber when the animal needs to cool down, and flows back to the interior layers, close to the bodies core, when the temperature is colder.\nThe body of a seal is specifically structured for life in the water, with a smooth, torpedo shaped torso, and flattened, powerful flippers, like four large swim fins instead of feet. In fact, the swim-fins scuba divers and backyard snorkelers use were modeled after the unique, compressed and web-toed feet of a seal.\nMost seal species live in very large social groups called colonies that may come together to sunbathe in masses of hundreds, and take to the beach to mate and raise young in tightly packed gatherings of thousands.\nOn land they are extremely cumbersome, and must move their often enormous bodies by wriggling almost like a worm. Some species move around by bouncing, some pull themselves forward with their front flippers, and many seals will also occasionally roll their bodies one or two revolutions to one side or the other if they wish to move short distances.\nIn the ocean though, seals swim with exceeding grace and swiftness, using all four flippers for both propulsion and steering. Some species can dive 1000 feet deep and remain submerged for over an hour.\nThey have larger volumes of blood and a greater concentration of oxygen in the blood than any land animals, and they expel all oxygen from their lungs before they dive, avoiding issues such as \"the bends\".\nIn dives as deep as 1000 feet and as long as 100 minutes, their special bodies survive on only the oxygen in their blood.\nseal lifestyle and reproduction\nThere are over 18 species of true seals, most of which display varying extents of sexual dimorphism - an obvious difference in appearance between males and females. Depending on the species, male seals can be larger than females by as much as five times, and in several species, such as the hooded and elephant seals, mature males have distinct pendulous noses and other facial features.\nSeals are highly social and desire close contact, but don't really have close relationships. They may move about among hundreds of other seals happily communing with dozens of individuals. Although they live in large groups seals are solitary hunters diving several hundred feet deep in search of fish, crustaceans and squid.\nLifestyle naturally varies among the many species, but seals, in general, are promiscuous, and males do not contribute to the raising of young. Seals migrate between breeding grounds and feeding grounds, traveling several hundred to up to two thousand miles a year.\nWhen females arrive at the breeding grounds, which are called rookeries, the males have already staked claims to prime areas, battling each other with loud roaring, charges and sometimes violent contests.\nFemales arrive already pregnant from the previous season, and give birth to one baby, called a pup, within a few days of arriving. After the birth of the baby the mother seal will remain on land for up to 6 weeks, nursing the pup till it is three times its birth weight.\nIn some species, such as the familiar harp seal, the mother fasts for a few weeks, doing nothing but nursing her newborn, then, after only 4 to 5 weeks, she leaves the pup for good, returning to the ocean to mate again.\nThe harp seal pups are snow white in color to camouflage them in their snowy environment, which is critical over the next week or two, as they begin to forage and fend for themselves.\nOther seals spend more time nurturing their young ones, but many species use this method of complete dedication by the mother for a few weeks and then basically a cold turkey abandonment.\nGroups of forlorn pups gather on beaches calling for their mothers and falling prey to killer whales, and polar bears. Eventually the strongest survivors take to the water and find their way to the feeding grounds which may be hundreds of miles away.\nwhat is the difference between seals and sea lions?\nseal on the beach\nsea lion running\nSea lions are members of the seal or pinniped family. The word pinniped means \"flipper feet\" or \"feather feet\" and includes three types of semi-aquatic marine mammals. The walrus, the \"true seals\" and the \"eared seals\" or \"walking seals\".\nThere are 7 species of sea lions and 9 species of fur seals that make up the \"earred seals\".\nEared seals differ from true seals in that they have external ears, larger, more powerful forelimbs, and can rotate their hind limbs forward and beneath them. These differences in skeletal structure allow the sea lion and fur seal to not only sit in a semi-upright position, (that classic pose), but also to walk and even run on all-fours.\nIn contrast, the rear limbs of true seals are fused together and are permanently facing rearward making walking impossible.\nAll pinnipeds, even walruses, are considered seals, in the same broad sense that leopards are considered cats, so it is not incorrect to call a sea lion a seal, just less precise.\nEared seals spend a great deal of time on land, breeding and sunning on the shores. With long, powerful front flippers, their natural position is upright with the chest raised off the ground. Their rear legs are two separate, front-facing flippers that can be rotated under the body, and they can rise up and move around with a two beat gate.\nAlso often referred to as the \"walking seals\", the eared seals can actually walk, and even run, quite rapidly when necessary.\nThe \"true seals\" have no external ear flaps, smaller front flippers and rearward facing hind limbs that are fused together into one scalloped flipper. They move across land by stretching their upper bodies out and arching their backs to pull themselves forward.\nTrue seals also swim differently from eared seals, getting most of their propulsion from their fused, tail-like rear flippers and undulating motions similar to a dolphin to propel themselves, while the eared seals use their strong front flippers as big, highly effective oars, appearing to fly through the water like birds.\nWalruses have skeletons designed more like the eared seals, but have no ears. They move like the true seals in the water, but like the eared seals on land, and so are somewhere in between these two groups, and are classified in a genus of their own. - Seal Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

These noses are multi-chambered and can be inflated with air to help the male make incredibly loud roars which intimidate rivals and impress females.\nThe female Southern elephant seal averages about 10 ft in total length, but the male Southern elephant seal averages 16 feet in length and weighs over 7000 pounds. The biggest adult males can be almost 20 feet long and top 8500 pounds.\nThe elephant seal is not only the largest pinniped, (way bigger than a walrus) but also the largest terrestrial carnivore, dwarfing such animals as African lions (826 pounds record weight) and polar bears,(2209 pounds record weight).\nFound on the beaches of New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa, the Southern elephant seal is land-bound for two separate one month long periods each year.\nFirst is mating season where males will remain on the beach and fast for weeks while establishing territories, and females will fast while feeding newborns. Males may battle fiercely during this time and things can get violent.\nMost adult male elephant seals have many scars from battles with sharp-toothed rivals. After breeding season, they return to the water to refuel, but then beach themselves again for molting season, where they return to their mating grounds to lounge about while they regrow their top layer of skin and fur in one 30 day marathon.\nElephant seals are the most adept deep sea divers of any pinniped capable of underwater excursions of 100 minutes or more without taking a breath. - Elephant Seal Facts\nelephant seal big bulls battle\nlife on the ice\nroaring leopard seal\nThe majority of seal species are located in some of the coldest environments in the world. Some species spend the majority of their lives on or under the Arctic ice cap coming up for air at strategic holes that they create themselves.\nSeals in these icy regions are well equipped with strong, sharp claws on their front flippers that they dig breathing holes with. They can maintain breathing holes through layers of ice up to 6 feet thick with constant tending.\nSome Arctic seals like the ringed seal, a staple of the polar bears diet, actually dig out caves in the snow that covers their breathing holes. They hollow out an area known as a lair, and under the snow cover they can come up out of the water.\nRinged seals raise their pups in the lairs and usually maintain more than one at a time so they can avoid predators. Polar bears have an astounding sense of smell, however, and can detect seals hiding in lairs.\nThe vastness of the Arctic is the seals best defense, but if a polar bear does discover its hiding spot, the ringed seal still has a good chance of escaping back down the breathing hole into the ocean water below before the bear can claw its way though the ceiling of hard packed snow from above.\nAnother notorious ice dwelling seal is the rather fierce leopard seal. These very unique seal species take some of the largest prey of all pinnipeds, such as penguins and other seal species.\nBut as impressive a hunter as they are, one of their dietary staples is the tiny invertebrate called krill. Leopard seals teeth are specially designed to sieve krill out of mouthfuls of sea water.\nThey are by far the most solitary of the seal species, living alone on the ice floes of Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands. The leopard seal earns its name with its spotted coat, its effective hunting style, and its often gaping mouthful of dagger sharp teeth.\nseals on ice - hunting and hunted\nall in the colony, all in the raft\nA group of seals on land is called a colony, and a group of seals in the water is called a raft.\nSeals can come together during breeding season and at certain popular breeding grounds in masses of hundreds, and sometimes thousands. Crowding is not a problem, in fact close body contact is desired by most seal species.\nThere is lots of lounging, floating, feeding and noisy discussion in the life of a seal. A raft of seals floating in the water may appear to be a larger creature to some predators who will think twice.\nSeals in water will regulate their body temperature by raising a flipper or tail out into the air. Many seal species spend equal amounts of time on land and sea, preferring isolated beaches, rocky outcrops and ice floats.\nPopular lounging areas are called \"haul outs\" or the term can be used to describe the activity, as in \"the seals are hauled out on the beach.\" Some species, such as elephant seals and leopard seals spend the majority of their lives in the water, only coming on land to molt once a year, and fight for breeding territory.\nMating itself takes place both on land and in the water, depending on species.\nMolting requires seals to remain on land where they can more easily regulate their temperature. Fur can be seen sloughing off seals and sea lions in huge chunks during this period.\nWhile human beings loose skin cells on a daily basis, and may replace 10 pounds of epidermis a year in tiny increments, molting involves the complete replacement of the epidermis skin and fur in the course of just a few weeks,\na few more seal facts\nSeals are known as the true seals, the earless seals or the crawling seals\nA male seal is called a bull, a female is called a cow, and a baby is called a pup\nA group of seals is called a colony on land, and a raft when in the water.\nThe male Southern elephant seal can grow to the size of a small truck weighing over 7000 pounds and measuring over 16 feet long.\nSome seals can stay underwater for up to an hour without taking a breath\nSeals replace their skin and their fur every year in one 30 day long molt.\nSeal the seal is a\ncarnivorous (meat-eating)\ndiurnal (awake during the day)\naquatic (lives in and near water)\npinniped(webbed digits)\nphocid (true seal family) mammal (animal with mammary glands and hair follicles)\nScientific Classification\nClass - Mammalia\nOrder - Carnivora\nGenus - Phocidae\nSpecies - phoca Seal Facts - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT bull cow pup group GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD colony, raft varied oceans fish, squid ENEMIES ENDANGERED TOP SPEED GENDER DIFFERENCE shark, orca polar bear threatened 25 mph Males often much larger LENGTH\nFEMALE WEIGHT FEMALE LENGTH MALE WEIGHT MALE 4 - 9 feet 130 - 1500 pounds 5 - 18 feet 200 - 8000 pounds ESTRUS GESTATION BIRTH LENGTH BIRTH WEIGHT 1 x year 10 - 14 months 1 - 4 feet 10 - 50 pounds RAISED BY # OF YOUNG AT BIRTH EYES OPEN mother 1, rarely 2 furred, sighted at birth WEANED INDEPENDENT MATURITY LIFESPAN 12-16 months 2 years 4 - 10 years 10 - 30 years"}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "10 Incredible Elephant Facts! - AZ Animals", "url": "https://azanimal.easterndns.com/blog/10-incredible-elephant-facts/", "text": "Elephants are fascinating creatures that have been studied closely by humans for thousands of years. Today, there are three remaining species of elephants: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. These unique species have many amazing qualities and adaptations which have helped them thrive both in their native habitats and in captivity.\nYou likely already know that elephants are the world\u2019s largest land mammals, but have you heard of any of these other lesser-known elephant facts?\n1. An elephant molar tooth is roughly the size of a brick and can weigh anywhere from 4 to 8 pounds!\nElephants are strictly herbivorous animals, but they still need large teeth to break down the massive amount of plant material they consume each day. They typically have four molars total at any given time, but it is typical for an elephant to go through six sets of molars or more during its lifetime!\nThese wide, flat molar teeth have ridges on them to help grind up plants like tree bark and branches as efficiently as possible. Interestingly, African and Asian elephants have differently shaped ridges on their molars; African elephants\u2019 molar ridges are diamond-shaped, while those of Asian elephants have a more cylindrical shape.\nCan you spot the elephant molar teeth? They weigh as much as a brick! Eddi_m/Shutterstock.com\n2. The oldest elephant on record was an Asian elephant named Changalloor Dakshayani, who lived to a robust 89 years old!\nBoth African and Asian elephants have long lifespans. Asian elephants in the wild typically live anywhere from 40 to 50 years, while African elephants live a bit longer, at around 60 years.\nChangalloor Dakshayani was originally bought by India\u2019s Travancore royal family and was donated to the Thiruvarattu Kavu Temple in 1949 when she was 19 years old. She was later transferred to another facility, the Chenkalloor Mahadeva Temple, in the late 1960s.\nIn 2016, she was officially certified as the oldest elephant in captivity by Kolkata, India\u2019s Univeral Records Forum. She died on February 5th, 2019, at a care facility in Pappanamcode, the capital of Kerala, India, at the ripe, old age of 89.\n3. African elephants have larger ears than Asian elephants to keep themselves cool.\nJust by looking at Asian elephants compared to their African counterparts, it is obvious their ears are far smaller and more rounded in appearance. The main reason for this difference is because they live in vastly different climates.\nWhile Asian elephants live in cooler jungle areas with a lot of plant cover for shade, African elephants live in much hotter, harsher desert-like environments. Over time, this has resulted in African elephants evolving to have much larger ears, which they use sort of as fans to cool their massive bodies off under the brutal African sun.\nAdditionally, the ears of the African elephant have huge networks of capillaries running through them which work to release excess heat during the elephants\u2019 long, arduous treks through the African savanna.\nAn Elephant challenges the photographer in the wilds of Africa. Elephants are the world\u2019s largest land animal, with male African elephants reaching 3m tall and weighing between 4,000 -7,500kg. Peter Betts/Shutterstock.com\n4. The only known occurrence of Asian and African elephants crossbreeding, a male calf named Motty, died after only 10 days in captivity.\nAsian and African elephants never come in contact in the wild, so they have never crossbred naturally. However, this hasn\u2019t stopped humans from trying to breed the two species with each other in captivity.\nWhile there are a few rumored occurrences of Asian/African hybrid elephants being born to various zoos and circuses throughout history, only one has actually been confirmed. In 1978 at the Chester Zoo in Cheshire, England, a calf named Motty was born to an Asian elephant mother, Sheba, and an African elephant father, Jumbolino. Motty was named after the zoo\u2019s founder, George Mottershead.\nSadly, the calf only lived for 10 days before succumbing to an umbilical infection. Today, Motty\u2019s body is preserved at London\u2019s Natural History Museum.\n5. Elephants can recognize their own reflection in mirrors!\nSelf-awareness is an extremely rare trait amongst animals, and it has only been consistently demonstrated by and recorded in three species: humans, chimpanzees, and orangutans. However, the \u201cmirror test\u201d has been conducted on many other species, to mixed outcomes.\nIn more recent years, many other animals such as dolphins, magpies, and even elephants have displayed promising results when subjected to the test. In 2006, a standard mirror test was done at the Bronx Zoo on three Asian elephants living at the facility.\nAmazingly, the elephants did not greet their reflection in the same way that they would usually approach other elephants! They were observed to touch the mirror and closely observe themselves, repeating movements like swinging their trunks and moving their heads. It was at this point that the researchers realized the elephants actually understood that they were looking at a reflection of themselves and not another member of their species!\nAn elephant underwater Willyam Bradberry/Shutterstock.com\n6. An elephant\u2019s trunk has around 40,000 distinct muscles!\nBy comparison, we humans have around 600 muscles throughout our entire bodies. An elephant\u2019s trunk is extremely powerful and flexible, with those 40,000 muscles divided into even more individual units to give it a wide range of motion and dexterity.\nWith these 40,000 muscles, an elephant\u2019s trunk is able to pick up objects weighing up to 700 pounds! This is a huge help to them when feeding, as they use their trunks to rip bark clean off of trees and pull entire branches into their mouths with ease.\n7. A baby elephant can weigh over 250 pounds at birth.\nIt\u2019s no secret that elephants are enormous animals, but did you know just how huge their babies are? A newborn elephant calf usually weighs around 250 pounds, is three feet tall, and can stand up on its own within 30 minutes of being born. This is an amazing feat, considering how heavy they are even at such a young age!\nDespite this size and strength at such a young age, though, baby elephants must stay very close to their mothers early on in order to survive. This is because they are nearly blind at birth and have to rely on their other senses, such as sound, touch, and smell to move around.\nBaby elephants weight 250 pounds at birth! paula french/Shutterstock.com\n8. An elephant\u2019s tusks are actually modified incisor teeth.\nIn most species of animals, incisor teeth are primarily used to bite into and tear apart food. An elephant\u2019s tusks are used in a similar way, often tearing into tree bark, branches, and even the ground itself with ease. These tusks grow continuously throughout an elephant\u2019s life and are worn down gradually as the animal uses them to eat, dig, and even defend itself.\nIn addition, the tusks help to protect the elephant\u2019s tender trunk. They are positioned perfectly on either side of the trunk to shield it from predators and damage from repeated use.\n9. Elephants can\u2019t jump.\nWe\u2019ve all seen it before: an elephant in a cartoon leaping in fright at the sight of a mouse or other rodent. In reality, though, elephants\u2019 legs aren\u2019t designed for jumping at all.\nIn addition to being too heavy to lift themselves off the ground, the bones in an elephant\u2019s legs all point downward and lack the flexibility and strength to push themselves off the ground and into the air. Elephants always keep at least one leg on the ground, even while running at speeds of up to 25 mph!\nAn Asian elephant in the beautiful forest at Kanchanaburi province in Thailand.\n10. Elephants can sense seismic activity with their feet and trunks.\nScientists at Stanford University have discovered that elephants use their trunks and feet to pick up on seismic signals given off by other elephants hundreds of feet away!\nThis behavior is known as seismic communication. Many species of smaller animals use it to find mates, prey, and new territory, but it is much rarer amongst large animals like elephants. It is believed that elephants can even sense oncoming thunderstorms with their trunks and feet and will move towards them to find water!"}

But in 2000, scientists were able to analyze the DNA of the elephants and discovered that the African elephant that lives on the savanna and the African elephant that lives in the rainforest are actually two distinctly different species. So now the answer to your Trivial Pursuit question would be three!\nHow many species of elephants are alive today?\nAn elephant herd on the run iStock.com/johan63\nThere are presently three species of elephants alive in the world today, there are:\nAfrican bush elephant : The largest elephant species\n: The largest elephant species African forest elephant : The \u201cnewest\u201d species of elephant that DNA evidence revealed to be a distinct species in 2000\n: The \u201cnewest\u201d species of elephant that DNA evidence revealed to be a distinct species in 2000 Asian elephant: Elephants that live across Asia and have significant physical differences versus African elephants\nNow, you may have heard of other types of elephants as well. The Asian elephant has 3-4 (scientists are still debating the number) of subspecies that are subgroups of the Asian elephant. Let\u2019s dive into the differences between each type of elephant!\nSpecies #1: African bush elephant\nAn African bush elephant on the savanna\nThe African bush elephant is the largest of the elephants and is characterized by large flappy ears that are the shape of Africa. They have long trunks and large white tusks. Compared to the African forest elephant, the savanna elephants have longer front legs compared to their back legs, their ears are bigger and their tusks are more curved and point outward. Another difference is they live in the savanna, as their name suggests, and eat mostly on grass.\nSpecies #2: African forest elephant\nAn African Forest Elephant mother with her calf, at the Dzanga saline (a forest clearing) in the Central African Republic.\nThe African forest elephant is smaller than the savanna elephant and their ears are more oval shaped. They too have long trunks and large tusks but their tusks are straighter and point down. The tusks also have a pinkish tint which makes them more susceptible\nto poachers. Forest elephants live in the rainforest where they can find lots of fruit, the main source of their diet. They also eat grass, leaves, seeds and tree bark.\nSpecies #3: Asian elephant\nAn Asian elephant with a newborn Mogens Trolle/Shutterstock.com\nThe Asian elephant is smaller than the African bush elephant and can be dark gray to dark brown and have depigmented skin (splotches of unpigmented skin). There are 3-4 subspecies of Asian elephants based on the regions they live in. One distinct difference between Asian and African elephants is the head of the Asian elephant is twin-domed, meaning it has a groove down the middle. Another difference is that only male Asian elephants can grow tusks whereas both male and female African elephants can have tusks. Looking at the three-four subspecies of Asian elephants here are some of the unique facts about each:\nIndian elephant : Most common Asian elephant with 26,000-30,000 left in Asia.\n: Most common Asian elephant with 26,000-30,000 left in Asia. Sri Lankan elephant : Largest subspecies in size weighing 4,000-12,000lbs.\n: Largest subspecies in size weighing 4,000-12,000lbs. Sumatran elephant : These elephants have skin that is more universal in color and has less depigmented areas. They are smaller than the Indian and Sri Lankan elephants.\n: These elephants have skin that is more universal in color and has less depigmented areas. They are smaller than the Indian and Sri Lankan elephants. Bornean elephant: Smallest Asian subspecies, sometimes called the Bornean pygmy elephant.\nAs we are able to do more research on each of these specifies and subspecies we can learn more about their habitats, diets and reproduction so that we can increase their numbers and get them off the endangered list. Each type of elephant has a critical role in contributing to their ecosystem and as humans we can help protect them so they can thrive again!\nTypes of Extinct Elephants\nWooly mammoths went extinct around 4,000 years ago.

Their Habitats Explained - AZ Animals", "url": "https://a-z-animals.com/blog/where-do-elephants-live-their-habitats-explained/", "text": "When we named elephants we gave a big clue as to where they live. The African elephant lives\u2026in Africa. The Asian elephant? Yes, in Asia. But where in Africa and Asia? What kind of habitat do these giant mammals have? Do all elephants live in the same kind of habitat? Let\u2019s take a look at the three elephant species and where they live.\nWhere Do Elephants Live?\nAn elephant grazing across its habitat Stephen Bridger/Shutterstock.com\nUp until the end of the last ice age, elephant-like creatures roamed across the massive Eurasian Steppe and across much of North America.\nHowever, today, elephants are limited to temperate areas in both Africa and Asia. Africa is home to two different elephant species. The African bush elephant lives across savannas and plains while the African forest elephant lives in rainforests and other wooded areas that are dense in vegetation.\nLikewise, the Asian elephant also lives mostly in areas that are more dense with vegetation. Its range stretches from India to the islands of Indonesia. Let\u2019s dig into the habitat of all three elephant species.\nWhere Does the African Bush Elephant Live?\nElephants communicate in a variety of ways \u2013 including sounds like trumpet calls (some sounds are too low for people to hear), body language, touch and scent. Sadly, about 90% of African elephants have been wiped out in the last century due to poaching.\nThere are two species of elephants that live in Africa, the African bush and African forest elephant. The African bush elephant lives in the sub-Saharan Africa in countries like Zimbabwe, Kenya and South Sudan, but are native in 37 different African countries. They can live in wooded savannas, grasslands and even semi-desert areas. A savanna is a large open grassland with small trees scattered throughout. Think of the set of the Lion King! The Serengeti is the most well-known savanna area.\nElephants need a large area to search for food and water. They spend most of their days roaming for grasses, bark, roots and fruit. Each elephant needs to consume around 300 lbs of food per day! They also have to find sources of water to provide the needed 30-50 gallons a day.\nAs humans develop more areas, the available land for elephants and other wildlife shrinks and is making it more and more difficult to sustain the large numbers of elephants that used to roam the earth. All three elephant species are now listed as endangered by the IUCN.\nThe African forest elephant\nMale forest elephant at (forest clearing), Ivindo National Park, Gabon. Peter H. Wrege / Creative Commons\nThe African forest elephant lives in the rainforests of central and west Africa along the equator with most of them living in Gabon. In contrast to the wide open savanna habitat, the rainforests are dense and packed with trees and vegetation. This makes it difficult for researchers to count them. The main diet of forest elephants is fruit so they must forage for food throughout the day to find enough fruit to support themselves. They also eat leaves, grass and tree bark.\nThe Asian elephant\nAn Asian elephant in the beautiful forest at Kanchanaburi province in Thailand.\nThe Asian elephant lives in southeast Asia. There are three subspecies of Asian elephants classified by where they live; the Sri Lankan elephant, Indian elephant and Sumatran elephant. There are also elephant that live in Borneo, the Bornean elephant, but researchers do not yet agree if they are actually a distinct separate subspecies."}

Here are some helpful clues for telling the 2 species apart: African elephants have very large ears that are shaped like the continent of Africa, while Asian elephants have smaller ears. Also, an Asian elephant's back is rounded, but an African elephant's back has a dip or sway in it. Their trunks are a little different, too: African elephants have 2 \u201cfingers\u201d at the end of their trunk, but Asian elephants have only 1."}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Does a Video Show an Elephant Painting a Picture of an Elephant?", "url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/elephant-painting/", "text": "YouTube: \u201cElephant Painting,\u201d version posted in mid-2010s:\nThe video seen above is \u201ctrue\u201d in the basic sense that it captures the real phenomenon of elephants who perform the physical process of creating drawings by holding brushes in their trunks and applying them to cards mounted on easels. A BBC News article described an exhibition of such paintings at an Edinburgh gallery in 1996:\nPictures which were painted by elephants have gone on display at an Edinburgh gallery. Art graduate Victoria Khunapramot, 26, has brought the paintings from Thailand to the Dundas Gallery on Dundas Street. They include \u201cself-portraits\u201d by Paya, who is said to be the only elephant to have mastered his own likeness. Paya is one of six elephants whose keepers have taught them how to hold a paintbrush in their trunks. They drop the brush when they want a new colour. Mrs Khunapramot, from Newington, said: \u201cMany people cannot believe that an elephant is capable of producing any kind of artwork, never mind a self-portrait. \u201cBut they are very intelligent animals and create the entire paintings with great gusto and concentration within just five or 10 minutes \u2014 the only thing they cannot do on their own is pick up a paintbrush, so it gets handed to them. \u201cThey are trained by artists who fine-tune their skills, and they paint in front of an audience in their conservation village, leaving no one in any doubt that they are authentic elephant creations.\u201d Mrs Khunapramot, who set up the Thai Fine Art company after studying the history of art in St Andrews and business management at Edinburgh\u2019s Napier University, said it took about a month to train the animals to paint.\nThe web site of the Asian Elephant Art and Conservation Project explains the background behind elephants\u2019 being taught to paint, with the resulting artworks being sold and the monies so raised being used to fund elephant conservation projects. The site includes a video gallery that features several clips of pachyderm artists in action similar to the one linked above, as well as galleries displaying the individual elephants\u2019 works. (Based on the similarity of drawings, we\u2019d guess that the elephant shown in the example video is Hong, a nine-year-old female living at the Maetaman Elephant Camp in Thailand.)\nHowever, although these animals may be creating artworks in a purely physical sense, critics contend that the elephants participating in this activity are not actually \u201cpainting\u201d in any meaningful sense of the word: They aren\u2019t engaging in any form of creativity, much less abstractly making free-form portraits of whatever tickles their pachydermic fancies at the moment; rather, they\u2019re simply actors performing in tourist trap attractions in Thailand, where they do nothing more than outline and color specific drawings they\u2019ve been painstakingly trained to replicate \u2014 and they manage that much only while receiving a good deal of prompting and guidance throughout the process from their mahout (trainers).\nAs zoologist Desmond Morris wrote after he and scientist Richard Dawkins traveled to Thailand in 2008 to investigate the \u201celephant painting\u201d phenomenon:\nSo are these endearing mammals truly artistic? The answer, as politicians are fond of saying, is yes and no. Let me describe exactly what happens. A painting session begins with three heavy easels being wheeled into position. On each easel a large piece of white card (30in x 20in) has been fixed underneath a strong wooden frame. Each elephant is positioned in front of her easel and is given a brush loaded with paint by her mahout. He pushes the brush gently into the end of her trunk. The man then stands to one side of his animal\u2019s neck and watches intently as the brush starts to make lines on the card. Then the empty brush is replaced by another loaded one, and the painting continues until the picture is complete. The elephant then turns towards its audience, bows deeply and is rewarded with bananas. The paintings are then removed from their frames and offered for sale. They are quickly snapped up by people who have been astonished by what they have just witnessed. To most of the members of the audience, what they have seen appears to be almost miraculous. Elephants must surely be almost human in intelligence if they can paint pictures of flowers and trees in this way. What the audience overlooks are the actions of the mahouts as their animals are at work. This oversight is understandable because it is difficult to drag your eyes away from the brushes that are making the lines and spots. However, if you do so, you will notice that, with each mark, the mahout tugs at his elephant\u2019s ear. He nudges it up and down to get the animal to make a vertical line, or pulls it sideways to get a horizontal one. To encourage spots and blobs he tugs the ear forward, towards the canvas. So, very sadly, the design the elephant is making is not hers but his. There is no elephantine invention, no creativity, just slavish copying. Investigating further, after the show is over, it emerges that each of the so-called artistic animals always produces exactly the same image, time after time, day after day, and week after week. Mook always paints a bunch of flowers, Christmas always does a tree, and Pimtong a climbing plant. Each elephant works to a set routine, guided by her master.\nThe following video clip reveals something of how much an elephant is actually guided by its mahout during the painting process:\nOther critics, such as One Green Planet\u2019s Kate Good, contend that not only is the elephant painting phenomenon a misleading show put on to garner money from tourists, but that the animals who participate in it have been abused; therefore, visitors to Thailand should shun the purchase of such works and avoid sharing videos in which the abuse can be seen."}

But there are some animals that are pretty terrifying, weird and downright spooky in ways that might make you sleep a little less soundly this Friday the 13th. From blood-squirting lizards to deceivingly cute killer sea otters, there are plenty of creepy behaviours in the natural world, that far outdo the supernatural.\nHere are 13 strange and terrifying facts about animals that\u2019ll send a shiver down your spine.\n1. This frog will kill you with a single touch.\nThe golden poison dart frog (Phyllobates terribilis) is the size of a paperclip... but don\u2019t be deceived by its tiny size! Its skin is coated in a lethal toxin that leaves the nerves and muscles of its victims inactive, leading to death. This little frog contains about one milligram of poison, enough to kill 10 - 20 humans if the poison reaches their bloodstreams.\n2. This species doesn\u2019t get the nickname \u2018Black Death\u2019 for nothing.\nCape buffaloes (Syncerus caffer) are extremely dangerous because of their unpredictable nature. That, plus their sheer strength and robust physique can knock out prey in an instant. They stalk and circle their prey before charging at speeds of up to 56 kilometers per hour \u2013 so, if you see one peeping at you through the African savanna grasses, you\u2019d better duck for cover.\n3. There are lizards that can literally squirt blood from their eyeballs.\nAt least eight species of horned lizard (Phrynosoma) can aim and squirt blood from their eyes. They restrict the blood flow to their head until the pressure builds up, rupturing the vessels in their eyelids. They do this as a defence mechanism to confuse their predators. Freaky!\n4. Meerkats are actually baby-killing beasts.\nIf you thought your family dynamics were crazy, you haven\u2019t seen anything. The dominant female meerkat (Suricata suricatta) in a clan controls breeding and kills the young of those that aren\u2019t her own, ensuring that her own offspring has the best chance of survival.\n5. Australia is home to possibly the most venomous marine animal in the world.\nThe largest box jellyfish (Chironex fleckeri) is common to Australia\u2019s northern oceans (lucky us) and its sting can cause cardiac arrest in its victims. With tentacles that can grow up to three metres, it\u2019s probably not ideal to go swimming with these horrors during the summer holidays.\n6. One slip of the foot and you\u2019re dead with these venomous snails.\nWhile they might look beautiful, cone snails (Conus) have one of the world\u2019s most painful and fatal \u2018stings\u2019. They fire a harpoon that can cause muscle paralysis and respiratory failure. Nicknamed the \u2018cigarette snail\u2019, its victims are said to only have enough time to smoke a cigarette before death.\n7. You\u2019re more likely to be killed by a cow than a shark.\nYep, you read that right. More people die annually from getting kicked or stepped on by a cow. Also, it\u2019s said that cows all over the world, simultaneously face the same direction while grazing. How\u2019s that for a conspiracy theory? (Now that\u2019s spooky).\n8. A hungry female black widow + mating = cannibalism.\nFemale black widow spiders will often eat their male partner while mating.\n9. Sea otters are so cute. They can also be aggressive killers.\nThere have been reports that these lovable sea otters (Enhydra lutris) are serial harassers. When males mate, they\u2019ll grab the female and aggressively bite her face. Not really the perfect date.\n10. These bats, zey vant to suck your blood.\nAptly named vampire bats, the most common one feeds solely on the blood of mammals, including humans. They\u2019ll identify a warm spot on your skin to bite then create an incision with their razor-sharp teeth, lapping up the blood from the wound. Best to stay out of dark alleyways at night.\n11. And the 'Parasite of the Year' award goes to...\nCymothoa exigua, also known as the tongue-eating louse, is a parasite that latches onto a fish\u2019s tongue and feeds on the blood vessels. Eventually, the tongue falls off and the parasite attaches itself to what\u2019s left and becomes the fish's new tongue. Isn't nature wonderful?\n12. I'm Australian, I'm cute and I'm poisonous...\nThe male platypus has half-inch poisonous spurs located on the inner side of each back ankle. Scientists believe that males use these spurs to compete with rivals during the breeding season. A kick from one of these bad boys is potent enough to kill small animals and cause intense pain in humans.\n13. The most terrifying animal of all is...\nWith over 7.4 billion people and counting, the human population is putting immense pressure on our planet as demand for the Earth\u2019s natural resources grows. What\u2019s terrifying is that Australia is among seven countries responsible for over 50% of global biodiversity loss. Now that\u2019s a horrific statistic.\nHappy Friday the 13th\u2026 and good luck sleeping well tonight."}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "African bush elephant - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_bush_elephant", "text": "Species of mammal\nThe African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), also known as the African savanna elephant, is one of two living African elephant species. It is the largest living terrestrial animal, with bulls reaching a shoulder height of up to 3.96 m (13 ft 0 in) and a body mass of up to 10.4 t (11.5 short tons). It is distributed across 37 African countries and inhabits forests, grasslands and woodlands, wetlands and agricultural land. Since 2021, it has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. It is threatened foremost by habitat destruction, and in parts of its range also by poaching for meat and ivory. The menstrual cycle lasts three to four months, and females are pregnant for 22 months, the longest gestation period of any mammal. It is a social mammal, travelling in herds composed of cows and their offspring. Adult bulls usually live alone or in small bachelor groups. It is a herbivore, feeding on grasses, creepers, herbs, leaves, and bark.\nTaxonomy [ edit ]\nElephas africanus was the scientific name proposed by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in 1797. Loxodonte was proposed as generic name for African elephants by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cuvier in 1825. This name refers to the lozenge-shaped enamel of the molar teeth, which differs significantly from the shape of the Asian elephant's molar enamel.\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, several zoological specimens were described by naturalists and curators of natural history museums from various parts of Africa, including:\nToday, these names are all considered synonyms.\nPhylogeny [ edit ]\nA genetic study based on mitogenomic analysis revealed that the African and Asian elephant genetically diverged about 7.6 million years ago. Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear DNA of African bush and forest elephants, Asian elephant, woolly mammoth and American mastodon revealed that the African bush elephant and the African forest elephant form a sister group that genetically diverged at least 1.9 million years ago. They are therefore considered distinct species. Gene flow between the two species however, might have occurred after the split.\nSkulls of African bush elephant (left) and African forest elephant (right)\nSkull of a male African bush elephant on display at the Museum of Osteology, Oklahoma City\nSkeleton of a female African bush elephant on display at the Museum of Osteology, Oklahoma City\nCharacteristics [ edit ]\nSkin and ears [ edit ]\nThe African bush elephant has grey skin with scanty hairs. Its large ears cover the whole shoulder, and can grow as large as 2 m \u00d7 1.5 m (6.6 ft \u00d7 4.9 ft). Large ears help to reduce body heat; flapping them creates air currents and exposes large blood vessels on the inner sides to increase heat loss during hot weather. The African bush elephant's ears are pointed and triangular shaped. Its occipital plane slopes forward. Its back is shaped markedly concave. Its sturdy tusks are curved out and point forward.\nSize [ edit ]\nAverage size of adults with the largest recorded individual included\nThe African bush elephant is the largest and heaviest land animal on Earth, with a maximum recorded shoulder height of an adult bull of 3.96 m (13.0 ft) and an estimated weight of up to 10.4 t (11.5 short tons). On average, males are about 3.20 m (10.5 ft) tall at the shoulder and weigh 6.0 t (6.6 short tons), while females are much smaller at about 2.60 m (8.53 ft) tall at the shoulder and 3.0 t (3.3 short tons) in weight. Elephants attain their maximum stature when they complete the fusion of long-bone epiphyses, occurring in males around the age of 40 and females around the age of 25.\nTrunk [ edit ]\nThe trunk is a prehensile elongation of the upper lip and nose. Short tactile hair grows on the trunk, which has two finger-like processes on the tip. This highly sensitive organ is innervated primarily by the trigeminal nerve, and thought to be manipulated by about 40,000\u201360,000 muscles. Because of this muscular structure, the trunk is so strong that elephants can use it for lifting about 3% of their own body weight. They use it for smelling, touching, feeding, drinking, dusting, sound production, loading, defending, and attacking. Functional loss of the trunk due to floppy trunk syndrome sometimes forces elephants to carry their trunks over their tusks and walk into deep water in order to drink. A 2021 study found that African elephants can also use their trunks to suction up food, capable of inhaling \"at speeds exceeding 490 feet per second, or almost 30 times as fast as humans can sneeze.\"\nTusks [ edit ]\nTusk of an African bush elephant\nBoth sexes have tusks, which erupt when they are 1\u20133 years old and grow throughout life. Tusks grow from deciduous teeth known as tushes that develop in the upper jaw and consist of a crown, root and pulpal cavity, which are completely formed soon after birth. Tushes reach a length of 5 cm (2 in). They are composed of dentin and coated with a thin layer of cementum. Their tips bear a conical layer of enamel that is usually worn off when the elephant is five years old. Tusks of bulls grow faster than tusks of females. Mean weight of tusks at the age of 60 years is 109 kg (240 lb) in bulls, and 17.7 kg (39.0 lb) in cows. The longest known tusk of an African bush elephant measured 3.51 m (11.5 ft) and weighed 117 kg (258 lb).\nMolars [ edit ]\nMolar of an adult African bush elephant\nThe dental formula of the African bush elephant is 1.0.3.30.0.3.3 \u00d7 2 = 26. It develops six molars in each jaw quadrant that erupt at different ages and differ in size. The first molars grow to a size of 2 cm (0.79 in) wide by 4 cm (1.6 in) long, are worn by the age of one year and lost by the age of about 2.5 years. The second molars start protruding at the age of about six months, grow to a size of 4 cm (1.6 in) wide by 7 cm (2.8 in) long and are lost by the age of 6\u20137 years. The third molars protrude at the age of about one year, grow to a size of 5.2 cm (2.0 in) wide by 14 cm (5.5 in) long and are lost by the age of 8\u201310 years. The fourth molars show by the age of 6\u20137 years, grow to a size of 6.8 cm (2.7 in) wide by 17.5 cm (6.9 in) long and are lost by the age of 22\u201323 years. The dental alveoli of the fifth molars are visible by the age of 10\u201311 years. They grow to a size of 8.5 cm (3.3 in) wide by 22 cm (8.7 in) long and are worn by the age of 45\u201348 years. The dental alveoli of the last molars are visible by the age of 26\u201328 years. They grow to a size of 9.4 cm (3.7 in) wide by 31 cm (1.0 ft) long and are well worn by the age of 65 years.\nDistribution and habitat [ edit ]\nThe African bush elephant occurs in Sub-Saharan Africa including Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Zambia, and Angola. It moves between a variety of habitats, including subtropical and temperate forests, dry and seasonally flooded grasslands, and woodlands, wetlands and agricultural land from sea level to mountain slopes. In Mali and Namibia, it also inhabits desert and semi-desert areas.\nIn Ethiopia, the African bush elephant has historically been recorded up to an elevation of 2,500 m (8,200 ft). By the late 1970s, the population had declined to a herd in the Dawa River valley and one close to the Kenyan border.\nBehavior and ecology [ edit ]\nSocial behavior [ edit ]\nThe core of elephant society is the family unit, which comprises several adult cows, their daughters, and their prepubertal sons. Iain Douglas-Hamilton, who observed African bush elephants for 4.5 years in Lake Manyara National Park, coined the term 'kinship group' for two or more family units that have close ties. The family unit is led by a matriarch who at times also leads the kinship group. Groups cooperate in locating food and water, in self-defense, and in caring for offspring (termed allomothering). Group size varies seasonally and between locations. In Tsavo East and Tsavo West National Parks, groups are bigger in the rainy season and in areas with open vegetation. Aerial surveys in the late 1960s to early 1970s revealed an average group size of 6.3 individuals in Uganda's Rwenzori National Park and 28.8 individuals in Chambura Game Reserve. In both sites, elephants aggregated during the wet season, whereas groups were smaller in the dry season.\nA bull elephant stretching up to break off a branch in the Okavango Delta , Botswana\nYoung bulls gradually separate from the family unit when they are between 10 and 19 years old. They range alone for some time or form all-male groups. A 2020 study highlighted the importance of old bulls for the navigation and survival of herds and raised concerns over the removal of old bulls as \"currently occur[ring] in both legal trophy hunting and illegal poaching\".\nDiet [ edit ]\nThe African bush elephant is herbivorous. Its diet consists mainly of grasses, creepers and herbs. Adults can consume up to 150 kg (330 lb) per day. During the dry season, the diet also includes leaves and bark. Tree bark in particular contains a high level of calcium. Elephants in Babille Elephant Sanctuary consume leaves and fruit of cherimoya, papaya, banana, guava and leaves, stems and seeds of maize, sorghum and sugarcane. To supplement their diet with minerals, they congregate at mineral-rich water-holes, termite mounds and mineral licks. Salt licks visited by elephants in the Kalahari contain high concentrations of water-soluble sodium. Elephants drink 180\u2013230 litres (50\u201360 US gal) of water daily, and seem to prefer sites where water and soil contains sodium. In Kruger National Park and on the shore of Lake Kariba, elephants were observed to ingest wood ash, which also contains sodium.\nCommunication [ edit ]\nAfrica bush elephants use their trunks for tactile communication. When greeting, a lower ranking individual will insert the tip of its trunk into its superior's mouth. Elephants will also stretch out their trunk towards an approaching individual they intend to greet. Mother elephants reaassure their young with touches, embraces and rubbings with the foot, while slapping disciplines them. During courtship, a couple will caress and intertwine with their trunks while play and fighting individuals wrestle with them.\nElephant vocals are variations of rumbles, trumpets, squeals and screams. Rumbles are mainly produced for long-distance communication and cover a broad range of frequencies which are mostly below what a human can hear. Infrasonic rumbles can travel vast distances and are important for attracting mates and scaring off rivals.\nLow frequency rumble visualised with acoustic camera\nAt Amboseli National Park several different infrasonic calls have been identified:\nGreeting rumble \u2013 is emitted by adult females members of a family group that have united after having been separated for several hours.\n\u2013 is emitted by adult females members of a family group that have united after having been separated for several hours.

Mating pandemonium \u2013 calls of excitement made by a cow's family after she has mated.\nGrowls are audible rumbles and happen during greetings. When in pain or fear, an elephant makes an open-mouthed growl known as a bellow while a drawn-out growl is a moan. Growling can escalate into a roaring when the elephant is issuing a threat. Trumpeting is made by blowing through the trunk and signals excitement, distress or aggression. Juvenile elephants squeal in distress while screaming is made by adults for intimidation.\nMusth [ edit ]\nObservations of adult African bush elephant bulls in Amboseli National Park revealed that they experience swelling of the temporal glands and secretion of fluid, the musth fluid, which flows down their cheeks. They begin to dribble urine, initially as discrete drops and later in a regular stream. These manifestations of musth last from a few days to months, depending on the age and condition of the bull. When a bull has been urinating for a long time, the proximal part of the penis and the distal end of the sheath show a greenish coloration, termed the 'green penis syndrome' by Joyce Poole and Cynthia Moss. Males in musth become more aggressive. They guard and mate with females in estrus who stay closer to bulls in musth than to non-musth bulls. Urinary testosterone increases during musth. Bulls begin to experience musth by the age of 24 years. Periods of musth are short and sporadic in young bulls up to 35 years old, lasting a few days to weeks. Older bulls are in musth for 2\u20135 months every year. Musth occurs mainly during and following the rainy season, and when females are in estrus. Bulls in musth often chase each other and are aggressive towards other bulls in musth. When old and high-ranking bulls in musth threaten and chase young musth bulls, the latter either leave the group or their musth ceases.\nElephants and white rhinos meet in Pilanesberg National Park\nYoung bulls in musth killed about 50 white rhinoceros in Pilanesberg National Park between 1992 and 1997. This unusual behavior was attributed to their young age and inadequate socialisation; they were 17\u201325-year-old orphans from culled families that grew up without the guidance of dominant bulls. When six adult bulls were introduced into the park, the young bulls did not attack rhinos any more, indicating older bulls suppress musth and aggressiveness of younger bulls. Similar incidents were recorded in Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Park, where young bulls killed five black and 58 white rhinoceros between 1991 and 2001. After the introduction of ten bulls, each up to 45 years old, the number of rhinos killed by elephants decreased considerably.\nReproduction [ edit ]\nSpermatogenesis starts when bulls are about 15 years old. Cows ovulate for the first time at the age of 11 years. They are in estrus for 2\u20136 days. In captivity, cows have an oestrous cycle lasting 14\u201315 weeks. Foetal gonads enlarge during the second half of pregnancy.\nAfrican bush elephants mate during the rainy season. Bulls in musth cover long distances in search for cows and associate with large family units. They listen for the cows' loud, very low frequency calls and attract cows by calling and by leaving trails of strong-smelling urine. Cows search for bulls in musth, listen for their calls and follow their urine trails. Bulls in musth are more successful at obtaining mating opportunities than non-musth bulls. Cows move away from bulls that attempt to test her estrous condition. If pursued by several bulls, they run away. Once they choose their mating partners, they stay away from other bulls that are threatened and chased away by the favoured bull. Competition between bulls overrides their choice sometimes.\nGestation lasts 22 months. Interval between births was estimated at 3.9 to 4.7 years in Hwange National Park. Where hunting pressure on adult elephants was high in the 1970s, cows gave birth once in 2.9 to 3.8 years. Cows in Amboseli National Park gave birth once in five years on average.\nThe birth of a calf was observed in Tsavo East National Park in October 1990. A group of 80 elephants including eight bulls had gathered in the morning in a 150 m (490 ft) radius around the birth site. A small group of calves and cows stood near the pregnant cow, rumbling and flapping their ears. One cow seemed to assist her. While in labour, fluid streamed from her temporal and ear canals. She kept standing while giving birth. The newborn calf struggled to its feet within 30 minutes and walked 20 minutes later. The mother expelled the placenta about 100 minutes after birth and covered it with soil immediately. Captive-born calves weigh between 100 and 120 kg (220 and 260 lb) at birth and gain about 0.5 kg (1.1 lb) weight per day. Cows lactate for about 4.8 years. Calves exclusively suckle their mother's milk during the first three months. Thereafter, they start feeding independently and slowly increase the time spent feeding until they are two years old. During the first three years, male calves spend more time suckling and grow faster than female calves. After this period, cows reject male calves more frequently from their nipples than female calves.\nThe maximum lifespan of the African bush elephant is between 70 and 75 years. Its generation length is 25 years.\nPredators [ edit ]\nAdult elephants are considered invulnerable to predation. Calves are sometimes preyed on by lions and spotted hyenas. Adult elephants often chase off predators, especially lions, by mobbing behavior.\nIn Botswana's Chobe National Park, lions attacked and fed on juvenile and subadult elephants when smaller prey species were scarce. Between 1993 and 1996, lions successfully attacked 74 elephants; 26 were older than nine, and one was a bull of over 15 years. Most were killed at night, and hunts occurred more often during waning moon nights than during bright moon nights. In the same park, lions killed eight elephants in October 2005 that were aged between one and 11 years, two of them older than eight years. Successful hunts took place after dark when prides exceeded 27 lions and herds were smaller than five elephants.\nThreats [ edit ]\nThe African bush elephant is threatened primarily by habitat loss and fragmentation following conversion of natural habitat for livestock farming, plantations of non-timber crops and building of urban and industrial areas. As a result, human-elephant conflict has increased.\nPoaching [ edit ]\nPoachers target foremost elephant bulls for their tusks, which leads to a skewed sex ratio and affects the survival chances of a population. Access of poachers to unregulated black markets is facilitated by corruption and in periods of civil war in some elephant range countries.\nIn June 2002, a container packed with more than 6.5 t (6.4 long tons; 7.2 short tons) ivory was confiscated in Singapore. It contained 42,120 hanko stamps and 532 tusks of African bush elephants that originated in Southern Africa, centered in Zambia and neighboring countries. Between 2005 and 2006, a total of 23.461 t (23.090 long tons; 25.861 short tons) ivory plus 91 unweighed tusks of African bush elephants were confiscated in 12 major consignments being shipped to Asia.\nWhen the international ivory trade reopened in 2006, the demand and price for ivory increased in Asia. The African bush elephant population in Chad's Zakouma National Park numbered 3,900 individuals in 2005. Within five years, more than 3,200 elephants were killed. The park did not have sufficient guards to combat poaching, and their weapons were outdated. Well-organized networks facilitated smuggling the ivory through Sudan. Poaching also increased in Kenya in those years. In Samburu National Reserve, 41 bulls were illegally killed between 2008 and 2012, equivalent to 31% of the reserve's elephant population.\nThese killings were linked to confiscations of ivory and increased prices for ivory on the local black market. About 10,370 tusks were confiscated in Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Kenya and Uganda between 2007 and 2013. Genetic analysis of tusk samples showed that they originated from African bush elephants killed in Tanzania, Mozambique, Zambia, Kenya and Uganda. Most of the ivory was smuggled through East African countries.\nBetween 2003 and 2015, illegal killing of 14,606 African bush elephants was reported by rangers across 29 range countries. Chad is a major transit country for smuggling of ivory in West Africa. This trend was curtailed by raising penalties for poaching and improving law enforcement.\nDuring the 20th century, the African bush elephant population was severely decimated. Poaching of the elephant has dated back all the way to the years of 1970 and 1980, which was considered the largest killings in history. Unfortunately, the species is placed in harm's way due to the limited conservation areas provided in Africa. In most cases, the killings of the African bush elephant have occurred near the outskirts of the protected areas.\nIn addition to being poached, the carcasses of elephants may get poisoned by the poachers, to avoid detection by vultures which help rangers track poaching activity by circling around dead animals, and pose a threat to those vultures or birds that scavenge on them. On 20 June 2019, the carcasses of 468 white-backed vultures, 17 white-headed vultures, 28 hooded vultures, 14 lappet-faced vultures and 10 cape vultures, altogether 537 endangered vultures, besides 2 tawny eagles, were found in northern Botswana. It is suspected that they died after eating the poisoned carcasses of 3 elephants.\nHabitat changes [ edit ]\nVast areas in Sub-Saharan Africa were transformed for agricultural use and building of infrastructure. This disturbance leaves the elephants without a stable habitat and limits their ability to roam freely. Large corporations associated with commercial logging and mining have stripped apart the land, giving poachers easy access to the African bush elephant. As human development grows, the human population faces the trouble of contact with the elephants more frequently, due to the species need for food and water. Farmers residing in nearby areas get into conflict with the African bush elephants rummaging through their crops. In many cases, they kill the elephants instantly as they disturb a village or forage upon their crops. Deaths caused by browsing on rubber vine, an invasive alien plant, have been reported.\nPathogens [ edit ]\nObservations at Etosha National Park indicate that African bush elephant die due to anthrax foremost in November at the end of the dry season. Anthrax spores spread through the intestinal tracts of vultures, jackals and hyaenas that feed on the carcasses. Anthrax killed over 100 elephants in Botswana in 2019. It is thought that wild bush elephants can contract fatal tuberculosis from humans. Infection of the vital organs by Citrobacter freundii bacteria has caused the death of an otherwise healthy bush elephant after capture and translocation.\nFrom April to June 2020, over 400 bush elephants died in Botswana's Okavango Delta region after drinking from desiccating waterholes that were infected with cyanobacteria. Neurotoxins produced by the cyanobacteria caused calves and adult elephants to wander around confused, emaciated and in distress. The elephants collapsed when the toxin impaired their motor functions and their legs became paralysed. Poaching, intentional poisoning, and anthrax were excluded as potential causes.\nConservation [ edit ]\nBoth African elephant species have been listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora since 1989. In 1997, populations of Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe were placed on CITES Appendix II, as were populations of South Africa in 2000. Community-based conservation programmes have been initiated in several range countries, which contributed to reduce human-elephant conflict and to increase local people's tolerance towards elephants.\nIn 1986, the African Elephant Database was initiated with the aim to collate and update information on the distribution and status of elephant populations in Africa. The database includes results from aerial surveys, dung counts, interviews with local people, and data on poaching.\nResearchers discovered that playing back the recorded sounds of African bees is an effective method to drive elephants away from settlements.\nStatus [ edit ]\nIn 1996, IUCN Red List assessors for the African bush elephant considered the species Endangered. Since 2021, it has been assessed Endangered, after the global population was found to have decreased by more than 50 percent over 3 generations. About 70% of its range is located outside protected areas.\nIn 2016, the global population was estimated at 415,428 \u00b1 20,111 individuals distributed in a total area of 20,731,202 km2 (8,004,362 sq mi), of which 30% is protected. 42% of the total population lives in nine Southern African countries comprising 293,447 \u00b1 16,682 individuals; Africa's largest population lives in Botswana with 131,626 \u00b1 12,508 individuals.\nIn captivity [ edit ]\nThe social behavior of elephants in captivity mimics that of those in the wild. Cows are kept with other cows, in groups, while bulls tend to be separated from their mothers at a young age, and are kept apart. According to Schulte, in the 1990s, in North America, a few facilities allowed bull interaction. Elsewhere, bulls were only allowed to smell each other. Bulls and cows were allowed to interact for specific purposes such as breeding. In that event, cows were more often moved to the bull than the bull to the cow. Cows are more often kept in captivity because they are easier and less expensive to house.\nSee also [ edit ]\nNotes [ edit ]\n^ The populations of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe are listed in Appendix II for specific purposes.\nReferences [ edit ]"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Facts About Mastodons | Live Science", "url": "https://www.livescience.com/56708-mastodon-facts.html", "text": "Mastodons were prehistoric relatives of today's elephants. Like their modern cousins, mastodons had tusks, flappy ears and a long nose. Both animals, as well as the woolly mammoth, are members of the order Proboscidea, a name that comes from the Greek word proboskis, which means nose.\nThe difference between mastodons and mammoths\nMastodons and woolly mammoths both look like ancient elephants, but they are separate species. One big difference between them is when they appeared on Earth. Mammoths appeared about 5.1 million years ago in Africa, according to Ross MacPhee, a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Mastodons, on the other hand, appeared about 27 million to 30 million years ago, primarily in North and Central America. [Related: Mammoth or Mastodon: What's the Difference?]\nThere are several other differences. Mastodons were slightly smaller than mammoths. Though they are both herbivores, they ate differently. Mastodons had blunt, cone-shaped molars that would crush vegetation, while mammoths had ridged molars that cut plants, much like today's elephants. Naturalist Georges Cuvier named them \"mastodon\" because of their breast-like tooth protrusions, according to Wired.\nAppearance\nUnlike modern elephants, mastodons had much smaller ears and foreheads and were covered in a thick layer of brown hair. Hairs on their coats, could grow up to 35 inches (90 centimeters) and the males' tusks grew to about 8 feet (2.5 meters). Females did not have tusks.\nFrom foot to shoulder, mastodons were between 8 and 10 feet (2.5 and 3 m) tall. They weighed between 4 and 6 tons (3,500 and 5,400 kilograms), according to the Illinois State Museum. That isn't much different from their modern counterparts. Modern elephants weigh 3 to 7 tons (2,722 to 6,350 kg) and range from 5 to 14 feet (1.5 to 4.3 m) tall, according to The Defenders of Wildlife.\nHabitat\nThough mastodons appeared primarily in North and Central America, they eventually spread all over the world, in every continent except for Antarctica and Australia. They typically inhabited spruce woodlands around valleys and swamps, according to Cochise College.\nExtinction\nMastodons went extinct around 10,000 years ago. There are many theories as to why. Most of these theories boil down to climate change and/or human hunting, according to Simon Fraser University. Some scientists think that the Earth warmed up from the Ice Age too quickly for the mastodon to adapt or that humans hunted them to extinction.\nOthers, like researchers Bruce Rothschild of the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine and Richard Laub of the Buffalo Museum of Science in New York, have a different theory. They found that 52 percent of the 113 mastodons they studied had signs of tuberculosis. This led the researchers to think that a tuberculosis pandemic contributed to their extinction. Though death by disease sounds like a cut-and-dry answer, \"Extinction is usually not a one-phenomenon event,\" Rothschild told Live Science. It is likely that the disease didn't kill off the animals directly, but made them weak. Coupled with the coming out of the Ice Age and fighting off humans, the species just couldn't survive.\nSculptures by artist Sergio de la Rosa show three elephant relatives, from left to right: the mastodon, the mammoth and the gomphothere. (Image credit: Sergio de la Rosa)\nFossil discoveries\nThe first mastodon fossils were found in 1705, according to the Oregon History Project, when a large tooth and bone fragments were found in the Hudson River Valley in New York. Not long after, in 1807, Thomas Jefferson personally financed an expedition that was by led William Clark to excavate mastodon and mammoth fossils from the Big Bone Lick site in Kentucky.\nThere have been many mastodon fossil discoveries in the past few hundred years. Sometimes, they are found in unusual places. For example, on October 16, 1963, Marshal Erb was using a dragline to excavate a pond and found fossils that came to be known as the Perry Mastodon. In another instance in 2016, a sinkhole in Florida\u2019s Aucilla River (opens in new tab) was declared an \"archaeological gold mine\" after an ancient human tool and mastodon bones are found inside.\nAdditional resources"}

Two species are traditionally recognised, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature.\nComparison between Asian and African elephants:\n1. Elephants actually evolved from a mammal called an Eritherium azzouzorum abou 60 million years ago. It was about the size of a rabbit.\n2. Elephants really do have excellent memory. They're able to pass information along to one another.\n3. Elephants spend around 20 hours a day moving around in search of food or socialization.\n4. They can't run, but they can speed walk about 25 mph.\n5. They can drink up to 2 gallons of water at a time.\n6. Elephants use a complex language and physical gestures to communicate with one another. For example, when they kneel in front of each other, it means an invitation to play.\n7. Elephants eat more than 300 pound of food a day.\n8. Their ears can span 4 feet wide and two feet high.\n9. Elephants can live up to 70 years.\n10. Elephant can\u2019t jump.\n11. The average weight for an elephant heart is about 27 to 46 pounds!\n12. Elephants have a highly developed brain and the largest of all the land mammals. The brain is 3 or 4 times larger than that of humans although smaller as a proportion of body weight.\n13. An elephant\u2019s skin is an inch thick.\n14. An elephant can reproduce at the age of 16, but rarely has more than four children throughout her lifetime. At birth, an elephant calf weighs about 230 lbs!\n15. Elephants have the longest pregnancy among all the animals. A female elephant takes about 22 months from conception to give birth.\n16. Elephants have preference for one tusk over the other, just like humans are either left or right-handed.\n17. Tusks is called incisor teeth of an elephant. They are used for defense, digging for water, and lifting things.\n18. Elephants have four molars, one on the top and one on the bottom on both sides of the mouth. The weight of one molar is about five pounds and is the size of a brick.\n19. The trunk of comprises of more than 40,000 muscles.\n20. Elephants rises their trunks up in the air and from side to side to smell better.\n21. The elephant\u2019s trunk is able to estimate the size, shape and temperature of an object. An elephant uses its trunk to lift food and suck up water then pour it into its mouth.\n22. Elephants are good swimmers \u2013 they use their trunk to breathe like a snorkel in deep water.\n23. Elephants can walk almost silently because their feet are very soft padded. This pad helps them to hold their weight.\n24. Elephants use their feet to listen, they can pick up sub-sonic rumblings made by other elephants, through vibrations in the ground. Elephants can listen by putting trunks on the ground and carefully positioning their feet.\n25. Elephants are very sensitive and caring animals. If a baby elephant complains, the entire family will look after him. Elephants express grief, compassion, self-awareness, altruism and play.\n26. Elephants orginise greeting ceremonies when a friend that has been away for some time returns to the group.\n27. Elephants have large, thin ears. Their ears are made up of a complex network of blood vessels which regulate an elephant\u2019s temperature. Blood is circulated through their ears to cool them down in hot climates.\n28. An elephant is capable of hearing sound waves well below our human hearing limitation.\n29. Elephants are social creatures. They sometimes \u201chug\u201d by wrapping their trunks together in displays of greeting and affection.\n30. Elephants pay homage to the bones of their dead, gently touching the skulls and tusks with their trunks and feet. When an elephant walks past a place that a loved one has died, he/she will stop dead still; a silent and empty pause that can last several minutes."}

These large, muscular creatures can clear trees, provide transport, or destroy a village in a single rampage incident. Known for their family units and long memories, Asian elephants have a number of important facts that help to make them truly unique in today\u2019s world.\n1. An Adaptable Animal\nAsian elephants are considered an endangered species, but their future holds a lot of promise if humans stop devastating the species. They can live in tropical forests, lowland valleys, and even in mountainous environments up to 10,000 feet in altitude. With a varied diet and enough open access, they will prefer to stay away from humans.\n2. A Hefty Appetite\nAsian elephants have mighty molars that help them break down numerous forms of vegetation \u2013 including tree bark. In captivity, the average elephant is going to eat more than 100 pounds of hay every day. They\u2019ll also get 10 pounds of fruits and vegetables, another 10 pounds of pellets, and some branches to enjoy.\n3. Not Coming Out\nAsian elephants have one of the longest gestation periods that scientists know of in the animal kingdom. The average calf takes at least 20 months to fully form, with many gestation periods being 22 months in length. Only one calf is typically born. Female elephants won\u2019t typically have their first calf until they reach 14 years of age and then average about one calf every 4 years.\n4. Listen To Your Mother\nAsian elephants are also guided by a matriarch instead of a patriarch. The oldest and largest female elephant usually fulfills this role. Family units are called herds and when different families come together for travel, this is called a clan. Unless the male elephants are younger than 13, they\u2019ll be off wandering around on their own or with their own bachelor crew.\n5. A Useful Trunk\nElephants can uproot a tree with their trunk. They can also use it to pluck a single blade of grass. With more than 40,000 muscles, it winds up being a very useful tool.\nAsian elephants are one of the most fascinating creatures on the planet today. They are also only 1 of 3 known animals who can recognize their own individuality in a mirror. With facts like these, how can you not fall in love with these majestic creatures?"}

At age five, she was captured from the wilds of Asia and purchased by Dori Miller, owner of Carson and Barnes and Kelly Miller Circuses. In 1958, while the Kelly-Miller circus was traveling through Cuba, Fidel Castro seized power. Shirley and the entire circus was held captive by Castro\u2019s forces for several weeks before finally being released.\nIn 1963, the circus traveled by ship to Nova Scotia and was docked at Yarmouth Harbor when a fire broke out in the engine room. This incident caused the ship to sink, killing two animals. Shirley was rescued, but not before sustaining severe burns on her back and legs. Today she is missing a large section of her right ear as result of the fire and has several scars on her back, side, and feet.\nAt the age of 27, while traveling with the Lewis Brothers Circus, Shirley's right hind leg was broken during an altercation with another elephant. As it healed, several bones in her leg fused together, creating an abnormal angle and shape. After two more years performing in the circus, Shirley was sold to the Louisiana Purchase Gardens and Zoo in Monroe, LA. She was the sole elephant at the zoo for 22 years.\nOn July 6, 1999, Shirley became the fourth resident of The Elephant Sanctuary, joining Tarra, Jenny, and Barbara. At The Sanctuary, Shirley experienced a very loving reunion with Jenny. Research showed the two elephants had been in the same circus 23 years earlier! This memorable event is the subject of an Emmy-winning National Geographic documentary \u201cThe Urban Elephant.\u201d\nFor the next seven years, the two elephants were inseparable in a relationship resembling one of a mother and daughter. During this time, Shirley also emerged as the matriarch of the \u201cFounding Herd,\u201d a leadership role reserved for the most respected and admired elephant in the group. Jenny died in 2006. After a short time, Shirley was seen spending time with Tarra, and also with Winkie and Sissy.\nMuch like at an assisted living facility, at The Sanctuary, comfort, choice, and independence are tantamount to quality of life. Individualized care from a professional team of Veterinarians and Caregivers has allowed Shirley to age gracefully in a natural habitat setting and make choices about her daily life.\nShirley passed away peacefully on February 22, 2021 at age 72. Shirley defied all odds as one of the oldest elephants in captivity and lived well beyond the life expectancy for a captive Asian elephant. Shirley was The Sanctuary\u2019s oldest elephant and, at the time of her passing, held the record for the second oldest elephant in North America.\n\u201cThe Sanctuary is deeply honored to have provided care for Shirley for 21 years. We thank Shirley\u2019s many supporters, fans, and friends who have shared her story, who have loved her from afar, and who have partnered with us through the years to provide lifetime care and the opportunity for Shirley to know true companionship with other elephants,\u201d said Janice Zeitlin, CEO. \u201cWe learned so much about the dignity and grace of elephants aging in captivity through caring for Shirley, and we will continue to apply this knowledge to help care for all current and future residents. Shirley leaves an enduring legacy marked by a truly remarkable life, and she will be deeply missed by all.\u201d\nPlease join us in celebrating Shirley and her long and courageous life.\nVISIT SHIRLEY'S TRIBUTE PAGE TO SHARE YOUR MEMORIES AND CONDOLENCES"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephant Tusks - Elephant Facts and Information - EleAid", "url": "https://www.eleaid.com/elephant-information/elephant-tusks/", "text": "Elephant Tusks\nIvory Tusks \u2013 A Blessing and Curse\nAn elephant\u2019s tusks are both a blessing and curse. Blessing because they give a sense of true majesty that rise them above other animals as well and being of use for various tasks. A curse because man\u2019s avarice for ivory has led to the senseless slaughter of hundreds of thousands of the magnificent animals.\nOne of the key differences between African and Asian elephants is the tusks. All African elephants, male and female, have tusks whereas only some Asian males have tusks. About 50% of Asian females have short tusks known as tushes \u2013 which have no pulp inside.\nWhat is a tusk?\nUsually in mammals tusks are enlarged canine teeth, but in elephants they are actually elongated incisors and are essentially no different from other teeth. One third of the tusk is actually hidden from view, embedded deep in the elephant\u2019s head. This part of the tusk is a pulp cavity made up of tissue, blood and nerves. The visible, ivory part of the tusk is made of dentine with an outer layer of enamel. Elephant ivory is unique which when viewed in cross-sections reveals criss-cross lines that form a series of diamond shapes. Elephants tusks never stop growing so some old bulls display enormous examples. However, the average size of tusks has decreased over the past hundred years because hunting elephants for their ivory has resulted in the \u2018big tusk gene\u2019 becoming increasingly rare.\nWhat are tusks used for?\nElephants use their tusks for a variety of tasks. Principally, they are formidable weapons against potential predators like the tiger (although tigers will only ever attack young or juvenile elephants) or in battle against other elephants. They are also used to aid foraging, digging, stripping bark and moving things out of the way; trained logging elephants are capable of lifting large logs with their tusks. There is also a display element to tusks and they can attract the interest of females.\nEvidence suggests that elephants normally prefer one tusk over the other, similar to being left or right handed in humans. The preferred tusk is known as the master tusk.\nHunting for Ivory\nIvory poaching for tusks is the main reason that elephants have been so heavily hunted. Elephant ivory has been used in huge amounts to make billiards balls, piano keys, identification chops and many other items for human enjoyment. Although hunting for ivory has been much more severe in Africa, there is no doubt that hunting and poaching has had an effect on the elephant numbers in Asia. In 1989, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) banned the ivory trade putting hunting outside the law. Poaching does still take place, but in most of the Asian elephants ranges it is under control."}

We on Kapama are fortunate to have all age categories of elephants, including babies. After all, who does not enjoy the very playful young ones?\nUnder the watchful eye of mother, young elephants are free to do as they please, and they often give us a wonderful show. Young elephants still in the developing stage are very curious about the world and we always enjoy the way they interact with nature and each other. Young elephants under the age of three are still very dependent on there relatives. Young elephants are often found mimicking their elders and this is how they learn and build their own personality\u2019s over time. Young are also very playful and won\u2019t hesitate to charge the vehicle. Now, this is often found to be very amusing to guests and we as guides also enjoy it as we will always keep a safe distance. With knowledge of animal behavior, we can tell if its playful behavior or if it is from feeling pressured or threatened. The reason I\u2019m pointing this out is if young elephants are feeling uncomfortable with the presence of a vehicle, they can often give out a cry of distress which will alert the bigger relatives, who will often rush in and try and defend the little one. This does not occur often if you keep your respective distance. Elephants will generally continue with their day as if you were not even there."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "African elephant - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_elephant", "text": "Genus comprising two living elephant species\nAfrican elephants (Loxodonta) are a genus comprising two living elephant species, the African bush elephant (L. africana) and the smaller African forest elephant (L. cyclotis). Both are social herbivores with grey skin, but differ in the size and colour of their tusks and in the shape and size of their ears and skulls.\nBoth species are considered at heavy risk of extinction on the IUCN Red List; as of 2021, the bush elephant is considered endangered and the forest elephant is considered critically endangered. They are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and poaching for the illegal ivory trade is a threat in several range countries as well.\nLoxodonta is one of two extant genera of the family Elephantidae. The name refers to the lozenge-shaped enamel of their molar teeth. Fossil remains of Loxodonta species have been excavated in Africa, dating to the Middle Pliocene.\nTaxonomy [ edit ]\nL. cyclotis, with a concave instead of convex forehead. Comparison of bush (left) and forest (right) elephant skulls in frontal view. Note the shorter and wider head of, with a concave instead of convex forehead.\nA female African bush elephant skeleton on display at the Museum of Osteology, Oklahoma City\nThe first scientific description of the African elephant was written in 1797 by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, who proposed the scientific name Elephas africanus. Loxodonte was proposed as a generic name for the African elephant by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cuvier in 1825. This name refers to the lozenge-shaped enamel of the molar teeth, which differs significantly from the rounded shape of the Asian elephant's molar enamel. An anonymous author used the Latinized spelling Loxodonta in 1827. Anonymous was recognized as authority by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature in 1999.\nElephas (Loxodonta) cyclotis was proposed by Paul Matschie in 1900, who described three African elephant zoological specimens from Cameroon whose skulls differed in shape from elephant skulls collected elsewhere in Africa. In 1936, Glover Morrill Allen considered this elephant to be a distinct species and called it 'forest elephant'; later authors considered it to be a subspecies. Morphological and genetic analyses provided evidence for species-level differences between the African bush elephant and the African forest elephant.\nIn 1907, Richard Lydekker proposed six African elephant subspecies based on the different sizes and shapes of their ears. They are all considered synonymous with the African bush elephant.\nA third species, the West African elephant, has also been proposed but it needs confirmation. It is thought that this lineage has been isolated from the others for 2.4 million years.\nExtinct African elephants [ edit ]\nBetween the late 18th and 20th centuries, the following extinct African elephants were described on the basis of fossil remains:\nPhylogeny [ edit ]\nAnalysis of nuclear DNA sequences indicates that the genetic divergence between African bush and forest elephants dates 2.6 \u2013 5.6 million years ago. The divergence between the Asian elephant and the woolly mammoths is estimated 2.5 \u2013 5.4 million years ago, which strongly supports their status as distinct species. The African forest elephant was found to have a high degree of genetic diversity, perhaps reflecting periodic fragmentation of their habitat during the climatic changes in the Pleistocene.\nGene flow between the two African elephant species was examined at 21 locations. The analysis revealed that several African bush elephants carried mitochondrial DNA of African forest elephants, indicating they hybridised in the savanna-forest transition zone in ancient times.\nSequence analysis of DNA from fossils of the extinct Eurasian Palaeoloxodon antiquus shows it to be much closer related to the African forest elephant than to the African bush elephant. The validity of Loxodonta has therefore been questioned.\nDescription [ edit ]\nShort tactile hair growing on the trunk\nSkin, ears, and trunk [ edit ]\nA male African bush elephant skull on display at the Museum of Osteology\nAfrican elephants have grey folded skin up to 30 mm (1.2 in) thick that is covered with sparse, bristled dark-brown to black hair. Short tactile hair grows on the trunk, which has two finger-like processes at the tip, whereas Asian elephants only have one. Their large ears help to reduce body heat; flapping them creates air currents and exposes the ears' inner sides where large blood vessels increase heat loss during hot weather. The trunk is a prehensile elongation of its upper lip and nose. This highly sensitive organ is innervated primarily by the trigeminal nerve, and thought to be manipulated by about 40,000\u201360,000 muscles. Because of this muscular structure, the trunk is so strong that elephants can use it for lifting about 3% of their own body weight. They use it for smelling, touching, feeding, drinking, dusting, producing sounds, loading, defending and attacking. Elephants sometimes swim underwater and use their trunks as snorkels.\nTusks and molars [ edit ]\nBoth male and female African elephants have tusks that grow from deciduous teeth called tushes, which are replaced by tusks when calves are about one year old. Tusks are composed of dentin, which forms small diamond-shaped structures in the tusk's center that become larger at its periphery. Tusks are primarily used to dig for roots and strip the bark from trees for food, for fighting each other during mating season, and for defending themselves against predators. The tusks weigh from 23 to 45 kg (51\u201399 lb) and can be from 1.5 to 2.4 m (5\u20138 ft) long. They are curved forward and continue to grow throughout the elephant's lifetime.\nThe dental formula of elephants is 1.0.3.30.0.3.3 \u00d7 2 = 26. Elephants have four molars; each weighs about 5 kg (11 lb) and measures about 30 cm (12 in) long. As the front pair wears down and drops out in pieces, the back pair moves forward, and two new molars emerge in the back of the mouth. Elephants replace their teeth four to six times in their lifetimes. At around 40 to 60 years of age, the elephant loses the last of its molars and will likely die of starvation which is a common cause of death. African elephants have 24 teeth in total, six on each quadrant of the jaw. The enamel plates of the molars are fewer in number than in Asian elephants.\nSize [ edit ]\nThe African bush elephant is the largest terrestrial animal. Cows are 2.2\u20132.6 m (7.2\u20138.5 ft) tall at the shoulder and weigh 2,160\u20133,232 kg (4,762\u20137,125 lb), while bulls are 3.2\u20134 m (10\u201313 ft) tall and weigh 4,700\u20136,048 kg (10,362\u201313,334 lb). Its back is concave-shaped, while the back of the African forest elephant is nearly straight. The largest recorded individual stood 3.96 metres (13.0 ft) at the shoulder, and is estimated to have weighed 10,400 kg (22,900 lb). The tallest recorded individual stood 4.21 m (13.8 ft) at the shoulder and weighed 8,000 kg (18,000 lb).\nThe African forest elephant is smaller with a weight of up 4,000 kg (8,800 lb) and a shoulder height of 1.8\u20132.4 m (5 ft 11 in \u2013 7 ft 10 in) in females and 2.4\u20133 m (7 ft 10 in \u2013 9 ft 10 in) in males. It is the third largest terrestrial animal.\nDistribution and habitat [ edit ]\nFemale bush elephants in Tanzania\nFamily responds to bee warning rumble\nAfrican elephants are distributed in Sub-Saharan Africa, where they inhabit Sahelian scrubland and arid regions, tropical rainforests, mopane and miombo woodlands. African forest elephant populations occur only in Central Africa.\nBehavior and ecology [ edit ]\nSleeping Pattern [ edit ]\nElephants are the animals with the lowest sleep times, especially African elephants. Their average sleep was found to be only 2 hours in 24-hour cycles.\nFamily [ edit ]\nBull elephants in mock aggression\nBoth African elephant species live in family units comprising several adult cows, their daughters and their subadult sons. Each family unit is led by an older cow known as the matriarch. African forest elephant groups are less cohesive than African bush elephant groups, probably because of the lack of predators.\nWhen separate family units bond, they form kinship or bond groups. After puberty, male elephants tend to form close alliances with other males. While females are the most active members of African elephant groups, both male and female elephants are capable of distinguishing between hundreds of different low frequency infrasonic calls to communicate with and identify each other.\nElephants use some vocalisations that are beyond the hearing range of humans, to communicate across large distances. Elephant mating rituals include the gentle entwining of trunks.\nThe bulls were believed to be solitary animals, becoming independent once reaching maturity. New research suggests that bulls maintain ecological knowledge for the herd, facilitating survival when searching for food and water, which also benefits the young bulls who associate with them. Bulls only return to the herd to breed or to socialize; they do not provide prenatal care to their offspring, but rather play a fatherly role to younger bulls to show dominance.\nFeeding [ edit ]\nWhile feeding, the African elephant uses its trunk to pluck leaves and its tusk to tear at branches, which can cause enormous damage to foliage. Fermentation of the food takes place in the hindgut, thus enabling large food intakes. The large size and hindgut of the African elephant also allows for digestion of various plant parts, including fibrous stems, bark and roots.\nIntelligence [ edit ]\nScratching on a tree helps to remove layers of dead skin and parasites\nAfrican elephants are highly intelligent. They have a very large and highly convoluted neocortex, a trait they share with humans, apes and some dolphin species. They are amongst the world's most intelligent species. With a mass of just over 5 kg (11 lb), the elephant brain is larger than that of any other terrestrial animal. The elephant's brain is similar to a human brain in terms of structure and complexity; the elephant's cortex has as many neurons as that of a human brain, suggesting convergent evolution.\nElephants exhibit a wide variety of behaviours, including those associated with grief, learning, mimicry, art, play, a sense of humor, altruism, use of tools, compassion, cooperation, self-awareness, memory and possibly language. All of these behaviors point to a highly intelligent species that is thought to be equal with cetaceans and primates.\nReproduction [ edit ]\nAfrican elephants are at their most fertile between the ages of 25 and 45. Calves are born after a gestation period of up to nearly two years. The calves are cared for by their mother and other young females in the group, known as allomothering.\nAfrican elephants show sexual dimorphism in weight and shoulder height by age 20, due to the rapid early growth of males. By age 25, males are double the weight of females; however, both sexes continue to grow throughout their lives.\nFemale African elephants are able to start reproducing at around 10 to 12 years of age, and are in estrus for about 2 to 7 days. They do not mate at a specific time; however, they are less likely to reproduce in times of drought than when water is plentiful. The gestation period of an elephant is 22 months and fertile females usually give birth every 3\u20136 years, so if they live to around 50 years of age, they may produce 7 offspring. Females are a scarce and mobile resource for the males so there is intense competition to gain access to estrous females.\nPost sexual maturity, males begin to experience musth, a physical and behavioral condition that is characterized by elevated testosterone, aggression and more sexual activity. Musth also serves a purpose of calling attention to the females that they are of good quality, and it cannot be mimicked as certain calls or noises may be. Males sire few offspring in periods when they are not in musth. During the middle of estrus, female elephants look for males in musth to guard them. The females will yell, in a loud, low way to attract males from far away. Male elephants can also smell the hormones of a female ready for breeding. This leads males to compete with each other to mate, which results in the females mating with older, healthier males. Females choose to a point who they mate with, since they are the ones who try to get males to compete to guard them. However, females are not guarded in the early and late stages of estrus, which may permit mating by younger males not in musth.[citation needed]\nMales over the age of 25 compete strongly for females in estrus, and are more successful the larger and more aggressive they are. Bigger males tend to sire bigger offspring. Wild males begin breeding in their thirties when they are at a size and weight that is competitive with other adult males. Male reproductive success is maximal in mid-adulthood and then begins to decline. However, this can depend on the ranking of the male within their group, as higher-ranking males maintain a higher rate of reproduction. Most observed matings are by males in musth over 35 years of age. Twenty-two long observations showed that age and musth are extremely important factors; \"\u2026 older males had markedly elevated paternity success compared with younger males, suggesting the possibility of sexual selection for longevity in this species.\": 287 [full citation needed]\nMales usually stay with a female and her herd for about a month before moving on in search of another mate. Less than a third of the population of female elephants will be in estrus at any given time and the gestation period of an elephant is long, so it makes more evolutionary sense for a male to search for as many females as possible rather than stay with one group.[citation needed]\nThreats [ edit ]\nNumber of African elephants\nBoth species are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and poaching for the illegal ivory trade is a threat in several range countries as well. The African bush elephant is listed as Endangered and the African forest elephant as Critically Endangered on the respective IUCN Red Lists.\nBased on vegetation types that provide suitable habitat for African elephants, it was estimated that in the early 19th century a maximum of 26,913,000 African elephants might have been present from the Sahel in the north to the Highveld in the south. Decrease of suitable habitat was the major cause for the decline of elephant populations until the 1950s. Hunting African elephants for the ivory trade accelerated the decline from the 1970s onwards. The carrying capacity of remaining suitable habitats was estimated at 8,985,000 elephants at most by 1987. In the 1970s and 1980s, the price for ivory rose, and poaching for ivory increased in particular in Central African range countries where access to elephant habitats was facilitated by logging and petroleum mining industries. Between 1976 and 1980, about 830 t (820 long tons; 910 short tons) raw ivory was exported from Africa to Hong Kong and Japan, equivalent to tusks of about 222,000 African elephants.\nThe first continental elephant census was carried out in 1976. At the time, 1.34 million elephants were estimated to range over 7,300,000 km2 (2,800,000 sq mi). In the 1980s, it was difficult to carry out systematic surveys in several East African range countries due to civil wars. In 1987, it was estimated that the African elephant population had declined to 760,000 individuals. In 1989, only 608,000 African elephants were estimated to have survived. In 1989, the Kenyan Wildlife Service burned a stockpile of tusks in protest against the ivory trade.\nWhen the international ivory trade reopened in 2006, the demand and price for ivory increased in Asia. In Chad's Zakouma National Park, more than 3,200 elephants were killed between 2005 and 2010. The park did not have sufficient guards to combat poaching and their weapons were outdated. Well organized networks facilitated smuggling the ivory through Sudan. The government of Tanzania estimated that more than 85,000 elephants were lost to poaching in Tanzania between 2009 and 2014, representing a 60% loss. In 2012, a large upsurge in ivory poaching was reported, with about 70% of the product flowing to China. China was the biggest market for poached ivory but announced that it would phase out the legal domestic manufacture and sale of ivory products in May 2015.\nConflicts between elephants and a growing human population are a major issue in elephant conservation. Human encroachment into natural areas where bush elephants occur or their increasing presence in adjacent areas has spurred research into methods of safely driving groups of elephants away from humans. Playback of the recorded sounds of angry Western honey bees has been found to be remarkably effective at prompting elephants to flee an area. Farmers have tried scaring elephants away by more aggressive means such as fire or the use of chili peppers along fences to protect their crops.\nConservation [ edit ]\nIn 1986, the African Elephant Database was initiated with the aim to monitor the status of African elephant populations. This database includes results from aerial surveys, dung counts, interviews with local people and data on poaching.\nIn 1989, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora listed the African elephant on CITES Appendix I. This listing banned international trade of African elephants and their body parts by countries that signed the CITES agreement. Hunting elephants is banned in the Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Senegal. After the ban came into force in 1990, retail sales of ivory carvings in South Africa have plummeted by more than 95% within 10 years. As a result of the trade ban, African elephant populations recovered in Southern African range countries.\nThe African Elephant Specialist Group has set up a Human-Elephant Conflict Task Force with the aim to develop conflict mitigation strategies.\nIn 2005, the West African Elephant Memorandum of Understanding was signed by 12 West African countries. The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals provided financial support for four years to implement the West African Elephant Conservation Strategy, which forms the central component of this intergovernmental treaty.\nIn 2019, the export of wild African elephants to zoos around the world was banned, with an exception added by the EU to allow export in \"exceptional cases where \u2026 it is considered that a transfer to ex-situ locations will provide demonstrable in-situ conservation benefits for African elephants\". Previously, export had been allowed in Southern Africa with Zimbabwe capturing and exporting more than 100 baby elephants to Chinese zoos since 2012.\nIt was found that elephant conservation does not pose a trade-off with climate change mitigation. Although animals typically cause a reduction of woody biomass and therewith above-ground carbon, they foster soil carbon sequestration.\nIn culture [ edit ]\nMany African cultures revere the African elephant as a symbol of strength and power. It is also praised for its size, longevity, stamina, mental faculties, cooperative spirit, and loyalty. Its religious importance is mostly totemic. Many societies believed that their chiefs would be reincarnated as elephants. In the 10th century, the people of Igbo-Ukwu in Nigeria buried their leaders with elephant tusks.\nSouth Africa uses elephant tusks in their coat of arms to represent wisdom, strength, moderation and eternity.\nIn the western African Kingdom of Dahomey the elephant was associated with the 19th century rulers of the Fon people, Guezo and his son Glele.[a] The animal is believed to evoke strength, royal legacy, and enduring memory as related by the proverbs: \"There where the elephant passes in the forest, one knows\" and \"The animal steps on the ground, but the elephant steps down with strength.\" Their flag depicted an elephant wearing a royal crown.\nSee also [ edit ]\nNotes [ edit ]\n^ Guezo and Glele ruled from 1818 to 1858 and from 1858 to 1889, respectively"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Top 5 Facts: Elephants \u2013 How It Works", "url": "https://www.howitworksdaily.com/top-5-facts-elephants/", "text": "Elephants are the largest land animals in the world, with African males averaging five tons. They have evolved to this huge size to protect themselves from predators but almost everything that makes an elephant unique is a consequence of this bulk. Large mammals don\u2019t have enough skin surface area to shed excess body heat so elephants have large flapping ears to act as radiators. A heavy head precludes a long neck so elephants have evolved a trunk, both to stretch up into branches and to be able to reach down to the ground to drink.\nMost mammals stand with their leg joints half bent, which makes it easier to accelerate from a standstill. Elephants can only support their body weight by keeping the bones all in a line, like a pillar. Humans are the only other animal that does this. Elephants do not have fused ankle joints, as some people think, but it is true that they do not jump. The impact stresses would risk serious injury if they tried. This is the same reason that elephants don\u2019t gallop. Instead, they have a curious half-jogging gait where the front legs run and the hind legs walk fast.\nElephants used to be classified as pachyderms and lumped with the rhino and hippopotamus. Scientists now place them in their own order, the proboscidea, along with the extinct mammoths. There are three species of elephant living today: the African Bush elephant, African Forest elephant and the Asian elephant. All elephant species are protected but poaching is a very serious problem and current population numbers are unknown.\nTop 5 Facts:"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "How Long is an Elephant's Pregnancy? - AnimalWised", "url": "https://www.animalwised.com/how-long-is-an-elephant-s-pregnancy-405.html", "text": "Elephants are very intelligent animals, and they are currently the largest land animals in the world. They are relatives of the extinct mammoth, a mammal that became extinct 3700 years ago. There are actually two species of elephant; the African (Loxodonta africana) and the Asian (Elephas maximus). The duration of an elephant's pregnancy is very long; one of the longest in all existing species. There are several factors that make this period so lengthy. One such reason is the size of the elephant fetus, and the size they need to reach before birth. Another determining factor for the length of gestation is the brain, which must be sufficiently developed before birth. At AnimalWised you'll learn more details about elephant gestation and you'll get to know how long is an elephant's pregnancy, along with some other details and interesting facts that will quench your thirst for knowledge.\nElephant fertilization\nA female elephant's menstrual cycle lasts 3 to 4 months, so they can be fertilized 3 to 4 times per year. These factors make gestation a little difficult in captivity. Mating between male and female is short-lived; they tend to rub against each other and wrap trunks. Females tend to run away from males, who must then pursue them. Male elephants flap their ears more in mating season than in other times of the year, in order to spread their scent and have a better chance of reproducing. The oldest males, between 40 and 50 years old, are those most likely to mate. Females, in turn, can become pregnant from the age of 14. In the wild, males display lots of aggression towards each other for the right to couple, and the youngest ones have little chance against the strength of older ones. They need to wait until they are more mature in order to reproduce. Typically, males mount the females once daily for 3 to 4 days, and if the process is successful the female enters the gestation period.\nElephant gestation\nAn elephant's pregnancy and gestation can last approximately 22 months, making it the longest process of all mammals and one of the longest in the animal kingdom. There are several reasons why this is such a long period; elephants are very large, even when they are only fetuses. Owing to their size, the development of the elephant in the mother's womb is slower. The pregnancy is a slow one because it goes hand in hand with development, which of course takes more time. Pregnancy in elephants is maintained by several ovarian hormones, known as corpora lutea. The gestation time also allows for proper development of the elephant's brain. This is very important, since they are highly intelligent animals, and this intelligence allows them to feed themselves using their long trunks. This cerebral development also allows the elephant to survive from the moment it is born.\nInteresting facts about elephant pregnancy\nThere are some interesting facts with regard to elephant pregnancy, such as: Elephants can be artificially inseminated, however this requires invasive methods. Elephants have an original hormonal process that, until now, is not evident in other species. The gestation period of an elephant is over ten months longer than that of the blue whale, which has a period of one year. An elephant calf should weigh between 100 to 150 kilograms (220 to 330 pounds) at birth. Elephants cannot see immediately after birth; they are practically blind. The interval between each birth is approximately 4 to 5 years.\nThe elephant might be the mammal with the longest gestation period, with sperm whales, black rhinos and walruses coming behind. However, there is one animal that surpasses them all: the frilled shark (Chlamydoselachus anguineus). This fish, which can be 2 meters (6'6'') lives at quite low depths and looks a bit like an eel. The frilled shark keeps her embryos - which grow quite slowly - for up to 3 years and a half.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Are Elephants Endangered? Conservation Status, Threats, How to Help", "url": "https://www.treehugger.com/are-elephants-endangered-5025729", "text": "There are two main groups of elephants left on Earth: African elephants and Asian elephants. Both face serious threats to their long-term survival, although the risks vary widely from place to place. Scientists classify all Asian elephants as a single species, and while the same is often done with African elephants, genetic evidence suggests Africa really has two separate species: savanna elephants and forest elephants.\ufeff\ufeff\nAsian elephants are endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which lists African elephants as vulnerable.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff Several million African elephants roamed across the continent as recently as the early 20th century, but today only about 350,000 remain. Asian elephants were less abundant to begin with, reportedly numbering about 200,000 a century ago, giving them even less of a buffer against population declines. There are now fewer than 40,000 Asian elephants left in the wild, raising the specter of extinction unless something can be done to save them.\nThreats to Elephants\nThe main threat to both Asian and African elephants is a familiar one for wildlife around the world: loss and fragmentation of their habitat. Many elephants also face additional dangers, though, including both direct and indirect conflict with people.\nHabitat Loss and Fragmentation\nHumans are encroaching on elephants in Africa as well as Asia, but the pressure is especially severe for Asian elephants. Their habitats are increasingly shrunken and fragmented by agriculture, logging, roads, and development for residential or commercial use. Elephants are migratory animals who depend on large, contiguous territories, and this trend robs them of vital resources like food and water. It can also limit genetic diversity by isolating populations from each other.\nConflict With Humans\nOn top of occupying and altering elephant habitats, people also commonly plant food crops there. As more farms appear in forests and savannas where elephants are accustomed to roaming, their crops often become easy targets for hungry elephants. A herd can destroy a year\u2019s harvest in one night, leading to understandable animosity among farmers, many of whom are nutritionally vulnerable and have little income to offset the loss. This sometimes leads to retaliatory killings of elephants, interactions that are dangerous for everyone involved. These clashes lead to hundreds of deaths across Asia and Africa every year, both elephant and human.\nClimate Crisis\nAll elephants need lots of water, a thirst that drives much of their migratory behavior and daily activities. The need for water can already be a big challenge for elephants even under normal circumstances, but as the climate crisis fuels longer, drier droughts in many places, it can become all but impossible to find enough. This threat is also compounded as their habitats shrink and splinter, since thirsty elephants now have even fewer options for undeveloped places to find water.\nPoaching\nMany elephant populations plummeted last century due to unsustainable hunting, largely fueled by demand for their ivory tusks. And while the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) banned the international trade of ivory in 1989, legal ivory markets have remained in some countries, enabled by a resurgent black market and well-armed gangs of poachers. Poaching can threaten elephants almost anywhere, but most illegal ivory currently comes from African elephants, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), where thousands of elephants are killed by poachers every year.\nWhat Can We Do to Help?\nAside from being intelligent, charismatic, and iconic, elephants are also important keystone species who shape and sustain the ecosystems around them. Many people around the world are dedicated to preserving these ancient creatures; here are a few of their top priorities:\nProtect Their Habitat\nSince the main threat to elephants is habitat loss, it makes sense to focus our conservation efforts on preserving what\u2019s left of their natural environment. Less than 20% of African elephant habitat is under formal protection, according to WWF, while an average of 70% of elephants in Asia are found outside protected areas. For large, migratory animals like elephants, the key is not just protecting isolated pockets of habitat, but also linking those pockets into large-scale wildlife corridors. In India and Nepal, for example, the Terai Arc Landscape project aims to reconnect a chain of 12 protected areas where Asian elephants live.\nReduce Demand for Ivory\nAlthough poaching of African elephants has fallen slightly since a peak in 2011, it remains a significant danger, especially combined with the many other threats facing elephant populations.\ufeff\ufeff Wild elephants need legal protection as well as parks and rangers with resources to enforce those laws, but it will be difficult to stop poaching without also addressing the demand for ivory that drives it. That is another focus for conservationists, who scored an important victory in 2017 when China ended its legal ivory trade. As a consumer, anyone can support the effort to save elephants simply by never buying anything containing ivory.\nHelp Humans Who Share Their Habitat\nPark rangers are on the front lines against armed poachers, and more resources are always needed to protect elephants across huge expanses of space. But the fate of elephants is also more broadly linked to the human communities around them, since people with enough legal opportunities to support their families might be less likely to resort to poaching for income. And where farmers clash with elephants on the fringes of their remaining habitat, conservationists are trying a variety of creative techniques to help both creatures coexist. Many small farmers can\u2019t afford fences strong enough to keep out elephants, for example, but some now surround their crops with beehive fences, which take advantage of elephants\u2019 natural fear of bees. As a bonus, the bees also provide fresh local honey."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "8 Facts About Elephants That Will Touch Your Heart", "url": "https://earthbuddies.net/facts-about-elephants-touch-heart/", "text": "We usually see elephants as huge and powerful animals. The thick skin of them is like an impenetrable armor that protects them from any danger. And the tusks are the weapon that\u2019s feared by other wild animals.\nHowever, beneath that thick skin and huge body, beat gentle and melancholic heart. Yes, elephants have feelings and their feelings are delicate! Here are some facts about those thick-skinned cotton candies that will change how you see them.\n1. They Recognize Themselves\nHuman babies naturally learn to recognize themselves in the mirror as they grow. They then start to learn how to distinguish their appearance from other people around and accept it as their identity.\nOther animals known to have this ability are dolphins, apes, magpies, and elephants. Yes, elephants can recognize themselves in the mirror. This might not sound as a big deal but it means that elephants can see themselves as human did.\nThey can recognize the physical features in their bodies and distinguish it from other elephants. It also means that elephants may able to see and identify each member of their group as we see and identify other people in workplace or school.\nPhoto by : Subi Sridharan\nwebsite : www.shutterzoom.co.uk\nInsta : @shutterzoomuk\n2. Elephants Never Forget\nOften hear that phrase? Well it is indeed a true fact, elephants have really long memory. The memory they keep in their heads said to lasts until tens of years, even lasts for their whole lifetime. There are several evidences of it, the famous one is Jenny and Shirley.\nCarol Buckley at The Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald reported that in 1999 resident elephant Jenny became anxious and could hardly be contained. It happened when Jenny was introduced to newcomer Shirley, an Asian elephant.\nApparently, it was a reunion for them as they crossed path as they were performing in the same circus 23 years earlier. It means that beside elephants can identify each other, they also remember the identity of other elephants in a very long time.\n3. Elephants Hugs Each Other\nWhen we feel down and depressed, sometimes what we need is just a warm hug from people we love. Apparently, that\u2019s not only our nature to give and receive hugs from other people, elephants too.\nAccording to researchers, elephants also hug each other when they see their comrades in hard times. They do it by putting their trunks in each other\u2019s mouth. They do it to offer comfort to those who feel upset or sad.\nIt means that elephants can recognize others\u2019 feeling like human do. Elephants are also known to offer hugs to other species, including their caretaker as a symbol of compassionate and love.\n4. Elephants Mourn The Dead\nElephants are known to mourn the death of their group members. George Wittemyer from Colorado State University who has been studying elephants at the Samburu Reserve since 1997, said that elephants have \u201ca fascination with death\u201d.\n\u201cElephants have respect for their dead, but their interaction with their dead is not something we fully understand,\u201d said Wittemyer to National Geographic. \u201cEvery time it happens, it\u2019s not the same, but it is striking behavior\u2014not based on survival or necessity, but based on some sort of emotion.\u201d\nIt means that elephants are able to feel and show sympathy to each other. Elephants are indeed categorized as one of some animals that are able to do it along with chimpanzees.\n5. Baby Elephants Have Babysitter\nWhen you or your parents need some time to do their chores, that\u2019s when the help of babysitter is needed. But do you know that happen not only to human? Yes, elephants also \u201chire\u201d babysitters for their babies.\nElephants live in a matriarchal herd, and it makes the mothers have more chores to do than just raising their children. In that case, they need help to babysit the calves until the calves are big enough to take care of themselves.\nThe babysitters are usually the young female ones in the herd. This babysitting deed is important to the young elephants\u2019 development. The young females can learn how to take care of the calves so when they give birth themselves they already have the knowledge how to take care of their babies.\n6. Baby Elephants Suck Their Trunks\nAs we know that babies usually suck their thumbs, baby elephants are known to do similar thing too. The baby elephants suck their trunks to comfort themselves.\nNot only sucking the trunks, baby elephants also often seen to play with their trunks. They usually run around and swing that \u201cfunny\u201d part of their body, or grab things with it and toss it around.\nThose baby elephants are also known to throw tantrum when they get upset. It shows how elephants develop feelings like human do since their earlier stage.\n7.Elephants Take Care Of Their Environment\nThe huge mammals are great help to the environment they live in. African elephants are known to dig water holes in dry river beds for water. Those water holes help other animals that live around the herd to get access to water and survive the wild.\nNot only that, African elephants pull down trees and break up thorny bushes to create grasslands that makes other animals\u2019 live easier. This is why they are known as \u201ckeystone species\u201d because they look after the place they are living in and help other animals.\nThe dropping of elephants also contributes to the nature as high-class fertilizer. It replaces the nutrients to the depleted soil and help the seed dispersal for several species of plants.\n8. They Can Cry But Can\u2019t Cry For Our Help\nLooking on the gentle and affectionate nature of elephants, no wonder that they can cry to express their feelings. They may cry to express their sadness, but do you know that they can also burst in tears of joy?\nOne noticeable case is Raju, the elephant that cried when rescuers freed him from a life of torture. The elephant was forced to live in shackles and survive with handouts from tourists only.\nWildlife SOS founder Kartick Satyanarayan said to Mother Nature Network, \u201cThe team were astounded to see tears roll down his face during the rescue. It was so incredibly emotional for all of us. We knew in our hearts he realized he was being freed.\u201d\nIt shows how elephants can feel the way as human beings can too. But the sad story is we cannot understand their language. The elephant we see in tourist attraction sites or television may cry for help but we just don\u2019t understand their language.\nThey can cry but can\u2019t cry for our help. That\u2019s why we as human beings, the most powerful and most perfect creature on earth, should be able to give more attention to those animals. It is easy to donate to elephant conservation, you can find a bunch of sites just by search it on search engines.\nSources:\nhttps://www.peta.org.uk/\nhttps://news.nationalgeographic.com/\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/\nhttp://www.nikela.org/\nhttps://www.mnn.com/"}

After reading our breakdown of five animal \u201cfacts\u201d Snapple got wrong, you might be less likely to believe what you read on the bottom of drink cap.\n1: \u201cSlugs Have Four Noses.\u201d\nThis Snapple \u201cfact\u201d is a bit misleading; rather than four noses, what slugs actually have is two sets of tentacles. Their top set can detect changes in brightness and sense other stimuli, and their bottom set can smell chemicals. While we humans like to assign animal appendages similar roles to what our own can do, these tentacles actually work almost nothing like the way we know our noses to do. (Try saying that three times fast!)\n2: \u201cThe Bullfrog Is the Only Animal that Never Sleeps.\u201d\nWhile there is a continuing belief that bullfrogs are the only animal that never sleeps, there are two problems with this assertion. One is that the concept itself is based largely on a single study from the late 1960s where bullfrogs were found to respond to painful stimuli (a shock) the same way every time they experienced it, even when they were in a resting phase. However, one study is not nearly enough on which to base as bold a statement as this.\nFurthermore, other animals have been found to chuck the necessity for the sleep as well, or at least, to not sleep the way humans do. Dolphins, for example, can rest one half of their brains while the other half stays awake!\n3: \u201cGiraffes Don\u2019t Have Vocal Chords.\u201d\nThis \u201cfact\u201d was simply an assumption based on two observations:\nGiraffes have long necks. Giraffes don\u2019t make a lot of noise.\nIn truth, however, giraffes do have voice boxes, and while it was long believed that they could not make sounds intense enough to be able to vibrate what would need to be incredibly long vocal chords, they actually can. Lions may roar, but giraffes hum, a strange, quiet, snoring sound you can hear here.\n4: \u201cA Hummingbird Weighs Less than a Penny.\u201d\nThis one\u2019s just misleading. The bee hummingbird actually does weigh less than a United States penny, coming in at about 2.4 grams and 2.5 grams, respectively. Still, the bee hummingbird is indigenous to Cuba, not the United States, so you\u2019re not likely to see many of them around. The average U.S. hummingbird weighs around 4 grams, which is definitely heavier than a penny.\n5: \u201cElephants Are the Only Mammals that Can\u2019t Jump.\u201d\nIt is true that elephants cannot jump if we are basing the ability to jump on having all of one\u2019s feet off the ground after propelling oneself upward. However, they are not the only mammals in the non-jumping club. Rhinos can\u2019t jump, and neither can sloths or hippos.\nBy Julia Tilford, contributor for Ripleys.com"}

We take for granted the fact that we are the most intelligent animals on the planet without ever actually considering what it is that sets us apart. Is it object permanence, the ability to plan, tool usage, or the fact that we build complex social relationships? Other animal species possess some of those traits, and some exhibit them all. Read on as we discuss the 10 smartest animals in the world.\n#10: Rats\nRats are very smart animals. They are natural students and are very good at learning and understanding concepts.\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that rats have been used for years as laboratory research animals. Despite having small and comparatively undeveloped brains, their minds function in an extremely similar way to humans, and the brain structure is comparable as well. They have the ability to figure out mazes, memorize routes, and perform complex multiple-step tasks.\nRats are also social animals. When left alone, they begin to exhibit signs of depression and loneliness. These psychological and social differences are why rats are one of the most intelligent animals.\n#9: Pigeons\nPigeons, one of the smartest animals, can recognize all 26 letters of the English language!\nIronically, pigeons are ranked next on our list and are colloquially known as \u201cflying rats.\u201d The reasons for their inclusion here though are significantly different. Pigeons have been proven to recognize their own reflection which shows a complex sense of self-awareness. They have the ability to recognize specific people and places over months and even years of time. That memory is precisely why pigeons were used for centuries to carry messages over great distances. Pigeons can identify all of the letters of the English alphabet, and they can even recognize the difference between two people in pictures.\n#8: Crows\nThe Crow, a very smart animal, are one of the few non-primates that make tools. Rudmer Zwerver/Shutterstock.com\nCrows are another highly intelligent animal species that were also used as messengers much like the pigeon. They are able to use complicated group tactics when in combat with other animals like flanking maneuvers. Crows can also learn speech, and they have an impressive memory. Researchers have recorded instances of crows altering migration patterns to avoid dangerous areas, and crows have even been caught memorizing garbage routes and schedules to more effectively stealing a quick bite to eat from the trucks!\nCrows possess the largest brain of all avian species, and they have shown the ability to recognize human faces. They also are able to use tools despite their obvious lack of hands and arms; in fact, the New Caledonian crow makes a knife to more easily separate leaves and grass. This same species also uses a hook and line to get at hard-to-reach food sources. Some more interesting crow facts are located here.\n#7: Pigs\nPigs are considered by animal experts to be more trainable than dogs or cats and are very smart animals. Sonsedska Yuliia/Shutterstock.com\nPigs just barely edged out dogs for our list of the 10 smartest animals. While dogs have intelligence comparable to a toddler, pigs operate at a much higher IQ level. They are able to understand the concept of reflection at only six weeks old; that is something that takes human children several months to comprehend.\nPigs also have approximately 20 different sounds that they use to communicate, and mother pigs sing to their children while they are feeding. Pigs respond to emotion and even show empathy when appropriate which is an extremely rare trait in the animal kingdom. Other pig facts can be found on this page.\n#6: Octopi\nThe very smart octopus can navigate their way through mazes and solve problems quickly. Andrea Izzotti/Shutterstock.com\nThe octopus is the only invertebrate animal to make our list of the world\u2019s most intelligent animals. As the only member of its class listed here, you may be asking just how smart is an octopus? Captive octopi have been observed using high-order planning with several steps to escape from captivity, and others are able to damage objects even outside of their tank by intentionally splashing water onto them repeatedly. They even throw rocks at glass and have been able to open jars with screw-on lids. These cephalopods are deceptively clever!\n#5: African Grey Parrots\nAfrican grey parrots are not only really smart animals, but they are also helpful! avers/Shutterstock.com\nThe African grey parrot takes the highest avian spot on this list of most intelligent animals. Estimated to be as smart as a five-year-old human, these parrots not only learn human speech, but they can master an impressively large vocabulary (up to hundreds of words). In addition, African greys understand spatial reasoning, recognize and identify shapes and colors, and can even be taught the relationships between bigger and smaller, different and alike, and over and under.\nA popular pet, the African grey parrot is found in a domesticated state throughout the world, but they are native to the rainforests of central Africa. You can find interesting facts about all sorts of parrot species here.\n#4: Elephants\nThe very smart elephant can imitate the sounds of other elephants and even some human words.\nElephants are frequently referenced for their long memory, but they are also one of the smartest animals. Elephants have a complicated social structure and have been witnessed participating in funeral rituals for departed members of their family as well as mourning their loss. Elephants also use tools and medicate themselves; they will eat the leaves of certain plants to cure illness and even induce labor!\nThey are also one of the very few animals that perform altruistic acts. Most animals lack the capacity to process the abstract thinking required of such actions. Elephants will sacrifice themselves if they believe that it will allow the rest of the herd or their children to escape to safety. Read more interesting elephant facts here.\n#3: Chimpanzees\nChimpanzees are very smart animals and are able to solve many different problems posed to them by human trainers and experimenters. Kletr/Shutterstock.com\nOur closest genetic relative comes in third place on this list of the most intelligent animals. Chimpanzees share 98 percent of their DNA with humans, and they are native to sub-Saharan Africa. They are expert tool users, and chimps have been seen improvising tools from available items in order to make what they need. These great apes also use psychological techniques; within their own families, they will manipulate others to accomplish certain tasks.\nOne unique fact about chimpanzees is that scientists discovered adult members of a family unit teaching their young sign language. The most interesting part of that discovery is that there was no human interaction or prompting whatsoever; the chimps took it upon themselves to teach the children sign language, and they were using it to communicate amongst the group. Read more chimpanzees facts here!\n#2: Bottlenose Dolphins\nResearchers think that the very smart bottlenose dolphins are self-aware, which would indicate highly-developed, abstract thinking. Andrea Izzotti/Shutterstock.com\nMany people believe that the bottlenose dolphin is the smartest animal, but it\u2019s ranked number two on this list. How smart is a dolphin? Honestly, it depends; there are over eight species of dolphin, but only the bottlenose dolphin made the cut here. They have the largest brain size among all their relatives, and they are the only dolphin without fused cervical vertebrae which allows them to make those human-like nodding motions with their heads.\nAside from being easily trainable, dolphins are able to recognize themselves in mirrors, notice unfamiliar marks on their body in a reflection, recognize images on television, and have an impressive memory. Dolphins have remembered calls from a mate after a separation of over 20 years. The two most impressive reasons for the bottlenose dolphin\u2019s high place on this list are truly mind-blowing. They have a language specific to their species that they switch to a \u201ccommon language\u201d to communicate when encountering other species of dolphin, and they have even been witnessed cooperating with other species such as humans and false killer whales to more effectively hunt!\n#1: Orangutans\nThe very smart Orangutans will take their time to figure out a problem! Everything I Do/Shutterstock.com\nOrangutans come in the first place here for a very interesting reason. Much like chimpanzees, the orangutan is able to use tools, learn sign language, and have complex social structures that involve rituals. What really sets them apart is the cognitive ability to understand why a certain action is performed. In captivity, an orangutan was taught tool usage and the process of building a simple structure; when he was released to the wild, researchers observed that same orangutan improvising tools from what could be found and then constructing a similar structure to obtain shelter from the rain.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the orangutan is so smart considering that it shares over 97 percent of its DNA with humans. Their tool use is of the highest order when compared to other animal species. They can be trained to use a hammer and nails, and orangutans even learned to use a hose to siphon liquids. Native to Indonesia, they are sadly critically endangered due to habitat loss.\nSmartest Animals List\nAnd that\u2019s our list of the smartest animals on Earth.

Animals that are considered mammals include warm-blooded vertebrates that have hair or fur and whose babies drink milk. Unlike other animal types like birds and insects, all mammal babies drink milk that comes from their mother\u2019s bodies. This is one of the key ways to know if an animal is a mammal. See the complete list of mammals.\nReptiles Lizards, dinosaurs, crocodiles, turtles, and snakes \u2013 all belong to that ancient and stout class of animals known as the reptiles. This is a diverse group with more than 10,000 different species and a huge representation in the fossil record. Once the dominant land vertebrates on the planet, reptiles still occupy just about every single ecosystem outside of the extreme north and south. See the complete list of reptiles.\nFish Fish are aquatic vertebrates. They usually have gills, paired fins, a long body covered with scales, and tend to be cold-blooded. \"Fish\" is a term used to refer to lampreys, sharks, coelacanths and ray-finned fishes, but is not a taxonomic group, which is a clade or group containing a common ancestor and all its descendants. See the complete list of fish.\nBirds Birds, members of the class Aves, include more than 10,400 living species. Their feathers distinguish them from all other classes of animal; no other animals on earth have them. If you see an animal with feathers, it\u2019s undoubtedly a bird. Like mammals, birds are warm-blooded vertebrates with four-chambered hearts. However, they are more closely related to reptiles and are believed to have evolved from dinosaurs. See the complete list of birds.\nAmphibians The official class of amphibians is Amphibia. To have the classification of an amphibian, an animal must be a vertebrate, require water to survive, be cold-blooded, and spend time both on land and in water. Though other animals only live on land or in the water, amphibians have the unique ability to thrive equally in both. Amphibians cover over 6,000 different species across the globe, but about 90% are frogs. See the complete list of amphibians.\nInvertebrates The definition of an invertebrate is any animal that does not have a backbone or vertebral column. The most prolific and easily recognizable members of the invertebrate family are insects. It\u2019s estimated that upwards of 30 million individual species of invertebrates may exist accounting for between 90-95 percent of all organisms on the planet. See the complete list of invertebrates.\nInsects All insects are part of the taxonomical phylum Arthropoda, and they are collectively referred to as arthropods. It is common to see this name misspelled as \u201canthropod,\u201d but this is not the correct term. They can be found in nearly every environment on the planet, and they currently account for over half of all known living organisms in the world. They have undergone many cycles of evolution depending on the resources available to them.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephant Facts \u2013 Guide to African Elephants", "url": "http://www.africanelephants.com/facts/", "text": "African elephants are the favorite animals of many people around the world. Afican elephants are larger than Asian elephants. The males can stand 12 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh 12,000 pounds, while females are a bit smaller in the 8,000 to 11,000 pound range. They have four molars that weigh about 11 pounds each, and these are replaced six times throughout their lives as the front ones wear down and the back ones shift forward.\nAfrican Elephant tusks can weigh from 50 to 100 pounds and stretch up to 8 feet in length. Both cows and bulls have tusks. The two main african elephant species are the African Bush Elephant (Loxodonta africana) and the African Forest Elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis).\nAfrican elephant conservation efforts are underway throughout the world, but every once in a while african elephant communities grow too large and need to be culled to preserve the ecosystem. Just take a look around to find african elephant facts and pictures of african elephants. We also have created a directory of zoos that have African elephants and found a live African elephant camera!\nAfricanElephants.com has a great unique feature: Ask the Expert! We have partnered with an expert in the field of African Elephants and he will answer many user submitted questions. Check out the questions and answers that he has already completed. Our african elephant expert Tim is an experienced researcher who often spends his summer in Africa studying elephants up close.\nThe scientific name for the African elephant is Loxodonta africana. There are currently two subspecies, the savanna or bush elephant Loxodonta africana africana and the forest elephant, Loxodonta africana cyclotis. Some researchers think these are actually two distinct species but this is still being debated.\nAccording to the 2007 African Elephant Status Report, a document put out by a group of elephant researchers, there are currently over 550,000 elephants in Africa. It is not possible to know exactly how many elephants there are in the entire continent because individuals are born and die every day and sometimes animals are missed when a count is conducted. For example, if researchers are counting the number of elephants in a national park, they might miss some that are in dense brush or under trees. Also, the number above does not include African elephants in captivity.\nMale African elephants can grow to be about 10.8 ft (3.3m) tall while females are smaller, growing up to about 8.5 ft (2.6m). The average height of humans is around 5.5 ft (1.7m) so elephants can be anywhere from 25% larger to double the height of people."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephant - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant", "text": "Loxodonta africana, in Luanga National Park, The African elephant,, in Luanga National Park, Zambia\nElephants are large grey animals with big ears, long noses and white tusks. They are the largest living land mammals. The largest elephant recorded was one shot in Angola, 1974. It weighed 27,060 pounds (12.25 tonnes) and stood 13 feet 8 inches (2.16 m) tall.\nAt birth, an elephant calf may weigh as much as 100 kg (225 pounds). The baby elephant develops for 20 to 22 months inside its mother. No other land animal takes this long to develop before being born.\nIn the wild, elephants have strong family relationship. Their ways of acting toward other elephants are hard for people to understand. They \"talk\" to each other with very low sounds. Most elephants sounds are so low, people cannot hear them. But elephants can hear these sounds far away. Elephants have strong, leathery skin to protect themselves.\nPhysical description [ change | change source ]\nThere are two living genera of elephants. These are the African Loxodonta africanus, and the Asian elephants Elephas maximus.\nAn elephant's most obvious part is the trunk. The trunk is a very long nose, made from the upper lip. An elephant uses its trunk to grab objects such as food. Though the rest of an elephant's skin is strong and thick, its trunk is very soft and sensitive. Elephants avoid Acacia trees with ants because they can bite the inside of an elephant's trunk.  The trunk is also used when it trumpets. The elephant usually stands still, raises its trunk, and blows. This is a signal to other elephants and wildlife.\nElephants have teeth and tusks. Tusks are large teeth coming out of their upper jaws. A lot of ivory comes from elephant tusks. Ivory traders killed many elephants, so now hunting them is illegal.\nIn total, they have 24 teeth: 12 front teeth, called premolars, and 12 back teeth, called molars. When the last molar wears out, the elephant dies because it cannot eat. They can live for about 70 years. But in a zoo or circus, people can keep elephants alive by feeding them soft food.\nGrass wears down their teeth because it has a high concentration of silica and is very abrasive. Elephants use their teeth in sequence, not all at once. This means that, at any time, they only have one tooth in each jaw, a total of four.\nDifferences between African and Asian elephants [ change | change source ]\nAfrican elephants are larger and have bigger ears. They are grazers who still do quite a lot of browsing: they eat leaves, branches and grass. These big ears have many veins, which carry blood throughout the body. Biologists think that the blood going through their ears helps African elephants to cool off. The weather is hotter in Africa than in Asia, so cooling is important for African elephants. Female African elephants have tusks, but female Asian elephants do not. African elephants have a low place in their back. African elephants have two \"fingers\" at the end of their trunks, but Asian elephants only have one. Indian elephants eat mainly grass.\nSome African elephants live on the savanna while others live in the forest. Today, many people think these are different species. Scientists named the forest group Loxodonta cyclotis and the savanna group Loxodonta africanus.\nThe African forest elephant is the third largest living land animal in the world.\nElephants are distantly related to sea cows, which are large aquatic mammals. Early ancestors in the Palaeocene and Eocene were small, semi-aquatic animals. By the Miocene several groups of large mainly forest-dwelling elephants evolved, the gomphotheres and deinotheres. Their teeth show little wear, indicating a diet of soft, nongritty, forest vegetation.\nModern elephants \u2013 the actual family Elephantidae \u2013 evolved from gomphotheres as the climate became cooler and drier in the Pliocene and Pleistocene. This includes the mammoth and mastodon as well as modern elephants.\nThe gomphotheres lasted a long time, and were hunted by modern man. There was a change in plant resources, with the reduced forests and extended grassland. This favoured specialist grass feeders over generalist eaters. This change in the dietary supply was one of the factors which forced gomphotheres toward extinction in the late Pleistocene in South America. The remaining population probably succumbed to climatic change and/or human predation around the time of the Holocene margin.\nThe significant thing about modern elephants (especially Indian elephants) is that they eat grass: they are primarily grazers, rather than browsers. Compared with gomphotheres, the teeth of modern elephants are quite different.\nHumans have used elephants for different things. The Carthaginian general Hannibal took some elephants across the Alps when he fought the Romans. He probably used the North African elephant, a kind of elephant that does not live today. It was smaller than other African elephants. Elephants are used by tourists as rides.\nPeople have used Indian elephants to move around and to have fun. Many circuses have them. Siamese, Indians, and other South Asians used them for several things. They fought in armies, and they crushed criminals. They also did heavy work like lifting trees and moving logs.\nHowever, people have never domesticated elephants. Domesticated animals are tame and have babies under human control. The male elephant in heat is dangerous and hard to control. This state is called musth. Most elephants used by people are female, except those used in war. In a battle, female elephants run from males, so armies needed males. Elephants are used by tourists for riding.\nStatus today [ change | change source ]\nBoth African and Asian elephants are endangered species. Elephants in captivity do not make many babies, and some captive elephants are abused and mistreated.\nAfrican elephants receive some legal protection in every country where they are found. However, 70% of their range exists outside protected areas. Conservation efforts in some areas have led to more elephants. Local numbers may be controlled by contraception or moving the elephants to other places. Large-scale culling (legal killing) ceased in 1988, when Zimbabwe stopped doing it. In 1989, trade in elephants and their products (ivory, meat) was made illegal. Appendix II status (which allows restricted trade) was given to elephants in Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe in 1997 and South Africa in 2000. In some countries, sport hunting of the animals is legal: Botswana, Cameroon, Gabon, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe have export quotas for elephant trophies. The IUCN estimates a total of around 440,000 individuals for 2012.\nThe total population of Asian elephants is about 40,000\u201350,000 (a rough estimate). Around half of the population is in India. Although Asian elephants are declining in numbers overall, particularly in Southeast Asia, the population in the Western Ghats may be increasing.\nA female elephant will have a single baby (called a \"calf\") every four or five years. Calves are born 85 cm (33 in) tall and weigh around 120 kg (260 lb). An elephant's gestation lasts about 22 months. Another female elephant often stays with the new mother until its baby is born. The newborn elephant can often stand within a half hour after it is born. Mother elephants touch their babies gently with their trunks. It takes a baby a year or more to control its trunk and learn its many uses.\nBaby elephants nurse for the first two years of their lives. After it is born, the first thing that the baby does is wobble in search of its mother's milk. It drinks about 10 liters of milk every day.\nWhite elephants are considered holy in Thailand.\nThe most famous fictional elephant is Dumbo. It is a flying elephant in a Disney movie. The Elephant's Child is one of Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories\nGanesha is the god of wisdom in Hinduism. He has an elephant's head.\nThe elephant is the symbol for the United States Republican Party. It is like the Democratic Party's donkey. The first person to use the elephant as a symbol for the Republican Party was Thomas Nast. He did that in a Harper's Weekly cartoon in 1874."}

Each one of them represents an ancient tome of biological trivia.\nThe incredible things that our animals can do are often hidden from humans. Human Beings are aware of the existence of many kinds of animals, but still, they are unknown to some fun facts about animals.\nOur animal kingdom consists of millions of majestic, mysterious, and magnificent species. These amazing creatures that live on our land, beneath the oceans, and beyond will surely make you smile when you discover interesting fun facts about them.\nHere are some of the fun facts about animals from around the world that will remind you that the world is an awesome place.\n1.Koala fingerprints are so close to humans' that they could taint crime scenes.\nIf you take a closer look at Koalas hands, you'd see that they have fingerprints that are almost identical just like humans.\nIn fact, they're so similar that not even careful analysis under a microscope can easily distinguish when it involves loopy, whirling ridges on koalas' fingers from our own.\n2.Parrots will selflessly help each other out.\nResearchers have discovered that parrots will voluntarily help each other obtain food rewards and perform selfless acts.\nAccording to a 2020 study published in Current Biology co-author Auguste von Bayern noted, \"African grey parrots were intrinsically motivated to assist others, albeit the opposite individual wasn't their friend, in order that they behaved very pro-socially.\n3.Prairie dogs kiss.\nPrairie dogs are quirky creatures as they're giant rodents, they dig massive underground homes, and that they kiss. When they seem to be sweetly sharing a smooch they are actually touching their front teeth to identify each other.\nThe BBC explains that scientists believe prairie dogs kiss and cuddle more when they are being watched by zoo visitors because they enjoy the attention.\n4.The mantis shrimp has the world's fastest punch.\nIt's the mantis shrimp that has the world's fastest punch than a boxer, traveling at about 50 mph.\nAccording to Science its little fists are \"accelerating faster than a .22-caliber bullet\".

Consistent with Guinness World Records, the oldest known breed of domesticated dog goes all the way back to 329 BC.\"There are carvings found in Sumer which represent a dog, which resembles a Saluki, which dates back to 7000 BC.\"\n6.And the oldest evidence of domesticated cats dates back 9,500 years.\nAccording to Guinness World Records reports humans have been domesticating cats for over 9,500 years.\nIn 2004 it was proved \"bones of a cat were discovered within the Neolithic village of Shillourokambos in Cyprus. The position of the cat within the ground was next to the bones of a person's, whose similar state of preservation strongly suggests they were buried together.\"\n7.Bottlenose dolphins are even more right-handed than humans.\nAccording to Scientific American \"Around 70-80% humans are right-handed and the remaining are left-handed\". And the same goes for bottlenose dolphins.\nA team of Florida's Dolphin Communication Project noticed the feeding behavior of bottlenose dolphins and found that the animals were turning to their left side 99.44 percent of the time, which \"actually suggests a right-side bias\".\n8.Cows painted with zebra-like stripes can avoid being bitten by flies.\nCows have to deal with the annoying pesky flies. Farmers can now protect their animals by painting them with zebra-like stripes.\nA study of PLOS One published in 2019 states that \"the numbers of biting flies on Japanese Black cows painted with black-and-white stripes were significantly less than those on non-painted cows and cows painted only with black stripes.\" This worked because the stripes cause a sort of motion that confused them much within the way that optical illusions.\n9.Capuchin monkeys wash their hands and feet in urine.\nCapuchin monkeys wash their feet and hands in urine to urge comfort or sex.

That's because they need a secret handshake or password.\"\nCowbirds lay their eggs in other bird's nests, which suggests that their little ones eventually got to reconnect with their own kind when the time is true. And when that point comes, the young birds have a trick for deciding whom to succeed in bent, simply they use \"a specific chatter call\" to interact with one another.\n12.Pigeons can do the math.\nOne of the studies of 2011 published in the journal Science found that birds are capable of doing math. During the study, the pigeons were asked to compare nine images, each containing a different number of objects.\nThe researchers found that the birds were able to rank the images in order of how many objects they contained. You might think of pigeons as not that smart but they're actually quite intelligent!\n13.Frogs can freeze without dying.\nAccording to Kenneth Storey, a professor at Carleton University \"We have false springs here all the time where it gets really warm and all the snow melts and then suddenly bam the wind comes from the north and it's back down to -10 to -15 Celsius and they're fine\". Frogs undergo repeated freeze-thaw cycles.\n14.Reindeer eyes turn blue in the winter.\nAccording to the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, \"the eyes of Arctic reindeer change color through the seasons from gold to blue, adapting to extreme changes of sunshine levels in their environment.\"\nThe change in color impacts how light is reflected through the animals' retina, and improves their vision. Reindeers have beautiful baby blues eyes but only in the winter!\n15.Sloths can take up to a month to completely digest a single leaf.\nEverything about life is slow for these sleepy mammals. With its slow metabolism, it's going to take the sloth a month to digest one leaf.\nFor comparison, it takes the typical human 12 to 48 hours to ingest, digest, and eliminate waste from food.\n16.Adult cats only meow at humans.\nAccording to the ASPCA, while \u201cKittens meow to let their mother know they\u2019re cold or hungry, but once they get a bit older, cats no longer meow to other cats.\nBut they continue to meow at people throughout their lives.\u201d Cats mostly do this to get human\u2019s attention. Next time the cat wants your attention, it will make \u2018miaow\u2019 again!\n17.Painted turtles survive winter by breathing through their butts.\nPainted turtles need to adapt to frozen ponds, which restrict their access to the air above the water. In the winter, Painted Turtles do something called brumation, which may be a period of dormancy, almost like hibernation. During brumation, these turtles use their butts for breathing. This process is called cloacal respiration.\n18.Snow leopards don't roar.\nAccording to a study of 2010 published in the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, scientists researched why some cats have a higher-pitched meow than others. Through this study, they found that it's not the size that determines a kitty's call, but its habitat.\nSnow leopards have less-developed vocal cords than their fellow large cats, this means that they can't roar, but make a purr-like sound called a chuff.\n19.Squirrels will adopt orphans.\nAn evolutionary biologist Andrew McAdam said, \u201cSocial animals, including lions and chimpanzees, are often surrounded by relatives, so it isn't surprising that a female would adopt an orphaned loved one because they need already spent tons of your time together.\u201d\nAccording to the study of the University of Guelph, animals will take in the orphaned pups of their late family members. Turns out, squirrels have an intense motherly instinct.\n20.Moths experience love at first scent.\nWell, love, at first sight, is not only meant for humans but the same goes for a moth.\nWhen a male moth catches a whiff of a female moth, he'll travel miles to find her\u2060 based on her scent alone.\nAccording to the experts at Audobon, \"they don't know what the female sounds like, or even what she looks like. But when they smell her, boy, do they know it, and they use her seductive musk to track her down.\"\n21.Ravens are masters of deception.\nA 2002 study published in Animal Behaviour found that these birds have the ability to deceive each other. The entire corvid family which includes crows, ravens, and jays is exceptionally intelligent. Ravens have also been known to play pranks on one another and to tease other animals.\n22.Cats recognize their own name but choose not to respond.\nIn a 2019 study published in Scientific Reports, researchers discovered that cats can recognize their own name but they don't necessarily feel obligated to respond.\nSorry, cat owners, your pet does know when you're calling their name, yet they're ignoring you.\n23.Cows produce more milk when listening to slow music.\nResearchers at the University of Leicester School of Psychology found that slow music can reduce stress in cows and increase the amount of milk they produce by 3% as opposed to more upbeat tunes.\n24.Catfish have taught themselves how to kill pigeons.\nIn southwestern France, a group of European catfish has learned to kill pigeons, launching themselves out of the water to grab the sunbathing birds.\nResearchers have no idea why they hunt the birds but guess it could be because of declining prey.\n25.Dragonflies create a heart with their tails while mating\nDragonflies even create a combined heart-shaped with their tails when mating. Dragonflies symbolize change, transformation, adaptability, mark a sign of spiritual growth, and emotional maturity seeing one of these flutterings around has a special meaning. Not only this, but they also embody love in many ways.\n26.Penguins propose to each other with pebbles\nJust like humans propose to each other by exchanging a ring, penguins also use the same method but with a pebble. When penguins choose a mate, they give a small stone over to them, which represents their lifelong commitment to each other. This one really pulls on your heartstrings!\n27.Ghost crabs growl using teeth in their stomachs.\nGhost crabs can growl at their enemies sort of a dog. crabs make fearsome noises using their teeth located within the stomachs. Ghost crabs utilize a special animal acoustic communication system.\nThey can make different sounds by striking the ground with their claws, rubbing their claws together to make a rasping sound, rubbing their legs to make a bubbly noise, and rubbing the teeth inside their stomachs to make a growling sound.\n28.Female lions do 90 percent of the hunting.\nAccording to CBS News \"Lionesses, not male lions, do the majority of hunting for their pride\".\nWhile male lions attract their fair share of attention thanks to their impressive men, it's the female lions who do the bulk of the work when it comes to feeding their families. 29. Some sharks glow in the dark.\n29. Sharks glow in the dark\nThe researchers, from Belgium and New Zealand, found that some shark species produce a glow that only other sharks can see.\nAccording to CNN this glow \"helps sharks identify each other and even fight against infection on a microbial level.\"\n30.Baby Tasmanian devils make life-long friendships.\nIf you have best friends who have been around since you were a child, then you have something in common with Baby Tasmanian devils.\nResearch has shown that Tasmanian devils form bonds when they're young, engage in friendly sleep-overs, that last for the rest of their lives.\nSo these are the 30 amazing fun facts about animals that will shock you.

But if you imagine it as a marine mammal and place it on its side, swimming ... now you\u2019ve got a blue whale.\nBalaenoptera musculus, the blue whale, is the largest animal ever known to have lived on the planet, including all dinosaurs. Even at birth, it's larger than adults from most other animal species. The planet is covered with amazing, fascinating creatures, but the blue whale is in a league of its own. Consider the following.\n1. Blue Whales Can Grow More Than 100 Feet Long\nThey are gigantic. Generally ranging in length from 80 to 100 feet (24 to 30 meters), the longest one ever recorded was a magnificent 108 feet (33 meters) long. That's about as long as three school buses lined up end to end.\n2. They Can Weigh as Much as 30 Elephants\nThe average weight for these gentle giants is 200,000 to 300,000 pounds (90,000 to 136,000 kilograms), or about 100 to 150 tons. Some can weigh as much as 441,000 pounds (200,000 kg), or 220 tons. For comparison, an adult African bush elephant weighs up to 6 tons, so it may take 30 or more elephants to equal the weight of one blue whale.\n3. They Have Big Hearts\nThe heart of a blue whale may only beat twice per minute while diving. eco2drew / Getty Images\nThe blue whale's heart is huge. It's the largest heart in the animal kingdom, weighing about 400 pounds (180 kg) and roughly the size of a bumper car. As a blue whale dives to feed, its giant heart may only beat twice per minute.\n4. They Have Big Tongues, Too\nA blue whale\u2019s tongue alone can weigh as much as some elephants.\n5. They Have the Biggest Babies on Earth\nBlue whale calves are the biggest babies on Earth, easily, and at birth already rank among the largest full-grown animals. They pop out at around 8,800 pounds (4,000 kg) with a length of some 26 feet (8 meters). They gain 200 pounds (90 kg) a day! Their growth rate is likely one of the fastest in the animal world, with a several billion-fold increase in tissue in the 18 months from conception to weaning.\n6. They\u2019re Unusually Loud\nBlue whales, in fact, are the loudest animals on the planet. A jet engine registers at 140 decibels; the call of a blue whale reaches 188. Their language of pulses, groans, and moans can be heard by others up to 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) away.\n7. They Eat a Lot of Krill\nBlue whales feast on krill; their stomachs can hold 2,200 pounds (1,000 kg) of the tiny crustaceans at a time. They require almost 9,000 pounds (4,000 kg) of the little guys a day, and around 40 million krill daily during the summer feeding season.\n8. They're Pretty Fast\nBlue whales can swim at speeds up to 20 mph, but they usually travel more slowly. NOAA / CC BY 2.0\nThey travel a lot, spending summers feeding in polar regions and making the long trip to the equator as winter comes along. While they have a cruising speed of 5 mph (8 kph), they can accelerate up to 20 mph (32 kph) when needed.\n9. They Have Long Life Spans\nBlue whales are among the planet\u2019s longest-lived animals. Kind of like counting tree rings, scientists count layers of wax in the ears and can determine a ballpark age. The oldest blue whale they\u2019ve discovered this way was calculated to be around 100 years old, though the average life is thought to last around 80 to 90 years.\n10. They Once Were Abundant\nBefore whalers discovered the treasure trove of oil that a blue whale could provide, the species was plentiful. But with the advent of 20th-century whaling fleets, their population plummeted until finally receiving worldwide protection in 1967. From 1904 to 1967, more than 350,000 blue whales were killed in the Southern Hemisphere, according to the World Wildlife Fund. In 1931, during the heyday of whaling, an astounding 29,000 blue whales were killed in a single season.\n11. Their Future Remains Uncertain\nWhile commercial whaling is no longer a threat, recovery has been slow and new threats plague blue whales, like ship strikes and the impact of climate change. There is one population of around 2,000 blue whales off the coast of California, but all told there are only around 10,000 to 25,000 individuals left. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the species as endangered. Hopefully with time, the planet\u2019s largest gentle giants will again roam the seas aplenty."}

Further complicating matters, it's possible that these elephants were capable of interbreeding--meaning the Dwarf Elephants of Cyprus may have been 50 percent Mammuthus and 50 percent Stegodon, while those of Malta were a unique blend of all three genera.\nWhile the evolutionary relationships of Dwarf Elephants are a matter of dispute, the phenomenon of \"insular dwarfism\" is well understood. As soon as the first full-sized prehistoric elephants arrived on, let's say, the small island of Sardinia, their ancestors began evolving toward smaller sizes in response to limited natural resources (a colony of full-sized elephants eats thousands of pounds of food every day, much less so if the individuals are only one-tenth the size). The same phenomenon occurred with the dinosaurs of the Mesozoic Era; witness the shrimpy Magyarosaurus, which was only a fraction of the size of it continental titanosaur relatives.\nAdding to the mystery of the Dwarf Elephant, it hasn't yet been proved that the extinction of these 500-pound-beasts had anything to do with the early human settlement of the Mediterranean. However, there is a tantalizing theory that the skeletons of dwarf elephants were interpreted as Cyclopses (one-eyed monsters) by the early Greeks, who incorporated these long-gone beasts into their mythology thousands of years ago! (By the way, the Dwarf Elephant shouldn't be confused with the Pygmy Elephant, a smaller relative of African elephants that exists today in very limited numbers.)"}

They are: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant and the Asian elephant (also known as the Indian elephant). All other species are extinct.\nPhotograph by Nick Brandt\n2.\nElephants are the world\u2019s largest land animals now living. The largest elephant ever recorded was shot in Angola in 1956. This male weighed about 24,000 lb (11,000 kg), with a shoulder height of 3.96 meters (13.0 ft), a metre (yard) taller than the average male African elephant.\nPhotograph by Beverly Joubert\n3.\nThe elephant\u2019s gestation period is 22 months, the longest of any land animal. At birth it is common for an elephant calf to weigh 120 kilograms (260 lb). They typically live for 50 to 70 years, but the oldest recorded elephant lived for 82 years. Healthy adult elephants have no natural predators, although lions may take calves or weak individuals.\nPhotograph by paddyboy\n4.\nWith a mass just over 5 kg (11 lb), elephant brains are larger than those of any other land animal. A wide variety of behaviours associated with intelligence have been attributed to elephants, including those associated with grief, making music, art, altruism, play, use of tools, compassion and self-awareness.\nPhotograph by Eduard\n5.\nElephants live in a structured social order. The social lives of male and female elephants are very different. The females spend their entire lives in tightly knit family groups made up of mothers, daughters, sisters, and aunts. These groups are led by the eldest female, or matriarch. Adult males, on the other hand, live mostly solitary lives.\nPhotograph by Nick Brandt\n6.\nThe tusks of an elephant are its second upper incisors. Tusks grow continuously; an adult male\u2019s tusks grow about 18 cm (7 in) a year. Tusks are used to dig for water, salt, and roots; to debark trees to eat the bark; to dig into baobab trees to get at the pulp inside; and to move trees and branches when clearing a path. In addition, they are used for marking trees to establish territory, and occasionally as weapons.\nPhotograph by Nick Brandt\n7.\nThe proboscis, or trunk, is a fusion of the nose and upper lip, elongated and specialized to become the elephant\u2019s most important and versatile appendage. African elephants are equipped with two fingerlike projections at the tip of their trunk, while Asians have only one. The elephant\u2019s trunk is sensitive enough to pick up a single blade of grass, yet strong enough to rip the branches off a tree.\nThe trunk is also used for drinking. Elephants suck water up into the trunk\u2014up to 14 liters (15 quarts) at a time\u2014and then blow it into their mouths. Elephants also suck up water to spray on their bodies during bathing. On top of this watery coating, the animals will then spray dirt and mud, which dries and acts as a protective sunscreen. When swimming, the trunk makes an excellent snorkel.\nPhotograph by Sandy Powers\n8.\nElephants swim well, but cannot trot, jump, or gallop. They do have two gaits: a walk and a faster gait that is similar to running.\nPhotograph by Aaron Logan\n9.\nAfrican elephants, are currently found in 37 countries in Africa. They are distinguished from Asian elephants in several ways, the most noticeable being their much larger ears. Also, the African elephant is typically larger than the Asian elephant and has a concave back. In Asian elephants, only males have tusks, but both males and females of African elephants have tusks and are usually less hairy than their Asian cousins.\nPhotograph by William Albert Allard\n10.\nElephants are herbivores and spend up to 16 hours a day eating plants. Their diets are highly variable, both seasonally and across habitats and regions. Elephants are primarily browsers, feeding on the leaves, bark, and fruits of trees and shrubs, but they may also eat considerable grasses and herb.\nPhotograph by Nick Brandt\nPhotograph by Sklmsta\nPhotograph by Eduard\nPhotograph by Sandy Powers\nPhotograph by Bernard Gagnon\nPhotograph by Nick Brandt\nPhotograph by George Steinmetz\nPhotograph by Nick Brandt\nPhotograph by Frank G. and Frances Carpenter\nPhotograph by Andrew Styan\nSOURCES\n\u2013 Wikipedia: Elephant\n\u2013 1x.com: Photography\n\u2013 Nick Brandt: Photography\n\u2013 National Geographic\nIf you enjoyed this article, the Sifter highly recommends: 10 AWESOME FACTS ABOUT OWLS [15 PICS]"}

Of course, cute little kitties might not be everyone's cup of tea but not to worry, since there are so many other kinds of fluffs (and not only them) to cheer anyone up. And sometimes all you need is just a little something behind that cute photo or video, therefore this time we are here to warm up your hearts with the cutest uplifting facts the animal kingdom has to offer!\n#1 Cats Don't Think Of Us As Humans. Instead, They See Us As Equals, Just Like Other Cats By nudging you with their heads (bunting) they're actually greeting you as they would another member of their cat family. This means that to them we're probably the ugliest, biggest, and clumsiest cats they've ever seen but they accept you into their family and love you anyways.\n#2 Sea Otters Hold Hands While They\u2019re Sleeping So That They Don\u2019t Drift Apart\n#3 Tiger Populations Are On The Rise\n#4 Dogs Sneeze When Play Fighting To Show They Are Playing And Don\u2019t Wanna Hurt You\n#5 When A Baby Elephant Is Born, Other Mothers In The Social Group Will Trumpet To Celebrate Or Announce The Baby's Arrival Elephants tend to stay in close \"family\" groups for their whole lives, which are generally made up of female elephants (the males often leave the group to go mate, but sometimes group up with other solitary males). So other female elephants are often present for new births.\n#6 Cows Have \"Best Friends\" And Are Happier When They're With Them A study from Northampton University found that when cows were paired with another cow that shared a social bond with them, their heart rate was lower and they were more relaxed while they were penned.\n#7 There's An Abandoned Minefield That Has Accidentally Created A Penguin Sanctuary. The Mines Keep Poachers Out, But The Penguins Are Too Small To Set Them Off The mines were set on the Falkland Islands when Argentinian commandos occupied the territory in a 1982 conflict with British forces. Since then, Magellanic penguins have thrived in the area. And because the areas are well-marked and fenced off, no civilian has been injured by the mines, either.\n#8 An Otter Will Find A Pebble As A Juvenile And Keep It For Their Whole Life If that's not cute enough for you, they keep the pebble in the pocket that forms of the skin folds of their armpit.\n#9 Your Dog Probably Dreams About You\n#10 There Are Little Tiny Harvest Mice That Sleep Inside Flowers\n#11 Pandas Are No Longer Considered An Endangered Species Also, being a professional panda caretaker is one of the highest paying jobs in China, if I remember correctly, their average salary is about $32.5k.\n#12 Dogs Can Tell When You're Due To Come Home By How Much Of Your Scent Is Remaining In The House Ever wondered how your dog seems to be able to tell time accurately? If you or someone you live with has a daily routine, your dog might go linger by the door or start looking out the window right before their human is due home because they can smell how much your scent has deteriorated in your absence.\n#13 Bees Get Sleepy After Drinking Nectar And Occasionally Take Naps On Flowers\n#14 Dolphin Mothers Sing To Their Babies While They're In The Womb According to a study at the University of Southern Mississippi, dolphin mothers will make a \"signature whistle\" for the benefit of their calf while it's in the womb. This whistle is thought to act as a sort of \"name\" for the mother, allowing the calf and mother to locate each other easily once it's born. After the calf is born, other nearby adult dolphins will whistle less, likely to help the calf learn and use the right whistle.\n#15 Ravens Can Remember Faces And You Can Befriend Them Of course, befriending them will require some bribing with food. But they will later recognize you and fly over. Worth it!\n#16 When Dogs Appear In Movies And TV, Sometimes They Have To Have Cgi Tails Because They Wag Too Much During The Scene This happened during filming of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, when some husky dog actors didn't look \"menacing\" because of their happily wagging tails. It's possible that they were wagging because they knew they were doing a good job at their acting tasks. The same happened while filming \"White Fang\" and \"Game of Thrones\".\n#17 Squirrels Adopt Other Baby Squirrels If They're Orphaned\n#18 Your Dog Actually Loves You, Not Just Because You Give Them Food And Walks Studies that measured oxytocin levels, heart rates, and other biometrics showed that levels of bonding hormones rose and heart rates fell in both humans and their dogs after interacting with each other. In other words, when you pet your dog, both of you produce more of the same hormone in your brain that makes you fall in love with people, and both of you relax more.\n#19 Penguins Not Only Mate For Life, They Will Also Spend Time To Find A Beautiful Pebble For Their Mate And Then \"Propose\" With It\n#20 Goats And Cows Have Accents Cows tend to moo differently depending on the region they live in. It's similar for goats, but goats will also adopt a new \"accent\" if they hang out with new goats for a while.\n#21 Bees Make A \"Whoop!\" Sound When They Bump Into Each Other Or Are Startled\n#22 Some Tiny Spiders Wear Water Droplets As Hats\n#23 Dolphins Will Intentionally Play With Puffer Fish And Get Poked By The Spikes. The Poison In The Spikes Gets Them High\n#24 Tigers Are Unable To Purr, So In Order To Show Affection, They Close Their Eyes And \"Chuff\" Because Closing Their Eyes Means They Leave Themselves Vulnerable By leaving themselves vulnerable, they are saying that they trust each other.\n#25 Some Penguins Are Ticklish\n#26 Cows Take Turns In Babysitting Their Young. One Will Stay With The Calves While Other Moms Graze Further Away\n#27 Octopuses Make Cute Little Gardens By Collecting Stones And Shiny Things And Arranging Them In The Sand\n#28 Hundreds Of Trees Become Seedlings Every Year Because Of Squirrels Forgetting Where They Buried Their Food According to Rob Swihart, a professor of wildlife science at Purdue University, gray squirrels bury their food (nuts, acorns, etc.) all over the place but often forget to dig them back up. Those buried seeds have a good chance of becoming full-grown trees.\n#29 It Takes Some Time For Baby Elephants To Get Control Of Their Trunks\n#30 Prairie Dogs Say Hello By Kissing\n#31 Red Pandas Use Their Fluffy Tails As Blankets To Keep Warm When They Sleep\n#32 Baby Elephants Suck On Their Trunk For Comfort\n#33 Ducks Like To Surf.

Members Of The Pack Watch Over The Young When The Parents Go Hunting\n#36 Guinea Pigs Hop Up And Down When Excited And Apparently It's Called \"Popcorning\" A bunch of other animals also do this too\n#37 Sea Horses Get \"Married\" Seahorses tend to be monogamous and will intertwine their tails to stick together while floating through the ocean. Is it because they\u2019re cute and loving, or is it just an evolutionary aspect of their species? The truth is, seahorses are pretty bad swimmers and spend a lot of time hiding from predators. Finding a mate for life boosts their chances of successful reproduction.\n#38 Chinchilla Fur Is So Dense That It's Very Bad For Them To Get Wet. So Instead Of Bathing In Water, They Bathe In Dust\n#39 Dolphins Have Names For One Another Scientists at the University of St. Andrews state that \"Each dolphin produces its own unique signature whistle that describes its individual identity.

It often grows in dense, bamboo-like clumps.\nElephant grass has narrow leaves that can reach 2 to 3 feet in length and 1 inch in width. Leaves have prominent white central vein, pointed tips and razor-sharp edges. They are pale green colored and alternately arranged on the stem.\nElephant grass and sugar cane have similar morphology. They differ in size (sugar cane can reach 19.8 feet in height) and shape of leaves (elephant grass has narrower leaves).\nFlowers of elephant grass are arranged in the form of elongated seed-heads. Each seed-head consists of numerous spikelets that are surrounded with fine bristles. Seed-heads can be greenish, yellow or purple colored. Flowers of elephant head contain both types of reproductive organs (perfect flowers).\nElephant grass blooms during the spring and summer. Flowers are designed for pollination by wind.\nFruit of elephant grass is dry, seed-like grain (caryopsis). Seed is small, brown-colored and oval shaped.\nAnimals, wind and water facilitate dispersal of seed of elephant grass in the wild.\nElephant grass propagates via seed, sprigs and stem cuttings.\nElephant grass is used as animal fodder (primary source of food for dairy cattle in East Africa). Elephant grass can be easily cultivated in many areas because it does not require too much water and nutrients for the successful growth. Elephant grass can be harvested 4 to 6 times per year.\nElephant grass is often cultivated near commercially important crops, such as maize and sorghum, to attract pests (such as stemborer moths) and prevent damage on the main agricultural crops.\nDense stands of elephant grass provide shelter for many birds.\nElephant grass is often cultivated as windbreak and firebreak. It is also used to improve fertility of the soil and in the control of erosion.\nElephant grass is used for the manufacture of paper, oil, biogas and charcoal.\nUncontrolled growth of elephant grass can clog waterways and induce floods."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "African Bush Elephant Facts, Worksheets & Taxonomy For Kids", "url": "https://kidskonnect.com/animals/african-bush-elephant/", "text": "Not ready to purchase a subscription? Click to download the free sample version Download sample\nThe African Bush elephant, Loxodonta africana, is the largest living terrestrial animal in the world, reaching up to 24 feet in length and 13 feet in height. Also known as the African Savannah elephant, these peaceful giants are truly impressive with their massive size.\nSee the fact file below for more information on the African Bush elephant or alternatively, you can download our 20-page African Bush Elephant worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\nKey Facts & Information\nTAXONOMY\nIn 1797, German physician and anthropologist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach suggested Elephas africanus as the elephant\u2019s scientific name.\nLoxodonte, which points out its lozenge-shaped molar teeth enamel, was the generic name for African elephants, introduced by French naturalist and zoologist Georges Cuvier in 1824.\nThe ancestors of the African Bush elephant became extinct during the Pleistocene Epoch. Currently, there are only three species of elephant left: Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), African Forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), and African Bush elephant (Loxodonta africana).\nPHYSICAL FEATURES\nGaining the title for being the largest and heaviest known terrestrial mammal, Savannah elephants reach 3.96 meters (13 feet) tall and weigh 10.4 tons. The males are generally taller and heavier than the females.\nTheir ears resemble the shape of the African continent, and are bigger and reach up over the neck, unlike those of the Asian elephants. These huge flaps are not just for hearing, but are also used to keep them cool in the African heat.\nSavannah elephants have single dome heads, which are fuller and more rounded. They are also distinguishable for their curved tusks, and the number of nails they have on each foot: four on their front feet and three on their hind feet.\nTheir trunks are an elongation of their upper lip and nose, resulting in a two-finger-like tip. Their tusks grow from deciduous teeth called tushes, that form in the upper jaw of the elephant. They also have six molars in each jaw quadrant, protruding at different ages and varying in size.\nBEHAVIOR\nAfrican Bush elephants are incredibly sociable mammals. They usually gather in family herds comprising of 10 females with their calves. They do not want to stay in one area, and are continuously looking for food.\nTheir trunks are flexible enough to help them gather and handle food, and collect water. Along with their tusks, they also use their trunks to protect themselves from their natural predators, and to fight with other male Savannah elephants when trying to find potential mates.\nAfrican Bush elephants are also highly intelligent. They are considered as emotional mammals, showing traits such as giving and receiving love, attending to the needs of their young, and grieving for the loss of their relatives.\nTheir tough skin is highly sensitive to ultraviolet rays, so they use mud as sunscreen. These elephants love mud baths, which protect them from burning and insect bites, and give them enough moisture.\nThese elephants are arrhythmic species \u2013 they have clear vision in dim light. They also have the ability to detect vibrations in the ground because of their sensitive feet.\nHABITAT AND DIET\nAfrican Bush elephants are mostly found in plains and grasslands of central and southern Africa. They are nomadic animals that live in grassy savannas and shrublands of Africa.\nThey are herbivorous mammals that feed on plants and plant matter. Their diet consists of leaves and fallen branches of trees, fruits and grasses, and even roots underground.\nThese peaceful giants have no natural predators due to their huge size.\nLions and hyenas may sometimes pick off young African Bush elephants that are away from their mother, and even old and sick adults that are too vulnerable to attack.\nAdult African Bush elephants can drink about 50 gallons of water a day, holding 1.5 gallons of water in their trunk at a time.\nREPRODUCTION\nAfrican Bush elephants are expected to live between 60 and 70 years.\nFemales are able to reproduce after 10 or 11 years. They are believed to be most fertile between the age of 25 and 45. Males, however, reach sexual maturity at 20 years old.\nFemale Savannah elephants give birth to a single calf after a gestation period of two years. Calves stay with their herd for two years for protection and guidance until they are six years old, old enough to support themselves.\nCONSERVATION\nHabitat loss and humans poaching their ivory tusks are the biggest threats to their survival.\nThe IUCN lists African Bush elephants as vulnerable. There are only 15,000 species left; however, their numbers are increasing.\nAfrican Bush elephants play a vital part in maintaining the savannah and open woodland ecosystems, and in helping plants and animals survive.\nAfrican Bush Elephant Worksheets\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about the African Bush Elephant across 20 in-depth pages.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Rabbit Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Rabbit-facts.html", "text": "rabbit Facts\nPortrait of a Rabbit\nThe rabbit is one of the most recognizable and well-loved creatures in the animal kingdom. Domesticated for thousands of years, rabbits are bred for their meat, their fur, and of course, for companionship.\nThere are an estimated 14 million pet rabbits in the world, many of whom live in the classic outdoor wood and chicken-wire hutch, some living in indoor cages, and some clever bunnies learning to use a litter pan and getting the run of the house.\nRabbits are beautiful little animals with many endearing features. They have slender, thin-skinned, towering ears that, in hares, can be 3 times the length of the skull.\nThe ears are amazingly expressive. They can move independently, swivel in almost any direction and can be held erect or folded flat back against the shoulders.\nWhen at ease, rabbits move about in soft little two-beat hops, grazing on vegetation and grooming themselves, cleaning limbs, backs, ears and toes with their short pink tongues.\nThey commonly raise up on their hind legs to inspect their environment, reach tall flowers and leaves, and clean their front paws and faces with the same motions that a house cat uses, except with two paws at the same time.\nRabbits have ever quivering noses, long expressive whiskers, and a powder puff for a tail. Although both rodents and rabbits are small, furry and buck-toothed, rabbits are not in the rodent family.\nRabbits and hares are approximately 50 different species of small herbivorous mammals in the family Leporidae. They are from an order known as lagamorphs, which also includes little mountain-dwelling animals called pikas.\nThere are several major skeletal and systemic differences between lagamorphs and rodents. Lagamorphs have an extra pair of small flat teeth known as \"peg teeth\" in their top jaw, directly behind their incisors.\nan assortment of domestic rabbits\nLagamorphs are basically exclusively vegetarian, while most rodents are opportunity feeders, happily dining on meat whenever it is available.\nMale lagamorphs lack the penile bone that rodents have, and the overall design of the male genitals is different.\nRabbits are found around the world in a variety of environments, but most are woodland creatures who are classically known for living in a burrow - usually a self-dug hole several feet deep with multiple rooms and tunnels known as a \"warren\".\nFinally, rabbits in the wild eat grasses as a dietary mainstay. They will eat many types of vegetation when available, but rarely consume root vegetables like the famous carrots of Bugs Bunny lore. In fact, carrots fed too liberally can actually cause tooth decay in pet rabbits.\nSpeaking of Bugs Bunny, the term \"bunny\" formally refers to a juvenile rabbit, but is often used informally to describe any rabbit, and sometimes in conjunction with the term rabbit as in \"bunny-rabbit\". which is similar to calling a cat a kitty-cat, or your 90 pound Lab a \"puppy-dog\" - it's all good. - Rabbit Facts\nthe domestic rabbits\nAll domestic rabbits are descendants of the European wild rabbit. First farmed in outdoor pens, and possibly barns, by the Romans around 200 years B.C., the European rabbit became a popular and easy source of superior meat and fur.\nCatholic monks living in the Champagne region of France conscientiously and selectively bred, housed, and thus domesticated the European rabbit between 500 and 600 A.D.\nIt is said that some forms of rabbit meat were declared to be fish and were acceptable to eat during Lent, which served as continued motivation for the Monks.\nA few hundred years later, rabbits were being line bred throughout most of Europe. Different regions began to develop specific breeds, and the size, color, and disposition of the animals evolved and expanded over time.\nThe Dutch rabbit, one of the most popular and recognizable breeds of pet rabbit in modern society, can be seen depicted in artwork beginning in the 1400's..\nToday, the American Rabbit Breeders Association, or ARBA, has over 30,000 members and recognizes 45 different breeds of rabbit. Worldwide there are approximately 80 recognized breeds of domestic rabbit, each with its own contribution and traits, from massive New Zealand Giants, regularly considered the finest animals for meat, to the plush coated Rex breeds that are favorites for fur production, to dainty Netherland dwarfs, bred purely for companionship.\nRabbit meat is one of the leanest meats available, with far less fat than beef, pork or chicken. The entire rabbit is considered to be white meat. The rabbit is so lean, in fact, that it is a bit less tasty than other types of meat, and although the reproduction rate of a single doe may lead to her producing up to 200 pounds of rabbit meat in a single year, the meat itself is an acquired taste.\nToday's domestic rabbit is an entirely different animal from the creature that was first captured and corralled in Ancient Rome. So different, in fact, that it is no longer physicallly capable of reproducing with the European wild rabbit it was derived from. - Rabbit Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

There are two families in this order of animals. Rabbits and hares are in the family leporidae, pikas which are smaller and rounder bodied than rabbits with shorter limbs and ears and no tail, are in the family ochotonidae.\nThe rabbit is in a separate genus from the hare, but the differences between the two animals are not obvious or plain to see. In general, hares are larger than rabbits with longer limbs and ears, but many species of hares are remarkably similar in appearance to rabbits.\nAdding to confusion is the fact that probably the most \"hare-like\" example of a hare - the black-tailed jackrabbit- is actually inaccurately called a \"rabbit\".\nThere are, however, substantial differences between rabbits and hares, and their separation by genus is not controversial.\nFirst, hares and rabbits start life very differently. Newborn rabbits are hairless, blind, toothless and completely helpless. They cannot walk, see, or eat solid foods until they are several weeks old.\nNewborn hares on the other hand, not only have their eyes open, they are fully furred and can actually begin foraging and eating solid foods within hours of birth and can survive completely on their own within a few hours of being born.\nOnce out and about, hares and rabbits live surprisingly different lifestyles too.\nRabbits are social creatures living in family units of up to 20 individuals. They dig large, communal homes underground called warrens, where they spend most of their daylight hours, and they eat soft vegetation like grasses and flowers.\nHares are generally solitary animals only coming together for mating. They do not dig warrens, but live above ground their whole lives. Hares have tougher digestive systems, and many live in very harsh environments where they must eat difficult to forage foods that are hard to chew and digest like bark and twigs.\nFinally, many species of hares molt their fur to change colors with the seasons. Rabbits remain the same color all year round, regardless of any changes in weather or environment.\nrabbit reproduction - how can rabbits have so many babies?\nbaby baboons\nRabbits have long been used as symbols of fertility and sexual vigor in many societies. It is mathematically possible for a single pair of rabbits to multiply to about 1300 individuals in the span of just one calendar year.\nWhy and how does the rabbit reproduce at such an amazing rate? Well the why may be because rabbits are very popular food source for a large variety of predators.\nA wild rabbit has a life expectancy of less than 3 years, simply because it is hunted by every predator in its habitat.\nAnd even animals smaller in size and weight than mature rabbits and hares, such as house cats and sparrow hawks will regularly take them, because they offer little defense other than fleeing.\nSo for a bunny, reproducing before you get eaten is the number one plan, and nature has designed the rabbit with several physical characteristic to help with that goal.\nFirst, female rabbits do not have a \"season\" as most mammals do. The female is receptive to the males advances as long as she has unfertilized eggs available, which is about 26 days out of every month. The females hormones are triggered by the act of intercourse, and she ovulates about 10 hours after copulating, so the eggs are released only when sperm are present, and impregnation is virtually guaranteed with a single mating.\nSecond, while hare newborns are almost completely self sufficient the day they are born, rabbits catch up quickly, remaining helpless for the first few days but becoming completely independent and fully weaned at only 4 to 5 weeks. (some variation, of course, between species)\nNext, young rabbits and hares are ready, and often do, mate at as young as 4 months old. Once pregnant, the gestation is a relatively short 29-33 days. Litter size is not extreme compared to many other species - including many breeds of dogs - with a typical litter size of 5 or 6 kits, but some other factors like the speed of development, make up for, and may be the reason for this.\nWithin 2 to 4 days of giving birth, a female rabbit may be receptive to an interested male, and become impregnated again. So it is actually conceivable for one female rabbit to become pregnant every 35 days and deliver up to 10 kits in each litter in the course of 1 year.\nThrow in the idea that the youngsters from her first litter may begin mating at 1 month old, and so on and so on, and you end up with many, many rabbits.\nSome animals, particularly some rodents, have shorter pregnancies, larger litter sizes, and even quicker weaning times, but the combination of all these factors in the rabbit, along with a very strong reproductive drive, gives you the most prolific mammal in the animal kingdom. - Rabbit Facts\npet rabbits\nNetherland dwarf, Dutch, Mini-lop\nAngora rabbits\nRabbits make lovely pets, and have been diligently bred for attractiveness and personality since the 1400's.\nSome modern breeds are so petite that they may be kept happily in a simple hutch indoors, not unlike one might keep a hamster or gerbil. The Netherland dwarf, Dutch, Mini-lop and Angora bunnies are the most popular modern breeds, but there are literally dozens of fine choices for an indoor or outdoor companion.\nSome rabbits pets aren't confined at all, but are given the run of the house once some rabbit-proofing is done to discourage the chewing of furniture and electrical cords. Since the rabbit is a den animal in the wild, its natural tendency is to eliminate in the same place all the time, which facilitates litter-pan training. Of course healthy rabbit feces are relatively dry and pellet-like,so an accident is rarely an issue.\nThe main drawback to rabbits being kept indoors is the odor of wet litter. Rabbits drink lots of water and produce dark, potentially strong-smelling urine, so pans and cages must be cleaned regularly. Male rabbits will occasionally spray urine, similar to male cats, which can be a huge problem.\nSpaying or neutering your pet rabbit is an excellent idea and can eliminate potential issues. Spayed and neutered rabbits are less likely to develop bad toilet habits, have milder smelling urine and feces, will be more gentle and less anxious, and can't reproduce, so you will not be overrun with bunnies if you happen to have a pair.\nIt has been calculated that, do to the rabbits amazing reproductive gifts, if a single pair of healthy rabbits and all of their offspring are left to breed freely, they can expand to 1300 individual rabbits within just one years time! That's allot of rabbits!.\nCheck out just a few of the most popular rabbit breeds kept as companions right here...\na few more rabbit facts\nEastern cottontail rabbit\nA group of rabbits is called a \"herd\"\nRabbits live in underground burrows called \"warrens\" that can include several rooms and several hundred feet of tunnels\nThe male rabbit is a buck, the female is a doe and the baby is a kit, a kitten or a bunny\nRabbits are born helpless with no fur and their eyes closed, hares are born fully furred, eyes open and can eat solid food almost immediately.\nRabbits are lagamorphs, not rodents\nDomestic rabbits have changed in captivity so substantially that they can no longer successfully breed with wild rabbits\nRabbits can see completely behind them\nA rabbits teeth continue to grow its entire life\nRabbit meat is leaner than beef, chicken or pork and is all white meat.- Rabbit Facts!\nRabbit the rabbit is a\nherbivorous (plant-eating)\ncrepuscular (most active at dawn and dusk)\nterrestrial (lives on ground) plantigrade(walks on entire foot)\nlagamorph (rabbit, hare, pika)\nmammal (animal with mammary glands and hair follicles)\nScientific Classification\nClass - Mammalia\nOrder - Lagomorpha\nFamily - Leporidae\nGenus - 11\nSpecies - 54\nRabbit Facts - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT buck doe kit, kitten group GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD herd worldwide forest to desert grass, flowers ENEMIES ENDANGERED TOP SPEED GENDER DIFFERENCE fox, hawk no 24 mph none VERTICAL LEAP AVG.

Known for their large nose, which is called a \u201cproboscis,\u201d elephant seals are an incredibly unique species of animal. Read on to learn about the elephant seal.\nDescription of the Elephant Seal\nElephant seals are named for their large proboscis, which only the male seals possess. Female elephant seals are smaller than males, and have a normal-sized nose. Elephant seals come in varying shades of tan, but look darker-colored when their fur is wet. When on land, elephant seals move about using an undulating or worm-like motion.\nInteresting Facts About the Elephant Seal\nElephant seals differ from many other pinniped species, both in appearance and behavior. The elephant seal has a number of interesting and distinguishing characteristics.\nDeep Sea Divers \u2013 Elephant seals can hold their breath for up to 2 hours. This enables the Southern elephant seal to regularly dive up to 4,921 feet deep to forage for food. One study even recorded a female elephant seal diving to 5,700 feet on multiple occasions.\n\u2013 Elephant seals can hold their breath for up to 2 hours.

Junk in the Trunk \u2013 Male elephant seals are significantly larger than female elephant seals, and use their massive bulk to battle other males. An adult male elephant seal can be seven or eight times heavier than, and twice as long as, his female counterpart.\n\u2013 Male elephant seals are significantly larger than female elephant seals, and use their massive bulk to battle other males. An adult male elephant seal can be seven or eight times heavier than, and twice as long as, his female counterpart. Stupendous Schnoz \u2013 The elephant seal is named for it\u2019s massive snout, but this unusual appendage is not simply there for show! Ok, it is partly there for show, the bigger the nose the better the male\u2026 but the large proboscis also serves two other functions for the male elephant seal. The large nose amplifies the sound of the elephant seal\u2019s roar, allowing him to scare away rival males. The nose also reabsorbs moisture when the seal breathes, helping prevent dehydration.\nHabitat of the Elephant Seal\nNorthern Elephant Seal\nThe Northern elephant seal species lives offshore in the open ocean most of the year. During breeding season, Northern elephant seals inhabit sandy beaches, both on offshore islands and on some parts of the mainland United States.\nSouthern Elephant Seal\nThe Southern elephant seal species prefers chilly sub-Antarctic and Antarctic waters. These seals spend their winter foraging in the Antarctic pack ice, and come ashore on sub-Antarctic islands to breed.\nDistribution of the Elephant Seal\nNorthern Elephant Seal\nThe Northern elephant seal species is found from the Gulf of Alaska to Baja California.\nSouthern Elephant Seal\nThe Southern elephant seal species ranges from Antarctic waters to the Tropic of Capricorn. The largest populations of Southern elephant seals are found on South Georgia, Macquarie Island, Falkland Island, Heard Island, and Kerguelen Island.\nDiet of the Elephant Seal\nElephant seals feed on squid, fish, sharks, rays, shellfish, krill, and algae. It is believed that squid makes up a large part of their diet.\nPhocids vs. Otariids\nElephant seals are considered \u201ctrue seals,\u201d and are in the family Phocidae. Phocids (A.K.A true seals) can be distinguished from Otariidae (A.K.A eared seals) by looking for a few specific characteristics.\nTrue Seals \u2013 Phocidae Eared Seals \u2013 Otariidae No external ear flaps, just a hole where the ear is Small external ears Rear flippers point directly behind them, and they move by undulating their way across land Rear flippers can be rotated underneath them, allowing them to \u201cwalk\u201c on land Propel forward in the water using their hind flippers, steer with short front flippers Propel forward in the water using their long front flippers, steer with hind flippers Nails/claws on front flippers No nails/claws on front flippers\nElephant Seal and Human Interaction\nNorthern elephant seals were very heavily hunted for their oil-rich blubber, and came quite close to extinction. Elephant seals are now protected from harm under the Marine Mammal Protection Act , and their numbers have bounced back to a healthy population level.\nAs of 2018, there is only one known elephant seal held in human care. A male Northern elephant seal, now named \u201cCoolio,\u201d was rescued by the North Coast Marine Mammal Center in 2014. When he was found, Coolio was very malnourished, and had sustained injuries to his eyes.\nWhile he nearly made a full recovery, Coolio\u2019s eyes were permanently damaged, and he was deemed non-releasable. Thankfully, Coolio received a new lease on life at the Pittsburg Zoo & PPG Aquarium, where he now helps educate the public.\nDomestication\nThere has been no effort to domesticate elephant seals, and individuals in zoos and aquariums are rare.\nDoes the Elephant Seal Make a Good Pet\nThe elephant seal is an immense animal, with the smallest adult female weighing in at an average of 1,500 pounds! This size makes the elephant seal a very impractical pet.\nElephant Seal Care\nLittle is known about caring for elephant seals in zoos. With time, Coolio \u2013 at the Pittsburg zoo \u2013 should help us increase our understanding of elephant seal care.\nBehavior of the Elephant Seal\nElephant seals spend most of their lives at sea, roaming the open ocean and the depths of the seas in search of food. Elephant seals are solitary for most of their lives, congregating only during the breeding seasons. Male and female animals take different migration paths throughout the year. The seals return to their breeding grounds, known as \u201crookeries,\u201d in winter.\nReproduction of the Elephant Seal\nElephant seals congregate in large numbers on beaches to breed. A single adult male will protect a harem of 40 or 50 females, and he will breed with them all. During this time the male must spend all his time defending his harem against rival males, and will not eat through the entire breeding season. Female elephant seals give birth to a single pup after an 11-month gestation. This pup will nurse for just one month before being weaned."}

In general, foxes are small members of the dog family, the largest of which is the typical red fox.\nMost other species are considerably smaller.\nThe red fox is the most wide-spread carnivore in the world, living in every region of the Northern Hemisphere including Central America, and having been introduced by humans to Australia, where they are so successful they are considered a major pest.\nThe red fox in particular is extremely skilled at adapting to almost any environment. They have succeeded and thrived in close proximity to human beings and there are even some sub-species of red fox that live in heavy urban environments, taking advantage of their naturally nocturnal tendencies.\nMany other fox species are endangered or threatened, unable to adapt to human encroachment, while the red fox enjoys healthy populations all over the world.\nFoxes live in small groups, or alone. They don't have the kind of intense social structure we connect with other canines like the wolf and the dog.\nThey are solitary hunters even if living in a family group, and they are notorious for killing extra prey and burying it for later. This activity is probably how the \"sly\" signature got attached to the fox, although, foxes, in general, are very bright, inquisitive and intelligent animals.\nThere are unusual names applied to male and female foxes as well, the male being known as a \"reynard\" and the female, naturally, a \"vixen\"\nThere is no doubt of the beauty of these animals, (they've paid the price being regularly trapped for their fur). and there is no doubt why the term \"fox\" is often used to describe attractive people too! - Fox Facts\nwhat does the fox say?\nThe fox says allot, actually. Although they are members of the canine family, fox species don't bark like domestic dogs do.\nThey have a warning bark of their own that is very short, high-pitched, and usually singular, definitely not a \"bow-wow-wow\" type sound.\nThey do, however, make an amazing variety of noises- up to 20 different calls it is believed.\nFox vocalizations include chilling nighttime \"screams\", coyote-like howls, whimpers, \"snuffing\" noises, and a happy call that sounds like a human baby crying. But the most distinct sound most foxes make is a chuckling type noise called a \"gekker\".\nFoxes will gekker when they are fighting or playing. They will also gekker out of excitement and nervousness, and as most foxes are rather nervous creatures, the sound is emitted quite often.\nA litter of kits play-fighting will roll around gekkering for hours at a time. And a vixen defending her den will gekker an intruder right out of her territory. -Fox Facts\nfox reproduction\nfox vixen and kits\nThe fox family dynamic is very varied, with some animals forming fairly strong pair bonds, while others are more independent, and live in very loose family structures.\nThe red fox usually lives in a small family unit with a dominant pair, and two to five other individuals, usually maturing offspring. Similar to wolves, it is generally only the dominant female who will have kits, and the other family members will often assist in the raising of the kits.\nOccasionally, a father fox has been known to rear young on his own, after the demise of the mother. Red foxes and many other fox species dig simple, but roomy dens when the babies are about to be born, and the family will stay close by for up to three months while the young kits grow. The whole family takes care of the kits.\nThe rest of the year, foxes usually live basically out in the open, bedding down by turning in a tight circle to tamp down a little bed for themselves, just as we see domestic dogs do on the living room rug.\nAs the kits mature, they may leave to form their own family units, usually at about 10 to 18 months, or, sometimes will stay with their parents for life. When youngsters stay on, they often remain subordinate to the parents and help with the raising of the next generations of kits without producing offspring themselves.\nMother, father and siblings will regurgitate food for young kits and bring food back to the den. It has long been a belief that foxes live alone, and some do, but perhaps it is because they spread out and hunt alone, and if they are seen at all, it is when they are stalking prey or seeking their next meal. - Fox Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Within just a few generations the foxes not only became quite content with human contact, but sought it out and took comfort and even joy from being petted and played with.\nThe psychological changes were interesting for sure, but the physical changes were astounding.\nThe foxes changed color and began to develop patches in their coats, sometimes their tails turned curly and their ears flopped down. It seemed the traits that pushed towards a tamer animal perhaps had strong chemical influences as well.\nMost suggest the domesticated version has less adrenalin, and perhaps less testosterone. DNA research done on the foxes showed that major changes had taken place,and that this was basically a new animal, with strong hints of our domestic dog.\nToday, the study is no longer funded, and only continues with the sale of the foxes as pets. These domestic foxes, once a form of red fox but now known as \"silver foxes\" actually make sweet and lovely pets for many in Russia.\nmany beautiful little beasts\nfox species\nThere are twelve species of foxes in the genus \"vulpus\" which are known as the \"true foxes\". Among these, the red fox is the largest and most common, and is also the most wide spread carnivore in the world.\nThe grey fox, very similar to the red, is also quite large and fairly numerous.\nThe other species are smaller, ranging from the cat sized cape fox to the chihuahua sized fennec fox. There are also numerous species outside of the \"vulpus\" genus that are still referred to as foxes.\nMany of these are quite rare, and several are severely endangered.\nThe fox is somewhat fragile in the wild. Even the amazingly capable red fox which can live to 10 years old has a surprisingly short life expectancy of perhaps only 4 years in the wild.\nHunted, trapped, poisoned, hit by cars, pursued by larger predators, domestic dogs and the occasional birds of prey, too many of these little gems are struggling to hang on. - Fox Facts\nthe arctic fox\narctic fox pair\nThe stunning arctic fox may weigh only about seven pounds, and most of it is fur.\nLiving in some of the harshest conditions on earth, the little arctic fox blends in perfectly for 9 months of the year in glorious snowy white, and then quickly sheds and replaces its coat with brown fur for the few short spring and summer months .\nAmazingly suited to the snow and ice, it has snowshoe like fur on its paws to navigate wintry terrain, and uses its large tail as a muff while it sleeps.\nThe arctic fox can hear small rodents moving beneath the snow and pinpoint their location.

That said, the female elephants are responsible for looking after all the young ones, and the male elephants simply roam throughout the jungle alone.\nBig Brains\nImage Source\nIt is no secret that elephants are free and wild animals. In addition to that, they are also the brainiest animals in the kingdom. Their size is enormous, and they have the ability to crush any kind of threat that comes their way. That said, witnessing this kind of hostility in elephants is rare because they are generally kind and gentle animals.\nAiry Ears\nImage Source\nElephants have interesting airy ears that help them keep cool by radiating heat. Interestingly, the elephants found in Africa have ears similar to the map of the African continent while the ones found in Asia have smaller ear lobes.\nJumbo Family\nImage Source\nThe female elephants have a pregnancy period of 22 months. Normally, the female elephants look after the babies, and the male elephants roam around. The average life span of an elephants ranges between 60-70 years.\nLargest Land Animals\nImage Source\nElephants are the largest land animals who can weight anywhere between 4000-7500 kg. They can have a height of 3 meters. However, Asian elephants are comparatively smaller. They weight between 3000-6000 kgs and have a height of 2.7 meters.\nEndangered or Not\nImage Source\nThe population of Indian elephants is around 20,000 to 25,000 in the forests. One of the biggest dangers to elephants come from the poachers who kill these elephants to get their tusks. Other causes that endanger their lives are conflicted between humans and animals as well as deforestation.\nAsian Elephant Family\nImage Source\nThe Elephas maximus or the Indian elephant come under the subcategory of Asian elephants. There are other two species in this family too. They are known as Elephas Maximum in Sri Lanka and Elephas Maximus in Sumatranus in Sri Lanka. The Indian elephants have a long front and are large. However, their body is slightly thinner than the ones found in Thailand.\nIvory Tusk Poaching\nImage Source\nIt is a sad reality that the lives of these massive animals are in danger due to ivory tusk poaching. Many humans are known to have killed elephants just for fun or sporting activity. Sometimes, people kill them if they come closer to their communities. While Asian elephants are totally under threat, African elephants are also vulnerable.\nFinal Words\nAs mentioned above, elephants are majestic creatures that need no introduction. They are also quite fascinating, and we are sure you learned something new today."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Lemur Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Lemur-facts.html", "text": "lemur Facts\nPortrait of a Lemur\nOne of the coolest lemur facts is that they can easily jump 6 times their body length. Lemurs are woolly-furred, long-tailed, arboreal animals that are found only on the island of Madagascar off the Eastern coast of Africa.\nThere are more than 30 different species and dozens of subspecies of lemurs, ranging in size from the 1 ounce mouse lemur, to the 20 pound Indri.\nThese creatures evolved undisturbed in an isolated environment for millions of years, and thrived in their island paradise until human beings came to Madagascar about 2000 years ago. Since then, people have destroyed over 90 percent of the natural forests, leaving the lemurs, as a group, the most endangered mammals in the world.\nMost lemurs are plant eaters that indulge in the tropical leaves, fruits, shoots and flowers of the island, while occasionally dining on insects, and possibly small reptiles and birds.\nThey are social, active animals with remarkable athletic abilities, who can leap 30 feet or more from limb to limb using their powerful, long legs and strong gripping hands and feet. The long, thickly furred tail is not prehensile, but acts like a rudder as they fly through the air, and a signalling device while on the ground.\nSome species, such as the large, exquisitely black-furred Indri, are almost exclusively tree-dwelling, while the most recognizable species, the beautiful ring-tailed lemur, spends as much as 70 percent of the time on the ground, even sleeping in big, furry, communal, heaps, right out in the open on grass or rocks.\nRing-tail lemurs are small animals, overall, at about 5 or 6 pounds fully grown, but they live in alert communities of 10 to 25 individuals, and use warning calls if danger approaches.\nA group of lemurs is called a conspiracy, and they will, in fact, conspire together against predators, occasionally using a technique called \"mobbing\", where the entire group will attack. This is seen most often against snakes, where families of lemurs will converge on a large ground boa and simply beat it to death.\nOnly Madagascar's largest predator, the awesome fossa, which looks like a small, brown, 25 pound mountain lion, but is actually related to the mongoose, regularly preys on ring-tailed lemurs, although buzzards, large boas, and domestic dogs are also an occasional threat.\nHunting has only recently become an issue, as some of the old customs and traditions of Madagascar change with the times. Lemurs were once considered a sacred animal that was honored and respected. The people believed that harming a lemur in any way would bring bad luck, disease, or even death. But the taboo has eroded, and in the last decade, people have been hunting lemurs for their meat and fur, and lemur dishes are served in local taverns, despite being illegal.\nBut the biggest danger for lemurs is deforestation. With a new president elected in 2014, the government of Madagascar announced a new initiative to save their most iconic citizens. Madagascar's unique wildlife, if preserved wisely, can help the nations ecotourism trade blossom, and with over 200,000 tourists per year and growing, the thousands of species of plants, reptiles, and of course, lemurs, exclusive to this one island, must somehow survive.\nare lemurs monkeys?\nwhite-ruffed lemur\nPrimates are broken into 2 groups, wet-nosed primates like lemurs, lorises, and galagos, and dry-nosed primates like monkeys and apes. (including us).\nThe wet-nosed primates are called prosimians, because they evolved separately from, and millions of years before the monkeys. In fact, the word prosimian literally means \"before monkeys\".\nThe differences between monkeys and prosimians goes beyond the wet, dog-like noses that lemurs and lorises have.\nProsimians don't have the flexible, expressive faces of monkeys, and their eyes and orbital sockets are angled differently from monkeys, with a little more emphasis on peripheral vision, and less on stereoscopic focus.\nMore of the prosimian brain is dedicated to the sense of smell, than to the sense of sight, not surprising, since the dog-like, wet nose is extremely adept.\nAnd prosimians have two very unique features, the tooth comb and the toilet claw, that monkeys lack.\nThe toothcomb is a specialization of the front teeth in the lower jaw. These teeth are long, slender, and perfectly parellel with narrow, even spaces between them. They project horizontally from the mandible, and are used in grooming the fur, just like a barber's comb.\nThe most unusual part of this adaption is the sublingua, or \"under tongue\". It is a small, serrated, secondary structure beneath the tongue, but it doesn't have taste buds or salivary glands, it is specifically designed to clean the toothcomb.\nIn the case of lemurs, the \"toilet claw\" refers to the second toe of the foot, which has a claw, rather than the usual nail, and is used primarily for scratching an itch. The digit that has this adaption, varies among the prosimians, but monkeys do not have this anatomical feature. - Lemur Facts\nlemur lifestyle\nSome lemurs are almost completely arboreal, and able to live the majority of their lives off the ground, high in the trees. Nocturnal lemurs like the aye-aye are mostly solitary animals, while diurnal species like the Indri and Sifaka are very social, living in groups and communicating with numerous calls.\nThese animals are incredibly athletic, and employ a vertical position while climbing. They leap from tree to tree by thrusting against the tree trunk with their long, powerful, frog-like legs that unfold like springs to launch them as far as 30 feet in a single bound. But they come down to the ground in the morning hours to sun themselves, sitting like little Buddhas, hands on their knees, palms up, with their bellies and chests exposed to the warmth.\nOne of the most familiar lemurs is the ring-tailed lemur. The ring-tailed is in it's own genus, differing from other lemur species in a number of ways. They spend more time on the ground than any other species - up to 80% of the time, depending upon their habitat. They are quadrupedal, walking and running on all-fours just like dogs, but will occasionally take a few steps on their hind legs.\nAlthough they eat mostly leaves and fruits found in trees and shrubs, they are the only lemurs that occasionally feed on the ground, and will actually lower their heads like cows to graze on leafy plants and mosses. They live in the largest groups, with 30 or more individuals in a troop, although 12 to 20 is most common.\nRing-tailed lemurs are extremely expressive and vocal animals, with approximately 28 separate calls. They bleat like baby lambs, purr like cats, click and croak like frogs, they make high wails and loud whoops, and regularly engage in group vocalizations, like a pack of wolves howling together.\nThey are also the only lemurs with rings on their tails, an adaption that reflects their more terrestrial lifestyle. The highly visible black rings, usually 13 or 14 on a tail, and always with a black tip, help them keep together, track one another and judge each others moods.\nThe tail plays a big part in their lives. About 15% longer than the lemurs entire body, it is held straight up vertically as they walk, the tip sometimes curled over. Tails wave gracefully like feathers when all is calm, but straighten out tense, hairs on end, like a frightened cat tail during moments of conflict.\nThe tail is not prehensile, but it is expressive, even used as an exhibit of aggression known as a \"stink fight\". The stink fight is a ritualistic battle where males will rub their tails against scent glands on their chests and wrists, and then wave them at each other, projecting their special smell. They will even do handstands thrusting their tails over their heads for impact. It's not really clear how the winner is decided.\nRing-tailed lemurs have a matriarchal society, with a fairly clear order of dominance that is established and maintained by mildly aggressive behaviors like staring, lunging, and pushing. Females are dominant over males, and one mature female is usually in charge, deciding when the group travels, eats or rests.\nEven the lowest ranked female is dominant over all the males in the group. If there is unrest between two neighboring groups of ring-tails, the females will engage each other, not the males, but conflicts are rarely serious.\nDuring their lives, females stay with the group they were born into, while males will leave and integrate into neighboring groups when they are 3 to 5 years old.\nMale ring-tailed lemurs have scent glands on their chest, rumps and wrists. The wrist glands have a spur-like fingernail that is known as the horny spur. They will use this spur to rake at the trunks of sapling trees with their wrists leaving a gash in the tree that is filled with their scent. This is both a visual and olfactory marking of territory.\nLemurs have opposable thumbs and big toes, but they don't display any tool use in the wild, and don't usually handle or play with inanimate objects as monkeys do. During research experiments using touch screens, they do not use their fingers as monkeys do, instead touching the screen with their noses.\nStill, lemurs at the Duke University primate center have displayed the ability to learn tool use, solve intricate problems and to discriminate quantities - in effect, to count. - Lemur Facts\nRed-ruffed Lemur\nlemur reproduction\nlemur babies\nring-tailed lemur mother and babies\nFemale ring-tailed lemurs come into season once a year, for only about 24 hours, during which she may mate with multiple partners. The ring-tailed lemurs mating season is from late April to early June, which means births coincide with the beginning of the rainy season, sometime between August and September. This insures that nursing mothers will have plenty of food sources to carry them through the stress of rearing youngsters.\nFemale lemurs have anal scent glands that indicate when they are in season. The male lemur has special scent glands on his chest and wrists that release a chemical blueprint of his health and fitness. He pulls his tail against his chest and rubs these glands against it, and then waves his tail in the females direction, luring her with his odor. Males will wave their tails at each other too, in mock battles called \"stink fights\".\nFemales ring-tails are pregnant for 135 to 145 days, and give birth to one, or sometimes two infants. The newborn lemur has thick fur, open eyes and a clasping instinct that gives it the ability to cling to it's mothers chest just moments after birth.\nBabies will travel underneath their mother, sometimes held by her, but capable of staying on all by themselves, for 2 weeks, and then they start migrating to her back, where they will ride like a tiny jockey, and cling on tight as she flies through the forest.\nOnce the baby lemur has reached about three weeks old, it will start to venture off it's mother's back, just for brief moments, and then hop right back on.\nBoth male and female adults in the troop interact with infants, and may babysit briefly as the mother rests or forages. If a baby is orphaned, the troop will take over it's care, and another nursing mother may adopt it.\nBecause lemur reproduction is strictly seasonal, all the babies are born at the same time of year, between late August and early September, and grow up together.\nBy six weeks or so, they are playing together in excited little nursery groups, cuddling, wrestling and bouncing through the trees. They are weaned at 8 to 10 weeks, and stop riding on their mother's backs after 12 to 14 weeks.\nThe youngsters are independent by eight months, but stay close to their mothers. Females will remain with the same troop for life, while young males will move to other troops at 3 to 5 years old, and may switch groups every few years. This insures genetic diversity within the species. - Lemur Facts\nCrowned Sifaka mother and infant\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

This tiny, wide-eyed creature is the tinyest living primate at only 5 inches from head to tail. Mouse lemurs are nocturnal, and feed mainly on insects. They hunt at night, using their incredible night vision and powerful sense of smell, plucking insects from tree limbs, and rustling through undergrowth for beetles and grubs.\nThe aye-aye is a startling and strange looking animal, with rough-textured, shaggy grey fur, huge eyes and ears, and curious specialized fingers. Like nocturnal woodpeckers, they use their long bony finger to tap on branches, locating grubs under the bark and spearing them out with their specialized claws. Aye-ayes make large nests in the crooks of trees and sleep all day, out of the suns glare.\nThe Indri is the largest lemur species at up to 25 pounds. They are called \"Babakoto\" which means \"little father\", because the locals believe they are our direct ancestor. Indi live in small groups of 6 to 12 individuals, who routinely call across the forest to each other with loud, eerie, whale-like sounds.\nFinally, nine species of lemurs known as sifakas, are iconic creatures in Madagascar. They have beautiful coats of contrasting colors, and are famous for their hopping gate.\nAmazing climbers and incredible leapers, the sifakas have slender, elongated limbs and torso. They bounce effortlessly through the woods, pushing off tree trunks with their long, frog-like back legs, like little Parkour runners.\nBut when they come down to the ground to sun themselves, and to move between tree groves, or cross man-made obstacles like roads and railroad tracks, they hop along on their hind legs in big, sideways bounds, their hands held out wide for balance. It looks like a dance of joy, and certainly is delightful to watch. - Amazing!\nhow does the sifaka cross the road?\na few more lemur facts\nLemurs are only found on the island of Madagascar and tiny neighboring Comoro islands\nLemurs are primates, but they are not monkeys\nLemurs have lower front teeth that are fashioned into a comb for grooming\nRing-tailed lemurs spend the most time on the ground\nThe aye-aye has a special, long, boney finger, for hunting insects\nNatives believed whoever the aye-aye pointed its finger at was doomed\nThe lemur has a wet nose, like a dog, and a great sense of smell\nScientists think lemur ancestors drifted to the island of Madagascar on clumps of floating vegetation"}

These are some of the many intriguing things I learnt as a safari guide in Kruger and on my past travels.\nAs a child growing up in South Africa, I heard and read a lot about animals. There are some lovely African Tales about most of these animals. As I share animals facts below, I will also list the names of African Tales for you to look out for. These tales are great for children so look them up!\nMost people go on wildlife safaris with the aim of spotting the Big 5 of Africa. Thus, I'll start off with some interesting facts about the Big 5 safari animals.\nFacts About the Big 5 Animals of Africa\nFirst, let's get the facts straight about the term \"Big Five\". Contrary to popular belief, the term Big Five does not indicate that these are the 5 biggest animals in Africa. These are, in fact, the 5 most dangerous animals a person can encounter in the bush when on foot. This was originally a hunting term which was later adopted by the tourism industry. Now spotting the Big 5 of Africa has become the main aim of going on an African safari for many.\nInteresting Lion Facts - about the king of the beasts\n1. Possibly the most social of the cat family, lions typically live in large families. They do everything as a group (called a pride), except for the males who regularly patrol their territories to fend against other lions.\nMale lion\n2. A lion's roar can be heard over 8km away. Lions are able to roar so loudly due to a ligament in their voice box. This ligament is stretched to enable more air to pass across the vocal cords, making the incredibly deep and loud sounds. This is also the same for other large cats like leopards, tigers and jaguars.\n3. Lions have a white line right underneath their eyes which assists them with night vision. There is a reflective coating behind the eye which helps to amplify the light emitted by stars and the moon. With this help, a lion\u2019s eyesight is 8 times better than that of humans at night.\nLion eyes\n4. Lions can sleep, or at least rest for up to 20 hours per day. A big part of why they sleep so much is to conserve energy for when it is needed - for hunting and defending territories.\nLion sleeping\nAfrican Tale with Lions: The story of lion and jackal\nInteresting Leopard Facts \u2013 about the elusive predator\n1. The leopard is probably the most adaptable of the big cats when it comes to human interference. This is the main reason why leopards are spotted close to urban areas. Their adaptability also makes them the most widely distributed wild cat on the planet.\n2. Leopards have strong necks, which allow them to drag prey (that weighs more than themselves) into trees. They do this in order to hide it from other predators.\n3. Leopards scavenge regularly but are brilliant hunters.\n4. Leopard cubs are born blind and are therefore completely dependent on their mothers. Their eyes start opening about 10 days after birth. Cubs typically stay with their mothers for up to about 2 years.\nLeopard and cub\n5. A leopard\u2019s tail is almost the same length as its body. Their long tails mainly assist them with balance when climbing, as well as serving as a rudder when they are chasing prey and have to turn sharply.\nLeopard hunting\nAfrican Tale about Leopards: How the leopard got his spots\nInteresting Elephant Facts \u2013 about the gentle giants\n1. Elephants are the largest land-based mammal in the world and are found in Africa and Asia.\n2. Elephants are highly social animals. They live in herds which are led by an older female matriarch. These herds are usually family herds made up of elephants of all different ages.\nAmboseli elephants\n3. Adult male elephants, or bulls, normally move freely between different family herds.\n4. African elephants' ears are shaped like the continent of Africa and play an important role in cooling elephants down. On very hot days, elephants like to spray water or put mud behind their ears where there are lots of small veins. This cools the veins helping the elephants to cool down. In the heat, elephants tend to constantly flap their ears which in turn cools down their bodies. So their ears and the veins work like an air conditioning unit.\nElephant in the savannah, in namibia\n5. Did you know that elephants are either right-handed or left-handed? One can see this when looking at their tusks. They normally have one tusk which is broken or more worn than the other. This indicates that they prefer using that specific tusk making them either left or right-handed.\n6. Elephants have very complex and intricate ways of communicating. These include using vibrations to make sounds. Some of which are audible to humans and some of which are not. These sounds can travel for several kilometres. They also communicate through visual signals and touch.\nElephants in namibia\n7. The average daily food intake of an elephant is between 150 kg to 300 kg per day, and when drinking they can consume between 100 and 200 litres of water. This is why having too many elephants in a game park that isn't large enough can wreak havoc on the vegetation and ecosystem as a whole.\nAfrican Tale about Elephants: Why elephant has a trunk\nInteresting Rhino Facts \u2013 about nature's real-life unicorns\n1. A group of rhinos is actually called a crash.\nRhino (2)\n2. In Africa, we have the white (square-lipped rhinoceros) and the black rhinoceros (hook- lipped rhinoceros) however, their actual colours are very similar. In my life as a guide, I heard numerous reasons for these names. I guess the one that makes the most sense is that the names originated from when the Dutch settlers in Africa called the white rhinos \u201cwijd\u201d. This actually means wide \u2013 referring to the wide jaw of the white rhino \u2013 but it sounded like \u201cwhite\u201d to English speakers, and was therefore translated incorrectly.\n3. Rhinos are very fast for their size. White rhino males can weigh more than 2 tons and can run at a speed of 40km per hour.\n4. Their horns are made from keratin, which is the same material human nails are made of. Rhinos are primarily hunted for their horns despite the fact that their horns do not have any proven medicinal properties.\nRhino horns\n5. Like elephants, rhinoceroses communicate using infrasonic frequencies that are below the human threshold of hearing.\n6. Like humans, the skin of a rhino is very sensitive to the sun. Thus they love taking mud baths to cover their skin. This also helps to trap ticks and other parasites - once the mud dries up, they scratch against a tree which then removes these parasites.\nRhino mud bath\nAfrican Tale about Rhinos: How the rhinoceros got his skin\nInteresting Buffalo Facts \u2013 teamwork at its best\n1. The buffalo is oddly-enough seen as one of the most dangerous of the Big 5. This has a lot to do with the fact that other animals usually show some warning signs before they attack. This is not so with the buffalo. They rarely give any warning signals and can surround you without being noticed.\n2. Buffalo are usually found in large herds, sometimes hundreds of animals in one herd. These huge herds are often closely followed by lions. So much so that you are almost certain to find lion when you see a large herd of buffalos. When these herds get attacked by lions, they form a circle around their young, facing outward towards the threat to form a barricade of horns.\nBuffalo herd\n3. Buffalo are actually very good swimmers, as they often cross large rivers to find good grazing fields. One also often sees lonely buffalo bulls (also known as dagga boys) lying in water and mud. The name dagga boy comes from the word \u201cdagga\u201d which refers to a cement mixture used in building houses. These solitary buffalo bulls usually look like they have cement patches on their bodies from the mud.\n4. Buffalos have a good symbiotic relationship with many bird species, like the oxpecker and also egrets. You are sure to find a variety of birds when looking at a herd of buffalo.\nBuffalo and bird\nAfrican Tale about Buffalos: The tale of oxpecker and buffalo\nFacts About the Little 5 Animals of Africa\nA lesser-known grouping of smaller animals that we have in Africa, is the Little 5. These are in fact 5 smaller animals that share their names with the animals of the Big 5 grouping. Here are the Little 5 animals...\n1. Antlion:\nThe largest of the lacewing family. They look very similar to dragonflies.\nAntlion by Bernard DUPONT\nTheir larvae are found all over Southern Africa in soft sand and they stay in funnel-shaped pits, used to catch their prey. They sit at the bottom of the pit hidden in the sand, and when they detect an insect entering the pit, they throw sand towards them to make the prey fall to the bottom. Here they grab their prey with their large jaws.\n2. Leopard tortoise:\nThe largest tortoise found in Southern Africa.\nLeopard Tortoise by Bernard Dupont\nThey have unique markings on their shells. They are mostly plant eaters, however, they often gnaw on bones and also eat hyena droppings. They do this to get calcium and other minerals which assist in eggshell production and keep their own shells in good condition.\n3. Elephant shrew:\nSo-called because of their rather long and flexible noses which look similar to the elephant\u2019s trunk.\nElephant shrew by Javier Abalos\nThey eat invertebrates and also fruit, seeds and leaves. The females usually carry food to their young in their cheek pouches.\n4. Rhinoceros beetle:\nThese beetles can reach up to 60 millimetres in size and their name originates from the horns on their head.\nRhino beetle by Bernard Dupont\nThe males use these horns to fight each other for territory and for possession of females. They are part of the scarab family. There are over 300 types of rhino beetles worldwide. It is known to be the strongest animal as it can carry up to 850 times its own body weight\n5. Buffalo weaver:\nKnown as 'buffalo' weavers for following buffalo herds to feed on the insects disturbed by the buffalos' movements.\nRed-billed buffalo weaver by Derek Keats\nThese weavers are communal and live in large colonies. They use thorny twigs to make large nests which are divided into different compartments to create egg chambers.\nInteresting Facts about other African Animals\nPangolin or scaly anteater:\nThe only animal in the world that is completely covered in scales.\nPangolin by Adam Tusk\nThese scales are made from keratin (like rhino horns) and these scales contribute to 20% of the animal's overall weight.\nPangolins have a long sticky tongue that grows from deep inside their chest cavity and can extend to over 40cm, which is longer than its own body!\nThey are able to close their nose and ears when feeding in order to keep ants from entering.\nAfrican Tale on Pangolins: How the Pangolin got its scales\nOstrich:\nThese funny looking birds are somewhat prehistoric in appearance.\nOstrich by Bernard Dupont\nEven though they have a wingspan of up to 2 meters, they are completely flightless. They mainly use their wings for a mating display, and to help counterbalance when running away from predators.\nThey can run up to 70 km per hour, which makes them the fastest living animal and bird on two legs.\nThey have three stomachs, and regularly swallow stones and pebbles. The pebbles help ostriches to grind-up food in their first stomach, as they do not have teeth to chew.\nThe brain of an ostrich weighs around 40 grams, compared to one of their eyes that weighs around 60 grams. They, therefore, have fabulous eyesight and can see up to 3 and a half kilometres.\nAn ostrich egg is equivalent to 24 hen eggs and takes about one and a half hours to hard boil.\nThey do not stick their heads in the sand or the ground \u2013 this is an urban myth. When in danger, ostriches normally run away, but they also have powerful legs and can kick potential predators.\nThe male ostrich is called a rooster, and a female is called a hen. A group of ostriches is called a flock.\nMales and females both roost on their eggs. With the black colour of the male feathers, they are well camouflaged for roosting during the night, and then females roost during the day.\nAfrican Tale on Ostriches: How the ostrich got its long neck\nBlack-Backed Jackal:\nPeople who have been into the bushveld know all about the distinctive sounds these animals make around sunset.\nBlack-backed jackal\nThey are monogamous, which means that they mate for life, and only hold one partner.\nThey are omnivorous as their diets regularly include berries and grass. They scavenge a lot, but they are known to catch small prey like rodents and birds. One usually sees them following lions as they hunt, at a distance. They regularly creep up to lions' prey in order to steal a bit of meat.\nAfrican Tale about Jackal: Clever Jackal gets away\nMarabou Stork:\nIn my view, this is possibly the ugliest bird around, a real thing out of nightmares.\nMarabou Stork by John Cooke\nMarabou storks are large, long-legged, long-necked wading birds with a long, bare pink gular sac.\nThey are large birds and can reach an average size of about 152cm, and have a wingspan of around 3.7m. On average they weigh around 9kg.\nThey are not very vocal but indulges in bill-rattling courtship displays. The throat sac is also used to make various noises during mating time.\nThey have tall legs that are often white in colour however, their legs are not white at all \u2013 the whiteness is due to them defecating on their own legs, which is known as urohydrosis. This is mainly to regulate their body temperatures as it cools down the body.\nThe birds are known to build their nests in trees and sometimes even in tall buildings. The female usually lay between three to five eggs. Both the parents are equally involved in taking care of the young, however, only one out of four reaches adulthood.\nTheir diets mainly consist of carrion, fish, insects, frogs, snakes, lizards, mice and other rodents, even other birds.\nI am going to end off with some interesting facts on my personal favourite animal, the African wild dog. Also known as the painted dog or painted wolf.\nAfrican Wild Dog:\nAfrican wild dogs by Derek Keats\nThey have distinctive patterns on their fur, and no two wild dogs have the same patterns.\nThey usually live in large packs, which are dominated by the matriarch. They have an alpha pair (almost like a king and a queen) and these are usually the only ones in the pack who mate. Once the pups are born, the whole pack looks after them and they take priority. Pups that are old enough to eat solid food are given priority at a kill \u2013 even over the dominant pair.\nThey have massively large roaming areas and are known to roam around 50km in a day.\nWhen hunting, they have about an 80% success rate and hunt in groups which are well coordinated. Their main hunting strategy is to outrun an animal tiring it out over a very long distance. Like with cycling races, when the front runners get tired, then the dogs right behind them pick up speed and the front runners fall back a bit. Usually, after a few kilometres of running, the prey gets very tired and weak, which makes it easier to take down.\nIt has been documented that they have similar social and hunting habits to wolves.\nWild dogs\nThey are sadly an endangered species \u2013 they used to range across 39 countries in Africa, with population numbers in the hundreds of thousands. Currently, there are fewer than 6,000 individuals left in the wild, forming fewer than 700 packs.\nI was not able to get African tales for all of the animals mentioned, however, for the little ones, there are a few books published on African tales. I recommend looking out for some of these, as they are lovely stories. Some recommended books:\nStories of Africa by Gcina Mhlope\nAfrican Animal Tales by Jay P.W. Heale\nNumerous short stories and books by Mwenye Hadithi\nWith all these interesting African animal facts, I'm sure your next wildlife safari will be even more fun and interesting!\nFor help planning your next African Safari on a budget contact our travel experts."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "All About Elephants - Senses | SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment", "url": "https://seaworld.org/animals/all-about/elephants/senses/", "text": "Vision\nElephant eyes are about 3.8 cm (1.5 in.) in diameter and their vision is moderate. Elephants traverse forests, savannas, and grasslands, primarily orienting with the trunk, as opposed to sight. Ex: There have been documented occurrences of elephant herds being led by a blind member. The complete lack of vision did not hinder the blind member\u2019s ability to fulfill its leadership role.\nElephants have long eyelashes to help avert blowing sand, dirt, and debris from the eyes.\nIn addition to the upper and lower eyelids, elephants have a \u201cthird eyelid\u201d which moves vertically across the eye. These eyelids function to protect the eye when feeding, bathing, and dusting (cooling down). Refer to behavior section.\nSome elephants develop a white ring that encircles the iris as they mature. This ring is similar to an age-ring that may develop in humans (as they age) called arcus lipoides, and does not affect vision.\nThe eyes of an elephant are located on the sides of the head and therefore provide better peripheral vision (angle of vision extending from the sides to the rear), rather than binocular vision (eyes located on the front of the face, in which fields of vision overlap, creating depth perception).\nHearing\nElephants have good hearing, detecting sounds as low as 14 to 16 hz (human low range: 20 hz) and as high as 12,000 hz (human high range: 20,000).\nElephants frequently use infrasonic sounds, which are sounds emitted below the human hearing range, in long-distance communication. Research has shown that elephants are capable of recognizing calls and voices of particular individuals from 1 to 1.5 km (0.6-0.9 mi.) away. Refer to Communication Section.\nThe ears of the elephant are used to funnel in sound waves from the environment, contributing to its keen sense of hearing.\nIn general, animals with large heads and wide-set ears are better adapted for hearing lower frequency sounds because the larger skull encompasses longer ear canals, wider tympanic membranes (membrane that separates the middle ear from the exterior), and larger middle ears.\nOlfactory\nElephants have a keen sense of smell, detecting water sources up to 19.2 km (12 mi.) away.\nNostrils are located at the tip of the trunk and function in breathing, smelling, and drawing water in to squirt into the mouth. The elephants\u2019 sense of smell is in constant use, with the trunks moving back and forth, detecting new scents and information.\nOnce a scent is drawn in through thee nostrils, there is a series of seven olfactory turbinals, located in the nasal cavity. Turbinals are curls of bone that have millions of olfactory receptor cells associated with them.\nIf smelling does not provide enough information, elephants may collect the substance with the trunk. Then the chemical information is passed on to its Jacobson\u2019s organ, a chemical detection unit located in the soft tissue of the upper palate (roof of the mouth). The organ is attached to the oral/nasal cavities and primarily functions to detect the estrus (reproductive) status of a female. This behavior is known as the flehmen response and is characterized by the elephant curling its trunk into its mouth.\nTouch\nElephants are very tactile in nature. Elephants use all parts of their body to interact with one another in all forms of behavior, including parental-offspring, playful, aggressive, defensive, exploratory, sexual, and anti-predator.\nThe trunk is one of the most tactile appendages elephants have. It is used to stroke, touch, explore, caress, or reassure in care-taking and may also be used to slap or block in defense or dominance situations.\nThe trunk is so sensitive to touch that it is capable of perceiving pressure differences as light 0.25 mm (0.01 in.) in depth, which is equivalent to a light brush against the skin.\nThe strength of an elephant\u2019s trunk is capable of lifting weights in excess of 250 kg (550 lb.).\nElephant trunks have extensive sensory motor cells, called pacinian corpuscles, that enable them to have a strong sense of touch. The pacinian corpuscles are composed of concentric membranes of connective tissue, similar to the layers of an onion. Between each layer of connective tissue is a slimy gel. When a movement or vibration is detected, the pressure deforms the gel and connective tissue layers of the pacinian corpuscles. This stimulates nerve endings and sends a signal to the brain.\nPacinian corpuscles are also found in the soles of elephant feet, assisting in the detection of seismic vibrations (shaking, vibrating movement of the Earth).\nMany animals including elephants survived the Asian tsunami in 2004. It is thought these animals had advanced warning to the tsunami due to their detection of seismic vibrations. The tsunami\u2019s approaching vibrations were detected by the pacinian corpuscles in the elephant\u2019s feet and alerted them to the approaching storm."}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "All About Elephants - Birth & Care of Young| SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment", "url": "https://seaworld.org/animals/all-about/elephants/care-of-young/", "text": "Birthing\nAs the time for giving birth approaches, the female will seek close contact with another female in her family unit for protection during labor.\nSometimes the entire family unit circles around a female giving birth, protecting her from all sides.\nFemales give birth while standing. The birth itself lasts only a few minutes.\nA single calf is usually born head and forelegs first. Twins have been documented, but are extremely rare.\nMothers will consume the afterbirth to avoid detection by predators.\nCalves at Birth\nOn average, newborn calves stand about 1 m (3 ft.) high and weigh 120 kg (264 lb.) at birth. Newborn male African elephants may weigh up to 165 kg (364 lb.). Newborn Asian elephant calves weigh about 91 kg (200 lb.).\nThe newborn is helped to its feet by its mother and other females. Calves are able to stand on their own within minutes of birth.\nThe mother and other females help guide the calf to nurse almost immediately. The trunk of the calf is still short, so it uses its mouth to nurse.\nCalves are able to walk within one to two hours of birth.\nWithin two days, calves are strong enough to join the rest of the herd, which is waiting patiently nearby.\nCalf Development\nMothers, aunts, sisters, and the matriarch are very important to calf development. The pace of the herd is adjusted, so the young can keep up. Calves learn which plants are edible and ways to acquire them, by watching their elders. Mothers and aunts are in almost constant affectionate contact with the young, offering guidance and assistance.\nCalves nurse for the first six months of life. Elephant milk is high in fat and protein (100 times more than the protein contained in cow's milk).\nOn average, calves drink about 10 L (21 pt.) a day.\nCalves begin to experiment with their developing trunks between four and six months of age by picking grasses and leaves to supplement their diet. Weaning from milk gradually follows this process. Calves are not completely weaned until they are over two years of age and may weigh between 850-900 kg (1,874-1,984 lb.).\nBirthing Intervals\nThe birth interval for elephants is about a year. Females may have up to 12 calves in their lifetime."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "African Elephant | Reid Park Zoo", "url": "https://reidparkzoo.org/animals/elephant/", "text": "African elephants are the largest living terrestrial mammal. They are a dull, brownish-grey color, and sparsely covered in black, bristle-like hairs. Their wrinkled skin and large ears increase surface area, keeping their body cool. Both males and females have tusks, or modified incisors, that grow throughout their lives; they also have a modified upper lip and nose \u2013 the trunk \u2013 that has 2 prehensile finger-like lips at the end, used for grasping small and large items.\nDiet: The diet varies during the wet and dry seasons of Africa. When water is plentiful, elephants will eat grasses, leaves, fruits, and flowers. In times of drought, elephants feed on the woody parts of trees and shrubs. An adult elephant can eat 160 kilograms (350 pounds) of food a day! At Reid Park Zoo, our elephants are given a mix of hay, browse, pellets, and a variety of fruits and vegetables.\nIn the Wild: Elephants are highly social creatures, and live in groups called herds. Herds consist of the matriarch \u2013 the oldest female \u2013 related females, and their offspring. Males, or bull elephants, will live with the herd until sexual maturity, at which time they leave and form bachelor herds or live alone. Elephants are also highly vocal. They can use subsonic grumbles heard 8 kilometers away, loud trumpets, and high pitched squeaks to communicate. Elephants are a keystone species; they are instrumental in keeping the savannas from turning into woodlands by knocking over trees and spreading seeds of the fruit they eat.\nConservation issues/actions: Poaching is one of the biggest threats to elephant populations, because they are illegally hunted for ivory and meat. Elephants are also greatly affected by climate change, as they are forced to alter their home ranges in search of food. This places them in close human contact; they have been documented eating crops and damaging water supplies of local farmers in the search for food. Habitat fragmentation and the expansion of human populations into the migratory path of elephants creates human/wildlife conflicts.\nAt the Zoo:\nIn 2014, as part of the elephant species survival plan (SSP), the Reid Park Zoo was lucky to have the first elephant born in Arizona. In addition to our elephant SSP, the Reid Park Zoo supports the Tarangire Elephant Project. This project, located in Tanzania, researches population numbers, movement, and herd dynamics in wild elephants. Additionally the Tarangire Elephant Project has worked to protect over 1,000,000 acres of elephant habitat to protect elephant migratory paths from development, in an effort to reduce elephant/human conflict.\nCheck the event board in the front plaza when you arrive, there may be an opportunity to catch a session with an Elephant Keeper at the training wall in the pavilion of the Jim Click Elephant Care Center.

Over the course of evolution, the elephant as we know it today has evolved into a strong forced bulldozer that has the power to modify the landscape it resides in. For elephants their effect on the landscape is often considered destruction, but is it? The answer to this question partially depends on your preconceived views of \"nature\". If you see nature as something static and in a particular way then any change no matter how minute will amount to destruction. An interesting statistic found in the book African Elephants: A Celebration of Majesty about this issue; a general estimation shows that Man is clearing more forests in one day that all the elephants in Africa will 'destroy' within one year. Put in perspective, the effect that elephants have on their environment may not be as serious are we have been led to believe. Unfortunately for some, our narrow opinion of seeing elephants as only living bulldozers of destruction is far from the case. As much as 80 percent of what elephants consume is returned to the soil as barely digested highly fertile manure."}

Once found throughout the tear-shaped island at the bottom of India\u2019s southern tip, these elephants are now being pushed into smaller areas as development activities clear forests and disrupt their ancient migratory routes.\nThe herd size in Sri Lanka ranges from 12-20 individuals or more. It is led by the oldest female, or matriarch. In Sri Lanka, herds have been reported to contain nursing units, consisting of lactating females and their young, and juvenile care units, containing females with juveniles. The Sri Lankan elephant population has fallen almost 65% since the turn of the 19th century. Today, the Sri Lanka elephant is protected under the Sri Lankan law and killing one carries the death penalty."}

Elephants have excellent memories and encourage you to use yours to make the most of your current experiences.\nIf you sense a close affinity with the elephant, or if this animal has been manifesting in your life lately, it is definitely trying to send you a message.\nRead on to find out all about its meaning.\nMeaning and Symbolism of Elephant as Spirit Animal\nElephants are gentle and wise animals that represent power and strength. If these creatures are making an appearance in your life, it means you are developing a new relationship with your positive feminine attributes.\nElephants are family-oriented and focus on past and future generations. Elephant\u2019s main mantra could well be \u201cfamily first.\u201d This spirit animal challenges you to protect the weak of your tribe and recognize how your family\u2019s union, love, and loyalty serve as powerful protection energy.\nHowever, not all family is bound by blood.

Rushing to get to the finish line doesn\u2019t guarantee you success, so take one step at a time and enjoy the process. The elephant spirit animal reminds you that when things are taking longer than you expected, they are also worth waiting for!\nCharacteristics and Personality\nElephants are majestic creatures that have a lot to teach us. Some people call them the world\u2019s most gentle giant because their impressive physical stature doesn\u2019t make justice to their kind nature.\nThe elephant spirit animal represents:\nIntelligence\nMemory\nStrength and Protection\nUnity, Family, and Friendships\nRepressed Anger\nElephant Spirit Animal Positive Powers\nIntelligence and Consciousness\nElephants are incredibly intelligent, with a brain that weighs over 11 pounds and has 300 billion neurons. It\u2019s on par with our brains regarding functionality and interconnectivity.\nThis is why it is believed that elephants have profound thoughts and complex emotions. Animal behaviorists notice intelligence when they use tools, show compassion and grief, engage in cooperation, and how they communicate with each other.\nIf the elephant appears in your life, it could be a sign to overcome an obstacle by using your intellect. You might feel emotional about your current circumstances, but you must rely on your rational mind to make logical decisions.\nEmotions are powerful and help us understand other people\u2019s struggles. However, they can cloud our judgment. The elephant reminds you that you have a powerful intellect, and it could help you find the answers you seek.\nWisdom and Memory\nElephants have excellent memories and never forget about dangerous situations and people that should be avoided. We all remember positive and negative experiences. Some of us want to erase them, while others dwell too much on the past instead of living the present.\nThe elephant spirit animal reminds you that our memories are powerful but only if you use them to fully experience your current circumstances.\nMake your past experiences help you achieve your full potential today. The elephant takes the knowledge of its experiences and uses it to have a better life. Use your memories to guide you on your life journey and let them lead you to positive transformation.\nStrength and Protection\nElephants are known to risk their lives to protect their herd. The elephant\u2019s strength reminds you that you are physically and emotionally protected, and there\u2019s nothing you should worry about.\nIt could also mean that you need to protect your loved ones from imminent danger. If your instincts tell you something is off, summon your inner elephant and become more protective.\nThe elephant doesn\u2019t hide in the face of a threat, especially if it involves one of their loved ones. This animal knows when to establish boundaries if someone doesn\u2019t respect them.\nThe elephant may also remind you to be more protective of your work, projects, or even your material possessions.\nUnity, Family, and Friendships\nElephants are widely known for their intense dedication to their families and friends. They are social animals that live in large herds with whom they remain for all their lives.\nThe leader of the elephant family is the oldest female, who has the wisdom to ensure their survival. Young males strike on their own while females stay with their mothers and grandmothers. Still, the group remains close to their original family to protect the youngest ones.\nIf the elephant spirit animal appears in your life, it could mean you can rely more closely on your family and friends. Never take your loved ones for granted, as they are one of your greatest blessings in life.\nElephant Spirit Animal Negative Powers\nRepressed anger\nAlthough elephants are considered one of the gentlest animals, there are times when they can become violent and fiercely attack their predators. The elephant spirit animal could thus represent repressed anger and resentment.\nThis aspect of the spirit animal could be found if you ignore the things that make you angry. If you suppress your anger, you will become resentful and perceive other people as foes instead of allies.\nYou can let go of your anger with confidence because you know how useful it is when used wisely. The elephant spirit guide will give you self-confidence by making you realize that you can change your response and the situation around you.\nElephant as Animal Totem\nYou can reach the elephant as a totem animal when you are struggling with conflicts in your family, as it will give you enough empathy to understand all parties and find the perfect solution.\nUse an elephant talisman if you are delving into your heritage, family trees, and ancestors\u2019 history. Your past lives have lessons that will guide you through current problems, and the elephant totem pole could help you along this process.\nAlso, you can use an elephant statue to summon ancient wisdom and messages from your higher self. Elephant strength can help you discover the secrets hidden in the heavenly realms.\nIf you are confused about a personal circumstance, the elephant totem can patiently get you back on track.\nHow to Call Animal Spirit of the Elephant for Help?\nIt shouldn\u2019t be hard to ask your elephant spirit animal for help since they are already there, waiting for you to notice them. However, some people have forgotten their spiritual roots and don\u2019t make these spiritual creatures part of our daily life. Thus, they need some time and practice to get there.\nAs soon as you call them and ask for their wise presence, the elephant will come your way and offer their advice to overcome your obstacles.\nYou can call your spirit animal elephant by going to a quiet, nature spot and visualizing its presence. Try closing your eyes and taking a couple of deep breaths until your train of thought slows down. Then, picture yourself calling the elephant and then visualize its huge body, movements, and wisdom near you \u2013 the more precise, the better.\nTalk to the elephant as if you were talking to an old friend or relative and ask them as many questions as you want. This will trigger the connection between your heart and the spiritual realm, calling the elephant spirit animal to come by your side.\nYou can also keep symbols or pictures of the elephant on your desk, cell phone, kitchen, or any place you usually stare at. By doing so, every now and then, you will bring its energy to your consciousness.\nYou can also watch documentaries about these powerful animals, study their personality and lifestyle, and bring their teachings to your daily experience.\nIf you follow these guidelines, the elephant will soon manifest in your life.\nHow Does an Animal Spirit make Itself Known?\nThe most straightforward way for spirit guardians to reach you and manifest in your life is through dreams or unlikely coincidences.\nHave you ever had a wildly vivid dream about an elephant sending you an important message or staying by your side during a trying experience?\nOr maybe a recurring dream in which the elephant appears next to you, keeping you company, or even a dream in which you transform yourself into an elephant. This is a powerful sign that you should pay attention to what\u2019s trying to convey and adopt the elephant\u2019s characteristics to overcome your obstacles.\nYour spirit animal can make itself known through coincidences or, as I like to call them, synchronicities that arise in a mysterious way. For example, you might hear your children overtalking about the elephant, and soon after, your best friend sends you a funny meme of it. Then, the news broadcasts also talk about this particular creature.\nThis can\u2019t be a mere coincidence, right?\nThese strange happenings are how spirit animals manifest themselves in our lives. We just need to connect the dots in our hearts to discover their message.\nHow to Understand Your Power Animal\u2019s Message\nThe signs and messages of our spirit or power animals are usually very subtle since they come from the spiritual dream. Therefore, you could understand them faster if you developed your intuition or inner compass.\nIf you don\u2019t know where to start, try noticing your gut reactions at any given situation and follow its lead when you are unsure of how to proceed.\nIn addition, take a look at your current circumstances and record how you feel about them. Are you shouldering heavy burdens or facing an important challenge? Do you need the elephant\u2019s intelligence and wisdom to overcome a crisis?\nThe elephant will come to your rescue and invite you to become aware of your inner power and take charge of it.\nThe more in contact with your inner self, the clearer the elephant\u2019s message will be. Take a few minutes each day to meditate and create a sacred space within your heart to help you in this task.\nMeaning of Elephant in Dreams\nIf an elephant visits your dreams, it means that you must overcome an obstacle in your relationships or move into a role of greater responsibility in your family.\nDreaming with animals could also symbolize having found a newfound strength within yourself that will clear the obstacles in your way to success.\nElephants are good luck symbols in many cultures, which is why dreaming with these creatures is considered a good omen that heralds a positive outcome in your life.\nMeaning of Elephant in Various Mythologies\nThe elephant has been featured in many cultures around the world as they live in India, Africa, and Asia. Some people consider it a symbol of fertility and others a connection to spiritual Enlightenment and Buddha itself.\nIn ancient India, the elephant was treated as a symbol of strength and authority. In ancient Rome, the elephant expressed wisdom and iron determination.\nEastern cultures traditionally considered the elephant a symbol of longevity and good fortune.\nIn ancient Greece, elephants represented resplendence and majesty.\nIn China, these creatures were viewed as wise animals that could discern between good and evil spirits.\nElephants are one of the most sacred animals in Hinduism. Ganesh is a Hindu god with an elephant head, and it removes obstacles while bringing luck. The god Vishnu rides the back of an elephant to show his power.\nIn other Eastern cultures, elephants represent peace and harmony because of their long-lived status among other animals."}

Of the three families in this order, only the elephant family is still alive today. So, what\u2019s the difference that separates elephants vs. mammoths?\nBoth animals are gentle herbivores, though mammoths may have sometimes fought using their long tusks. In this article, we\u2019ll discuss all of the differences between elephants and mammoths, including why elephants have survived while mammoths went extinct.\nComparing Elephant vs Mammoth\nWooly mammoths went extinct around 4,000 years ago. Dotted Yeti/Shutterstock.com\nElephants and mammoths are very similar creatures, and they even descended from the same ancestor long ago!\nHowever, they do have distinct differences\u2014mainly due to the ways mammoths adapted to cooler environments. Before we dive in, let\u2019s talk about the species of elephant alive today.\nAfrican Elephant: African elephants have large ears, two extensions from their trunks used for gripping, and dipped backs. There are two species of African elephants, the African bush elephant which is larger and lives on savannas and the African forest elephant which is smaller and lives in dense forest environments.\nAsian Elephant: It\u2019s still debated which elephant species is closest related to mammoths, but many believe it may be the Asian elephant. These elephants have small ears, rounded backs, and just one extension from the trunk. Female Asian elephants do not have tusks. Asian elephants are an endangered species.\nThere were many mammoth species including the Wooly Mammoth, Pygmy Mammoth, and Steppe Mammoth. All of these species are now extinct.\nElephant Mammoth Status Endangered Extinct Habitat Africa, Asia North America, Asia, Europe Body Rounded or dipped back Humped back Tusks Shorter tusks with 1-2 extensions; only male Asian elephants have tusks Long tusks with two extensions; both sexes had tusks Ears Asian elephant ears are smaller, while African elephant ears are larger Small ears Fur Little fur Thick fur, sometimes with double coat\nThe 5 key Differences Between Mammoths and Elephants\nThe wooly mammoth was one of the last mammoths to emerge. A key difference between mammoths vs. elephants was their thick coat\n1. Mammoths are Extinct\nThe major difference between these species is that only one is living. Mammoths went extinct around 4,000 years ago in large part thanks to a rapidly changing climate and hunting from humans spreading across the globe.\nElephants are still alive today, although all species of elephant are threatened. Asian elephants are on the endangered species list while African bush elephants are endangered and African forest elephants are now critically endangered.\nIt\u2019s so important to keep the elephants left today alive, or this entire order of animals will be gone from our Earth for good.\n2. Mammoths had Bigger Tusks\nMammoths were heavier than elephants, with much longer tusks. They were more twisted than elephant tusks, and could grow up to 16 feet long.\nIn comparison, the longest ever elephant tusks were 11 feet and 7 inches in length.\nAnother important variation exists only in Asian elephants: the females do not have tusks. Both sexes of mammoths and African elephants have tusks.\nAnd last but not least when it comes to their trunks, both African elephants and mammoths have (or had) two extensions from the tips of their trunk that are (or were) used for gripping. Asian elephants have only one.\n3. Mammoths had Thick Coats\nIf you\u2019ve ever seen an elephant, you know that they have very thin layers of hair\u2014it may even look like they don\u2019t have fur at all.\nYou couldn\u2019t say this about a mammoth. They had thick fur to adapt to cold environments. Some of them even had double coats to keep them warm through harsh winters.\nAn African Forest Elephant mother with her calf. Forest elephants live in dense, forest habitats\n4. Their Habitats were Different\nMammoths and elephants are the descendants of the same animal. Sometime in history, however, mammoths evolved to travel outside of the warm climates of Africa, Asia, and Europe.\nWhile elephants remained in these environments, mammoths travelled as far as North America!\nOver time, they adapted to colder climates and thus were able to survive these further travels.\nA comparison of a mammoth and Asian elephant petrroudny43/Shutterstock.com\n5. They have Different Body Shapes\nMammoths had humps on their back near their shoulders, but elephants do not have this. Asian elephants have more rounded backs, while African elephants\u2019 backs slope downward toward the middle.\nMammoths and Asian elephants also have more distinctive foreheads, while African elephant foreheads slope straight downward into the trunk. There is a much less visible dividing structure between the head and trunk.\nMammoths had larger foreheads than either elephant species, and it was kind of rounded in shape.\nLastly, African Elephants have longer ears than either the Asian elephant or mammoths."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Hyrax Facts: Animals of Africa - WorldAtlas", "url": "https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/hyrax-facts-animals-of-africa.html", "text": "Africa is famed for its diverse and unique wildlife. Although the \u201cbig five\u201d animals are the famous residents (lions, leopards, buffalos, elephants, and rhinos), there are many other animals who, while being secretive and small, are critical to the ecosystem.\nOne of such animals is the hyrax. Hyrax is a name given to small rodent-like animals under the order of Hyracoidea. While their small stature, as well as diet, resembles that of rodents, scientific studies show that the hyrax is surprisingly related to the elephant and sea cows (manatees and dugongs).\nHyraxes are classified into four distinct species, the Procavia capensis (rock hyrax), Heterohyrax brucei (yellow-spotted rock hyrax), Dendrohyrax arboreaus (southern tree hyrax), and the Dendrohyrax dorsalis (western tree hyrax). Hyraxes, as is the case with all African wild animals, are faced with the increased threat of extinction due to human activities. While human hunting of hyraxes is minimal, the prime threat to their existence is the destruction of their natural habitat by human activity.\n4. Behavior\nHyraxes are active during both the daytime and night, and can be seen foraging near pitch darkness, a behavior attributed to their excellent sense of smell as well as excellent hearing. Hyraxes are social animals and live in groups of up to 50 individuals. Such groups are usually headed by a male and a few subordinate males with the female hyraxes being the majority. The territorial male is usually on the lookout while the other members are feeding and will sound an alarm after it detects any threat in the environment. The hyraxes in these groups communicate with one another through a complex variety of sounds.\nAnimals who prey on hyraxes include leopards, pythons, birds of prey and serval cats. Their primary defensive response is biting and clawing the predator. Hyraxes are rather impressive in their toilet manners as they usually have a defined location used for defecation away from their shelter crevasse. The hyrax reaches sexual maturity at the age of 17 months where females mate with the dominant male. The female hyrax has a gestation period of seven to eight months (which is rather long for an animal of its size) after which it gives birth to a litter of four youngsters who spend the most of their childhood in the safety of the crevasses. After reaching adulthood, male hyraxes are banished from their home territory and spend their solitary lives in the margins of established territories.\n3. Habitat and Range\nHyraxes are found all over the continent of Africa as well as the Middle East. However, these small mammals are likely to be found in areas with rocky terrain because the hyraxes do not dig burrows and so look for crevasses in rocks or hollow trees to reside in. They particularly look for crevasses which are small enough to hinder predators from accessing them or their young. When choosing a location to establish a habitat, the biggest factor they take into account is the area\u2019s visibility and temperature. Another reason why hyraxes prefer rocky areas are that hyraxes are fond of basking on rocks where they live so as to control their body temperature. However, hyraxes can be found in many other diverse habitats and can even be found in tundra climates at altitudes of over 14,000 feet above sea level\n2. Diet\nHyraxes primarily feed on shrubs, twigs, and grasses with a preference for fruits, shoots, berries, and buds. The animals use their excellent climbing skills to access the fresh and soft parts of trees and bushes. However, hyraxes have been observed feeding on birds\u2019 eggs, lizards, and insects which means the animals can most accurately be classified as omnivores. Mosses and liverworts are usually consumed by hyraxes. Initially, hyraxes were wrongfully considered to be ruminants (animals who chew regurgitated cud) due to their jaw motion while chewing.\nHowever, hyraxes are not ruminants and instead rely on their complex, multi-chambered stomach which has a host of bacteria to break down the fibrous plant matter. Hyraxes use their molar teeth to cut off leaves instead of their incisors which resemble tusks. The hyraxes obtain moisture from the plants they feed on and hence can go extended periods of time without drinking water. While feeding, hyraxes are cautious and will look for threats after every bite if living alone, and if living as a group, an individual will be on the lookout for predators while the others feed.\n1. Physical Description\nHyraxes are small animals without tails. They resemble guinea pigs. The animals grow to 28 inches in length and have a maximum weight of 11 pounds. The hyrax\u2019s skin is covered with thick fur and has varied coloration depending on the species. The yellow-spotted rock hyrax\u2019s fur is yellowish brown and has a white patch just above its eyes. The rock hyrax is greyish-brown in color and has no distinct marks on its face.\nThe hyrax has several physical attributes that differentiate it from rodents and link it to elephants and manatees. The hyrax\u2019s feet have rubber-like moist soles which are crucial in climbing. Hyraxes have three toes on the hind feet and four toes on the front feet. The toes have nails (with the exception of the hind foot\u2019s inner toe which has a claw used for scratching itches) which resemble hoofs unlike the usual long, claw-like nails found in rodents. The dental characteristics of the hyrax are also close to that of elephants with elongated incisors which resemble tusks found in manatees and elephants. These tusk-like teeth are more prominent in male hyraxes than in females."}

Much of this random knowledge gets lost in the ether, leaving us to speculate about things like dinosaur divorce rates or amphibian dance moves. But we still catch an awful lot, providing us with plenty of interesting\u2014if not always actionable\u2014facts about our fellow fauna.\nThe list below is a tribute to such trivia. From extinct penguins to newly identified wasps, these tidbits reflect the depth of our own species' curiosity about nature\u2014and our skill in shedding new light on it. As you peruse these facts, imagine all that went into discovering each one. We embrace their randomness here, but most hail from a robust body of knowledge about the animal in question.\nSo without further ado, here are 36 random animal facts that may interest you.\nAnatomy\nTreehugger / Russell McLendon\n1. Octopuses have three hearts. One pumps blood around the body, while the other two pump it to the gills. Oh, and that blood is blue, thanks to high copper levels!\n2. Owls don't have eyeballs. They have eye tubes.\n3. Polar bears have black skin. This helps it to absorb heat from the sun to stay warm in an Arctic climate, and it likely protects the bear from harmful UV rays.\n4. A human brain operates on about 15 watts.\nAbilities\nTreehugger / Russell McLendon\n5. Butterflies can taste with their feet, using something called chemoreceptors that help them to identify plants. Females select the correct leaf on which to lay eggs by \"drumming\" it with her feet to release juices.\n6. Animals with smaller bodies and faster metabolism see in slow motion.\n7. Dogs' sense of smell is about 100,000 times stronger than humans', but they have just one-sixth our number of taste buds.\n8. Reindeer eyeballs turn blue in winter to help them see at lower light levels. (They're golden-colored in summer.) No other mammals are known to have this ability.\n9. A single strand of spider silk is thinner than a human hair, but also five times stronger than steel of the same width. A rope just 2 inches thick could reportedly stop a Boeing 747.\nTreehugger / Russell McLendon\n10. The claws of a mantis shrimp can accelerate as quickly as a .22-caliber bullet. Scientists must keep them in thick plastic tanks because their punches can break glass.\n11. A sea lion is the first nonhuman mammal with a proven ability to keep a beat. A female sea lion named Ronan was trained to do it by scientists, who then showed she could transfer that skill to a song with a different beat that she had not heard before.\n12. Squirrels can't burp or vomit. Nor can any other rodent. This happens to be why rat poison is so effective; other mammals tend to expel any toxic substance they ingest.\n13. The extinct colossus penguin stood as tall as LeBron James.\n14. Honeybees can flap their wings 200 times every second.\nSurvival and Adaptation\n15. A type of \"immortal\" jellyfish is capable of cheating death indefinitely.\n16. Cats and horses are highly susceptible to black widow venom, but dogs are relatively resistant. Sheep and rabbits are apparently immune.\n17. Sharks kill fewer than 10 people per year. Humans kill about 100 million sharks per year. They should be much more scared of us than we are of them.\n18. Tardigrades are extremely durable microscopic animals that exist all over Earth. They can survive any of the following: 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 Celsius), -458 degrees F (-272 C), the vacuum of space, pressure six times stronger than the ocean floor and more than a decade without food.\nBehavior\nTreehugger / Russell McLendon\n19. Wild dolphins call each other by name. They let out a unique whistle to identify each other and will respond if they hear their own call played back.\n20. Young goats pick up accents from each other. This means they join humans, bats, and whales as mammals known to adjust their vocal sound to fit into a new social group.\n21. Humpback whale songs spread like \"cultural ripples from one population to another.\"\n22. Elephants have a specific alarm call that means \"human.\"\nTreehugger / Russell McLendon\n23. There's a place on Earth where seagulls prey on right whales. They dive-bomb the calves that are coming up to breathe air and take bites of blubber out of their backs. The calves' skin is thinner than adults' and they have to come up for air more frequently, making them more exposed and vulnerable to attack.\n24. Horses use facial expressions to communicate with each other. Researchers have identified 17 discrete facial movements in horses.\n25. Azara's owl monkeys are more monogamous than humans. They live together as families, with two parents and offspring, for up to nine years or when one of them dies. Fathers are highly involved in caring for their young.\n26. Male gentoo and Adelie penguins \"propose\" to females by giving them a pebble. These are precious because the penguins use them to build their nests, and they can be hard to find along the barren Antarctic shoreline. If the female accepts the pebble, the pair bonds and mates for life.\nTreehugger / Russell McLendon\n27. Barn owls are normally monogamous, but about 25% of mated pairs \"divorce.\" They do so if breeding is unsuccessful.\n28. African buffalo herds display voting behavior, in which individuals register their travel preference by standing up, looking in one direction and then lying back down. Only adult females can vote.\n29. If a honeybee keeps waggle-dancing in favor of an unpopular nesting site, other workers headbutt her to help the colony reach a consensus.\n30. The bone-house wasp stuffs the walls of its nest with dead ants.\nBonus Weird Animal Facts\nTreehugger / Russell McLendon\n31. Less time separates the existence of humans and the Tyrannosaurus rex than the T-rex and the stegosaurus.\n32. Animals have some unusual group names. For instance, a group of parrots is known as a pandemonium. Buffalo form an \"obstinacy\" and rhinoceroses a \"crash.\" You may have heard of a \"murder\" of crows, but what about an \"exaltation\" of larks?\n33. Warmer weather causes more turtles to be born female than male.\n34. A supercolony of invasive Argentine ants, known as the \"California large,\" covers 560 miles of the U.S. west coast. It's currently engaged in a turf war with a nearby supercolony in Mexico.\n35. By eating pest insects, bats save the U.S. agriculture industry an estimated $3.7 to $53 billion per year.\n36. Fourteen new species of dancing frogs were discovered in 2014, raising the global number of known dancing-frog species to 24."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "What Do Elephants Eat? - Wild Animal Park", "url": "https://www.wildanimalpark.org/what-do-elephants-eat/", "text": "Elephants are herbivorous and will almost eat anything vegetarian ranging from leaves, bark, twigs, shrubs and bushes, fruits, roots and flowers. As large animals it is understandable that they need large quantities of food. Elephants use their muscular trunks, a very versatile appendage, for digging roots and uprooting plants, plucking leaves and breaking branches off the trees.\nWhat do African and Asian elephants eat?\nThe African elephant is much larger that the Asian elephant and consequently eats a lot more than the latter. While an average African elephant will need 250 kilograms of food and drink 60 liters of water the Asian elephant will eat 150 kilograms and drink 40 liters of water. Both species will feed mostly in the early morning and in the late evenings.\nThe African elephant is found in all types of habitats ranging from the savannahs to marshes and deserts and even in mountains above the snow line. Because of the terrain they live in and because of their higher reach they are browsers. They eat leaves, soft shoots, woody plants, shrubs and fruits of high growing trees. They will often rip bark off trees. They will often uproot trees, a habit which can change savannah into grasslands.\nThe Asian elephant lives in the thorn-scrub forests of Sri Lanka, Southern India and Thailand and in the evergreen forests and are grazers. They will generally feed on grasses, low woody plants and trees. As bamboo is abundant in these regions the Asian elephant is very fond of them.\nHow much do elephants eat?\nAn interesting fact is that elephants do not have a very efficient digestive system and they digest, on an average, only forty percent of the food they eat. That makes the quantity of food they require even larger. A large male African elephant may eat as much as 350 kilograms of vegetation in a day. They also have to drink a lot of water. Elephants may spend as much as 18 hours a day foraging for food and water. Because they consume such quantities, elephants live close to water as the live to the food source. They are also very good swimmers so they often swim in search of food from one place to another.\nElephants have 26 teeth. Unlike most other mammals that first develop baby teeth that are later replaced by a set of permanent teeth elephants have cycles of tooth replacement throughout their lives and may be typically replaced six times in a lifespan. This helps them eat the tough tree barks and the roots till late into their lives. An elephant with an infected tooth cannot survive for long in the wild because it cannot eat properly, and tooth replacements help.\nImpact on ecology\nElephants can travel long distances in search of food and will walk even up to 80 kilometers in a day. During the dry season they will migrate thousands of kilometers in search of food and water. These migrations can have both a positive and negative impact on ecology, mostly the former. When elephants dig for water they leave behind water holes that are used by smaller animals and birds, helping their population. When they dig for roots and uproot trees they can help transform a savannah into an oasis.\nThey also greatly help plant life. Because of their weak digestive system, most of the seeds they eat pass through their digestive tract. As they wander in search of food they carry these seeds over long distances propagating plant growth. Their dung also serves a food source for monkeys and dung beetles.\nThey can also be destructive. Over population of elephants in some areas of Africa has resulted the in destruction of plants in search of food affecting certain species of small animals and birds.\nWhile the major threats to elephants are from poaching, destruction of habitats and their food and water resources also is a major threat both in Africa and in Asia. Because of their food and water requirements they need large tracts of land to forage unlike any other terrestrial animal. When food resources are scarce the elephants will move into areas inhabited by humans. Because of the volume of food that they need, they tend to destroy crops and plantations and destroy water sources used by people. This leads to man-animal conflicts."}

They mourn their dead, cry tears of joy, and form close familial bonds.\nThey also have lifespans similar to our own, and today, we\u2019re looking at some of the oldest known elephants to ever live.\nA Quick Crash Course in Elephants\nElephants are the largest land mammals currently roaming Earth \u2014 specifically Africa and Asia. As you might have already guessed, the gentle-but-giant herbivores need lots of fuel, and the average adult elephant puts down 330 pounds of vegetation a day. But when you consider that elephants weigh between 5,000 and 14,000 pounds, 330 pounds of food makes sense!\nDespite their commanding size, the elephants are not all right. Due to poaching, climate change, and habitat destruction, all three extant species are on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature\u2019s Red List. African bush elephants and Asian elephants are Endangered, and African forest elephants are Critically Endangered.\nThe easiest way to tell African and Asian elephants apart is their ears: the former\u2019s are much larger and shaped like the African continent; the latter\u2019s are smaller and shaped like the Indian subcontinent!\nTwo wild African Elephants interacting with each other. Elephants are highly social animals that need companionship. JONATHAN PLEDGER/Shutterstock.com\nWhat Is the Average Lifespan of an Elephant?\nThe average lifespan for Asian elephants is 48 years. African elephants typically make it to 60 or 70.\nSadly, zoo-dwelling elephants have the shortest lifespans. A six-year study concluded that pachyderms living in European zoos die much sooner than those living in protected wildlife reserves throughout Africa and Asia. Researchers believe that captivity significantly erodes elephants\u2019 mental health, so much so that the stress can lead to early death.\nPoaching Is a Huge Threat\nThough elephants live relatively long lives compared to other animals in the wild, poaching is an increasing problem for the pachyderm population. According to some reports, over 30,000 elephants are illegally killed each year for their ivory.\nThe situation is devastating and complicated. Corporate encroachment and urban expansion have decimated the traditional livelihoods of many communities, and regional wages meant to replace the old ways are stagnant and insufficient. But ivory black market buyers are willing to pay enough to support an impoverished family for an entire year, so poaching continues. Solving the problem will require a multifaceted plan that accounts for sociological, economic, and psychological considerations on both micro and macro scales.\nEvidence suggests that Mother Nature is also working on the problem, and some scientists speculate that tuskless elephants may be climbing the evolutionary ladder. However, related research is still in its early stages, and conclusions have yet to be drawn.\nOldest Known Elephants\nNobody is sure which animal currently holds the record for oldest elephant living because the long-reigning record-holder, Dakshayani, passed away in 2019 at the ripe old age of 88. Soon after his death, the pandemic descended, and a new crown holder has yet to be named.\nBased on our research, Raju, an Asian elephant rescued in 2014 by Wildlife SOS, may be the front runner. His vet believes he\u2019s in his late 50s. According to reports, Raju was a slave elephant, and when handlers from Wildlife SOS cut off his shackles, Raju shed tears of joy.\nBut the probability that Raju is the oldest elephant on the planet is pretty low. A 60-plus-year-old pachyderm, who\u2019s managed to escape poaching, is likely living somewhere in the wild.\nFormer oldest elephant record-holders include:\nLin Wang \u2013 A World War II veteran and resident of the Taipei Zoo, Lin Wang was born in 1917 and passed away in 2003 at the age of 86. For years, he held the title of the world\u2019s oldest living elephant.\nIndira \u2013 Indira lived most of her life at Karnataka\u2019s Sakrebailu, an elephant rehabilitation center in India. Docile and accommodating, Indira lived to about 90 years old \u2014 or, at least, that was her vet\u2019s best guess. Nobody was sure of her actual age at death because she wasn\u2019t born in captivity. Indira passed away in 2017.\nShirley \u2013 Shirley was born into a toxic circus environment where handlers abused her. Thankfully, she was eventually sold to the Louisiana Purchase Gardens and Zoo in Monroe, Louisiana, and was ultimately placed at The Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee. The world first welcomed Shirley in 1948. Sadly, she passed on in 2021 at the age of 73, which is a long time for an Asian elephant!\nHanako \u2013 When Hanako went to elephant heaven in 2016, she was the oldest Asian elephant in Japan. Hanako lived at the Inokashira Park Zoo, but her treeless enclosure at the facility courted much controversy. Plus, they forced Hanako to live alone, the equivalent of being thrown in solitary confinement for no reason.\nTyranza \u2013 A longtime resident of The Memphis Zoo, Tyranza \u2014 Ty for short \u2014 was once the oldest African elephant in North America. Ty was born in 1964 and orphaned early. From there, she was committed to a circus and rescued in 1977 by the Memphis Zoo. Sadly, she passed away in 2020.\nA life-size specimen of Lin Wang at the Taipei Zoo. Lin Wang served in the Second World War and the Chinese Civil War. Lin became a cultural icon after his arrival in Taiwan and died as one of the oldest Asian elephants in the world.\nElephants are incredible animals.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Asian elephant | Oregon Zoo", "url": "https://www.oregonzoo.org/discover/animals/asian-elephant", "text": "Elephas maximus\nAsian elephants are native to the scrub forests and rain forests of India, Nepal, and parts of Southeast Asia.\nAt 6,000 to 13,000 pounds and 7-10 feet high at the shoulder, Asian elephants are among the largest living land animals, but are smaller than their African relatives, with smaller ears and rounded backs.\nHumans have worked with Asian elephants for around 5,000 years. Today, roughly a third of the world population of this endangered species lives under human care.\nLife of an Asian elephant\nElephants live in close social groups called herds, where they form strong bonds with each other. Females and calves live in multigenerational herds, while adult males spend time on their own and in \"bachelor\" herds.\nAs highly intelligent and social animals, Asian elephants communicate with each other in several ways. Sounds include snorts, barks and roars as well as very low frequency rumbles used to communicate over distances of more than five miles. They also use their highly sensitive trunks to communicate by touch.\nWild Asian elephants spend up to 16 hours a day grazing on shrubs, grass, fruit, leaves, twigs and bark, eating a total of between 4 and 6% of their weight each day. When necessary, they can walk up to ten miles a day in search of food.\nFemales, called cows, are pregnant for 20-22 months, the longest pregnancy of any mammal. Each member of the herd plays a role in the calf's upbringing and care. Newborn calves are about 3 feet tall and weigh up to 300 pounds. They stand on their own very soon after birth and follow their mothers within a few days.\nUnder human care, Asian elephants' complex lives must be supported through specific social groupings and large spaces that offer a variety of choices.\nCompleted in 2015, the Oregon Zoo's Elephant Lands habitat was designed around the social structure of elephants. Throughout the habitat, feeding stations, mud wallows and water features encourage the elephants to be active 14-16 hours a day. To protect their sensitive feet, the entire habitat is covered in sand to a depth of four feet.\nAt Elephant Lands, the herd experiences dry, warm to hot summers and cool, wet winters. The habitat allows the herd to wander freely between three interconnected outdoor spaces and Forest Hall - one of the world's largest indoor elephant spaces. The elephants swim 12 months a year, and will even venture out to play during Portland's rare snow days. Forest Hall is kept at a constant temperature of 70 degrees.\nThe bulls and the female group choose when to spend time on their own, with each other and near or away from people.\nThe Oregon Zoo's elephant staff brings more than 140 years of experience caring for Asian elephants. Using verbal cues and positive reinforcement, staff train each elephant to participate in its own care, from bathing to receiving health checks. Caretakers use verbal cues with the herd, as well as lightweight sections of bamboo that are used as \"targets\" to communicate specific information. For example, a caretaker can check an elephant's foot by asking it to touch its foot to the target. This training builds trusted relationships, and enables the elephants to participate in their own care.\nElephant conservation\nAsian elephants live in some of the most densely human-populated regions of the world, which puts them in frequent and sometimes deadly conflict with people. Logging, development and agriculture to produce crops such as oil palms have drastically reduced elephant habitat throughout Asia. Poaching for ivory, skin and other products is now a growing threat to Asian elephant populations.\nThe Oregon Zoo contributes to the welfare and conservation of Asian elephants throughout their range, with a focus on Borneo. There, the zoo partners with wildlife officials to improve care practices and supports human-conflict mitigation efforts in addition to reforestation and research projects.\nHow you can help Asian elephants\nYou can take action for the survival of Asian elephants by spreading awareness and using your power as a consumer.

This relative isolation has created an ecology like no other.\nThe vast majority of Australian animals are marsupials - animals whose young develop in a pouch instead of a placenta. Australia is also home to the only egg-laying mammals in the world, the amazing echidna and the extraordinarily odd duckbill platypus.\nBats and dingos are the only placental mammals to have reached Australia on their own.\nDingos arrived from China via the Indonesian land bridge about 12,000 years ago and are the largest carnivores on the continent. Other dogs, cats, horses, cows, sheep and rabbits were all imported by human beings.\ncheck out our youtube channel!\nwhat is a marsupial?\nThere are three subclasses of mammals, placental mammals which carry their young in a womb with a placenta, and deliver a relatively full-formed infant, marsupials which do not have a placenta and deliver a relatively un-formed infant that continues its development inside an external pouch, nourishing itself with milk from the mothers mammary glands, and monotremes which lay eggs.(check them out).\nThe majority of animals native to Australia are marsupials, but what exactly is a marsupial, and how do they differ from other animals?\nSimply put, the embryo of a marsupial starts out life in the mothers womb, receiving nourishment from its egg sac, but is delivered very early and continues its development outside the mothers body.\nInstead of having a womb lined with a placenta that the egg attaches itself to and gains nourishment from, marsupials have no placenta and the baby must leave the womb, while still in a nearly embryonic state, to get nourishment from breast milk.\nThe baby, called a \"neonate\" at this stage, is born after only 12 to 28 days of development in the womb. It may be a fraction of an inch long in some species, is hairless, blind and has poorly developed rear legs.\nThe nostrils are open and the fully developed sense of smell is critical to the neonate finding its way. Its forelimbs are strong too, and raging instinct sets the neonate on a manic climb, unaided by the mother, across the sea of its mothers belly fur to reach the pouch.\nThis journey may be a distance of as much as 15 inches and require six minutes of continuous struggle. In a miracle of pure instinct, the almost imperceptible newborn arrives at the pouch, where it will attach itself to a teat and continue to develop for another 2 to 6 months.\nThe kangaroo\nAn icon of Australian wildlife and the nation itself, the kangaroo is the epitome of a marsupial.\nKangaroos are macropods, belonging in the family macropodidea, which literally means \"big feet\".\nThere are over 65 species in the family including red and grey kangaroos, wallabys, and pademelons. These animals are all designed with huge, powerful hind limbs and muscular tails that aid them in locomotion.\nWith its spacious, forward-facing pouch, curious hopping style of locomotion and a variety of other uniquely endearing features, the kangaroo sets the tone for all Australian wildlife.\nThe red kangaroo is the largest marsupial, and also the largest animal in Australia, with mature males weighing in at over 200 pounds and standing 6 feet tall. - Australian Animals\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

It is the only member of the family Phascolarctidae, the \"arct\" part of the family name from a Greek word meaning \"bear\", and there is definitely a \"bear-like\" quality to koalas, particularly in their lumbering movements and well-rounded, tailless bodies.\nPlush, fuzzy-eared, and with a sweet expression, koala bears are the darlings of Australian animals. They are tree-dwelling marsupials, who live the majority of their lives high in the limbs of eucalyptus forests.\nThey have a very limited diet that consists of the eucalyptus leaves of several different species of eucalyptus trees.. Eucalyptus leaves are toxic to many animals, but the koala has a section of intestine called the caecum which breaks down the toxins in its favorite food.\nBecause their diet is so limited and provides little nutrients, the koala bear is extremely sedentary, spending no more than 10 minutes a day in full-bodied exertion of any kind.\nThe koala bear is not social in the wild, and they are only seen in groups in preserves, zoos and game parks. The koala bear also has one of the smallest brains, percentage wise, of all mammals.\nthe tasmanian devil\nThe Tasmanian devil is a carnivorous marsupial with an epic reputation.\nThis is a very unique creature who has a lifestyle and manner of going about things that is entirely unique, not just among Australian wildlife, but among all animals.\nWildly vocal, the Tasmanian devil emits a constant deluge of guttural, gurgling, wailing and growling noises with little, if any, instigation.\nThe devil has an enormous head and neck which make up a full 25% of its total body mass. A relatively small animal at under 25 pounds, even the areas largest carnivore and apex predator the tough as nails dingo will not entertain any confrontation with a devil unless numbers are well in its favor.\nCompetition with the dingo for food, and attempted extermination of them as pests, has greatly impacted the devils population.\nAs of the early 1900's the devil can no longer be found on the continent of Australia , but now only exists on the island it is named for - Tasmania.\na few more australian Animals\nThe variety of Australian wildlife doesn't stop at koalas and kangaroos.\nThere are over 250 species of marsupials in Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand and the surrounding islands, the vast majority of which exist nowhere else in the world.\nThe bandicoot and bilby are local favorites and are comparable to squirrels and raccoons found in other parts of the world. The bilby is such a charismatic and popular little animal that Australians celebrate Easter with chocolate replicas of bilbys instead of rabbits.\nThe only egg-laying mammals in the world - the wildly bizzare duck billed platypus and the almost equally weird echidna exist only in Australia. These animals make up an entire subclass of mammals which lay leathery eggs instead of bearing live young.\nFinally, the beautiful dingo is the largest carnivore in Australia and the only placental mammal other than bats to have navigated to Australia naturally.\nDingos are the only large predator on the continent other than human beings and literally enjoy top-dog status among Australian animals. - Australian Animals Facts"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Northern Elephant Seal | NOAA Fisheries", "url": "https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/northern-elephant-seal", "text": "Northern elephant seal. Photo: NOAA Fisheries\nAbout the Species\nThe northern elephant seal is the largest of the \u201ctrue\u201d seals in the Northern Hemisphere. Adult males use their large, inflatable noses during the winter breeding season to resonate sound when vocally threatening each other. The largest colonies of northern elephant seals are found off southern California in the Channel Islands. They have one of the longest migrations of any mammal; some have been recorded traveling over 13,000 miles roundtrip. Northern elephant seals were once thought to be extinct due to commercial sealing in the 1800s. A small population survived in Mexico and the population began to steadily increase in the early 1900s. Today, robust populations of northern elephant seals in the U.S. and Mexico are derived from those few hundred individuals that survived in Mexico. Northern elephant seals, like all marine mammals, are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\nPopulation Status\nThough a complete population count of elephant seals is not possible because all age classes are not ashore at the same time, the most recent stock assessment reports with population estimates are available.\nProtected Status\nMMPA Protected Throughout Its Range\nAppearance\nNorthern elephant seal pups are black until they are weaned at about 6 weeks old, and they molt and turn light silver. Adults are dark brown or gray. When males reach puberty at about 7 years old, they develop a large inflatable nose, or \"proboscis.\" The proboscis overhangs their lower lip by about 8 inches. They also develop a robust, thick neck with calloused skin that appears pink and light gray and creates a shield to protect them from harm when fighting other males. Conversely, females maintain their smaller noses and smooth necks. Fully grown males can reach lengths of over 13 feet and can weigh nearly 4,400 pounds. Females are significantly smaller than males, but are also quite large, growing to about 10 feet long and weighing up to 1,300 pounds.\nBehavior and Diet\nNorthern elephant seals\u2019 diet primarily consists of squid and fishes, but they also consume rays and sharks. Northern elephant seals spend about 9 months of the year in the ocean. Most of this time is underwater, diving to depths of about 1,000 to 2,500 feet for 20 to 30 minute intervals with only short breaks at the surface. They are rarely seen out at sea for this reason. While on land, they prefer sandy beaches. Northern elephant seals fast during the mating season and can lose up to 36 percent of their body weight during this time. When molting occurs, they shed their short, dense fur along with large patches of old skin. Molting takes 4 to 5 weeks to complete.\nWhere They Live\nNorthern elephant seals are found in the eastern and central North Pacific Ocean. Though they range as far north as Alaska, they typically breed and give birth in the Channel Islands off California or Baja California in Mexico, primarily on offshore islands from December to March. Males feed near the eastern Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska, and females feed farther south, in the offshore waters of Washington and Oregon. Adults return to land between March and August to molt, with males returning later than females. Adults return to their feeding areas again between the spring/summer molt and the winter breeding season.\nWorld map providing approximate representation of the northern elephant seal's range\nLifespan & Reproduction\nPups are born in early winter from December to January. Breeding occurs from December to March, and gestation lasts around 11 months. Northern elephant seals are polygynous breeders with a social hierarchy. Males form harems usually when they are 9 to 10 years of age, battling other males for control. Adult males use their large, inflatable noses during the winter breeding season to resonate sound when vocally threatening each other. There is a notable difference in lifespan between males and females. Females generally live for about 19 years, while males only live for about 13 years. Females come ashore and within a few days give birth to a pup conceived in the previous breeding season. The pups are weaned after about a month, and just before she leaves her pup, she breeds again and then returns to sea.\nThreats\nEntanglement in Fishing Gear Northern elephant seals can become entangled in fishing gear, either swimming off with the gear attached or becoming anchored and possibly drown if they cannot reach the surface to breathe. Once entangled, seals may drag and swim with attached gear for long distances, ultimately resulting in fatigue, compromised feeding ability, or severe injury, which may lead to reduced reproductive success, lower survival rates and/or death. Vessel Strikes Inadvertent vessel strikes can injure or kill seals. The projected increase in vessel traffic arising from the opening of trans-polar shipping routes (as arctic sea ice continues to decline) will increase the risk of vessel strikes and also increase ambient noise and pollution.\nScientific Classification"}

Can It Also Breathe Through Its Ears?\nA chameleon\u2019s tongue can be as long as its body. As chameleons get ready to strike, they contract the muscles in their tongue, much like a person pulling back the string of a bow. They then shoot their tongue like a cannon to snare their prey.\nThe tongue of Rhampholeon spinosus, an endangered chameleon from Tanzania, can produce a peak acceleration that\u2019s 264 times greater than the acceleration due to gravity. If it were a car, its tongue could accelerate from 0 to 60 miles (97 kilometers) per hour in 1/100th of a second.\n46. License to Krill\nA blue whale\u2019s tongue weighs as much as an adult elephant. Blue whales are the largest animals ever to have lived on earth, and they feed almost entirely on some of the smallest marine life \u2013 tiny shrimp-like animals called krill.\n45.

This makes the water boatman the loudest animal relative to its body size.\n38. Monkey Business\nThe loudest land animal on land (not relative to anything) is the howler monkey who can be heard up to three miles away. They howl mostly to warn other monkeys that this is their territory and to let others within their own group know where they are.\n37. Trump\u2019s Favorite Monkey\nAlthough loud, howler monkeys are harmless and their way of dealing with humans they don\u2019t want near them is to innocently pee on them.\n36. A Wail of a Whale\nThe loudest mammals, period, are blue whales that can produce low-frequency pulses heard from more than 500 miles away.\n35. The Claw! The Claw!\nThe loudest known living creature (not a mammal) is the snapping shrimp, which has specialized claws that can shoot jets of superheated water up to 62 miles per hour and explode at 200 decibels to stun or even kill its prey.\n34. The Need for Speed\nA cheetah can go from zero to 60 miles per hour in three seconds, which is exactly the same as a Corvette. Except when you ride a cheetah, you don\u2019t look like a douchebag.\n33.

Just when you thought spiders couldn\u2019t get scarier.\n13. It\u2019s Complicated\nAfter mating, a male tarantula will run away from the female because if he sticks around, she\u2019ll eat him. God forbid if he doesn\u2019t at least drop a text later.\n12. Butt Out!\nAs a defense mechanism, sea cucumbers will eject their internal organs via their anus.\n11. Looking Down On Us\nAt 18 feet long, the king cobra is the largest venomous snake in the world and can raise itself up to 6 feet off the ground, enough to tower over most humans.\n10.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Loxodonta africana (African bush elephant) - Animal Diversity Web", "url": "https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Loxodonta_africana/", "text": "Geographic Range The range of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) is patchily distributed across central and southern Africa in the Ethiopian Region. Remnant populations exist as far northwest as Guinea-Bissau and as far northeast as Ethiopia. Disjunct populations exist southward into northern South Africa, and include contiguous populations in Gabon, Tanzania, Botswana, and Zambia. Once present in Burundi, Gambia, and Mauritania, they've now been extirpated from those countries. These elephants were extirpated from Swaziland, as well, but have been re-introduced here in recent years. (Blanc, 2008; Laursen and Bekoff, 1978; Thomas, et al., 2008) Biogeographic Regions\nethiopian native\nPhysical Description Currently, African elephants are the largest terrestrial organism. Female elephants can range from 2,000 to 3,500kg in mass and stand 2.2 to 2.6m at shoulder height. Male elephants are larger, ranging from 4,500 to 6,100kg in mass and standing 3.2 to 4m at shoulder height. Distinguishing characteristics between the sexes include head shape, width of forehead, saddle-back vs straight back, and tusk size. Males are broader with a curvy build. Both sexes have two thick, ivory tusks which are curved and can reach up to 350 cm in length. African elephants have muscular trunks that are able to grab objects and can be used for breathing purposes. They can grab objects due to the unique shape at the end of the trunk. Their sizable ears are triangular and can help keep them cool in the hot, summer months. African elephants have creased, gray skin covered with papillae. The thick (up to 30 mm), immobile skin covers the majority of the body, while bumpy skin covers areas that require a lot of movement. Smooth skin can be found on delicate areas of the body. Hair that varies in color, length, and thickness can be found along the body. Hair that grows along the back and tail is flattened dark hair that can grow to 0.80 m in length. Hair around the eyes is long in order to prevent foreign objects from entering the eyes. Calves have different hair coloring and texture. Their hair is softer with a lighter tone such as a red or brown. The dental formula for African elephants is i 1/0, c 0/0, p 3/3, m 3/3. At birth, calves do not have tusks but instead have temporary premaxillary incisors. These incisors are replaced at about a year of age with incisors that will ultimately form the tusks. Adult African elephants have lophodont dentition, with 6 molars that grow and move forward, like on a conveyor belt. They are worn down, lost, and replaced throughout their lives. Once the sixth set of molars is worn down, there are no additional teeth to replace them and the elephant is not able to process forage.

This is done by a scent in female urine and genital area. During the courtship process, bulls approach females and attempts to use their trunk to stroke her. Bulls will put up a fight in order to mate, by chasing the females if they retreat. When females stop retreating, they will join the bulls in stroking each other with their trunks. The courtship continues by females surrendering their hindquarters to the males. Bulls then mount the females to begin mating. The males will thrust repeatedly into the females for up to 2 mins. While females are in an estrus state, they may mate with several different bulls, and are considered polygynandrous. They are cooperative breeders, in which females have help raising young by other members of the family or \"clan.\" (Laursen and Bekoff, 1978; Poole, et al., 2007) Mating System\npolygynandrous (promiscuous)\ncooperative breeder African elephants are viviparous animals, meaning that they birth their young live. They breed year-round with no seasonal differences. The number of offspring is usually limited to one for each birthing period but in rare cases, twins may be born. They breed once every 3-9 years, and will give birth to an average of four calves in their lifetime. The gestation period is about 22 months but is strongly influenced by environmental factors. The gestation period may be shorter if the environmental factors are favorable for newborns survival. Newborn African elephants will weigh between 90-120 kg, with 100 kg being the average birth weight. Offspring are completely dependent on their mother's milk until they are weaned at four months, but continue to occasionally drink their mother's milk for up to three years. Young African elephants will gain their full independence around eight years of age. Sexual maturity occurs at different ages for males and females. Males will reach sexual maturity around 20 years of age, while females will reach sexual maturity around 11 years of age.

When female elephants give birth, they will move away from the herd in order to allow space for the offspring. When they return, all members of the herd will inspect the new elephant thoroughly. Until young elephants are around 4 years of age, they will closely follow their mother. During this time, mothers will feed their young through breast milk and help them move around obstacles. Until young offspring are independent, around 8 years of age, they will depend on the rest of the herd to teach them how to use their trunks, forage for food, and move around tough obstacles. Maternal position only affects the young if the mother is the leader of the herd, in which case, the young will be the next leader of the herd.

Their regular pace is 6 km/hour but, they can reach speeds of up to 24 km/hour when running. How much they travel each day depends on the amount of resources in close proximity that they require; the average walking distance for African elephants is around 10 km a day. Before African elephant populations were constricted to large reservations for protection, they migrated hundreds of kilometers seasonally, from high to low altitudes and vice versa. African elephants are active animals for the majority of time in a 24-hour period, due to the amount of food they must consume each day. They are dormant in the early morning hours with an additional sleep midday for a total of 4 hours of sleep every day. During this time they scavenge for food and groom themselves. Grooming consist of African elephants using their trunks to cover themselves with mud or water, and the process helps them maintain hydration. Female African elephants are social animals that live in herds of 6 to 70 members. These herds have a matriarchal order, and consist of females (cows) and their young. The alpha elephant in these herds tends to be the biggest and most dominant. Male African elephants (bulls) tend to only live within a herd if they are not old enough to go out on their own or for mating purposes. Bulls will live a life in solitary or with a few other bulls. (Greco, et al., 2016; Laursen and Bekoff, 1978; Lee and Moss, 2012; Miller, et al., 2016; Thouless, 1996) Key Behaviors\nterricolous\ndiurnal\nnocturnal\nmotile\nnomadic\nsocial\ncolonial\ndominance hierarchies Home Range If enough essential resources are present African elephants will move as little as 1.5 Km a day. When resources are scarce, African elephants may travel as much as 40 km a day. Thouless (1996) reported that African elephants' home range can vary from 102 to 5527 km within a period of 25 months. (Miller, et al., 2016)\nCommunication and Perception African elephants communicate acoustically with others of their species. Many of their calls are low frequency calls of ca. 20Hz. They can make a variety of calls including rumble, trumpet, snort, roar, bark, and grunt. Soltis (2010) reports 3 other calls made by these elephants. They include \"rev, croak, and chuff.\" A trumpet, roar, or growl could show signs of aggression. A \"soft chirp\" shows submission or intimidation. Infant elephants will gurgle during play and squeal when frightened. The African elephants can hear one of these calls from over 2km away. They will make these calls to warn or gather others in their herd or to signal they are ready to mate. African elephants watch and listen to their surrounding environment for signs of something amiss. They communicate visually by using their trunks or ears to signal other herd members. Tactile communication is between a mother and her child or two elephants trying to mate. Forms of chemical communication along with scent marking among African elephants is done by males who are mating with the females in a clan. Around the clan the males will mark trees or bushes with their tusks or by secreting a substance onto the bush. (Laursen and Bekoff, 1978; O\u2019Connell-Rodwell, et al., 2006; Soltis, 2010) Communication Channels\nvisual\nacoustic\nchemical Other Communication Modes\nscent marks Perception Channels\nvisual\ntactile\nacoustic\nchemical\nFood Habits African elephants have a herbivorous diet consisting of tree foliage, fruits, herbs, grasses, and wood including roots, twigs, and bark. Their source of fiber comes from chewing on bark but not digesting the bark itself. In order to obtain bark or roots, African elephants will overturn a tree to for easier access. Using their trunks as a temporary container or holding, African elephants use their trunks to gather water and shoot it into their mouths. African elephants will feed continuously throughout the day, eating opportunistically. They must consume around 50 gallons of water everyday in order to stay hydrated. African elephants are both browsers and grazers. Depending on the season and location, herds may depend more on one or the other feeding technique. Typically during the wet seasons, African elephants are more particular about they consume. During this season, they are more likely to forage on grasses. However, during the dry seasons when food is less abundant, they will be more flexible with what they consume. During both seasons, African elephants tend to pick food sources that are high in nutritional content. (Archie, et al., 2006; Chafota and Owen-Smith, 2012; Codron, et al., 2006; Codron, et al., 2013; Laursen and Bekoff, 1978) Primary Diet\nherbivore folivore frugivore lignivore\nPlant Foods\nleaves\nroots and tubers\nwood, bark, or stems\nfruit\nEconomic Importance for Humans: Positive African elephants are used for a variety of reasons that benefit humans, often involving the killing of these elephants. African elephants can simply be used as large sport hunting for trophies or they can be hunted for their tusks, ears, feet, and meat. Because their tusks are made of ivory, they have been used for numerous reasons such as billiard balls, dice, piano keys, and most commonly, decorative carvings. Ivory can be sold for a high price, allowing someone to live off the price of a few pounds. Their large ears are converted into leather to make purses. Their feet can be preserved and made into furniture. However, given the conservation status of African elephants, these uses of elephant parts are difficult to justify. (Laursen and Bekoff, 1978; Wittemyer, 2011; Gao and Clark, 2014; Laursen and Bekoff, 1978; Wittemyer, 2011) Positive Impacts\nfood\nbody parts are source of valuable material\nEconomic Importance for Humans: Negative African elephants do not have many negative economic impacts on humans. African elephants destroy vegetation by using it as a food source or by knocking it down due to their massive size. If elephants are raiding crops for food and people come to stop them, the elephants might chase down the people and kill them. (Gadd, 2005; Laursen and Bekoff, 1978; Thomas, et al., 2008) Negative Impacts\ninjures humans\nConservation Status According to the IUCN Red List, African elephants are listed as a \"Vulnerable\" species. CITES appendices list African elephants in both Appendix I and Appendix II. African elephants in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe are listed in Appendix II, while African elephants in other countries are listed in Appendix I. Appendix I means the species is in danger of extinction. This Appendix protects the species by making international trade illegal when dealing with African elephants. Appendix II states that the species is not endangered, but could become so if poaching is not regulated. The US Federal List have listed African elephants as a \"Threatened\" species. The reason some elephant populations are in decline in certain countries is because hunting is legal in these countries. However, illegal poaching that is not prosecuted has the same negative impact. Elephants are sold and bought legally or illegally for their hides, fur, tusks, and meat. Despite an international ban on the sale of ivory since 1989, trade in illegal ivory doubled from 2007-2014. Organized crime combined with corrupt government officials makes it increasingly difficult to punish offenders. Another reason for the decline of African elephants is that they are losing their habitats due to human development and expansion. In order to combat further decline of African elephants, some populations have been moved to protected areas to prevent poaching. However, about 70% of the current range is unprotected lands. So, threats are on-going. Some management efforts have been successful at increasing local populations, so much so that contraception or trap-and-relocate programs had to be implemented to sustain the habitat. Another hardship is that herds are treated differently across political boundaries - the legality of hunting, the locals' attitudes towards elephants, and the permissability of or non-action to combat illegal poaching all affect the populations. Larger-scale conservation plans that cross country boundaries may address some of these issues.

In dune areas vegetation is also sparse and conditions are dry. This is because sand does not hold water well so little is available to plants. In dunes near seas and oceans this is compounded by the influence of salt in the air and soil.

Contunico \u00a9 ZDF Enterprises GmbH, Mainz See all videos for this article\nelephant shrew, (order Macroscelidea), also called sengi, any of approximately 20 species of rat-sized African mammals named for their long, tapered, and flexible snout (proboscis). All have slim bodies, slender limbs, and very long hind legs and feet. Although they resemble shrews, they are not insectivores but constitute the mammalian order Macroscelidea.\nElephant shrews are terrestrial and are active during the day. Their ears and eyes are large, and, when alarmed, they run on their toes swiftly along paths they construct and maintain, sometimes leaping over obstacles. When foraging, they move along the pathways, using their paws and the constantly moving proboscis to turn over leaf litter and soil in search of prey, which consists of small insects (especially ants and termites), other arthropods, and earthworms. Gestation lasts two months, and litters contain one or two well-developed young.\nCheckered elephant shrews (Rhynchocyon cirnei) weigh about half a kilogram (1.1 pounds), with a body 23 to 31 cm (9 to 12 inches) long and a slightly shorter tail (18 to 25 cm). The fur is short, stiff, and glossy. Upperparts may be patterned with chestnut and buff; they may be orange on the forequarters, changing to dark red and then black on the rump, or uniformly dark amber with a shiny golden rump. The bicoloured tail is finely haired and appears bare. These elegant long-legged animals are similar in body form to small forest antelopes (see dik-dik; duiker). They live only in East Africa, where they inhabit tropical forests (including deciduous lowland and montane forests) with well-drained soils and carpets of leaf litter. Nests are made of dry leaves on the open forest floor.\nThe largest species, the giant elephant shrew (R. udzungwensis), weighs about 0.7 kg (1.5 pounds) and inhabits two forested areas within the Udzungwa Mountains of Tanzania.\nThe smaller species weigh 30 to 280 grams, with bodies 9 to 22 cm long and shorter tails of 8 to 18 cm. The soft, dense fur ranges from grayish brown to dark brown, in tones usually matching the soil where they live. They are found in the uplands of southern, eastern, and extreme northwestern Africa, inhabiting dry forests and scrub, savannas, open country covered by sparse shrubs or grass, semiarid and rocky habitats, and sandy, sparsely vegetated plains. They rest and den in burrows, rock crevices, depressions in the ground, and termite mounds, beneath fallen tree trunks, among tree roots, or in dense underbrush.\nIn addition to the checkered elephant shrews, the family Macroscelididae also includes the long-eared elephant shrews (genus Elephantulus), the round-eared sengis (Macroscelides proboscideus, M. flavicaudatus, and M. micus), and the four-toed elephant shrew (Petrodromus tetradactylus); those three genera are classified together in a subfamily separate from Rhynchocyon. Macroscelididae is the only family in the order Macroscelidea. There are eight extinct genera, some of which had teeth similar to antelopes\u2019 and were probably herbivores. The evolutionary history of elephant shrews is confined to Africa and dates to the Late Eocene (41.3 to 33.9 million years ago). Their closest relatives were thought to be tree shrews and insectivores, but since the 1950s elephant shrews have been recognized as a distinct order. They are possibly related to rabbits and rodents, although molecular data suggest that they may be more closely related to an ancient group that gave rise to the aardvarks, elephants, hyraxes, and sirenians."}

The smaller, darker forest elephant, with straight tusks, lives in the equatorial forests of Central and West Africa.\nNow, for the first time, scientists have separately evaluated how the two are faring\u2014and the findings are grim.\nSavanna elephants are endangered and forest elephants are critically endangered, according to an official assessment released today by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) for its Red List of Threatened Species, the world\u2019s most comprehensive inventory of extinction risk.\nStunning Pictures of Elephants Please be respectful of copyright.

Here, a family enjoys time together at Kenya\u2019s Samburu National Reserve.</p>\n\u201cFor both species, poaching is still the biggest driver of decline,\u201d says Kathleen Gobush, leader of the new assessments and a member of the IUCN\u2019s Elephant Specialist Group, a group of technical experts focusing on conservation and management of elephants.\n\u201cThese assessments hopefully will garner renewed attention for the world to double down on stopping the killing, trafficking, and demand for ivory.\u201d\nEvidence has been building since the early 2000s that forest and savanna elephants should be split taxonomically into two species. In 2008, when the IUCN issued its last assessment of African elephants, it still considered them a single species, then described as vulnerable to extinction. In the years since, scientists came to recognize that forest and savanna elephants are distinct from each other.\nSince the 2008 assessment, an elephant poaching crisis has also gripped Africa. In 2016, researchers reported in the journal PeerJ that between 2007 and 2014, savanna elephants declined by 30 percent in 18 African countries. A 2013 report in PLOS ONE found that forest elephant populations had plummeted by 62 percent in less than a decade.\nPoaching peaked in 2011 and since has eased in some places, notably in parts of East Africa. But it persists and is worsening in other regions, especially in Central and West Africa. Meanwhile, elephant habitat continues to be degraded by or lost to human activity.\n\u201cThe potential positive conservation impact of splitting forest and savanna elephants into separate species cannot be overstated,\u201d says Bas Huijbregts, the African species director at the World Wildlife Fund, who was not involved with the new assessment. \u201cChallenges to both species are very different, as are the pathways to their recovery.\u201d\nIn particular, the new report should attract more attention to forest elephants. Less visible and easily monitored than savanna elephants, they tend to be overlooked by governments and donors, and their needs are overshadowed by those of their larger cousins, Gobush says. (See National Geographic\u2019s stunning elephant pictures.)\nBureaucratically, the two species have mostly continued to be grouped together, which can hinder conservation efforts for both, says Sue Lieberman, vice president of international policy at the Wildlife Conservation Society, based in New York City. \u201cFrom a legal or regulatory perspective, governments need to catch up.\u201d\nA best guess\nTo arrive at the new findings, Gobush and her colleagues assessed all available data for both species across hundreds of field sites, dating back to the 1960s for savanna elephants and the 1970s for forest elephants.\nUsing those data, they built a statistical model to estimate population reductions over time. What came to light was that savanna elephants have declined by more than 50 percent over three generations (75 years), tipping them into the endangered category. Longer-lived forest elephant numbers have fallen by more than 80 percent over three generations (93 years), making them critically endangered.\nThe IUCN relies on a variety of factors to determine an animal\u2019s conservation status, such as how much its numbers and range have dwindled.\n\u201cAt this point, there can be no doubt that poaching and habitat loss have devastated populations of elephants all across Africa,\u201d says Scott Schlossberg, a data analyst at Elephants Without Borders, a Botswana-based nonprofit, who was not involved with the new assessment. \u201cA few elephant populations are doing well, but the long-term trends for the continent as a whole are poor.\u201d (Read how poaching is on the rise in Botswana.)\n4:42\nIf anything, the IUCN findings likely are underestimates because of the scarcity of quantitative data about past elephant populations across the continent, says Iain Douglas-Hamilton, founder of Save the Elephants, a nonprofit based in Kenya, who also was not involved with the new evaluation. \u201cThe current assessment isn\u2019t absolute and doesn\u2019t pretend to be,\u201d adds Douglas-Hamilton, a National Geographic Explorer. \u201cIt\u2019s a best guess of trends.\u201d\nDouglas-Hamilton says elephants can bounce back if given the chance. \u201cThey can go from high slaughter and almost destruction to strict protection and recovery,\u201d he says.\nKenya\u2019s Tsavo National Park provides an example. Poaching reduced its savanna elephants from an estimated 40,000 in the 1970s to about 6,500 in 1988. Today, elephant numbers in the park have rebounded to about 17,000, a response to anti-poaching measures.\nIvory wars\nRebuilding elephant populations requires protecting their habitat as well as continuing to clamp down on poaching and ivory trafficking, Schlossberg says. The U.S., China, U.K. and many other countries have closed their legal domestic ivory markets.\n\u201cAllowing new ivory sales could jeopardize the progress that has been made recently in fighting ivory trafficking,\u201d Schlossberg says. (Learn how human suffering is linked to poaching.)\nAmong countries that have not closed their legal ivory markets, Japan now has the world\u2019s largest, and Japanese carvers prefer ivory from forest elephants.\nThat forest elephants are now recognized as critically endangered only emphasizes the heavy toll poaching for ivory continues to extract, Lieberman says.\n\u201cAll countries that still allow domestic ivory markets, including Japan, need to close their markets once and for all.\u201d"}

When people speak of the American bison and the American buffalo they refer to the same animal.\nThere is a European bison as well, that, although separated by oceans, looks very much like the American bison or buffalo, and is basically considered to be the same animal.\nThe Old World \"buffaloes\" are the Cape buffalo of Africa, and the domesticated water buffalo of Asia. The most obvious difference is that they lack the thick, woolly fur of the American buffalo, and are usually black in color.\nThe horn shape is different as well, with the Old World buffaloes having longer horns that curve back in towards each other.\nFinally, all of these animals are bovines from the subfamily bovinae, which are all basically cow-like animals with cloven hooves and multi-chambered stomachs.\nThe American buffalo once numbered over 65 million strong across almost the entire continent of North America. By the end of the 1800's their numbers were reduced to a few hundred.\nNow, with organized conservation efforts, the number of wild bison roaming the open range is about 16,000, and there are close to 500,000 individuals living in large, privately owned herds.\nnative americans and the american buffalo\nThe American bison or American buffalo once roamed the continent of North America in such mass, that a galloping herd would leave a black swathe of trodden soil in its wake.\nNative people, particularly the Dakota, Lakota and Nakota Sioux, were indebted to the buffalo for their very lifestyle. These tribes followed the buffalo and planned each year around the migrating herds.\nThey hunted buffalo in several fascinating ways.\nBefore they had horses, they would drape themselves in wolf hides and crawl close enough to use a bow and arrow. This technique worked only with herds of \"bachelor\" males who did not fear wolves. The Indians found they could approach within yards of the herd when wearing wolf skins which hid their scent, where the buffalo would flee if they caught the scent of the Indians approaching. Herds with females and youngsters were wary of wolves and could not be hunted with this technique.\nIndians in the Dakotas employed a very dramatic hunting style, which involved stampeding a buffalo herd over a cliff. This was called a \"buffalo jump\" and there is a particular site in South Dakota where thousands of buffalo bones and hundreds of Indian arrowheads can be found at the foot of a steep cliff.\nThe native Americans had great respect for the buffalo, and some believed in a deity with the head of a buffalo called Tatanka. The word was also used as the word for buffalo in many Sioux native American societies.\nIn the mid 1800's the United States Government attempted to wipe out the buffalo, not because they wanted to be rid of buffalo, but because they wanted to wipe out the Indians.\nBecause of the plains Indians dependency on the buffalo for their survival, the animals were hunted down by the U.S. Cavalry in numbers so great that the army could not use all the meat and hides.\nThey literally burned thousands of carcasses after slaughtering them, so that they could not be utilized.\nIn the Indian culture, almost every part of the precious animal was harvested and put to use. Hides for clothing and tepees, bones for tools, each edible part used for different recipes and tonics. The tongues, eyes, horns and hooves all put to use.\nFor the Native American, the sight of their precious buffalo slaughtered and burned, must have been simply horrible..\nKinder hearts prevailed in the last years of that century, and the preservation of the species can literally be traced to several small groups of individuals moved to areas of the country where they would be protected. - Buffalo Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

The herd is led by a wise matriarch who chooses grazing areas and napping sites and schedules throughout most of the year.\nWithin the herd are females and their youngsters, the females having a well-defined hierarchy which is helpful for cooperation and keeping the peace.\nMales live in smaller groups called \"bachelor herds\" and occasionally will move about in solitary until the mating season. In July, females begin to come into season and the males will start their attempts to attract willing females.\nDominant males will bellow, charge and head- but other males to keep them away from their females. These battles are not generally serious and the less aggressive or smaller male will simply find another female to tend or wait till later in the season.\nMating season will last until September, and then the males will recede back into their own herds. Males have nothing to do with the rearing of calves.\nThe calves are born a much lighter color than the adults. They have thick wool, and small tabs on their heads called \"buttons\" where their horns will soon start to grow. The females raise their calves in their maternal herd where the excitable youngsters frolic together in little \"kindergartens\" that are watched over by all the mothers.\nWhen calves are young, they may fall prey to bears or mountain lions, but wolf packs pose the greatest danger.\nWolf packs are particularly skilled at hunting buffalo, and use their classic \"tag-team\" hunting approach to run the herd until the weakest fall behind.\nThe gift of speed and the ability to run is critical to the survival of the young buffalo, and newborns are up and running with the herd within 20 minutes of birth.\nwhy aren't there domestic buffalo?\nThe buffalo is basically a very large cow - a ruminant which has a four-part stomach for breaking down food that would be undigestable by many other creatures.\nIt spends long hours chewing and re-chewing the grass of the plains. With their short necks they only can bend their head down and eat comfortably to a height of about six inches, and by leaving that amount of grass, the plant survives and regenerates.\nBuffalo usually drink by walking into the stream or river till they can comfortably reach the water.\nTheir incredibly plush fur sloughs off in the summertime in sheets, in a process, called \"moulting\", which leaves mounds of discarded hair throughout the valley.\nAttempts to domesticate the buffalo have failed miserably, and often resulted in injuries, because along with its immense size, the buffalo has a wild heart and has been described by those who tried, as being an animal that simply can't be tamed.\nEven buffalo cows raised in captivity refuse to be milked.\nhuge bison\na few more buffalo facts\nThe American bison and the American buffalo are the same animal\nThe name \"bison\" is more commonly accepted and is the name of the animals zoological genus and zoological species\nThere were once an estimated 65 million buffalo roaming free in North America\nThe buffalo is the largest land animal in the New World\nNovember 2nd is National Bison Day!\nin the 1800's the buffalo was almost hunted to extinction by the U.S. Government in an attempt to starve out the Native Americans\nBoth male and female buffalo have horns\nThe European bison lives in Poland and looks almost exactly like the American bison - Buffalo Facts!\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Artiodactyla\nFamily Bovidae\nSubfamily Bovinae\nGenus Bison\nSpecies bison\nBuffalo Facts - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT bull cow calf group GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD herd North America plains,\nsome forest grass ENEMIES ENDANGERED TOP SPEED GENDER DIFFERENCE wolves threatened 37 mph both have horns AVG.

When used as props for tourist photos, they are constantly surrounded by noise and poorly handled by guides and tourists alike.\nWorld Animal Protection works around the globe to protect sloths and other wild animals--like elephants, otters, and tigers--and keep them in their natural habitats and free from the cruelty of the animal entertainment industry and global wildlife trade.\nRead on to learn more about sloths and why they belong in the wild.\n10 Interesting Facts About Sloths\n1. It takes two\nFound in Central and South America, sloths call the tall trees their home, as their long claws make it difficult for them to walk on the ground. There are two types of sloths, two-toed and three-toed. However, this can get confusing as both types have three claws, or \u2018toes,\u2019 on their hind limbs. In reality, the \u2018two-toed\u2019 sloth should really be called the \u2018two-fingered\u2019 sloth, as the difference between both can be found on their front limbs.\n2. Big brother\nThe modern sloth is usually around the size of a medium-sized dog. But ancient sloths of years ago, known as \u2018Megatherium,\u2019 could grow as large as an Asian elephant! These giant sloths sometimes featured areas of small bone discs that would act as \u2018armor plating\u2019 for protection. They became extinct around 10,000 years ago.\nLucky is a young adult three-toed sloth who resides at the AIUNAU sanctuary in Columbia after being rescued from captivity.\n3. Natural camouflage\nSloths possess a symbiotic relationship with the algae that grows on their fur. While the sloth provides the algae with shelter and water (as sloth fur is highly absorbent), the algae provide the sloth with camouflage and extra nutrients through the sloth\u2019s skin.\n4. Hanging around\nSloths can spend 90% of their lives hanging upside down thanks to their impressive biology. Studies show this is possible because their organs are attached to their rib cage, so they don\u2019t weigh down on their lungs. Unlike us, a sloth can hang upside down without affecting their breathing.\nPrincesa is an inquisitive two-toed sloth, also looked after at the AIUNAU sanctuary in Colombia.\n5. A green diet\nA sloth\u2019s diet consists mainly of buds, leaves, and tender shoots. They have a multi-compartment stomach that allows them to effectively digest the tough cellulose that they eat. This is a slow process, taking 30 days to digest one leaf!\n6. Looking at you\nSloths have extra vertebrae at the base of their neck, allowing them to turn their head on a 270\u00b0 axis. They can obtain an almost 360\u00b0 view of their surroundings, which proves to be a highly beneficial defense mechanism. This unique feature makes sloths stand out from other mammals whose bone structures do not allow for this flexibility.\nA wild sloth in the Sobrenia National Park in Panama.\n7. Doing the lengths\nAlthough sloths have long claws that make walking on land difficult, they can move up to three times faster when they swim \u2013 surprising for such a typically slow-moving animal! They can also hold their breath for an impressive 40 minutes, suppressing their metabolism to make their heart rate a third of its average speed.\n8. Taking it slow\nThe sloth\u2019s nature allows them to conserve energy, moving slower than any other mammal. This modest pace means that sloths generally travel no more than 125 feet (38 meters) in a single day, and on the rare occasion that they find themselves at ground level, they crawl only 1 foot (30 cm) per minute.\nA wild infant sloth in the Sobrenia National Park in Panama.\n9. Beauty sleep\nThe Greek goddess Aergia was the ancient personification of the sloth and was known to sleep often. Sloths in the wild sleep as much as humans, at around 8-9 hours a day.\n10. A photo smile\nThe facial structure of a sloth gives the appearance that they are constantly smiling \u2013 even if they\u2019re experiencing pain, stress, or anxiety. When sloths are used as a photo prop for wildlife selfies, tourists may accidentally confuse this feature for happiness or contentment.\nHelp keep sloths in their natural habitat\nOur study found that the most common species used for selfies in the Amazon are sloths, pink river dolphins, anacondas, and caiman \u2013 with sloths being used the most.\nIn the wild, sloths typically live quiet, sleepy lives. When used as props for tourist photos, they are constantly surrounded by noise and poorly handled by guides and tourists alike. Research shows that sloths are frequently held by their claws or arms with no support, causing them to experience high levels of fear and stress.\nWhen traveling, take pictures of sloths and other wild animals from a distance and when they are in their natural habitat. Do not interact with them, and say no to anyone who offers you to hold a sloth for a photo. Help protect sloths by signing the Wildlife Selfie Code for more tips to keep wildlife where they belong: in the wild. Sloths do not want a hug-- they want to survive.\nAct Now"}

We are, after all, animals ourselves. Beyond that, we share the planet with a remarkable diversity of other animals, we rely on animals, we learn from animals, and we even befriend animals. But do you know the finer points of what makes one organism an animal and another organism something else, such as a plant or a bacterium or a fungus? Below, you'll find out more about animals and why they are unlike the other lifeforms that populate our planet .\n01 of 10 The First Animals Appeared About 600 Million Years Ago Fossil of Dickinsonia costar, an early animal that was part of the Ediacaran biota, primitive animals that lived during the Precambrian Period. De Agostini Picture Library / Getty Images. The oldest evidence of life dates back some 3.8 billion years. The earliest fossils are of ancient organisms called stromatolites. Stromatolites were not animals\u2014animals would not appear for another 3.2 billion years. It was during the late Precambrian that the first animals appear in the fossil record. Among the earliest animals are those of the Ediacara biota, an assortment of tubular and frond-shaped creatures that lived between 635 and 543 million years ago. The Ediacara biota appears to have vanished by the end of the Precambrian.\n02 of 10 Animals Rely on Other Organisms for Food and Energy A frog leaps out of the water in the hopes of making a meal out of an insect. Shikheigoh / Getty Images Animals need the energy to power all aspects of their lives including their growth, development, movement, metabolism, and reproduction. Unlike plants, animals are not capable of transforming sunlight into energy. Instead, animals are heterotrophs, which means they cannot produce their own food and must instead ingest plants and other organisms as a way to get the carbon and energy they need to live.\n03 of 10 Animals Are Capable of Movement Tigers, like all cats, are animals that exhibit highly developed movement skills. Gary Vestal / Getty Images Unlike plants, which are fixed to the substrate in which they grow, most animals are motile (capable of movement) during some or all of their life cycle. For many animals, the ability to move is obvious: fish swim, birds fly, mammals scamper, climb, run, and mosey. But for some animals, the movement is subtle or restricted to a short period of their life. Such animals are described as being sessile. Sponges, for example, are sedentary for most of their life cycle but do spend their larval stage as free-swimming animals. Additionally, it has been shown that some species of sponges can move at a very slow rate (a few millimeters per day). Examples of other sessile animals that move only very minimally include barnacles and corals.\n04 of 10 All Animals Are Multicellular Eukaryotes William Rhamey / Getty Images. All animals have bodies that consist of multiple cells\u2014in other words, they are multicellular. In addition to being multicellular, animals are also eukaryotes\u2014their bodies are composed of eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells are complex cells, inside which internal structures such as the nucleus and the various organelles are enclosed in their own membranes. The DNA in a eukaryotic cell is linear and it is organized into chromosomes. With the exception of the sponges (the simplest of all animals), animal cells are organized into tissues that perform different functions. Animal tissues include connective tissue, muscle tissue, epithelial tissue, and nervous tissue.\n05 of 10 Animals Have Diversified Into Millions of Different Species M.M. Sweet / Getty Images The evolution of animals, since their first appearance 600 million years ago, has resulted in an extraordinary number and diversity of lifeforms. As a result, animals have evolved many different forms as well as a multitude of ways of moving, obtaining food, and sensing their environment. Throughout the course of animal evolution, the numbers of animal groups and species have increased and, at times, decreased. Today, scientists estimate that there are more than 3 million living species.\n06 of 10 The Cambrian Explosion Was a Critical Time for Animals Daniel Daz Santana / EyeEm / Getty Images The Cambrian Explosion (570 to 530 million years ago) was a time when the rate of diversification of animals was both remarkable and rapid. During the Cambrian Explosion, early organisms evolved into many different and more complex forms. During this time period, nearly all of the basic animal body plans developed, body plans that are still present today.\n07 of 10 Sponges Are the Simplest of All Animals Borut Furlan / Getty Images Sponges are the simplest of all animals. Like other animals, sponges are multicellular, but it is where the similarities end. Sponges lack the specialized tissues that are present in all other animals. The body of a sponge consists of cells that are embedded within a matrix. Tiny spiny proteins called spicules are scattered throughout this matrix and form a support structure for the sponge. Sponges have many small pores and channels distributed throughout their body that serve as a filter-feeding system and enables them to sift food from the water current. Sponges diverged from all other animal groups early in the evolution of animals.\n08 of 10 Most Animals Have Nerve and Muscle Cells Sijanto / Getty Images All animals with the exception of the sponges have specialized cells in their bodies called neurons. Neurons, also called nerve cells, send electrical signals to other cells. Neurons transmit and interpret a wide range of information such as the animal's well being, movement, environment, and orientation. In vertebrates, neurons are the building blocks of an advanced nervous system that includes the animal's sensory system, brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. Invertebrates have nervous systems that are made up of fewer neurons than those of vertebrates, but this does not mean the nervous systems of invertebrates are simplistic. Invertebrate nervous systems are efficient and highly successful at solving the problems of survival these animals face.\n09 of 10 Most Animals Are Symmetrical Paul Kay / Getty Images Most animals, with the exception of sponges, are symmetrical. There are different forms of symmetry in various animal groups. Radial symmetry, present in cnidarians such as sea urchins, and also in some species of sponges, is a type of symmetry in which the animal's body can be divided into similar halves by applying more than two planes that pass through the length of the animal's body. Animals that exhibit radial symmetry are disk-shaped, tube-like or bowl-like in structure. Echinoderms such as sea stars exhibit a five-point radial symmetry called pentaradial symmetry. Bilateral symmetry is another type of symmetry present in many animals. Bilateral symmetry is a type of symmetry in which the animal's body can be divided along a sagittal plane (a vertical plane that extends from head to posterior and divides the animal's body into a right and left half)."}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Six facts about elephant families - The Independent", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/six-facts-about-elephant-families-9015298.html", "text": "Elephants display complex social and emotional behaviour, and are said to value their families more than most animals.\n1. Females are the boss\nElephant families have a matriarchal head, meaning that an older, experienced lady elephant leads the herd. A family usually consist of a mother, her sisters, daughters their babies (calves). Occasionally, non-related elephants join to form families. Female family units range from three to twenty five elephants.\nSometimes herds of female elephants combine with groups of bull elephants to form larger clans. Herd aggregations of 500 to 1000 elephants have been recorded around watering holes and other sources of food and water. Herd aggregation has also been documented in areas where poaching is rampant.\n2. They babysit\nFemale elephants (cows) help each look after each other\u2019s calves. Babysitting other female\u2019s calves is important for elephant development; young females learn how to look after the young, and the calves are shown how it\u2019s done. The survival rate of a calf greatly increases when more females are present and willing take care of it.\n3. They bond\nElephants are known to develop strong, intimate bonds between friends and family members. There have been reports of elephants forming lifelong friendships with each other, and they even mourn the death of their loved ones. Mother elephants have been seen grieving over stillborn calves, and some elephants have even been spotted returning to, and lingering near, spots where their friends and family members died.\n4. They walk in a single file\nDisney wasn\u2019t lying in The Jungle Book \u2013 elephants actually do actually walk in single file when they on the move, for instance while in search of food and water. The calves will sometimes hold on to their mother\u2019s tails with their trunks to keep up, while other female elephants surround them to protect them from danger.\n5. Guys hang out in groups, too\nAdult male elephants live a predominantly nomadic and solitary life. When a male elephant (bull) reaches puberty, around 12 to 15 years of age, he will gradually become more independent of his family until he breaks away completely, to either roam alone or find a loosely-knit group of male elephants to join.\nHerds of bulls have a hierarchal structure, with the strongest and most experienced elephants leading and protecting the group. When a bull is ready to mate he will pursue an elephant family until he selects a female and she accepts his advances. Once he has mated with a cow, he\u2019ll either return to his herd or resume his solitary existence, leaving the cow to rear the calf by herself.\n6. Herds can separate\nAlthough they tend to be close, an elephant family can split. This decision is influenced by ecological factors, such as the availability of food and water in the area, and social factors, such as how well the elephants get on, the size of the group or the death of a matriarch. As such, different herds living over vast terrain can be interrelated. These \u2018bond groups\u2019 keep in touch with each other through rumbling calls and usually stay within a mile of each other."}

And what are these unique tools that help these desert animals survive?\nWell the adaptions of desert animals isn't as simple as handling the extreme heat, because although extreme temperatures occur, the definition of a desert is an environment with a lack of precipitation, a lack of water, not high temperatures. In fact, it can get very cold in the desert - and it can even snow!\nHere are just some of the incredible animals that live in the desert, and call places like the Mojave, the Sahara and the Gobi their home...\ncheck out our youtube channel!\nwhat is a desert?\nThe word \"desert\" may make you think of sand dunes and excruciating heat, but only about 1/4 of the world's deserts are covered in sand, and parts of Antarctica engulfed in freezing ice and snow actually qualify as desert. The factor that truly determines a desert is how dry it is, not how hot it is.\nThere are two common explanations for what a desert is. The most common is an area that receives less than 10 inches of rain annually.\nThe other, and perhaps more technical and scientifically accepted explanation of what a desert is, involves evaporation. According to the Koppen system of climate classification, a desert is any area where more water is lost through evaporation than is gained through precipitation.\nUltimately, the amount of rain or snow varies greatly in deserts.\nSome, like the Chihuahuan desert, which makes up a large part of the South West United States and Northern Mexico, has a summer monsoon season of heavy rains, but the rest of the year is nearly completely dry.\nSome areas like Cairo, Eqypt have very meager rainfall scattered throughout the year, with slight, seasonal peaks and valleys.\nAnd some areas, like Dry Valleys, Antarctica, have not had any precipitation in about 2 million years.\nGenerally, low rainfall means limited growth potential for plant-life. Because there are less roots in the soil, the landscape becomes less permanent, and hills and dunes may be formed, moved and made to disappear by strong winds.\nAnother idea about deserts is that they are barren, and unable to support life, but actually many people and animals live and thrive in many desert environments, having adapted in various fascinating ways to their special home.\nAnd consider that human civilization was born in the deserts of the Middle East.\nDoes it snow in the desert?\nBactrian camels in the snow\nRemember, temperature is not the factor that decides whether a region is desert or not, and some of the coldest places on Earth are desert. So yes, it certainly does snow in the desert.\nIn fact, it snowed 3 years in a row in Saudi Arabia from 2013 to 2015. Some arctic deserts are so cold that snowfall hasn't melted in thousands of years, and one of the most famous of all desert animals the Bactrian camel, (the one with 2 humps!) is native to the mountains of the Gobi desert, where snow is fairly common.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Animals Of The Stone Age List With Pictures & Facts", "url": "https://www.activewild.com/animals-of-the-stone-age/", "text": "The animals of the Stone Age: list with pictures and facts.\nAnimals Of The Stone Age\nAnimals of the Stone Age include the cave bear, dire wolf, Glyptodon, marsupial lion, Mastodon, Smilodon and the woolly mammoth. Stone Age animals co-existed with early humans and their ancestors, who by the end of the Stone Age had spread across Eurasia and into The Americas.\nYou can find out more about these and other animals of the Stone Age in the list below.\nWhat Is The Stone Age?\nThe Stone Age is a period in history during which humans and their ancestors made and used stone tools. It began around 3.3 million years ago and ended between 5,000 and 2,000 years ago, depending on location (stone tool use began and ended at different times in different parts of the world).\nMuch of the Stone Age is included in the Pleistocene epoch, a time in the geologic time scale that began 2.58 million years ago and ended 11,700 years ago.\nGlacial Cycles\nThe climate of the Pleistocene epoch was dominated by glacial cycles. During glacial periods, much of the planet\u2019s northern and southern hemispheres were covered by ice sheets. These glacial periods were interspersed with warmer periods known as interglacials, during which the ice sheets would retreat.\nThe Ice Age\nThe last glacial period began 115,000 years ago and ended around 11,700 years ago. It is known as the Ice Age, although the name can also refer to the whole Pleistocene Epoch.\nExtinction Of Stone Age Animals\nThe animals in this list of Stone Age animals are all known or believed to have existed alongside humans and their ancestors.\nHunting by humans is one of the two main causes of extinction of stone-age animals, the other being a warming of Earth\u2019s climate that followed the end of the last glacial period, which occurred around 11,700 years ago.\nMany animals of the Stone Age had evolved to live in cold climates and were unable to survive the lengthy interglacial period that followed the end of the Ice Age.\nList Of Animals Of The Stone Age\nCastoroides (Giant Beaver)\nWhere found: North America\nCastoroides, also known as the giant beaver, was a bear-sized member of the beaver family Castoridae. It appeared in the late Pliocene and lived through most of the Pleistocene. Two species of giant beaver have been identified.\nThe largest giant beavers grew to around 2.5 m / 8.2 ft in body length. The incisor teeth of Castoroides were much longer than those of modern beavers, reaching around 6 in. / 15 cm in length. Its tail was also longer and thinner.\nThe giant beaver is thought to have shared the largely aquatic lifestyle of living beavers.\nCave Bear\nWhere found: Europe, Asia\nThe cave bear was a stone age relative of living brown bears, and a member of the bear family, Ursidae. Its scientific name is Ursus spelaeus. With a body length of up to 3 m / (9 ft 10 in), the cave bear was a similar size to the polar bear, the largest of the living bears. It was found in Europe and Asia.\nCave bear fossils have been found in caves, suggesting that the species lived and hibernated in caves (which is how the species got its name). The size and structure of its teeth suggests that its diet was mainly herbivorous.\nDeinotherium\nWhere found: Europe, Asia, Africa\nDeinotherium was a stone-age relative of today\u2019s elephants. Unlike todays\u2019 elephants, however, its tusks extended from the lower, rather than the upper jaw, and curved downwards. They were probably used to pull branches off of trees, or to dig in the ground for food.\nStanding over 4 m / 13.12 ft. tall, and weighing an estimated 14 tonnes / 15.43 short tons, the largest Deinotherium was larger than the African elephant \u2013 the largest living land animal.\nDire Wolf\nScientific name: Aenocyon dirus\nWhere found: The Americas, Asia\nThe dire wolf is one of the best-known stone-age animals. It appeared in the Late Pleistocene, and lived up to around 9,500 years ago.\nAlthough a similar size to today\u2019s gray wolf, the dire wolf was slightly heavier, suggesting a stockier body.\nThe dire wolf\u2019s teeth were larger than those of today\u2019s wolves, and its bite force more powerful than that of any living canid. These may have been adaptations for a hyena-like scavenging lifestyle, but are likely simply have been requirements for taking down large stone-age animals such as mastodons and ground sloths.\nThe dire wolf is one of many stone age animals to have been found at the La Brea Tar Pits, a fossil hotspot in Los Angeles, USA.\nYou can find out more about the dire wolf on this page: Dire Wolf Facts\nElephant Bird\nWhere found: Madagascar\nThe elephant birds were a family (Aepyornithidae) of flightless birds found in the African Island country of Madagascar. They belong to a group of birds known as \u201cratites\u201d, which includes living birds such as ostriches and cassowaries.\nElephant birds are thought to have appeared in the Oligocene epoch, and existed until the 17th century.\nGlyptodon\nWhere found: South America\nGlyptodon was a 2.5 m / 8.2 ft. long, stone-age relative of today\u2019s armadillos. The size of a small car, Glyptodon was protected by a rounded, armored shell. Its tail, too, was heavily armored. It belonged to the mammalian group Xenarthra, which contains today\u2019s anteaters, sloths and armadillos.\nGlyptodon was herbivorous. Its extinction may have been caused by overhunting by stone-age humans.\nMammoth\nWhere found: Europe, The Americas, Asia, Africa\nMammoths were a group of mammals in the elephant family that first appeared early in the Pliocene epoch, before the beginning of the Stone Age. Around 10 mammoth species have been identified. They make up the genus Mammuthus.\nMammoths first appeared in Africa, then spread across Europe and Asia before entering North America.\nThe best-known mammoth is the woolly mammoth Mammuthus primigenius. This species was a similar size to today\u2019s African bush elephant. It had several adaptations for living in the cold, including its characteristic fur, and small ears for protection against frostbite.\nThe last woolly mammoths lived on Wrangel Island, a Russian island in the Arctic Ocean. They were still alive at the time of the building of the Great Pyramid in Egypt.\nYou can find out more about the woolly mammoth on this page: Woolly Mammoth Facts\nMarsupial Lion\nWhere found: Australia\nThylacoleo carnifex was a stone age marsupial that lived in Australia. It is the largest of three species of genus Thylacoleo, a group of animals known as the marsupial lions due to similarities in both their appearance and lifestyle to those of today\u2019s lions.\nThylacoleo carnifex was a fearsome animal, the size of a jaguar, with strong fore limbs, retractable claws, and an immensely strong bite force.\nA rock painting made by Aboriginal Australians features an animal that may be a marsupial lion with a striped coat and pointed ears. Another rock painting depicts a possible marsupial lion and a man holding a spear. These paintings provide evidence not only of what the marsupial lion looked like, but also that it and humans had a degree of interaction.\nMastodon\nWhere found: The Americas\nMastodons were Stone Age relatives of today\u2019s elephants. The five currently recognized species of mastodon belong to the genus Mammut and family Mammutidae. They were found in North America, and were less-closely related to living elephants than mammoths.\nSmaller than mammoths, but powerfully-built and equipped with long tusks, mastodons were herbivores that inhabited forests.\nHunting of mastodons by stone age humans may have caused their extinction at the end of the Pleistocene epoch.\nIrish Elk\nWhere found: Europe, Asia\nThe Irish elk Megaloceros giganteus was a large member of the deer family Cervidae. It was one of several species of the now-extinct genus Megaloceros. This stone age species was found across northern Europe and into Siberia. It was a similar size to today\u2019s moose and its antlers were larger than those of any other known deer.\nDepictions of the Irish elk in cave paintings show it with pale fur, and a dark stripe running along its back and each of its sides.\nMegatherium\nWhere found: South America\nMegatherium was a giant ground sloth that lived in South America. It belonged to the same group, Xenarthra, that contains living sloths, anteaters and armadillos, and extinct animals such as Glyptodon, also included in this list of stone-age animals.\nMegatherium Americanum, the largest species of Megatherium, grew to lengths of up to 6 m / 20 ft., and would have weighed up to 4 tonnes / 4.41 short tons.\nUnlike living sloths, Megatherium didn\u2019t climb trees; it would simply have pulled branches towards its mouth with its powerful arms. Although Megatherium is often depicted with hair, some paleontologists think that it would have been hairless, like an elephant, to prevent overheating.\nSivatherium\nWhere found: The Americas\nSivatherium is a genus of extinct animals in the giraffe family Giraffidae. It was found in both Africa and Asia and appeared several millions of years before the beginning of the stone age. It is thought to have become extinct around 800,000 years ago.\nSivatherium resembled a modern okapi, but was significantly larger. It had two pairs of horn-like growths known as ossicones on its head. One pair was large and resembled antlers.\nSmilodon\nWhere found: The Americas\nOne of the most famous stone age animals, Smilodon was a saber-toothed cat found in the Americas in the Pleistocene and early Holocene. Smilodon populator, a Smilodon species found in South America, may have been the largest ever member of the cat family Felidae ever to have lived.\nThe most distinctive feature of Smilodon was the pair of canine teeth that projected out of its mouth from the upper jaw. The canine teeth of Smilodon populator were 28 cm / 11 in length.\nSmilodon hunted animals larger than itself, bringing them down with its powerful limbs and claws before delivering a death bite with its long canines.\nYou can find out more about Smilodon on this page: Smilodon Facts\nToxodon\nWhere found: South America\nToxodon was a hippopotamus-like hoofed mammal that lived in South America. It was powerfully-built, with short legs and a barrel-shaped body It would have co-existed with early human settlers for several thousands of years before becoming extinct, possibly due to hunting by humans. Several specimens have been found with arrowheads embedded in them.\nWoolly Rhinoceros\nWhere found: Europe, Asia\nThe woolly rhinoceros, scientific name Coelodonta antiquitatis, was a stone-age member of the rhinoceros family Rhinocerotidae. It roamed the cold grassland biome known as the Mammoth Steppe that covered much of Europe at the end of the Pleistocene.\nA similar size to today\u2019s white rhino, the woolly rhino was covered in hair and had two horns on its nose. The longer front horn grew up to 1.4 m / 4.6 ft in length.\nWhile humans are known to have hunted the woolly rhinoceros, it is thought that a warming climate, rather than hunting, caused the extinction of this cold-climate specialist.\nDiscover More With Active Wild\nYou can discover more amazing prehistoric animals on the following pages:"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "10 Amazing Facts About Elephants - softpedia", "url": "https://news.softpedia.com/news/9-Amazing-Facts-About-Elephants-71540.shtml", "text": "1.There are 170 known fossil elephant species that inhabited the whole Earth, except for Australia and Antarctica. The elephants' ancestors appeared 50 million years ago in North Africa, were pig sized and resembled a tapir. Elephants' living closest relatives are sea cows, like manatees, dugongs and hyraxes.\nDuring the Ice Age there were more 6-7 elephant species, including mastodons in North America and mammoths in Eurasia and North America.\nToday there are 3 species: the large 4 m (13 ft) tall savanna elephant and the smaller 3 m (10 ft) tall rainforest elephant and the Asian elephant, a forest animal 3 m (10 ft) tall.\nIn the savanna African elephant the weight difference between male and female can be of two tons, as males weigh on average 6 tons (up to 7.5 tons, the record is 10.5 tons) and females 4. This is the largest living land mammal. The Asian elephant weighs 5 tons in the case of the males and 3 for females.\nElephants are now endangered. In Kenya, in just 10 years the population plummeted from 150,000 to 30,000 and in Zimbabwe from 80,000 to 60,000 (in the same country black rhino population dropped from 3,000 to 300). Even if in many African countries rangers are free to kill poachers, these can be often better armed. Today there are about 600,000 African elephants and 30,000 wild Asian elephants.\n2.An elephant herd can have 5-1,000 individuals and it is led by an old female, called matriarch. A herd can contain females and their calves. Young males are driven away from the family when mature, forming separate bachelor herds while mature bulls circulate freely from one clan to another in search for routing cows. The ties are so close amongst the member of a herd that elephants are known to mourn for their dead.\nThe female gives birth every 4 years. The gestation lasts for 22 months. In 1 % of the cases twins will be born. The newborn calf is 33 in (83 cm) tall and weighs about 250 pounds (112 kg). The calf is suckled for at least two years. A cow usually has 2-4 calves with her, of various ages. Cows defend their young vigorously, charging any intruder. Sexual maturity is achieved at 14-15 years. Elephants can live up to 70 years.\n3.An elephant eats daily during the dry season 150-170 kg of food and drinks 80 liters of water, while during the rainy season they eat 200-280 kg of food daily.\nElephants ingest regularly soil containing iron and bicarbonate. Savanna elephants eat mainly grass and woody vegetation (especially during the dry season) while forest elephants eat mainly fruit and woody plants. Elephants digest cellulose with the help of protozoa in the cecum and the thick gut. In Kenya, conservationists even made paper from elephant dung.\nThey cannot survive more than 24 hours without drinking. That's why elephants are never too far from a water source. Water is also essential for bathing each evening. Elephants are good swimmers and will immerse themselves completely when they find water deep enough. By covering themselves with dirt, elephants protect themselves against insect bites.\nIf water is scarce during the dry season, elephants dig for water in the sandy bed of a river that has stopped flowing.\nElephant have only 4 functional teeth, 12 in (30 cm) long, which can be replaced 6 times. After the last replacement, the elephant can no longer feed properly.\n4.The tusks are not canines, but incisor teeth. In the Asian elephants, only males (and not all) are tusked, while in the African elephant the female carries smaller tusks. The record was a 10 ft (3.3 m) long tusk, which weighed 230 pounds (104 kg) but the average is 2.5 m (83 ft) long and 60 kg (130 pound). In the case of the females, tusks do not weigh more than 18 kg (40 pounds), the average being 7 kg (16 pounds). The tusks of the Asian elephant male are not longer than 2.1 m (7 ft). In extinct mastodons and mammoths, the tusks could be 5 m (17 ft) long!\nBecause the elephant foot has underside soft cushions, elephants can walk almost noiselessly. A walking elephant has a speed of about 5.5 mi (9 km) per hour and it \"runs\" with a speed of 25 mi (40 km) per hour, faster than the most rapid human athletes, despite their huge size. Elephants living in the forest are sedentary, but those in dry places migrate, traveling up to 500 km (300 mi).\n5.Besides the trumpeting (expressing anger) and throaty rumbling similar to gargling which we hear, elephants also communicate through infrasounds with a frequency of 14-24 Hz. The advantage of the infrasounds is that they can cross vast distances, without being attenuated by the vegetation. This explains why elephant herds located at great distances one from another move in a coordinated way. The infrasounds are produced by a membrane located in the forehead, where the trunk unites to the skull.\nEach elephant has a specific vocal timbre. The calls of the elephants have various meanings, from aggression to alarm call when searching for lost offspring. When spotting a possible danger, elephants stop rumbling.\nThey express aggression by threatening with twirled trunk and by throwing dust in the air. The African elephant also flutters its enormous ears.\n6.Like children, elephants must be disciplined by the members of their collectivity to turn into responsible members of the elephant society. But male elephants that were orphans turned into adult delinquents in a reserve in South Africa, as they had never been kept under control by mature elephants.\nThe balky elephants attacked people (killing two, including a professional hunter), killed 19 white rhinos in three years and even attempted mating with rhinoceroses. When adult bulls from a group were moved amongst delinquents, they restored order and a more proper behavior in young bulls.\n7.Elephants of Digboi (northeastern India) are fascinated by oil. They roam through the oil fields when important valves from the pipes connecting the wells to the refinery are open. They seem to enjoy the sound made by valves when opening, especially those controlling the vapors which impede the oil turning into paraffin. But it's not all about the gushing oil, but also the mud and the water getting out with the oil. The water is salty and this is what elephants want.\nIn fact, an elephant led to the discovery of this oil field during the British occupation. A British official working at the first railway in the area noticed an oily substance on the limb of an elephant. Following the traces of the elephant, he discovered a bubbling oil pool. That was the first oil field opened in Asia, in 1889.\n8.What's the weight of a cloud? 550 tons of water. About 100 elephants! All in minute droplets floating on ascending hot air. This is a normal cumulus cloud.\nBut a storm cloud can have the weight of 200,000 elephants. A hurricane cloud means 40 million elephants, more than the existing elephants on the planet.\n9.A trunk can sniff at a long distance from the owner's face, grab things, or march across a pool underwater, using it as a snorkel. Because the trunk does not have bones, it's extremely mobile. In fact, nose bones are greatly reduced and not only in elephants, but also in other mammals that developed rudimentary trunks (like tapirs).\nA trunk contains more than 40,000 muscles and tendons and its tip is very sensitive, making it very precise (elephants can pick up from the floor objects which are the size of a coin).\nIn addition, there is one (in African elephant) or two (in Asian elephant) \"fingers\" on the tip to grasp small objects. This prehensile \"hand\" can weigh 400 lb. (160 kg) and measure 7 feet (2,1 m), being able to lift objects of more than 300 lb. (120 kg). A man can be thrown 35 m (116 ft) away with the trunk and 2 tons can be dragged by trunk.\nThe elephant can collect gallons of water with the trunk and then give itself a quick shower; or reach the highest, freshest leaves off a tree.\nIt may be used to chase away flies or to hug affectionately another elephant's trunk. Changes in nostril size shift the sound of the elephant calls. Elephants also wade into pools and use the tip of their trunk as a snorkel as it swims to the other side, breathing easily.\nHumans can only use a foot long snorkel tubes, because for deeper snorkels the mismatch between air pressure inside lungs and the increasing outside pressure can make blood vessels swell.\nBut elephant lungs are different: instead of having a pleural space between lungs and the chest case as humans and most mammals do, elephants have dense sheets of fibery tissue, allowing their lungs to withstand pressures that would cause human lungs to collapse. This is a sign that elephant ancestors were aquatic creatures. Indeed, their closet living relatives seem to be the sea cows, like manatees and dugongs.\n10.Have you ever wondered why elephants have a wrinkled skin? The folding of their skin helps them regulate their temperature and keep its humidity. The wrinkled skin retains 5-10 times more water than a smooth skin and the mud stuck on it dries much harder, keeping coolness for longer periods. The wrinkled skin also loses more heat, cooling down the animal."}

Distinguishable for their straight tusks that point downward, these peaceful giants are now considered vulnerable by the IUCN.\nSee the fact file below for more information on the African Forest Elephant or alternatively, you can download our 21-page African Forest Elephant worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\nKey Facts & Information\nORIGIN\nLoxodonte, which points out its lozenge-shaped molar teeth enamel, was the generic name for African elephants, introduced by French naturalist and zoologist Georges Cuvier in 1824.\nIn 1900, German zoologist Paul Matschie suggested Elephas (Loxodonta) cyclotis as the African Forest elephant\u2019s scientific name.\nThe ancestors of the African Bush elephants became extinct during the Pleistocene Epoch. Currently, there are only three species of elephants left: Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), African Forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), and African Bush elephant (Loxodonta africana).\nPHYSICAL FEATURES\nBulls reach a shoulder height of 2.4 to 3.0 meters (7.9 to 9.8 feet,while females are around 1.8 to 2.4 meters (5.9 to 7.9 feet) tall. African Forest elephants weigh 2 to 4 tonnes and have footprint sizes at 12.5 to 35.3 centimeters (4.9 to 13.9 inches).\nThey have grey skin which appears yellow to reddish after rolling its body in the mud (wallowing). Their bodies are covered with black, rough hair, usually 20 to 200 mm (0.8 to 8 in) in length.\nTheir ears are more oval-shaped compared to the Asian elephants which look like the shape of India. These huge flaps are not just for hearing, but are also used to keep them cool in the African heat.\nHeads of the Forest elephant are slightly smaller than the Savannah elephants which have fuller and more rounded single dome heads.\nThey are also distinct for their straight tusks that point downward, and the amount of nails they have on each foot: five on front feet and four on hind feet.\nTheir trunks are an elongation of their upper lip and nose, resulting to a two finger-like tip. Their pink tusks, made of dentin, are thinner and harder compared to the African Bush elephant, and grow from deciduous teeth called tushes, that form in the upper jaw of the elephant.\nTheir tusks are about 1.5 m (5 ft) long and can weigh between 50 to 100 lbs (23 to 45 kg). Tusks of male Forest elephants grow until they mature, while tusks of females stop growing when they reach sexual maturity.\nBEHAVIOR\nAfrican Forest elephants are incredibly sociable mammals. They usually gather by family herds comprising of 10 females with their offspring. This behavior of mothers looking after their calves together is called allomothering. They do not want to stay in one area, and are continuously looking for food.\nTheir trunks are flexible enough to help them gather and handle food, and collect water. Along with their tusks, they also use their trunks to protect themselves from their natural predators, and to fight with other male Savannah elephants when they are trying to find potential mates.\nAfrican Forest elephants are also highly intelligent. They are considered as emotional mammals, showing traits such as giving and receiving love, attending to the needs of their young, and grieving for the loss of their relatives.\nTheir tough skin is highly sensitive to ultraviolet rays, thus, they use mud as sunscreen. These elephants love mud baths which protect them from burning and insect bites, and gives them enough moisture.\nThese elephants are an arrhythmic species \u2013 they have clear vision in dim light. They also have the ability to detect vibrations in the ground because of their sensitive feet.\nHABITAT AND DIET\nAfrican Forest elephants are mostly found in lowland tropical and subtropical rainforests and woodlands of central and western Africa, including Gabon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon and Central African Republic, Liberia, and Ghana.\nThey are herbivorous mammals that feed on plants and plant matter.\nTheir diet consists of leaves and fallen branches of trees, fruits and grasses, and even roots underground.\nTheir front pair of molars wear down and drop out in pieces, causing the back pair to move forward and two new molars emerge in the back of its mouth.\nForest elephants crave salt. Aside from their usual diet, they also visit salt, or mineral licks, and even eat soil.\nThese peaceful giants have no natural predators due to their huge size.\nLions and hyenas may sometimes pick off young African Bush elephants that are away from its mother, and even old and sick adults that are too vulnerable to attack.\nAdult African Bush elephants can drink about 50 gallons of water a day, with 1.5 gallons of water into their trunks at a time.\nREPRODUCTION\nAfrican Forest elephants are expected to live between 60 to 70 years.\nOf all the three elephant species, Forest elephants have the slowest reproductive rate. They sexually mature at the age of 23, with an average gestation period of about two years.\nFemales are able to reproduce between the age of 8 and 12 years. They start breeding at the age of 23, and give birth every 5 to 6 years, resulting in a lower birth rate than the Bush elephants.\nBaby elephants weigh 232 lbs (105 kg) when they are born. Their tusks grow when they reach around 16 months.\nCalves stay with their herd for a few years for protection and guidance, until they are six years old \u2013 old enough to support and protect themselves.\nCONSERVATION\nHabitat loss and humans that poach their ivory tusks are the biggest threats to their survival.\nThe IUCN lists African Bush elephants as vulnerable.\nAfrican Forest elephants play a vital part in maintaining the lowland tropical and subtropical rainforests and woodlands ecosystems, and in helping plants and animals survive.\nAfrican Forest Elephant Worksheets\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about the African Forest Elephant across 21 in-depth pages.

Even buffalo cows kept in captivity refuse to be milked.\nSeeing how widespread common domestic cattle and horses are, if they coulda been, they woulda been, and sometimes you will see an individual who has given in to a saddle or cart, but as a species they are wild to the bone.\nRock on wild animals!\nWhat's the difference between wild animals and domestic animals?\nWild animals have survived in their native habitat for the entire existence of their species. They have never been selectively bred for the purposes of human beings.\nThat being said, nearly every species of animal, reptile, even fish and insects, have been held in captivity at one time or another.\nThe question is, how well do they take to that captivity, and have they been altered by it.\nThe tiger and the lion may be the first animals that comes to mind when we talk about a wild animal, but there are generations of lions and tigers that have been bred in captivity not just in zoos, where their wild behavior may be somewhat retained, but in circuses and in the pet industry.\nIn these situations, it isn't the most powerful and fearsome male that reproduces, it is the most amiable and tractable individuals, and occasionally, those with unique coat color.\nGenerations of big cats bred with tameness in mind has not made them pussycats, but in most cases it has created individuals with calmer demeanors, and even significantly smaller fangs!\nWhat is a domestic animal?\nTrue domestic animals have lived thousands of generations in captivity, and differ significantly from their wild ancestors both physically and psychologically.\nBut tameness and domestication are not the same thing.\nTameness is a degree of calm, a manageable demeanor, and a lack of aggression and fear.\nBut there are many creatures, such as silkworms, honey bees that are completely domesticated and certainly wouldn't be considered \"tame\" in the sense that we think.\nAnd the wildest of the wild, the animals we think of when we say \"wild animal\", lions and tigers, have been kept and bred in zoos, circuses and by the pet trade for centuries.\nNaturally, the most powerful and dominant of these animals is not being reproduced, and they have acquired a more docile demeanor.\nThe fangs of these big cats are even significantly smaller than their wild cousins, but are they domestic animals?\nThere are definitely alot of grey areas here, but the species that has been most clearly altered by it's relationship with human beings is, of course, the domestic dog.\nDomestic dogs are so completely engulfed in our world that they instinctively choose the company of human beings over their own species right from birth.\nThey are drawn to and transfixed by human beings, and some breeds have an incredible desire to please.\nMost domestic dogs are even born understanding the uniquely human gesture of pointing.\nSomething that the smartest animals on the planet, apes and whales, must be patiently taught to comprehend.\nDomestic horses are able to completely suppress their instincts and desires as prey animals, in order to carry us into war, on patrol, or on parade.\nAnd the domestic cat is born with a specific vocabulary word hardwired in it's brain that it only utters to human beings - yes, it seems cats only \"meow\" to people.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephants on the path to extinction - the facts - the Guardian", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/12/elephants-on-the-path-to-extinction-the-facts", "text": "Elephant evolution\nThe largest of all land beasts, elephants are thundering, trumpeting six-tonne monuments to the wonder of evolution. From the tip of that distinctive trunk with its 100,000 dextrous muscles; to their outsize ears that flap the heat away; to the complex matriarchal societies and the mourning of their dead; to the points of their ivory tusks, designed to defend, but ultimately the cause of their ruin.\nAfrican and Asian elephants are more closely related to the woolly mammoth than to each other. The ears are said to be a geographical guide. In Asia, elephants have smaller India-shaped ears. While in Africa their huge ears are the shape of the whole continent.\nWhere do they live?\nAsian elephants used to roam from the coast of Persia through India and southeast Asia and deep into China. In Africa, they could be found in almost every habitat from the shores of the Mediterranean to the Cape of Good Hope. Most common in the savannahs, elephants still inhabit a wide variety of landscapes. They can be found in the Saharan and Namibian deserts and the rainforests of Rwanda and Borneo. But their range has shrunk and they are now extinct in the Middle East, on the Indonesian island of Java, northern Africa and most of China. Almost everywhere, these great nomads are restricted to ever-decreasing pockets of land.\nElephants in Kenya. Photograph: THE DSWT / Barcroft Images\nHow many elephants are alive around the world?\nIn 1800 there may have been 26 million elephants in Africa alone, although it\u2019s hard to be precise. But today, after years of poaching and habitat destruction, those numbers are a tiny fraction of what they once were.\nCurrent range of Asian elephants Current range of Asian elephants\nIn Asia, it is estimated that less than 50,000 elephants remain; more than half of them in India. Tiny populations, a few hundreds or thousands, cling on in countries across south-east Asia and the Himalayas.\nIn Africa, the larger of the two species is a step further from extinction. Less than half a million roam the continent, mostly in the southern states. In the west and the forested centre, elephants are in a particularly perilous condition.\nWhat has caused the destruction of elephants?\nFor thousands of years ivory has been prized and elephants have been killed for it. The Egyptian pharoah Tutankhamun was laid to rest around 1323BC on a headrest of ivory, while in nearby Syria elephants were more or less wiped out for their ivory by 500BC.\nThe invention of guns increased the pressure. The 19th century brought a fashion for big game hunting among colonialists, which wiped out herds across the continent of Africa. Now the remaining dwindling numbers face the threat of local hunters and modern poaching gangs, financed by Asian syndicates and armed by the conflicts of Africa.\nSome experts see the brutal killings of elephants not as a battle for a commodity, but for land. As the human population booms, so does demand for space. Poaching conveniently removes elephants from the land, leaving it open to development. This is a pattern seen across western Africa, where elephant declines have been most precipitous. By 2050, 63% of remaining elephant rangelands will be compromised (pdf) by human encroachment.\nThe tightly-contested rural landscapes of Asia have seen a more direct form of conflict between humans and elephants. In an evening\u2019s feeding a herd of elephants can destroy the annual crop of many small farmers. Human lives are also in danger. In India, panicked or enraged elephants kill more than 400 people each year (pdf). This leads to retaliation. Wildlife authorities often hunt down and kill problem elephants. In Indonesia, dozens of elephants are poisoned by palm oil growers each year.\nUncovering the \u2018elephant holocaust\u2019\nAs Africa\u2019s nations shook off colonial rule in the years following World War II, a huge poaching crisis arose. British zoologist Ian Douglas Hamilton, who flew a light aircraft over sub-Saharan African countries to count elephants in the 1970s and 80s, uncovered what became known as the \u201celephant holocaust\u201d. He estimated that African elephant numbers fell from one million to 400,000 during the 1980s.\nCurrent range of African elephants Current range of African elephants\nWithout the often dangerous work of Hamilton, governments would not have come together to ban the international trade in ivory in 1989. This led to a recovery in elephant numbers until 2008, when infiltration of the ivory trade by criminal gangs, rising Asian demand and high levels of corruption increased the levels of poaching with catastrophic results.\nHow many elephants are killed a year for ivory?\nAround 20,000 African elephants were killed last year for their tusks, more than were born. Chinese wealth is financing a hunger for ivory that threatens to bring an end to wild elephants within our lifetime.\nThere has never been a more dangerous time to be an elephant. Not during the industrial pillaging of the colonial era, nor the chaotic African and Asian independence movements that sparked a 1970s poaching boom, has an elephant been more likely to fall to a gun.\nIn spite of the global ban on international trade (overseen by the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species \u2013 Cites) the illegal ivory trade has exploded. Some believe large amounts of ivory has also been bought and stored in secret warehouses by investors needing somewhere to hide money from the global downturn. Criminal gangs bribe officials to ship huge quantities of ivory through the ports to illicit factories and markets of China, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand in particular. In 2011, seizures hit a peak of 23 metric tonnes \u2013 2,500 elephants. But that is only a fraction of what makes it through undisturbed.\nWhat should we do with ivory stockpiles?\nSome African states - including Namibia, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Botswana - are arguing for the right to sell off their ever-growing stockpiles, fed by both seizures and natural deaths, in order to help fund conservation work.\nBut ivory sell-offs - such as the two in 1999 and 2008 - have been also criticised for increasing demand, although there are some who dispute these findings. Another sale has been mooted by Zimbabwe and Namibia and will be discussed at Cites\u2019 triennial conference this September. Many states have burned their stockpiles for symbolic and practical reasons.\nIs it still legal to sell ivory?\nIn many countries ivory can be sold legally, usually sourced from stockpiles or from elephants killed before the ban, allowing antiques to be traded. Cites has raised concerns that unregulated domestic markets in China, Japan, Myanmar and Vietnam allow freshly killed ivory to join legal stock on the shelves, fuelling the poaching crisis.\nWhat can we do to halt the decline?\n1) Protect habitat\nEfforts to protect Asian elephants focus immense pressure on land and habitat. Poaching exists on the continent, but it is a lesser threat compared to the destruction of their homes. Unlike their African cousins, only Asian bull elephants have tusks. Elephant protection relies on the defence of reserve land from legal and illegal encroachment, logging, roads and other developments. Innovative solutions can help, such as a project in the tea fields of India which uses an SMS warning system so that humans can coexist safely with elephants.\n2) Reduce demand\nIn the markets of Asia where the majority of the poached African ivory ends up, the holy grail of elephant conservation remains the abolition of demand for ivory. This has worked in Japan \u2013 what was one of the biggest markets for ivory at the turn of this century is now a minor player.\nIn China, advertising campaigns featuring local and foreign celebrities are having an effect. The proportion of Chinese who believe elephant poaching is a problem grew from 47% to 71% between 2012 and 2014. This awareness also appears to be having an effect on policy. The Chinese and US governments have agreed to work together to end the global illegal ivory trade. Last year, China began to phase out its domestic manufacture and sale of ivory and the US cracked down on its own internal market, which was the second largest in the world.\nSeized ivory products in China Photograph: Ng Han Guan/AP\nMeanwhile the Europeans \u2013 historically responsible for a great part of the decline of elephants during colonial-era craze for big game hunting \u2013 have drawn criticism for refusing to back a long-term end to all trade in ivory. Some observers argue that the only way to save elephants is to give them economic value. That can mean emphasising the value to tourism, but the EU has raised the possibility of allowing states where populations are stable to harvest ivory and sell it to China legally.\n3) Support the frontline defenders\nThe link between poaching and poverty is clear: rates of infant mortality and poaching activity correlate strongly. In Kenya, a poacher makes $3 per kilo of ivory, a princely sum compared to the daily earnings of many around them. But the gangs they sell it to get $1,100 per kilo for the same tusk in China. Many elephants, particularly in the forests of central Africa, are not only targeted for their ivory. An enterprising hunter can make more (pdf) money in the unregulated bushmeat markets from the smoked meat than from the tusks. So the development and prosperity of rural Africa is a vital aspect of elephant conservation.\nVolunteers carry elephant tusks to a burning site for a historic destruction of illegal ivory and rhino-horn confiscated mostly from poachers in Nairobi\u2019s national park. Photograph: Tony Karumba/AFP/Getty Images\nIn the face of this multitude of threats, inspirational work is being done by exceptionally brave people. In Kenya, former poachers are recruited to be the world\u2019s first line of defence against the murder of elephants \u2013 the park rangers. All too frequently they lose their lives. These people, the NGO community and the efforts of many governments are sources of hope. The defeat of greed and desperation may be hard to imagine. But try imagining a world without elephants."}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "10 Important Facts About Mastodons - ThoughtCo", "url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/facts-about-mastodons-1093330", "text": "Mastodons and Mammoths are often confused\u2014which is understandable since they were both giant, shaggy, prehistoric elephants that roamed the plains of Pleistocene North America and Eurasia from two million to as recently as 20,000 years ago. Below you'll discover 10 fascinating facts about the Mastodon, the lesser-known half of this pachyderm pair.\n01 of 10 The Name Mastodon Means \"Nipple Tooth\" Wikimedia Commons Okay, you can stop laughing now; \"nipple\" refers to the characteristic shape of the Mastodon's molar teeth, not its mammary glands. For the record, the Mastodon's official genus name is Mammut, which is so confusingly similar to Mammuthus (the genus name of the Woolly Mammoth) that \"Mastodon\" is the preferred usage of both scientists and the general public.\n02 of 10 Mastodons, Like Mammoths, Were Covered with Fur Wikimedia Commons The Woolly Mammoth gets all the press, but Mastodons (and particularly the most famous member of the breed, the North American Mastodon) also had thick coats of shaggy hair, to protect them from the intense cold of Pleistocene North America and Eurasia. It's possible that Ice Age humans found it easier to hunt (and strip the pelts off) Woolly Mammoths as opposed to Mastodons, which may help to explain why the Mastodon's fur is so relatively unappreciated today.\n03 of 10 The Mastodon Family Tree Originated in Africa Wikimedia Commons About 30 million years ago (give or take a few million years), a population of prehistoric elephants in Africa branched off into a group that eventually included the genus Mammut as well as the lesser-known ancestral pachyderms Eozygodon and Zygolophodon. By the late Pliocene epoch, Mastodons were thick on the ground in Eurasia, and by the ensuing Pleistocene, they had crossed the Siberian land bridge and populated North America.\n04 of 10 Mastodons Were Browsers Rather than Grazers Wikimedia Commons \"Grazing\" and \"browsing\" are important terms to know when you're talking about plant-eating mammals. While Woolly Mammoths grazed on grass--lots and lots of grass--Mastodons were primarily browsers, nibbling on shrubs and the low-lying branches of trees. Lately, there has been some controversy about the extent to which Mastodons were exclusive browsers; some paleontologists believe species in the genus Mammut were not averse to grazing when circumstances demanded.\n05 of 10 Male Mastodons Fought One Another with Their Tusks Wikimedia Commons Mastodons were famous for their long, curved, dangerous-looking tusks (which still weren't quite as long, curved and dangerous-looking as the tusks wielded by Woolly Mammoths).\n06 of 10 Some Mastodon Bones Bear the Marks of Tuberculosis Wikimedia Commons Not only human beings are susceptible to the ravages of tuberculosis. Many other mammals perish from this slow-developing bacterial infection, which can scar bones, as well as lung tissue, when they don't kill an animal outright The discovery of Mastodon specimens bearing physical evidence of tuberculosis raises the interesting theory that these prehistoric elephants were doomed by exposure to the early human settlers of North America, who brought this disease with them from the Old World.\n07 of 10 Mastodons, Unlike Mammoths, Were Solitary Animals Wikimedia Commons Woolly Mammoth fossils tend to be discovered in association with other Woolly Mammoth fossils, leading paleontologists to infer that these elephants formed small family units (if not larger herds). By contrast, most Mastodon remains are completely isolated, which is evidence (but not proof) of a solitary lifestyle among full-grown adults. It's possible that adult Mastodons only gathered together during \u200bthe breeding season, and the only long-term associations were between mothers and children, as is the pattern with modern elephants.\n08 of 10 There Are Four Identified Mastodon Species Wikimedia Commons The most famous Mastodon species is the North American Mastodon, Mammut americanum. Two others--M. matthewi and M. raki--are so similar to M. americanum that not all paleontologists agree that they even merit their own species designation, while a fourth, M. cosoensis, was originally assigned as a species of the obscure Pliomastodon. All of these proboscids ranged across the expanse of Pliocene and Pleistocene North America and Eurasia during the Pleistocene epoch.\n09 of 10 The First American Mastodon Fossil Was Discovered in New York Public Domain In 1705, in the town of Claverack, New York, a farmer discovered a fossilized tooth weighing a whopping five pounds. The man traded his find to a local politician for a glass of rum; the politician then gifted the tooth to the state's governor, and the governor shipped it back to England with the label \"Tooth of a Giant.\" The fossil tooth--which, you guessed it, belonged to a North American Mastodon--quickly achieved fame as the \"Incognitum,\" or \"unknown thing,\" a designation it retained until naturalists had learned more about Pleistocene life."}

Despite of their huge body weight they can reach maximum speed up to 65 km/h, which is about 40 mph. Tigers can leap about 30 to 33 ft in length.\nTiger top speed:65 km/h\nWolf Speed:\nHave you ever wondered how fast wolves can run? Wolves are typically known to be one of the most agile and fastest animals in the world. Surprisingly, their average running speed is about only 25 mph. This may not seem very fast to us humans, but for an animal that is typically around 50-80 pounds, this is pretty impressive! In order to understand just how fast a wolf can run, let\u2019s take a closer look at their anatomy and physiology.\nWolf Average speed:35 km/h\nWolf top speed:40 km/h\nHyena Speed:\nSpotted hyenas can run up to 43 mph (70 km/h), making them one of the fastest mammals in Africa.\n60 / 150\n70 / 150\nLion Speed:\nLion king of the jungle can reach maximum speed of 80 km/h however lasts only for few minutes.

Why?\nWell, first because they are more closely related to smaller cat species, like bobcats and even domestic cats, than they are to the big cats, and second, because they cannot roar.\nYes, the mountain lion can growl, snarl, and even purr, but does not roar.\nThere are six sub-species of cougars ranging all throughout South and Central America, as well as Mexico, Western North America, and Florida.\nThis is a solitary, stealthy cat that is most active at dusk and dawn, and sneaks through the shadows largely undetected.\nThey live in many completely different habitats, from snow covered mountains, to tropical forests to swamps.\nBecause the places they live are so different, so too, are what cougars eat.\nIn the Rocky mountains of the Western United States, where they are called \"mountain lions\", their diet is mule deer, elk, moose and rocky mountain goats.\nIn the jungles of South America where they are called \"pumas\", they dine on wild boar and monkeys.\nIn the swamps of Florida where they are called \"panthers\", they eat baby alligators, snakes and pigs.\nIn the deserts of Mexico where they are called wildcats, they hunt jackal and hares.\nThe cougars skeleton is lightweight, and the body is extremely well muscled.\nThe paws are very large, and the hind legs are longer than the fronts, allowing the cougar to coil up and pounce on prey with devastating accuracy.\nThey are ambush hunters, hiding behind rocks or atop a tree limb, waiting for their victim to get close enough, then going in for the finish with a kill bite to the back of the neck.\nThe cougar is capable of a 15 foot vertical leap, and has been reported to clear horizontal distances of 30 feet.\nThe cougar is a serious carnivore and an excellent hunter consuming meat exclusively and hunting and killing almost everything it eats.\nIf the prey is large, such as a moose or elk, they will drag it to a secluded area and return to feed over several days.\nCougars rarely, if ever, scavenge, except in populated areas and campgrounds.\nCougars can be a menace for cattle ranchers and can easily take down a full grown cow.\nBecause of this, they have been tracked down and hunted out of existence across many square miles of range land.\nBut they are not endangered, except for the very rare Florida panther sub-species, and many cougars live in remarkably close proximity to human beings without us even knowing they are there.\nSpotting a mountain lion in the wild is extremely rare, but hikers often find clues of their presence like scat, recent kills, and scratches left on trees.\nCougar attacks on humans do occur, but are very rare, in fact, less than 30 people have ever been reported as being killed by mountain lions\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

When reaching the age of adolescence, males are either forced to leave the herd or do it by their own will, typically joining the herd only for mating. Meanwhile, females continue living with the herd, where they serve as 'nannies'. Old adult males are completely solitary due to being unable to travel with the herds. These elephants may be active at any time of the day, although the period of increased activity seems to occur from 2 hours before late afternoon till 2 hours before dawn, during which they look for food. When a group travels, its members constantly keep in touch in order to keep integrity of the herd. Typical forms of communication are soft vibrations of the upper trunk that are heard by conspecifics. According to a recent study, these animals are able to give out subsonic sounds, perceived at a distance of up to 5 km."}

It will occasionally pursue its prey on foot.\nDhole\nScientific Name: Cuon alpinus\nType Of Animal: Mammal\nFamily: Canidae (the dog family)\nConservation Status: Endangered\nThe dhole is an endangered wild dog that lives in the jungles of Central and Southern Asia. It lives in the same regions as tigers and leopards, and hunts for similar types of prey. However, it\u2019s not competition with these fearsome cats that has caused the dhole to become endangered; it\u2019s competition with man.\nOverhunting of the dhole\u2019s main prey \u2013 animals such as deer \u2013 by humans means that there\u2019s little left for the dhole. This, together with habitat loss caused by human expansion, has left the dhole with less food, and a smaller area in which to hunt.\nDholes live and hunt in packs of around 12 individuals and communicate using whistles, whines, screams, and a number of other vocalizations.\nYou can find out more about dholes on this page: Dhole Facts\nYou can see a list of every wild dog species on this page: Wild Dogs List with Pictures & Facts\nGaur\nScientific Name: Bos gaurus\nType Of Animal: Mammal\nFamily: Bovidae\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nThe gaur is the largest member of the family Bovidae.

It is one of the largest of the fifty-or-so members of the hornbill family, Bucerotidae.\nHornbills are found in Asia and Africa. These fruit-eating birds are similar in appearance and behavior to the toucans of the Americas. This is an example of convergent evolution \u2013 the process by which unrelated species develop similar adaptations.\nThe great hornbill\u2019s vulnerable status is mainly caused by deforestation.\nRed Junglefowl\nScientific Name: Gallus gallus\nType Of Animal: Bird\nFamily: Phasianidae\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe red junglefowl is a bird found in the jungles of southern Asia. If it seems familiar, that\u2019s because it\u2019s one of the main ancestors of the domestic chicken. Don\u2019t be surprised to hear the familiar sound of a cock crowing even if you\u2019re deep in the jungle.\nThe red junglefowl usually flies only to reach a tree branch to roost upon or to evade a predator. It spends most of its time foraging for seeds on the jungle floor.\nReticulated Python\nScientific Name: Malayopython reticulatus\nType Of Animal: Reptile\nFamily: Pythonidae\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe reticulated python is famous for being the world\u2019s longest snake, and is also one of the three heaviest.

In Thailand, its name is used as an insult.\nJungle Animals From Australia\nBowerbird\nScientific Name: Family Ptilonorhynchidae\nType Of Animal: Bird\nMany of the ninety species of bowerbird are brightly-colored, but that\u2019s not what makes these birds special. Instead, it\u2019s the ability of male bowerbirds to construct elaborate stick buildings known as \u201cbowers\u201d that sets them apart from other jungle birds.\nOnce the male has built his bower, he decorates it with brightly-colored objects collected from the surrounding jungle. If a visiting female is sufficiently impressed, she will mate with the male. The only purpose of the bower is to attract females; the eggs are laid in a separate nest.\nBowerbirds are found in the jungles of New Guinea and Australia.\nMusky Rat-Kangaroo\nScientific Name: Hypsiprymnodon moschatus\nType Of Animal: Mammal, Marsupial\nFamily: Hypsiprymnodontidae\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe musky rat-kangaroo is a small marsupial found in the rainforests of northeast Australia. A solitary animal, the musky rat-kangaroo is active during the day and spends the night in a nest. It eats fruit, fungi and insects.\nSouthern Cassowary\nScientific Name: Casuarius casuarius\nType Of Animal: Bird, Ratite\nFamily: Casuariidae\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe southern cassowary is one of three species of cassowary and the only one found in Australia. The fourth member of the family Casuariidae is the emu, another large flightless bird.\nThe southern cassowary reaches a height of up to 1.8 m (5.9 ft) and is the world\u2019s third-tallest bird after the two species of ostrich.\nThe horn-like helmet on top of a cassowary\u2019s head is called a casque. The exact function of the casque is unknown \u2013 it may be an indicator of a bird\u2019s health to potential mates, or may serve to amplify the cassowary\u2019s call.\nYou can find out more about cassowaries on this page: Cassowary Facts\nTiger Quoll\nScientific Name: Dasyurus maculatus\nType Of Animal: Mammal, Marsupial\nFamily: Dasyuridae\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nThe tiger quoll is also known as the \u201cspotted-tailed quoll\u201d on behalf of the distinctive markings on its tail.

Like all toucans, the keel-billed toucan has a large curved bill with which it forages for food in the rainforest canopy.\nDespite looking like a formidable weapon, a toucan\u2019s bill is largely hollow and relatively lightweight. As well as being a useful tool for reaching fruit, the bill is also thought to help the toucan keep its body at the correct temperature.\nDespite looking friendly, toucans have a darker side; they regularly steal eggs and nestlings from the nests of other birds.\nYou can find out more about toucans on this page: Toucan Facts\nMantled Howler Monkey\nScientific Name: Alouatta palliata\nType Of Animal: Mammal, Primate\nFamily: Atelidae\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nThe world\u2019s jungles are home to many primates: early primates evolved to live in trees, and today\u2019s monkeys and apes have many adaptations for this environment, including good eyesight, flexible shoulders and gripping hands.\nThe mantled howler monkey is just one of many monkeys that live in jungles. This large monkey is found in the forests of Central America. It mainly eats leaves, and lives in large groups of up to 40 individuals.\nLike other howler monkeys, the mantled howler is known for its extremely loud territorial howls. Howler monkeys howl in order to alert other troops of their presence. This \u201cshouting battle\u201d prevents real, physical battles from taking place.\nYou can find out more about howler monkeys on this page: Howler Monkey Facts\nOscar\nScientific Name: Astronotus ocellatus\nType Of Animal: Fish\nFamily: Cichlidae\nConservation Status: Unassessed\nThe Oscar is a freshwater fish found in shallow rivers and streams in the Amazon Basin.

Their trunks are used to pick up food, draw water, breathe and greet other elephants. Their large ears help them keep cool and communicate a range of emotions. Adult African elephants have two tusks which are used to peel bark off trees, mine for minerals and defend against predators.\nAfrican elephants are keystone species, in that they play a crucial role in maintaining their ecosystems. They assist with plant dispersal by depositing undigested plant seeds in their dung, and they alter their landscape by uprooting trees and digging for water during the dry season. These foraging behaviours can also help other animals survive in harsh environmental conditions.\nElephants live in family groups, presided over by a dominant female, called a matriarch. Bull elephants depart the matriarchal herd when they reach sexual maturity, then move alone or in bachelor herds. Herds can consist of 100 individuals or more, and they can move huge distances in search of food and water; for example, elephants in the deserts of Mali migrate across an area of 12,355 square miles.\n*International Union for Conservation of Nature is the world\u2019s main authority on the conservation status of species."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Poaching animals, facts and information", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/poaching-animals/", "text": "Wild animals are being poached on a massive scale, with millions of individual animals of thousands of species worldwide killed or captured from their native habitats. Poaching poses a growing threat to elephants, rhinos, and other charismatic animals, as well as to smaller and more obscure creatures, like certain lizards and monkeys.\nWhy animals are poached\nPoachers sometimes kill or capture animals to sell them locally or for the global trade in wildlife. Wildlife trading is a major black market that has increased alongside rising wealth in Asia\u2014a major consumer of wildlife\u2014and the advent of e-commerce and social media websites.\nSome animals, such as birds, reptiles, and primates, are captured live so that they can be kept or sold as exotic pets. Slaughtered animals, on the other hand, have commercial value as food, jewelry, decor, or traditional medicine. The ivory tusks of African elephants, for example, are carved into trinkets or display pieces. The scales of pangolins, small animals that eat ants, are ground into powder and consumed for their purported healing powers. The meat of apes, snakes, and other bush animals is considered a delicacy in parts of Africa.\n4:48\nIn addition to killing for direct profit, poachers target animals to prevent them from destroying crops or attacking livestock. This happens to lions and elephants in Africa, as well as to wolves, coyotes, and other predators in North America and beyond.\nThe effects of poaching\nPoaching has devastating consequences for wildlife. In some instances, it\u2019s the primary reason why an animal faces a risk of extinction. This is the case with the African elephant, more than 100,000 of which were killed between 2014 and 2017 for ivory. Poaching has also had a catastrophic impact on rhinos, with more than a thousand slaughtered a year for their horns.\nPoaching for the exotic pet trade affects an animal\u2019s welfare in addition to its numbers in the wild. Most wild animals eat specialized diets found in nature, and they need space to fly, roam, and swing from branches. Captured animals are stuffed into boxes, suitcases, or sacks, and even if they survive transport, they often suffer in their new, unnatural situations.\nThen there\u2019s the tragic ways poaching affects people. In Africa, nearly 600 rangers charged with protecting wildlife were gunned down by poachers between 2009 and 2016 while in the line of duty. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo\u2019s Virunga National Park, one of the continent\u2019s most dangerous, at least 170 rangers have been killed during the past two decades.\nWhat\u2019s more, poaching has been linked to armed militia groups in Africa suspected of trafficking ivory to fund their operations, and it often occurs alongside other crimes including corruption and money laundering. And poached animals can spread disease, such as Ebola and SARS.\n1:02\nEfforts to stop poaching\nIn addition to providing on-the-ground protection for animals, many countries make poaching an offense punishable by prison or monetary fees. Because poachers in Africa and Asia are often impoverished local people who make small profits in comparison to traders and kingpins, penalties for poaching wildlife are generally less severe than those for trafficking wildlife.\nThere are also numerous nonprofits around the world working to end wildlife poaching. Some of these groups have helped to promote alternative, more sustainable ways for poachers to earn a living. Another way people are working to end poaching is by trying to decrease demand for illegal wildlife and wildlife parts. If no one's buying the products, there will be no need to kill the animals."}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephant Seal Facts (Genus Mirounga) - ThoughtCo", "url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/elephant-seal-facts-4154853", "text": "The elephant seal (genus Mirounga) is the world's largest seal . There are two species of elephant seals, named according to the hemisphere in which they are found. Northern elephant seals (M. angustirostris) are found in coastal waters around Canada and Mexico, while southern elephant seals (M. leonina) are found off the coast of New Zealand, South Africa, and Argentina.\nDescription David Merron Photography/Getty Images The oldest confirmed elephant seal fossils date back to the Pliocene Petane Formation of New Zealand. Only the adult male (bull) \"elephant of the sea\" has the large proboscis that resembles an elephant's trunk. The bull uses the proboscis to roar during the mating season. The large nose acts as a rebreather, allowing the seal to reabsorb moisture when it exhales. During the mating season, seals don't leave the beach, so they must conserve water. Southern elephant seals are a bit larger than northern elephant seals. Males of both species are much larger than females. An average adult southern male may weigh 3,000 kg (6,600 lb) and reach a length of 5 m (16 ft), while the adult female (cow) weighs about 900 kg (2,000 lb) and it measures about 3 m (10 ft) long. Seal color depends on gender, age, and season. Elephant seals may be rust, light or dark brown, or gray. The seal has a large body, short front flippers with nails, and webbed hind flippers. There is a thick blubber layer beneath the skin to insulate the animals in cold water. Each year, elephant seals molt the skin and fur above the blubber. The molting process occurs on land, during which time the seal is susceptible to cold. The average lifespan of a southern elephant seal is 20 to 22 years, while the lifespan of a northern elephant seal is about 9 years.\nReproduction Brent Stephenson/naturepl.com/Getty Images At sea, elephant seals range solo. They return to established breeding colonies each winter. Females become mature around 3 to 6 years of age, while males mature at 5 to 6 years. However, males need to achieve alpha status to mate, which is normally between the ages of 9 and 12. Males battle each other using bodyweight and teeth. While deaths are rare, scarring is common. An alpha male's harem ranges from 30 to 100 females. Other males wait on the edges of the colony, sometimes mating with females before the alpha male chases them away. Males remain on land over the winter to defend territory, meaning they don't leave to hunt. About 79 percent of adult females mate, but a little over half of the first-time breeders fail to produce a pup. A cow has one pup per year, following an 11 month gestation period. So, females arrive at the breeding grounds already pregnant from the previous year. Elephant seal milk is extremely high in milk fat, rising to over 50 percent fat (compared to 4 percent fat in human milk). Cows don't eat during the one month needed to nurse a pup. Mating occurs during the last few days of nursing.\nDiet and Behavior Richard Herrmann/Getty Images Elephant seals are carnivores. Their diet includes squid, octopuses, eels, rays, skates, crustaceans, fish, krill, and occasionally penguins. Males hunt on the ocean floor, while females hunt in the open ocean. Seals use eyesight and vibrations of their whiskers (vibrissae) to find food. Seals are preyed upon by sharks, killer whales, and humans. Elephant seals spend about 20 percent of their lives on land and about 80 percent of their time in the ocean. Although they are aquatic animals, seals on sand can outrun humans. In the sea, they can swim at a speed of 5 to 10 km/hr. Elephant seals dive to great depths. Males spend more time underwater than females. An adult may spend two hours underwater and dive to 7,834 feet. Blubber is not the only adaptation that allows seals to dive so deeply. The seals have large abdominal sinuses to hold oxygenated blood. They also have more oxygen-carrying red blood cells than other animals and can store oxygen in muscles with myoglobin. Seals exhale before diving to avoid getting the bends.\nConservation Status Danita Delimont/Getty Images Elephant seals have been hunted for their meat, fur, and blubber. Both northern and southern elephant seals were hunted to the brink of extinction. By 1892, most people believed the northern seals to be extinct. But in 1910, a single breeding colony was found around Guadalupe Island off Mexico's Baja California coast. At the end of the 19th century, new marine conservation legislation was put in place to protect the seals. Today, elephant seals are no longer endangered, although they are at risk of entanglement in debris and fishing nets and from injury due to boat collisions. The IUCN lists the threat level as being of \"least concern.\""}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephants are socially complex - Welcome to ElephantVoices", "url": "https://www.elephantvoices.org/elephant-sense-a-sociality-4/elephants-are-socially-complex.html", "text": "Elephants are well-known for their intelligence, close family ties and social complexity, and they remember for years other individuals and places. They live in a fluid fission-fusion society with relationships radiating out from the mother-offspring bond through families, bond groups, clans, independent males and beyond to strangers.\nSpecial relationships between individual elephants may last a lifetime, though the quality of these relationships and the structure and degree of cohesion in an individual's social network may change through time.\nLike many sexually dimorphic mammals, adult male and female elephants live in very different social worlds. A complex network of bonds between individuals and families characterizes the lives of females and their offspring, while fluctuating sexual cycles distinguish the dynamic activities and relationships of males.\nIndividuals, Personalities and relationships\nElephants have strong individual personalities that affect how they interact with other elephants, how others perceive them, and how well they are able to influence members of their group. For example, some elephants are popular while others are not. Some elephants show strong leadership qualities, others do not; some are highly social \"extroverts\", while others are less social, \"introverts.\"\nIn order to better understand the personalities of individual elephants, members of the Amboseli Elephant Research Project (AERP) completed a Personality Questionnaire form (developed for people) for the adult members of Echo's family. Each elephant was rated on a scale of 1-7 on characteristics such as: active, aggressive, apprehensive, confident, curious, deferential, eccentric and so on. You can read about the result in the book by the Amboseli Trust for Elephants, The Amboseli Elephants: A Long-Term Perspective on a Long-Lived Mammal.\nElephant leadership - the Matriarch\nNo individual or individual personality has more impact on family structure and fortunes than the matriarch, or female leader, of an elephant family. Matriarchs are generally the oldest and largest adult female member of a family. In some cases it is very obvious who the leader of a family is - she is the individual to whom others orient, whose sudden change in activity they note, and whose leadership they turn to in a moment of crisis. In other families, the matriarch's leadership is less clear, and in still others there may be conflict over who is the leader. The reasons for these differences have to do with personality, genetic relationships and history.\nMatriarchs express their dominance in both competitive and cooperative situations. Matriarchs have been traditionally thought of as rather autocratic, making most decisions and leading a rather docile group of \"followers.\" While this may be the case in some populations and in some families, it has not been our observation. In general, we find that any member of a family may make a suggestion about a plan of action. Suggestions are typically made by adults, though on occasion even a juvenile may offer a suggestion.\nSome elephants are natural born leaders and they begin to display their abilities at an early age. The most successful leaders seem to be confident, well-connected individuals who are able to command the respect of others both through their wisdom and charisma. A suggested plan of action by an individual may be ignored, discussed, negotiated, or simply followed without further ado. It is true that if a matriarch makes a suggestion there tends to be less discussion than if a suggestion is made by another member of the family - but even this does not always hold true. Very often the matriarch has to argue her case and in many instances she loses her argument to the combined will of other members of the family (if you want to know how elephants discuss, then you'll have to learn more on the vocalization database!).\nQualities of a good matriarch\nSo, if the matriarch is not crucial in day-to-day decision-making, when is she important? Successful matriarchs are not self-appointed leaders of their family; they are leaders because members of their family respect them, and they are respected because they have proven over the years that they can be trusted to make wise decisions in a time of crisis. Through the years older females become \"repositories\" of social and ecological knowledge. So natural leadership qualities (personality) and long experience combined are the makings of a wise matriarch. Individuals living in families with older, more experienced matriarchs seem to gain more (in terms of survivorship) from her experience. However, not all matriarchs make wise decisions. Many families split up soon after the death of a matriarch and we believe that this may be partly related to conflict within the group over the new leader.\nWhat are the qualities of a good matriarch? Why are some matriarchs able to hold their family together while under the leadership of others families fall apart? We do not have answers to these questions though we will hazard an educated guess. A successful matriarch needs to be both genetically and socially well connected to all members of her family. In essence this means that she must use her social skills to show compassion and care toward all members of her extended family (not just her own daughters). She must prove to the others that she is worthy of being their leader - by her display of courage and wisdom in times of crisis, by her awesome memory of places and individuals in tough or dangerous times, by her intricate use of tactics in socially difficult situations, and through her excellent social skills to regularly and consistently build, maintain and reinforce the close bonds within her family. In the end, however, when families become very large, and the costs of competition outweigh the benefits of cooperation, even the best matriarch may not be able to hold a family together.\nSocial Organization and Families\nAn elephant family consists of one or more usually related adult females and their immature offspring who feed, rest, move and interact in a coordinated manner and have close and friendly ties. Members of a family show extraordinary teamwork and are highly cooperative in group defense, resource acquisition, offspring care, and decision-making. Members of a family greet one another with a special \"Greeting Ceremony.\" While cooperative behavior occurs most often between closely related individuals, kin selection does not explain all such behavior and a proportion of cooperative behavior within families can be explained by reciprocal altruism.\nThe intricate teamwork witnessed between members of an elephant family is to a large extent mediated by a complex suite of vocalizations. Day to day decision-making involves broad participation including consensus building. In Amboseli families contain anywhere from 2 to 16 adult females (that is, females over the age of 10). A matriarch, usually the oldest and most respected female, leads each family. Families may consist of as few as two or as many as 50 or more individuals.\nThe term \"family\" or \"family unit\" has meant different things to different people. Over more than three decades of observations in Amboseli we have witnessed the formation of new families and the dissolution of others. These changes occur over the course of many years as a complex network of relationships is built up or breaks down, and therefore it can be difficult to define at what point in time a particular group of individuals has become or ceased to be a family unit.\nBond Groups\nAbove the level of the family unit a second tier of relationships may exist within what is termed a bond group. Like the family, bond group membership is also usually determined by genetic relatedness. A bond group may include as many as five or more families, and up to 50 or more individuals. Although the ties between individuals across the bond group are weaker than those within a family, bond group members also have close and friendly ties, form alliances against aggressors, assist in the care of another's offspring, defend one another in times of danger and greet one another in a special way.\nBond groups are usually formed as the bonds within a family weaken and families begin to split up along matrilines. In different habitats there exists an optimum family size where the benefits of group living outweigh the costs of competition for resources. As a threshold is reached and the costs begin to outweigh the benefits the family will begin to break up - especially during periods of low food availability. In Amboseli it appears that mothers, daughters and sisters are most likely to stay together, while the fissures tend to divide cousins.\nThe cohesion of different families and bond groups varies significantly and depends upon a number of factors, including personalities, the degree of relatedness and friendship between individuals, the strength of the matriarchs' leadership, historical events such as deaths of important individuals, the type of habitat, and the season.\nClans\nAn elephant clan is the next social level and has been defined as those families who share the same dry season home range. These are elephants who share the same foraging areas when resources are in scarce supply. A clan is usually made up of several bond groups and numerous families such that several hundred elephants may make up a clan. Families tend to use their own clan area for foraging when times are hard, but during times of plenty they typically gather together in large social aggregations moving wherever there is good food available and a stimulating social life. In these aggregations several clans may intermingle. When resources allow, elephants will often choose to be in large aggregations, which frequently include several different clans. It is perhaps as a result of the positive experiences in these big social gatherings that some individuals decide to \"move home\" and establish residence and membership in a new clan.\nAlthough clan membership is relatively static, over the course of four decades in Amboseli much has changed. While some elephants, like members of Echo's family, are still using exactly the same home range as they were 35 years ago, other individuals have changed clans, changed bond groups and even changed families! Dramatic and dynamic changes have taken place in the lives of these individuals.\nMales\nYoung male elephants grow up in the tightly bonded society of females and as calves and juveniles they maintain close relationships with their relatives and participate in the many social events that affect their family, albeit at a lower intensity than their female age-mates. Males depart from their natal family anywhere from 9 to 18 years of age - a process that can take anywhere from 1 to 4 years. As a teenager a male elephant must learn a whole new set of rules based on his rank relative to each other male in the population, and his fluctuating sexual state. His transition from one society to the other changes gradually, but dramatically, over a period of eight or more years.\nIndependent males are often seen in small, all-male groups and they form lasting friendships with certain individuals, although these are looser arrangements than among female elephants. During sexually active periods males rove from one family group to the next in search of receptive females. Their interactions with family members are gentle and courteous, but rarely more. Once a male has located a receptive female he will, if he is competitively able, go into consort with her for a period of 2-3 days and then he will move on in search of another female.\nPopulations\nA population of elephants can be defined as a community of individuals linked by genetic and social relationships of mating and parenthood. For instance, the Amboseli elephant population utilizes a cross-border area of Kenya and Tanzania around the northern and northwestern side of Kilimanjaro. The Amboseli elephants interact with at least three different populations: The Kilimanjaro forest and Kitumbeini populations in Tanzania and the Tsavo population in Kenya. Between these populations there exists some gene flow, but this remains at very low levels.\nThe Kilimanjaro elephants come in small groups to visit Amboseli several times during the course of a year. Amboseli males mate with Kilimanjaro females, but the reverse rarely occurs as the Kilimanjaro males are smaller in body size and cannot compete with Amboseli males for access to females. We have evidence now that some of our males travel as far as the Kitumbeini area in Tanzania, a distance of over 100 km, and we know that a male who we believe originally came from Amboseli and is included in the Amboseli population records, travels well into the range of the Tsavo population, on the north eastern side of the Chyulu Hills.\nLarge Social Networks\nThe three elephant species, the African savanna elephant, Loxodonta africana, the African forest elephant, L. cyclotis, and the Asian elephant, Elephas maximus, are large brained, intelligent and highly social mammals. Exceptionally long lived, elephants live in a fluid fission-fusion society accumulating social and ecological knowledge over decades.\nAfrican savanna elephants typically live in larger family groups than either of the two other elephant species, and they are more often found in large aggregations. As a consequence, it is possible that the number, variety and complexity of their interactions and relationships may be even greater than the two other elephant species. In Amboseli a female elephant may physically encounter hundreds of other individuals in the course of her daily range. The individuals she meets will be related to her by different degrees, and known to her based on the frequency and the quality of their previous meetings and these factors will shape the nature and define the form of the relationship. An adult male, too, may meet and interact with hundreds of different individuals in the course of a day, though the type and nature of his relationships may be tempered by on his age and sexual state.\nSome of the calls used by elephants are powerful low frequency vocalizations that carry over long distances. Elephant can recognize the voices of hundreds of other elephants from up to 2 kilometers away. Family members in particular have an extensive vocal repertoire and an unusually large communication network, a phenomenon that may be unique to long-lived mammals like elephants with fluid social systems, long-range signaling capacities and the mental capacity for extensive social recognition."}

While some of these animals can see the same way humans do, the rest have limited vision. One of the animals with a different view of the world is the elephant.\nElephants have a vision that has been instrumental in their survival and navigation of forests and savannas. Their eyes and eyesight are crafted in a way that is markedly different from what you would probably expect.\nHow much do elephants depend on their vision? Here are some interesting facts about the eyes and vision of an elephant.\nWhat Color Are Elephants\u2019 Eyes\nElephants have amazing eyes that come in various colors. Their most common eye colors are dark brown, light brown, honey, and gray.\nBesides those stated above, elephants have several other eye color possibilities including blue-gray, gold, green, and yellow. In very rare instances, some elephants have differently colored right and left eyes.\nCan Elephants See Color?\nCoupled with the fact that they have poor vision, elephants are also color blind. They have only two types of color sensors during the day; these sensors are the green and red cones.\nColor-blind elephants tend to have the same set of visual pigments as color-blind humans. Although they can see blues and yellows, elephants cannot distinguish between reds and greens.\nElephants have what researchers call arrhythmic vision. This is a type of vision that changes with time. At night elephants are more sensitive to blue and violet lights, and this allows them to see more easily when there is little light.\nHow Many Eyes Do Elephants Have?\nJust like every other animal, elephants have two eyes, but interestingly they have three eyelids. They have the regular upper & lower eyelid and a third eyelid that moves across the eye.\nThe eyelids help protect the elephant\u2019s eyes while it feeds, bathes, and cools down.\nIn addition to having three eyelids, elephants also possess very long eyelashes. These lashes play an important role in keeping particles such as dust, sand, and debris out of the elephant\u2019s eyes.\nHow Big Are Elephants\u2019 Eyes?\nDespite their massive size, the eyes of an elephant are not as big as one would expect. The African Elephant, for example, stands at about 8.2 to 13 feet tall and weighs about 5000 to 14000 lbs. But its eyes measure just about 3.8cm (1.5 in) in diameter.\nWhen compared to the human eye, the elephant eye is only slightly bigger. The human eye measures around 2.5cm (1 in) in diameter.\nWhy Elephants\u2019 Eyes Are So Small Compared to Their Head\nThe most probable reason why elephants have small eyes is that they have big ears and a refined sense of smell.\nElephants rely more on their sense of smell and hearing than on their eyesight to navigate around their environment. These other senses help to make up for their poor eyesight.\nHow Good Is an Elephant\u2019s Eyesight?\nElephants have relatively poor eyesight. Elephants eyes are located on the side of their heads. With their eyes in this position, they have better peripheral vision.\nHowever, elephants lack depth perception, and their vision is largely limited. They are generally short-sighted and can only see distances up to 25 feet.\nElephants are usually born blind. In the early stages, they rely on their other senses to help navigate their way around their new world.\nAs their vision begins to improve through the years, they use it to seek out food and keep an eye on other calves. However, the eyes of an elephant will remain small, and at best, it will provide moderate vision.\nWhen there\u2019s drought in the wild, elephants journey long distances to find new sources of food and water. There is a higher chance of them smelling or hearing the water than actually seeing it.\nElephants can see better when under shade. But under the full sunlight of open savanna, their sight is markedly unremarkable.\nElephants that have adapted to staying under shade develop rounder pupils because of the reduced exposure to sunlight.\nSome elephants usually have a white ring around their iris as they get older. The ring bears similarities to the age ring that we humans have as we grow older. These rings are called arcus lipoides, and they do not disturb their vision.\nElephants usually spend a lot of time eating and will always stay up at night to get enough food. They barely have more than two hours of sleep at night.\nWith them having to spend most of their time in the dark, elephants have been able to adapt their eyes to see when there is limited exposure to light. This enables them to forage out of the heat of the sun, although they have to sacrifice their daytime vision.\nDo Elephants Have Tear Ducts?\nTear ducts, which are usually found in humans and other mammals, help to drain tears out of the eye as they flush out dirt. Being mammals, you would expect elephants to have tear ducts, but they do not.\nInstead of a tear duct, elephants have what is called a nictitating membrane.\nThe nictitating membrane is located in the elephants\u2019 third eyelid. It is responsible for producing the fluid in the aqueous layer of their eyes. So, it functions somewhat like a tear duct.\nConclusion\nElephants have relatively small eyes that can come in several different colors. They see more clearly at night although it is still not their strongest sense. Although they are color blind and don\u2019t have extremely keen vision, Elephants have other very strong senses like hearing and smell that make up for this deficiency.\nResources\nPlease share!"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "How Much Do Elephants Weigh? - AZ Animals", "url": "https://a-z-animals.com/blog/how-much-do-elephants-weight/", "text": "The elephant is the largest land animal on the planet. There are three kinds of elephants with scientist recently splitting the African elephant into two distinct species. The three elephant species are African savanna (or bush), African forest and Asian elephant. Let\u2019s take a look at all three to see how much these giant creatures weigh.\nSo, How Much Does an Elephant Weigh?\nElephants generally weigh between 4,500 and 11,000 pounds on average. How large an elephant gets depends on which of the three elephant species it is. However, the largest elephant on record weighed 24,000 pounds (more on this below!), so in very rare cases they can weigh truly extraordinary weights!\nElephants are the largest land animals on Earth, but let\u2019s dig a little deeper into the weight of different elephant species.\n#3 The third heaviest elephant is the African forest elephant.\nAn African forest elephant mother with her calf, at the Dzanga saline (a forest clearing) in the Central African Republic.\nThe Africa forest elephant lives in the rainforests of west and central Africa. They have the fewest numbers and are considered endangered. As babies elephants start out at 200 lbs and grow to be 1-3 tons (4,400-8,800lbs). My mini-van weighs 4,600lbs so it is about the size of a small African forest elephant!\n#2 The second heaviest elephant is the Asian elephant.\nAn Asian elephant bathing in a river Dmytro Gilitukha/Shutterstock.com\nThe truth is, ranking the African forest elephant and Asian elephant is an inexact science, as you could make an argument for either one being larger. Male Asian elephants typically weigh up to 8,800 pounds (similar to African forest elephants) while females weight up to about 6,000 pounds. The largest Asian elephant ever recorded weighed about 15,400 pounds. On the other hand, African forest elephants were only recently recognized as a distinct species, so it\u2019s hard to say just how large they get!\nThe bottom line, both the elephant species that typically live in forest environments are smaller than the largest elephant on this list, the savanna (or bush) elephant that lives across African plains.\n#1 The heaviest elephant is the African bush elephant!\nElephants communicate in a variety of ways \u2013 including sounds like trumpet calls (some sounds are too low for people to hear), body language, touch and scent. Sadly, about 90% of African elephants have been wiped out in the last century due to poaching.\nAfrican bush elephants live in sub-Saharan Africa on the plains and savannas. Literally the biggest baby, African savanna babies weigh an average of 264 lbs with some starting out as big as 364 lbs! Makes sense because when they are adults they can reach 7 tons or more. They range in size from 2.5-7 tons (5,000-14,000lbs). A large African savanna elephant is about the size of your favorite street taco truck!\nWhat part of the elephant is the heaviest?\nElephants use their tusks to help protect their territory.\nBig Brain: 10 lbs\nA research study showed that an African elephant\u2019s brain weighs 10 lbs and has 257 billion neurons! That is three times bigger and has three times more neurons than a human brain.\nGiant Tooth: 11 lbs\nThe back molars of an African elephant can weigh 11 lbs and get to be 16 inches wide!\nGinormous Ears: 100 lbs EACH\nAfrican elephant ears are used to help elephants stay cool. Their ears can be 6ft tall!\nHeavy Tusks: 110-175 lbs EACH\nBoth male and female Africa elephants can grow tusks. The adult male tusks are 110-175lbs each and the female tusks are quite a bit smaller at 40-44lbs.\nWhat is the heaviest elephant ever recorded?\nHenry, the largest elephant on record, can be found at the entrance to the Smithsonian Natural History Museum\nIf you pull up the Smithsonian website you will see it! If you want to see it in person you can travel to the Smithsonian Museum and see it in the lobby, all 11 tons of it. That is 24,000 lbs! A Hungarian game hunter donated the hide of this enormous elephant in 1959. It was shot in Angola and the hide was preserved. The elephant on display has been given the name \u201cHenry\u201d and is carefully cleaned and maintained by museum staff. Most rooms have 8ft ceilings so Henry wouldn\u2019t fit. A school bus weighs around 24,000 lbs, the same as Henry. Now that is a big elephant!"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "What Is The World's Largest Elephant? - AZ Animals", "url": "https://a-z-animals.com/blog/largest-elephants/", "text": "Most experts recognize three species of elephants: two from Africa and the Asian elephant. But which one is the biggest of the three?\nAnd just how big is the world\u2019s largest ever recorded elephant?\nThere are some distinguishing features between different species of elephants. Three notable things are size, ear shape, and tusks. Elephants will use their tusks for digging, lifting, gathering food, and defense. In the same way, humans are right or left-handed, elephants have a dominant side. You can tell this by looking at the tusks. The dominant side will show wear in the tusk.\nElephants are vegetarians. Their diet consists of grasses, fruits, leaves, bark, and roots. They consume food 16-18 hours every day, eating 300-350 pounds of food. The female elephant has one calf every four to five years. The calf will stay with the herd for many years, being cared for by the entire herd. Females will continue to stay with the herd into adulthood, but the male calves will leave the herd when they reach puberty.\nAs a highly intelligent species, elephants can problem solve and show emotions such as empathy and mourning. They will take care of others in their herd, care for the young and the weak or injured, protect them, and nurture them back to health. When meeting elephants from other herds, they will greet one another by using their trunks by holding them up high or inserting them into each other\u2019s mouths as a greeting.\nBelow you\u2019ll find a listing of the largest elephants in the world. First we\u2019ll analyze which species and subspecies are largest, and then we\u2019ll detail the largest elephant to ever live!\n# 3 Largest Elephant: Asian Elephant (Elephas maximus)\nElephants are incredibly intelligent and have been known to show emotion and use logic. Travel landscapes/Shutterstock.com\nThe adult Asian elephant grows between 6.6 and 9.8 feet tall, weighs in at 4,500 to 11,000 pounds, and will live up to 60 years. These elephants have smaller and round ears with one finger-like part to help them pick things up. Male elephants grow tusks that are usually large, although some male tusks are much smaller. The smaller tusks are called tushes and are not always seen outside the mouth. Asian female elephants do not grow tusks.\nElephants travel in matriarchal herds. They usually have six or seven females, with the eldest leading the herd. They can communicate up to 2 miles by making low-pitched sounds. As a highly social species, elephants will sometimes meet up with other herds. The matriarch or eldest female in the herd is in charge of remembering the best places for food, water, and shelter. She will also teach the younger elephants in the herd how to socialize.\nAs herbivores, their favorite foods are bananas, rice, and sugarcane and grazing on grass and trees. They will always be near a water source.\nIn Asian culture, the elephant is considered an important cultural icon. There are less than 50,000 Asian elephants in existence and three subspecies of Asian elephants. These are Indian, Sumatran, and Sri Lankan.\n#3.3 Largest Elephant Subspecies: Sumatran (Elephas maximus sumatranus)\nThe Sumatran elephant typically has brighter skin with fewer de-pigmented spots. Male elephants of the Sumatran subspecies grow shorter tusks, and the female tusks are barely visible. They live on the Sumatra Island of Indonesia.\nPossibly the most social of the elephant species, the Sumatran elephants will form herds of 20-35 elephants. Like the other elephant species, the males will leave the herd upon puberty while the females continue to stay with the herd. The young females will then take on a nanny role for the younger elephants. Communication is essential. The elephants will keep in contact to protect the integrity of their herd.\n#3.2 Largest Elephant Subspecies: Indian (Elephas maximus indicus)\nThe Indian elephant lives in the grassland, dry deciduous forest, moist deciduous forest, and evergreen and semi-evergreen forest of Asia, moving around frequently. They do not like to stay in one place for more than a day or two.\nNonterritorial, they travel in herds of up to 20 elephants. Unlike some of the other species of elephants, males will join the herds.\nHuman activities and agricultural development have limited these elephants from previous seasonal migration habits. Some have been known to raid farms, settlements, and plantations that were in their original range.\nThe Indian elephant has been semi-domesticated and is used in logging camps and the tourist industry. In the past, they were used as animals of war.\n#3.1 Largest Elephant Subspecies: Sri Lankan (Elephas maximus)\nThe Sri Lankan elephant is the largest of the Asian species, with the largest individuals having reached past 12,000 pounds! One distinguishing feature of the Sri Lankan elephant is a lack of pigmentation on the elephant\u2019s ears, face, trunk, and belly.\nHuman development has limited the migration habits of the elephant. They are found on the Island of Sri Lanka around the open grasslands, forested regions, open savannas, marshes, and lakeshores.\nAfrican Elephants\nAfrican elephants are the world\u2019s largest land animals! Peter Fodor/Shutterstock.com\nThe adult African elephant grows between 8.2 and 13 feet tall, weighs in at 5,000 to 14,000 pounds, and will live up to 70 years. Larger ears, much like the shape of the continent they inhabit, are distinguishing features of the African elephant. Males and females grow large tusks with two finger-like parts that help them pick up things.\nThe African elephant is the larger than its Asian counterparts; it is the largest animal on earth. Dwelling in Africa, these elephants find their homes in 37 countries. They use their trunks and tusks for communication and to handle objects. The large ears are used to radiate excess heat. Their tusks will grow their entire lifespan.\nAfrican elephants also travel in herds. Mothers and their young will stay together for many years in a herd. The males will stay in loosely connected relationships at best. They prefer a solitary lifestyle. The African elephants are considered a threatened species due to fewer poachers seeking their ivory tusks and diminished food sources. There are currently between 400,000-500,000 African elephants in existence.\nThere are two species of African elephants: the savanna, or bush elephant, and the forest elephant.\n#2 Largest Species: Forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis)\nThe Forest subspecies of the African elephant are the smaller of the two subspecies. They have slightly smaller, oval-shaped, and their tusks are straighter, pointing downward. Maxing out at 8-10 feet and 2-5 tons, this elephant makes its home in the dense forests of Gabon, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Cameroon, and the Central African Republic in central Africa and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia, and Ghana in West Africa.\nThis subspecies is considered critically endangered, having 60% of the population lost to poachers seeking their ivory tusks in the last ten years. It is difficult for the species to reproduce at a fast enough rate to compensate for this population loss because they don\u2019t reach sexual maturity until they are 23 years old. It also takes approximately two years for gestation. Experts say it would take over 80 years to recoup the 60% loss, assuming the poaching stopped now.\n#1 African Elephant Species: Savanna or Bush elephant (Loxodonta africana)\nElephants are the largest land animals on Earth, and they\u2019re one of the most unique-looking animals, too. With their characteristic long noses, or trunks; large, floppy ears; and wide, thick legs, there is no other animal with a similar physique. Aelice/Shutterstock.com\nThe larger of the two species of African elephants is the savanna elephant. Their larger ears and their legs distinguish them. The front legs of a Savanna elephant are longer than their back legs. The Savanna elephant calls eastern and southern Africa home, specifically Botswana, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Namibia, Mozambique, and South Africa.\nThey also travel in family herds, with an average of 10 mothers and their young. The males follow along only during the mating season. Occasionally the herds will join together in larger clans of several hundred members.\nThe savanna elephant has 40,000-120,000 muscles and tendons in its trunk and can lift 400 pounds. They will use their trunks to lift objects or suck water into the trunk, then blow it into their mouths to drink, or blow it on their backs to cool off.\nThe male elephant will use their tusks for sparring with other males for mating rights, and the males with the largest tusks tend to sire more offspring. Poachers seek elephants with the largest tusks, so they get more ivory. As a result, the mating males have smaller tusks. The sad consequence is the offspring will have smaller tusks or not even have tusks.\nBonus: The Largest Elephant on Record\n\u201cHenry\u201d on display at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum\nThe largest elephant ever recorded is seen by millions of tourists annually. That\u2019s because the specimen is in the rotunda of the Smithsonian\u2019s Museum of Natural History!\nThe elephant has been named \u201cHenry\u201d and stands 13 feet tall. He was shot in 1956 in Angola and given to the Smithsonian Institute in 1959. With a weight of 24,000 pounds, Henry is the largest elephant ever recorded."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "12 of the Oldest Elephants Ever Recorded - AZ Animals", "url": "https://a-z-animals.com/blog/the-worlds-oldest-elephant/", "text": "Elephants are huge herbivores and are the largest land mammals in the world. Easily distinguished by their grey skin, long trunk, and large ears, elephants are one of the most intelligent animals around. From expressing grief and mourning for weeks to playing a pivotal role in maintaining the shape of the landscape, elephants are incredibly fascinating animals. Not only that but they can live for a pretty long time too, with a lifespan of around 70 years. Here we\u2019ll discover exactly how old the world\u2019s oldest elephant is and see how elephants compare against other mammals.\nHow Many Species of Elephants are there?\nAsian elephants are one of three species of elephant\nThere are three recognized species of elephants alive today \u2013 African bush, African forest, and Asian. There are also three subspecies of the Asian elephant \u2013 Sumatran, Sri Lankan, and Indian.\nWhere the elephants are found is dependent on which species they are, with African and Asian elephants never coming into contact with each other. African bush elephants live in the forests, grasslands, and wetlands of Central and Southern Africa, while African forest elephants prefer the rainforests of Central and Western Africa. Meanwhile, Asian elephants generally live in the grasslands and deciduous forests of Asia. The Indian subspecies is found in mainland Asia, Sri Lankan elephants are native to Sri Lanka, and Sumatran is native to Sumatra.\nDifferences Between Elephant Species\nAfrican elephants have ears shaped like the African continent Attila JANDI/Shutterstock.com\nThere are only slight differences between the African forest elephant and the African bush elephant, with the most noticeable difference being their tusks. The tusks on African forest elephants are straighter and point downwards while on African bush elephants they curve outwards. Also, African bush elephants are generally bigger than African forest elephants.\nHowever, there are significant differences between African elephants in general and Asian elephants. One of the most distinguishable differences between the two is the \u201cfingers\u201d on the trunk. African elephants have two \u201cfingers\u201d while Asian elephants only have a single one. There are also noticeable differences between their ears \u2013 Asian elephants have much smaller ears than African elephants. Elephants use their ears to dissipate body heat as they have a lot of blood vessels close to the surface of the skin to help them cool off. As African elephants live in a much hotter climate than Asian elephants they need bigger ears to help them cool down. Amazingly, their ears are actually shaped like the continent of Africa.\nAlso, African elephants are much taller and heavier than Asian elephants. The tallest point on an African elephant is the shoulder, while the tallest point on an Asian elephant is the top of the head. Asian elephants have different shaped heads to African elephants, with a \u201cdouble-domed\u201d head rather than a broad, flat one. African bush elephants are the largest species and weigh around 13,000 pounds and reach 13 feet at the shoulder. Asian elephants are smaller and male-only weigh 8,800 pounds and reach around 9 feet. There are also differences between the tusks as only male Asian elephants have tusks. However, both male and female African elephants can have tusks.\nThe World\u2019s Oldest Elephant\nThe oldest elephant in the world was an Asian elephant who reached 89 years of age SOMMAI/Shutterstock.com\nThe oldest elephant in the world was an Asian elephant named Changalloor Dakshayani who reached 89 years old. Chengalloor Dakshayani was a female who was born in 1930 and died on 5th February 2019. From the age of 19 she lived at the Thiruvarattu Kavu temple. From the late 1960\u2019s she moved to the Chenkalloor Mahadeva Temple in India where she was used in temple rituals and parades.\nPrior to Chengalloor Dakshayani, the record was held by another Asian elephant \u2013 Lin Wang \u2013 who was 86 when he died. For many years Lin Wang was used by the Chinese Expeditionary Force along with several other elephants to carry supplies and pull artillery guns. During this time he served in the Second Sino-Japanese War and later in World War II. After the end of the war, he remained in service with the army until he was the only elephant remaining from the ones he had originally served with during the war. In 1952 the army gave him to Taipei Zoo where he remained for the rest of his life.\n12 of the Oldest Elephants to Ever Live\nHere is a list of 11 of the oldest elephants ever to live that includes the oldest African Bush elephant, the oldest surviving bull elephant in North America, and more:\nCasey (52 years old): The oldest ever recorded African Bush elephant in captivity.

Lin Wang served in World War II and lived out the remainder of his life at the Taipei Zoo. Changalloor Kakshayani (89 years old): The oldest elephant to ever live in captivity with a lifespan ranging from 1930 to 2019.\nDo Elephants Live Longer than Other Mammals?\nElephants can live for more than 70 years\nDespite being able to live to an impressive age for an animal, elephants actually aren\u2019t the only mammals with a long lifespan. Us humans are one of the longest living land mammals, with the oldest recorded age being 124.\nHowever, the longest living mammal is actually the bowhead whale which has a lifespan of more than 200 years. Incredibly, this has actually been confirmed as stone harpoon tips have been recovered from several bowhead whales after they\u2019ve died. Scientists have then been able to date the harpoon tips to give an accurate estimation of the age of the whales.\nBehavior of Elephants\nElephants live in herds led by a matriarch\nMost elephants live in herds, and these are led by the oldest and largest female who is the matriarch. The matriarch is respected by all of the herd and is the one that the others look to as a decision-maker. Females give birth approximately every four years and gestation lasts 22 months, making it the longest gestation of all mammals. Baby elephants are called calves and are looked after by other females in the herd as well as their mothers.\nMales and females live separately as young males leave the herd at around 15 years old and join \u201cbachelor herds\u201d with other young males. Once they are fully mature they usually break off and become solitary. Males don\u2019t mate with the females until they are approximately 20 years old as they are then strong enough to compete with other males.\nAs well as being majestic, elephants are highly intelligent too. They can remember places and people for years and are able to express several emotions \u2013 including joy, anger, grief, and compassion. When a herd of elephants comes across the remains of a deceased elephant they will usually touch the body with their trunk. They also cover the body with leaves and branches to bury them. If it\u2019s a member of their own herd that has died then they often remain with them for days or even weeks, standing vigil over them while grieving.\nElephants also like to wallow in mud and use their trunks to spray water over their backs. However, there is an important reason they do this as it helps to remove parasites and insects from their skin. Once the mud has dried on their skin they then rub themselves against a hard surface which then removes the parasites.\nEcosystem and Conservation\nElephants play an important role in maintaining ecosystems Donovan van Staden/Shutterstock.com\nUnfortunately, elephants are under serious threat. African bush elephants and Asian elephants are classed as endangered, while African forest elephants are critically endangered. In fact, it is estimated that elephants could even go extinct within twenty years unless something changes.\nTheir natural predators are lions, hyenas, and crocodiles, although they will usually only prey on young, ill or injured animals. However, the biggest threat to elephants is humans, particularly through poaching. Elephants are hunted for their ivory tusks and even for their meat in some areas. Habitat loss is another serious threat to elephants through things such as logging. Much is being done to try to protect elephants, including maintaining the \u201celephant corridors\u201d. This are narrow strips of land connecting two larger habitats for the elephants to travel on without coming into contact with humans.\nHowever, elephants actually play an incredibly important part in maintaining the ecosystem and in the conservation of other animals. They help to shape the habitat and in the dry seasons, they use their tusks to rip up dry river beds and help to create new watering holes. Also, in the bush, they uproot trees, which keep the plains open for animals such as zebra, antelope, and wildebeest. In the forests, elephants use their size to create paths for smaller animals to get through the undergrowth. This makes them vital to many habitats and to the survival of many other species."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Surprise: Elephants Comfort Upset Friends - Animals", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/140218-asian-elephants-empathy-animals-science-behavior", "text": "The short list of animals that console stressed-out friends just got longer \u2026 and heavier.\nAsian elephants, like great apes, dogs, certain corvids (the bird group that includes ravens), and us, have now been shown to recognize when a herd mate is upset and to offer gentle caresses and chirps of sympathy, according to a study published February 18 in the online journal PeerJ.\nJoshua Plotnik, a behavioral ecologist at Mahidol University in Kanchanaburi, Thailand, and primatologist Frans de Waal, director of Emory University's Living Links Center, have shown through a controlled study what those who work with elephants have always believed: The animals, in this case captive Asian elephants (Elephas maximus), offer something akin to humans' sympathetic concern when observing distress in another, including their relatives and friends.\nIntimate Gestures\nThe scientists studied 26 elephants of varying ages at the Elephant Nature Park in the Mae Tang district of Chiang Mai Province, Thailand. (Adult male elephants were excluded for safety reasons.)\nIt would be unethical to set up stressful situations, so they instead waited patiently for such moments to occur naturally.\nA stress-inducing situation might be a dog walking by or a snake rustling the grass, or the roar or just the presence of a bull elephant. Sometimes the stressor was unknown. Regardless, scientists know elephant distress when they see it: erect tails and flared ears; vocalizations such as trumpeting, rumbling, or roaring; and sudden defecation and urination tell the story.\nOver the course of a year, they spent up to two weeks per month and three hours daily observing the animals.\nDuring these observations, the scientists witnessed bystander elephants\u2014those not directly affected by a stressor\u2014moving to and giving upset elephants physical caresses, mostly inside the mouth (which is kind of like a hug to elephants) and on the genitals. (Also see \"African Elephants Understand Human Gestures.\")\nBystanders also rumbled and chirped with vocal offerings that suggested reassurance. Sometimes the empathetic animals formed a protective circle around the distressed one.\nThere was also evidence of \"emotional contagion,\" when herd mates matched the behavior and emotional state of the upset individual. In other words, seeing a \"friend\" in distress was distressing to the observers. Those animals also consoled one another.\n\"With their strong bonds, it is not surprising that elephants show concern for others,\" says de Waal, who describes empathy as a \"general mammalian trait.\"\n\"They get distressed when they see others in distress, reaching out to calm them down, not unlike the way chimpanzees or humans embrace someone who is upset.\"\nStill, \"I was surprised at how consistent the elephants' consolation behavior was,\" says Plotnik, who is also the founder of the nonprofit Think Elephants International.\n\"Whenever an elephant showed signs of distress, a reassuring friend was sure to come console them. The number of times when elephants showed distress without a response from others was very rare.\"\nEmpathetic Elephants\nElephants, whose herds are headed by a matriarch and made of generally related females, babies, and immature males, have long been known to bond strongly with their kind.\nThey celebrate births and mourn the dead. (Watch a video of elephants grieving.) Females will \"allomother\" (help to raise another's baby) and respond fully and quickly to cries from other mothers' young.\nElephants will also aid a weaker animal\u2014such as by helping the injured along\u2014a sign of being able to consider and empathize with another's perspective.\nStill, points out de Waal, \"many people are impressed by elephant intelligence, but actual hard data are scarce. We need to study them just as carefully as we do primates, dogs, or corvids.\" (Read \"Elephants Use Their Trunks to Ace Intelligence Tests.\")\nKeeping the peace is certainly valuable to all animals in a group, so one animal \"making up\" with another after a conflict makes sense for all. But bystander empathy\u2014just being a concerned friend\u2014takes things to a different emotional level.\nThe Road to Kindness\nPlotnik says not only is this work fascinating from the \"what other animals are capable of\" perspective, it's also a wonderful example of convergent evolution, which occurs when similar traits or behaviors (in this case empathy/consolation) evolve separately (for example, in apes and elephants) as a result of similar environmental pressures.\n\"I find this very exciting, because it suggests that the buck does NOT stop with us humans when it comes to smarts!\" he says. (Read \"Inside Animal Minds\" in National Geographic magazine.)\nAlso, \"the more we learn about how elephants think; make decisions; and see, hear, and smell their worlds, the better perspective we will have when trying to find ways to mitigate conservation problems,\" he says.\nIn the meantime, it will require more studies to figure out exactly how both givers and receivers benefit from this caring display by elephants. But the nonhuman road to kindness appears to be reaching new lengths.\nJennifer S. Holland has written about animal empathy in her two books Unlikely Friendships and Unlikely Loves.

An Antarctic cruise is an icy safari, with many different species of animals to observe. One of our favourite species is the Elephant Seal, here are some fun facts about these magnificent creatures and the environment they inhabit.\n1. Males are heavier than females\nAn adult male Elephant seal can weigh up to five tonnes and measure up to six and a half metres! Females are smaller and weigh around 7 \u2013 800 kg.\n2) Babies are born after 12 months\nThe gestation period for a female Elephant seal is 9 months. They have delayed implantation, which is why babies are born after 12 months even though the pregnancy itself does last for 9.\n3) Newborn Elephant seals weight around 50 kilograms\nElephant seal babies when born weigh around 50 kilograms. Within 3 months they will weigh 150kg!\nPups are generally born from September to October when their mothers come ashore at their berthing beaches around the continent.\n4) Elephant seals love socializing\nElephant seals are highly social animals and form large groups or harems for a month during the breeding season.\n5) They are willing to dive deep for their food\nElephants seals are among the largest carnivores in the world eating squid and fish as the main sources of food in their diet, and have been measured diving up to up to 2000m deep and can hold breath for up to two hours!\n6) Elephant seals are one of the strongest living examples of sexual dimorphism\nSexual dimorphism is a physical difference between the male and female of a species. Males may be up to ten times the weight of reproductive females. Only 2 \u2013 3 % of male Elephant seals actually breed.\n7) Elephant seals can be found in several regions\nElephant seals can be found across the Antarctic region, but are most prevalent around the Antarctic Peninsula and sub-Antarctic islands. They were hunted for their blubber during the sealing days. London alone used 20,000 tonnes of elephant seal oil to light the city a year.\n8) The Northern Elephant seal was thought to be extinct in the 1800\u2019s\nHowever, from a small group of animals left, there are now an estimated population of 150,000 which live mainly around the Baja Gulf in Mexico and on the shores of Southern California, USA. These animals have grown from a small group of animals, and do lack genetic diversity, so there are still concerns over the future of these animals.\n9) The Elephant seal do have predators\nTheir main predator is the Orca, and in the northern most part of their range.. Large sharks. Leopard seals have also been known to attack and kill stray young.\n10) There is an obvious reason for their name\nThey are called elephant seals due to a number of reasons, partly because of their size and also partly because of the male snout or trunk that inflates to impress and intimidate rivals when competing with other males for his harem. The trunk is inflated with air which is inhaled and thus a loud bellowing sound is produced. The depth and volume of the sound is a demonstration to others how powerful he is, and thus so avoids fights with competing males.\nEnjoy the majestic Elephant seal on a cruise to Antarctica, but keep your distance \u2013 despite their size they can move fast on land, and are highly aggressive when protecting their territory and young. Generally they are not afraid of man, however if disturbed while resting, reproducing or marking territory they can be a different proposition. Keep clear as per most wildlife you encounter on your cruise.\nDespite once being on the endangered list, due to the protection of the Antarctic treaty, the Southern Elephant seal is no longer in any immediate danger. However, over-fishing of Antarctic waters and human activities may in the future see some issues with their native habitat.\nThanks to Dr Mikolaj Golachowski for helping put this together. Dr. Miko was a lecturer on-board our last PinkTarctica Antarctic expedition to the Peninsula and is a leading expert on Elephant seals and their behaviour. Dr. Mikolaj is a native of Poland, and was base commander of the Polish base on the Antarctic Peninsula for several seasons.\nHe graduated at the Faculty of Biology, University of Warsaw and began working there as a researcher and lecturer of Zoology and Ecology in 1995.\nWant to continue learning about seals, check out this fantastic blog on the Majestic Weddell Seal.\nVisit Antarctica Cruises for further inspiration.\nComments"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Democrats And Republicans: Why Are They Donkeys And Elephants ...", "url": "https://www.dictionary.com/e/political-parties-animal-mascots/", "text": "While the bald eagle is a national symbol for the United States, the two major political parties that govern it are often represented by two different animals: a donkey for the Democratic Party and an elephant for the Republican Party. These animals are commonly linked with these two parties in everything from political analysis to bumper stickers.\nWhy these two animals, though? Why not an ostrich and an alpaca, or some other unlikely combo? Incredibly, the popularization of both the donkey and the elephant being associated with the parties can be traced back to one person: cartoonist Thomas Nast.\nWas the donkey originally a jackass?\nThomas Nast was an American cartoonist who joined the staff of Harper\u2019s Weekly in 1862. Nast\u2019s cartoons were very popular and his depiction of Santa Claus is still the most widely used version of the holiday icon we see today. During his career, Nast also drew many political cartoons that harshly criticized the policies of both parties.\nNast first used a donkey to represent the Democratic party as a whole in the 1870 cartoon \u201cA Live Jack-Ass Kicking a Lion\u201d in which Nast criticized the dominantly Democratic Southern newspaper industry as the \u201cCopperhead Press.\u201d While he did popularize the donkey, Nast wasn\u2019t the first person to use it in reference to the Democrats.\nOver 40 years earlier during the presidential campaign of 1828, opponents of Democrat Andrew Jackson referred to him as a \u201cjackass.\u201d Jackson actually embraced the insult and used donkeys on several campaign posters. Nevertheless, cartoonist Anthony Imbert would use a Jackson-headed donkey to mock Jackson an 1833 political cartoon.\nHowever, the donkey never really caught on after the end of Jackson\u2019s presidency, and Thomas Nast apparently had no knowledge that it ever was used to represent the Democrats.\nWhat does the elephant symbolize?\nAs for the elephant, Nast first used the behemoth to represent the Republicans in the 1874 cartoon \u201cThe Third Term Panic.\u201d The cartoon depicts the Republican Party as a lumbering elephant about to walk off a cliff. As for why Nast chose an elephant, a common theory is that it is based on an old phrase of \u201cseeing the elephant\u201d which pro-Unionist Republicans used to mean that they had seen battle during the Civil War. Nast himself was a proud Republican and diehard-Unionist so it is entirely plausible he was aware of this phrase at the time.\nThomas Nast worked at Harper\u2019s Weekly until 1886. It is an understatement to say that Nast\u2019s cartoons were extraordinarily popular. President Abraham Lincoln referred to Nast as his \u201cbest recruiting sergeant\u201d and President Ulysses S. Grant, one of the highest ranking Union generals, said that Nast had done as \u201cmuch as any one man to preserve the Union and bring the war to an end.\u201d\nWith praise like that (albeit from fellow Republicans), it isn\u2019t hard to figure out why his symbolic animals would catch on with the public and other cartoonists as early as 1896. By 1926, Republicans were already embracing the elephant as an unofficial animal. By 1928, some Democrats were also acknowledging the donkey as their unofficial animal as well. In 1932, both animals were used as symbols of the parties on an official campaign poster for Republican incumbent Herbert Hoover.\nToday, the Republican Party uses the elephant as an official logo and you will find it all over their web site and on plenty of official Republican merchandise. While the Democrats have never officially embraced the donkey as a symbol, the animal is used to represent the party by the media and is placed on a plethora of unofficial Democratic party merchandise.\nHow do we use mascots in political communication?\nThe Republican Party featured elephant logos at their 2020 Republican National Convention:\nGOD BLESS THE USA! pic.twitter.com/353UXMHgKM \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 24, 2020\nDemocrats and Democratic candidates have often embraced the donkey as their unofficial mascot:\nHappy 150th birthday to the Democratic donkey! Originally intended to be insulting, we embraced the comparison with such a tough, hardworking creature. From protecting union rights to fighting for affordable healthcare, I'm proud to stand with working-class Coloradans.#COPolitics pic.twitter.com/qmrheP0cIt \u2014 Daneya Esgar (@Dlesgar) January 15, 2020\nWhen your son makes you a Father\u2019s Day card with a hand drawn Democratic donkey, you know you\u2019ve done alright. #FathersDay #BlueWave pic.twitter.com/VXt59UENk5 \u2014 Chris King (@ChrisKingFL) June 21, 2020\nThe animals began in political cartoons and still appear in many of them today. CNN featured both animals in animated political cartoon ads that depicted them as friends:\nThe Republican elephant and Democratic donkey are longtime friends in CNN's artful new election coverage ads. https://t.co/vC5meK7Hr4 \u2014 Adweek (@Adweek) August 29, 2020\nSome conservative Republicans criticize liberal Republicans as being RINOs (Republicans in Name Only) and often have (rhi)no sympathy for these \u201cleft-leaning\u201d politicians. In recent years, some members of the Libertarian Party have unofficially embraced the porcupine as the unofficial animal mascot of the party.\nWill these mascots eventually catch on like the donkey and the elephant? It\u2019s hard to tell! The stories of the donkey and the elephant certainly have their own surprising twists and turns, and would have been hard to predict.\nDid you know the United States is a democratic republic?

Learn more about this bird with these 10 interesting facts.\n01 of 10 It Was Not the Size and Weight of an Elephant but About as Tall El fosilman\u00edaco / Wikimedia Commons / CC-BY-3.0 Despite its name, the elephant bird was nowhere near the size of a full-grown elephant. However, it was about as tall. (Note: African bush elephants range from 8.2 to 13 feet tall and weigh 5,000 to 14,000 pounds, while Asian elephants range from 6.6 to 9.8 feet tall and weigh between 4,500 and 11,000 pounds.) The largest specimens the elephant bird Aepyornis were 10 feet tall and weighed about 1,000 pounds\u2014still enough to make it the biggest bird that ever lived. However, the \"bird mimic\" dinosaurs that preceded the elephant bird by tens of millions of years and had roughly the same body plan, were in fact elephant-sized. The Deinocheirus may have weighed as much as 14,000 pounds.\n02 of 10 It Lived on the Island of Madagascar Pierre-Yves Babelon / Getty Images Ratites, large, flightless birds resembling and including ostriches, tend to evolve in self-contained island environments. Such was the case with the elephant bird, which was restricted to the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar, off the eastern coast of Africa. It had the advantage of living in a habitat with plenty of lush, tropical vegetation, but scarcely anything in the way of mammalian predators, a surefire recipe for what naturalists refer to as \"insular gigantism.\"\n03 of 10 Flightless Kiwi Birds Are Its Closest Living Relatives Dave King / Getty Images For decades, paleontologists believed that ratites were related to other ratites; i.e., that the giant, flightless elephant bird of Madagascar was close evolutionary kin to the giant, flightless Moa of New Zealand. However, genetic analysis has revealed that the closest living relative of Aepyornis is the kiwi, the largest species of which weigh about seven pounds. Clearly, a small population of Kiwi-like birds landed on Madagascar eons ago, from whence their descendants evolved to giant sizes.\n04 of 10 One Fossilized Aepyornis Egg Sold for $100,000 Mint Images - Frans Lanting / Getty Images Aepyornis eggs aren't quite as rare as hen's teeth, but they're still prized by collectors. There are about a dozen fossil eggs around the world, including one at the National Geographic Society in Washington, D.C., two at the Melbourne Museum in Australia, and a whopping seven at California's Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology. In 2013, an egg in private hands was sold by Christie's auction company for $100,000, about on a par with what collectors pay for small dinosaur fossils.\n05 of 10 Marco Polo Could Have Seen It MPI / Getty Images In 1298, the famous Italian traveler Marco Polo mentioned an elephant bird in one of his narratives, which has led to over 700 years of confusion. Scholars believe that Polo was actually talking about the rukh, or roc, a mythical beast inspired by a flying, eagle-like bird (which would certainly rule out Aepyornis as the source of the legend). It's possible that Polo glimpsed an actual elephant bird from afar, as this ratite may still have been extant (albeit dwindling) in Madagascar in late medieval times.\n06 of 10 Aepyornis and Mullerornis Are Two Types of Elephant Birds orDFoidl / Wikimedia Commons / CC-SA-3.0 For all intents and purposes, most people use the phrase \"elephant bird\" to refer to Aepyornis. Technically, however, the lesser-known Mullerornis is also classified as an elephant bird, albeit smaller than its famous contemporary. Mullerornis was named by the French explorer Georges Muller, prior to the misfortune of being captured and killed by a hostile tribe in Madagascar (which probably didn't appreciate his intrusion into their territory, even if only for purposes of bird-watching).\n07 of 10 An Elephant Bird Is Almost as Tall as a Thunderbird DEA PICTURE LIBRARY / Getty Images There's little doubt that Aepyornis was the heaviest bird that ever lived, but it wasn't necessarily the tallest\u2014that honor goes to Dromornis, a \"thunderbird\" of the Dromornithidae family of Australia. Some individuals measured nearly 12 feet tall. (Dromornis was much more slenderly built, however, only weighing about 500 pounds.) By the way, one species of Dromornis may yet wind up being assigned to the genus Bullockornis, otherwise known as the demon-duck of doom.\n08 of 10 It Probably Lived on Fruits LadyofHats / Wikimedia Commons / Public Domain You might think a ratite as fierce and feathery as the elephant bird would spend its time preying on the smaller animals of Pleistocene Madagascar, notably its tree-dwelling lemurs. As far as paleontologists can tell, however, Aepyornis contented itself with picking off low-lying fruit, which grew in abundance in this tropical climate. (This conclusion is supported by studies of a smaller extant ratite, the cassowary of Australia and New Guinea, which is well adapted to a fruit diet.)\n09 of 10 Its Extinction Could Be the Fault of Humans DEA PICTURE LIBRARY / Getty Images Amazingly enough, the first human settlers only arrived on Madagascar around 500 BCE, well after almost every other large landmass in the world had been occupied and exploited by Homo sapiens. While it's clear that this incursion was directly related to the elephant bird's extinction (the last individuals died probably around the mid-17th century), it's unclear whether humans actively hunted Aepyornis, or severely disrupted its environment by raiding its accustomed sources of food."}

Often revered as the \u2018must-see\u2019 animals on any African Safari, the name Big 5 actually has more sinister origins. The big five was originally a term used by hunters to describe the African animals that were considered as the hardest to hunt on foot.

For example, when running away from a predator warthogs will suddenly stop \u2013 as they have forgotten why they were running.\nAnd when they running, they point their hair tufted tails to the sky so fellow Warthogs can follow them \u2013 which is effectively an aerial with a pom-pom raised high off their backs for all predators to see. (Also, watching them run is actually quite entertaining).\nTheir upper tusks are enlarged canine teeth that protrude upwards from the mouth and can grow to 25cm.

It sleeps in underground burrows during the day and emerges at night to forage.\nAardwolves have specialized cheek teeth. They have strong jaws and canine teeth, but their cheek teeth have been reduced to flattened pegs, used for eating insects.\nAardwolves are territorial. A mating pair of aardwolves has a home range of up to four square km; and both sexes mark their territories with secretions from their anal glands.\n.\nBat-eared fox\nScientific Name: Otocyon megalotis\nLifespan: Up to 6 years in the wild. 6 to 14 years in captivity\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nCountries where they can be found: Native to more than 10 African countries including Kenya, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia and South Africa.\nQuick Facts about the Bat-Eared Fox:\nIn Botswana, indigenous people hunt the bat-eared fox for their pelts and in South Africa, they are hunting trophies. They are also often perceived as threats and predators of small livestock. And in the animal world, they are hunted by many large predators but are hard to catch; hyenas and jackals are much more of a threat, as are eagles swooping.\nTheir ears are a huge 13cm tall and make up a third of a bat-eared fox\u2019s height \u2013 as such they have incredible hearing, and can even hear insects moving underground.\nTheir ears are also filled with tiny blood vessels and help keep them cool.\nBat-eared foxes are nocturnal. They spend most of the day resting in burrows, before emerging after dark to forage and hunt.\nBat-eared foxes can take most of the water they need from the food they eat. Essentially they drink the bodily fluids of beetles and termites they feed on.\nBat-eared foxes flip traditional gender roles. Females give birth to 3-6 cubs each year but the males will groom, play, babysit, and rear their young as well as guarding the den against predators, whilst the females forage for food.\nThe Impossible 5 African Animals\nThe Impossible 5 of Africa are the Aardvark, Cape Mountain Leopard, Pangolin, Riverine Rabbit and White Lion \u2013 and are named because they a practically impossible to spot in the wild!\nAardvark\nThis lucky critter gets a mention in one of the other \u20185\u2019 African animals lists.

They will pick over kills made by larger carnivores and even frequent trash cans and rubbish dumps in pursuit of food (another reason NOT to have food in your tent when camping in a national park!)\nJackals are related to dogs, coyotes, foxes and wolves.\nCheetah\nScientific Name: Acinonyx jubatus\nLifespan:\nConservation Status: Vulnerable (population decreasing, approximately 10,000-12,000 in the wild)\nCountries where they can be found:\nCollective Noun: Coalition of Cheetahs\nBest Game Parks to see Cheetahs in the Wild:\nMasai Mara, Kenya; Kruger National Park, South Africa; Private Reserves in Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa; Serengeti National Park, Tanzania; Etosha National Park, Namibia; Central Kalahari, Makgadikgadi & Nxai Pan in Botswana.\n5+ Interesting Facts about Cheetahs:\nThe cheetah is the fastest land animal in the world, reaching speeds of up to 113km/h (70mph) and they can accelerate from 0 to 100km/h in just 3 seconds.\nTraveling at such speeds is exhausting and can only be maintained for 200-300m.\nCheetahs have between 2,000 and 3,000 spots, which help them to camouflage themselves.\nFemale cheetahs are solitary, living alone or with their young. Males live in small family groups of 2\u20133 brothers although in 2020 there is currently a family of 5 Cheetah Brothers who currently live in Kenya\u2019s Maasai Mara National Reserve (and were featured by David Attenborough in Seven Worlds, One Planet)\nCheetahs have long, flat, muscular tails that they use for balance and steering. The tail essentially acts like a rudder on a boat.\nCheetahs can survive only drinking water every 3-4 days.\nCheetahs hunt during the day to avoid competition from other powerful predators such as lions, hyenas and leopards.\nAntelope\nThere are over 90(!) different species of antelope in Africa which include Eland, Nyala, Waterbuck, Klipspringer, Gerenuk, Roan Antelope, Topi, Hartebeest, Thomsons Gazelle, Sable Antelope, Impala, Springbok (and obviously quite a few more!) But the ones below are, in my opinion, the most impressive/beautiful/interesting.\nKudu\nScientific Name: Tragelaphus strepsiceros\nLifespan: 10 years in the wild, 23 in captivity\nConservation Status: Least Concern (Population Stable)\nCountries where they can be found: Ethiopia, Tanzania, Eritrea, Kenya, Zambia, Angola, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa.\nQuick Facts about Kudu:\nThere are 2 species of Kudu \u2013 the Greater Kudu and it\u2019s cousin, the Lesser Kudu\nThe greater kudu\u2019s horns are spectacular and for an adult male (bulls) can grow as long as 1.8 meters, making 2.5 twists.\nThe horns do not begin to grow until the bull reaches 6\u201312 months, twisting once at around two-years-of-age and not reaching the full two-and-a-half twists until the age of six.\nBulls may stand 1.5 meters at the shoulder and weigh over 250kg.\nKudus are rarely aggressive, but use their horns to spar with other males during mating season to show superiority.\nEland\nScientific Name: Taurotragus derbianus\nLifespan: 20 years in the wild, 25 in captivity.\nConservation Status: Least Concern (Population stable)\nCountries where they can be found: South Sudan, Ethiopia, Angola, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Tanzania, Swaziland, Zimbabwe and South Africa.\nQuick Facts about Eland:\nThe Giant Eland is the largest antelope in the world and the slowest antelope but can jump a 2.5m fence from a standstill if threatened.\nElands are herbivorous with the majority of their diet made up of high protein succulent leaves from flowering plants, supplemented with forbs, trees, shrubs, grasses, tubers and seeds.\nElands roam in herds of around 40-60 but can gather in herds of up to 500-1000 animals in the rainy season.\nBoth male and female herds will often associate with zebras , roan antelopes and oryxes.\nImpala\nScientific Name: Aepyceros melampus\nLifespan: 12 \u2013 13 years in the Wild\nConservation Status: Least Concern (Population Stable)\nCountries where they can be found: Angola, Namibia, South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Zambia, Tanzania and Kenya.\nQuick Facts about Impala:\nThere are two subspecies of impalas: the common impala (Aepyceros melampus melampus), and the black-faced impala (Aepyceros melampus petersi) \u2013 however the Black Face impala is particularly rare and only found in Namibia and Angola.\nThe Common Impala is most common of all antelope in Africa and their population is estimated to exceed 2 million (in 2020)\nMales are known as rams with horns that can grow to 46 to 94 cm long, while females are referred to as ewes and have no horns.\nImpalas can run at up to 60km/h and are quite \u2018springy\u2019 being able to leap as far as 10 meters and as high as 3 meters.\nMost young impala are born around mid-day as this is the safest time to give birth (most of an Impalas natural predators \u2013 lions, leopards, cheetahs \u2013 are resting at this time). Mothers will leave the herd to give birth, returning to the herd 2-4 days later, however, half of newborns are killed by predators within the first few weeks of life.\nThe impala is rarely seen on its own. Females and young animals form herds of up to 100 individuals, while males live in a bachelor group of about 60 animals.\nOryx / Gemsbok\nScientific Name: Oryx gazella\nLifespan: Up to 18-20 years in the wild, 22 in captivity\nConservation Status: Least Concern (Population stable)\nCountries where they can be found: Botswana, Namibia & South Africa\nQuick Facts about Oryx:\nThe East African oryx (aka Gemsbok) is a species of antelope with long, spear-like horns. They have a grey coat and a white underside, separated from the grey by a stripe of black.\nOryx live in herds of up to 600 animals.\nA female Oryx leaves the herd to give birth and hides the calf for its first two or three weeks of life, visiting a few times a day to nurse it.\nOryx eat coarse grasses and thorny shrubs. In desert areas, they consume thick-leaved plants, wild melons, and roots and tubers they dig out of the ground. They typically feed in the early morning and late afternoon.\nRock Hyrax\nScientific Name: Procavia capensis\nLifespan: 9 \u2013 12 years\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nCountries where they can be found: Widespread throughout Africa\nQuick Facts about Hyrax:\nRock hyraxes are gregarious, living in colonies of up to 80 individuals.\nThey have three-chambered stomachs filled with symbiotic bacteria that help break down the plants they eat. Baby hyraxes are not born with the bacteria they will need to digest plant matter, so to obtain it they eat the poop of adult hyraxes.\nHyrax are actually related to elephants and manatees.\nHyraxes have black rubbery pads on their feet which are moistened by sweat glands and lift up in the center for a suction cup-like effect that helps the Hyrax keep their grip on rocky surfaces.\nStunning African Birds to Spot on Safari\nJackass Penguin\nScientific Name: Spheniscus demersus\nLifespan: 10 \u2013 27 years in the wild, 30 in captivity.\nConservation Status: Endangered (Population Decreasing)\nCountries where they can be found: South Western Coast of Africa along the Namibian and South African Coasts.\nQuick Facts about the Jackass Penguin:\nThe Jackass Penguin is also known as the African Penguin, or Cape Penguin.\nThey make donkey-like braying sounds to communicate.\nThey can dive under water for up to 2.5 minutes while trying to catch small fish such as anchovies and sardines.\nOne of the most famous and accessible colonies are found at Boulders Beach and Simonstown, just outside Cape Town.\nOstrich\nScientific Name: Struthio camelus\nLifespan: 50 to 75 years\nConservation Status: Least Concern (Population decreasing)\nCountries where they can be found: Widespread throughout Africa.\nQuick Facts about Ostriches:\nThe Ostrich is the largest, flightless bird in the world, growing up to 2m tall and weighing up to 170kg.\nOstriches can run up to 70km/h and cover as many as 5m in a single stride.\nOstriches have 3 stomachs.\nMale Ostrich have predominantly black feathers with white plumage, female have brown feathers with white tips.\nOstrich eggs are the largest of any living bird at 15cm long.\nOstriches normally spend the winter months in pairs or alone and during breeding season they live in nomadic \u2018herds\u2019 of between 5 and 50 birds, led by a top hen.\nHornbill\nScientific Name: Tockus erythrorhynchus\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nSecretary Bird\nScientific Name: Sagittarius serpentarius\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nQuick Facts about the SecretaryBird:\nThis impressive bird of prey can stand up to 1.2m tall\nThey move around mostly on foot, only flying when necessary such as reaching their nest and as part of the courtship ritual.\nSecretary Birds are carnivorous and eat snakes, insects, small mammals, birds\u2019 eggs, crabs and other reptiles.\nSecretarybirds hunt on the ground and use the thickened soles of their feet to stamp on their prey, stunning it and then swallowing it whole.\nKori Bustard\nScientific Name: Ardeotis kori\nConservation Status: Near Threatened (Population decreasing)\nQuick Facts about the Kori Bustard:\nThey are the heaviest flying bird native to Africa, however they mostly live on the ground, not flying unless absolutely necessary.\nKori bustards are distributed throughout eastern and southern Africa.

The tail of a relaxed elephant swings from side to side.\nThe tail of a restless elephant will be held still, often pointing downwards. The tail of an distressed or irritated elephant will be held out in a rigid way.\nAn irate elephant will normally first mock charge. This usually first involves a lot of ear flapping, head shaking and loud trumpeting.\nHow fast can an elephant run?\nAt top speed an elephant can travel at 25 miles/h (40 km/h).\nHowever their biggest asset is not their speed.\nTheir primary defense is their sheer bulk, tusks and trunk as well as their strength in numbers.\nAdult elephants have virtually no enemies except humans.\nDo elephants have good memories?\nElephant facts indicate that they seem to have one of the best memories of all animals.\nThe long lifespan of elephants do require that they have a good memory.\nThere is proof that elephants have recognized urine samples from group members they had been separated from for a few decades.\nThis good memory is very beneficial for survival when knowledge about where to find food, water and security is very useful during extreme climatic cycles.\nDid you know an elephants height can be estimated from the size of its footprint?\nFrom the footprint of an elephant it is possible determine the height of an elephant.\nFor males shoulder height is approximately 5,8 time the length of the hind footprint (and in the case of females 5,5 times).\nAn elephant\u2019s foot generally measures 40 - 50 centimeters in length and width and has a circumference of about 1.34 meters.\nThe footprint can also indicate the age of an elephant.\nYounger elephants leave a more defined footprint than older elephants that might have smoother ridges and well-worn heels.\nAll mammals can be divided into different groups based on their foot posture while standing.\nElephants fall into a group called near-ungulates, which refers to the fact that they have toenails rather than hooves.\nAn elephants foot is designed in such a way that elephants actually walk on the tips of their toes.\nAfrican elephants have 4 nails on their front feet and 3 nails on their back feet.\nThese nails are worn down and do not always show on their footprints.\nThe sole of the foot is covered in a thick epidermal layer tissue that acts like shock absorbers.\nThis allows the elephant to move surprisingly silently.\nThe ridges and grooves give it a good grip some stability when walking over a variety of terrains.\nThe reason that elephants can walk so quietly is in part due to the fibro elastic layer providing a spongy cushion on the bottom of the foot.\nThis allows the foot to mould over objects on the ground thereby effectively smothering the objects beneath it.\nHow do African elephants sleep?\nAfrican elephants can sleep standing up for a few minutes at a stretch but they do lie down in order to sleep more deeply.\nThey even snore at times.\nThey will also lie down in the heat of the day for an hour or two.\nElephants lie down to rest or sleep deeply, as these calves are doing. Entire herds can sometimes be seen lying flat in this way.\nElephants often doze while standing during the heat of the day. They will spend a few hours every night lying down and sleeping soundly.\nSome elephants are snorers. When they dreaming they may make vocalisations.\nElephant babies often lie in the shade of their mothers and members of the herd.\nCan elephants swim?\nElephants enjoy showering by sucking water into their trunks and spraying it all over themselves.\nAfterward, they often spray their skin with a protective coating of dust.\nIf it is possible an elephant goes to water once a day to drink, bathe and wallow in mud. On average an elephant will drink 70 to 90 liters a day but it can down 150 liter when thirsty.\nWallowing in mud is an important activity for elephants. It cools them off and it protects its skin against parasites.\nIn deep water an elephant will immerse itself completely. Elephants can swim across lakes and rivers with only the tip of their trunks showing.\nElephants shower themselves with dust and sand for the same reasons. Sand also acts as a useful substance to help dislodge ticks when the elephant rubs itself on rocks and trees.\nWhat do elephants eat?\nElephants eat a very wide variety of plants.\nIn summer grass forms the bulk of their diet, replaced in winter by woody plants.\nElephant fact: As their cheek teeth are worn away they are replaced by a series of six rows of teeth in each jaw.\nOnce the sixth row of teeth is worn away the elephant cannot chew its food properly anymore, and it slowly starves to death.\nElephants are not picky about what they browse.\nThey scan often be seen shaking trees to allow fruit and seed to drop on the ground for food that is to far to reach with their trunks.\nAfrican elephants can destructive to habitat when their numbers are not managed effectively.\nLike this page?"}

These time-lapse images prove otherwise.\nHunting of elephants by tourists is cost effective, profitable and easily monitored. The foreign hunter pays for all participation in the hunt, including government fees, and for taking the natural resource. A government representative is usually present. Animals are taken under a quota. The stakeholders in such an arrangement include the hunter, the professional hunter (guide), the regulatory agency (National Parks or Wildlife) and the people who live with the elephants (the community). Source: http://www.iwmc.org\nWatch this time lapse that shows the entire process of breaking down an elephant for it\u2019s meat.\nAs you can see, an elephant killed by a hunter is utilized to the fullest to feed an entire village of local people. Aside from the fact that protein is rare and VERY valued in rural Africa, the money spent on the hunt is a huge benefit to elephant conservation, as well as the locals living in the area.\nLaws against transporting ivory into the U.S. have made it difficult for hunters seeking an elephant in recent years, but there are still areas where these massive animals can be taken legally and transported home.\nThe anti-hunting community would like you to believe the elephant is endangered and on the verge of extinction. Facts however paint a very different picture.\nThere are in excess of 70,000 elephants in Zimbabwe today \u2013 nearly double the amount of elephants that the environment has the capacity to support due to human encroachment on suitable habitat. If we want elephants to be around for future generations, elephant hunting is an important conservation tool that must be considered.\nIt IS legal to hunt elephants in many African countries.\nin many African countries. The meat is given to local people, it\u2019s never wasted .\n. The money from hunting the elephant goes towards elephant conservation. The trophy fee on a elephant is quite expensive, more than any of the locals will make in a lifetime, so this system works out well for all involved.\nThe trophy fee on a elephant is quite expensive, more than any of the locals will make in a lifetime, so this system works out well for all involved.

M\u00e4rz 2019\nJedes Jahr reiten Touristen aus aller Welt w\u00e4hrend ihres Urlaubs in S\u00fcdostasien auf Elefanten. Hier erfahren Sie, warum Sie sich niemals daran beteiligen sollten.\nIn s\u00fcdostasiatischen L\u00e4ndern wie Indonesien, Thailand und Vietnam werden an touristisch interessanten St\u00e4tten oftmals Elefantenritte angeboten. Diese Ausfl\u00fcge findet man auf den Websites namhafter Reiseveranstalter, und die Fotos der Weltreisenden, die daran teilnehmen, sind \u00fcberall in den sozialen Medien zu finden.\nDoch in Wahrheit f\u00f6rdert die Teilnahme an einem Elefantenritt sowohl Tierqu\u00e4lerei als auch Wilderei. Zusammen mit anderen Faktoren bringt dies den Asiatischen Elefanten an den Rand der Ausrottung. Hier die Fakten:\nWild gefangen\nDie Zucht von Elefanten in Gefangenschaft ist bekannterma\u00dfen schwierig und stellt hohe Anforderungen an die Pflege der Tiere. In Vietnam ist seit 40 Jahren kein Elefant mehr erfolgreich in Gefangenschaft geboren worden.\nSo wurde tats\u00e4chlich die gro\u00dfe Mehrzahl der Elefanten, die f\u00fcr Touristenritte eingesetzt werden, aus der Wildnis gefangen.\nElefanten sind sehr soziale Tiere und leben in Freiheit in gro\u00dfen Herden. Bei der Gefangennahme werden Jungelefanten \u2013 gewaltsam \u2013 von ihren Familien und Freunden getrennt, und sie werden sie wahrscheinlich niemals wiedersehen.\nDer \u201cCrush\u201d \u2013 das Zerbrechen des Willens\nDamit Elefanten gef\u00fcgig werden, m\u00fcssen sie den Menschen f\u00fcrchten. Dies erreicht man normalerweise durch eine Methode, das als \u201cCrush\u201d bekannt ist. Junge Elefanten werden gefesselt und von denen, die sie gefangen genommen haben, mit vereinter Kraft so lange geschlagen, bis ihr Wille gebrochen ist.\nElefanten haben ein sehr gutes Ged\u00e4chtnis, und diese barbarische Misshandlung gen\u00fcgt im Allgemeinen, um sicher zu stellen, dass sie f\u00fcr den Rest ihres Lebens vor den Menschen, denen sie in die H\u00e4nde gefallen sind, eine l\u00e4hmende Furcht versp\u00fcren.\nZu Tode geschuftet\nSobald sie an die Tourismusbranche verkauft worden sind, m\u00fcssen Elefanten hart f\u00fcr ihren Lebensunterhalt arbeiten und f\u00fcr ihren neuen Eigent\u00fcmer Gewinn abwerfen. Elefanten, die f\u00fcr Ritte verwendet werden, m\u00fcssen \u00fcblicherweise den ganzen Tag f\u00fcr diesen Zweck zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen, jeden Tag.\nSind keine Touristen da, werden die Elefanten angebunden, um zu warten. Wenn die Touristen kommen, tragen die Elefanten bis zu acht Stunden lang in tropischer Hitze gro\u00dfe Gruppen von Menschen auf ihrem R\u00fccken.\nDer Schutz der Elefanten in der Tourismusbranche ist unzureichend geregelt und \u00dcberarbeitung eine ganz gew\u00f6hnliche Form der Misshandlung. Medien in Vietnam berichteten \u00fcber zahlreiche F\u00e4lle, in denen Elefanten in den letzten Jahren aufgrund von Ersch\u00f6pfung und Mangelern\u00e4hrung gestorben sind. Sie mussten sich im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes zu Tode arbeiten.\nNicht in der Lage, nat\u00fcrliche Verhaltensweisen auszuleben\nIn Gefangenschaft in einer Umgebung, in der der Schutz der Elefanten hinter gewerblichen Interessen zur\u00fccktritt, leiden die Tiere unweigerlich.\nIn Freiheit wandern Elefanten jeden Tag viele Kilometer weit auf der Suche nach ihrer bevorzugten Nahrung. Sie halten st\u00e4ndig Kontakt mit anderen Elefanten, entweder durch k\u00f6rperliche Ber\u00fchrung oder durch Kommunikation \u00fcber weite Entfernung mit Hilfe von niederfrequenten Rufen.\nElefanten spielen gern und baden in Wasser, bevor sie ein \u201cStaubbad\u201d nehmen, das Parasiten fern halt.\nDoch in der Gefangenschaft in den Touristenzentren ist nichts davon m\u00f6glich.\nIn der Zeit, in der sie keine zahlenden Besucher tragen m\u00fcssen, werden die Elefanten mit kurzen Ketten an den Fu\u00dfgelenken gefesselt. Sie haben nicht die M\u00f6glichkeit, herumzuwandern und Futter zu suchen, zu baden oder mit Artgenossen Kontakt zu pflegen. Elefanten unter Bedingungen zu halten, die ihren grundlegenden Bed\u00fcrfnissen nicht entsprechen, verursacht Leid und ist eine Form von Tierqu\u00e4lerei.\nDas Geld der Touristen erh\u00e4lt den Kreislauf aufrecht\nTragischerweise f\u00f6rdert der weltweite Tourismus die Nachfrage nach Elefantenritten. Solange Touristen aus aller Welt bereit sind, im Urlaub f\u00fcr den Umgang mit Elefanten und f\u00fcr Elefantenritte zu bezahlen, solange werden Elefanten auch weiter wild gefangen. Sie werden weiterhin in ein Leben voller Elend und Sklaverei verkauft und gepr\u00fcgelt, um ihren Willen zu brechen.\nAsiatische Elefanten sind gef\u00e4hrdet\nDie Situation ist f\u00fcr Asiatische Elefanten inzwischen kritisch. Die Art wird von der International Union for Conservation of Nature (Internationale Union zur Bewahrung der Natur \u2013 IUCN) als wildlebend gef\u00e4hrdet eingestuft, und ihre Zahl geht weiter zur\u00fcck.\nDie gr\u00f6\u00dfte Bedrohung ihres \u00dcberlebens in Freiheit ist die T\u00f6tung f\u00fcr Elfenbein und der Fang f\u00fcr Unterhaltungszwecke und Tourismus.\nDie Wahrheit l\u00e4sst sich nicht leugnen: Durch die Teilnahme an einem Elefantenritt sind Touristen mitschuldig an extremer Tierqu\u00e4lerei und f\u00f6rdern das Aussterben des majest\u00e4tischen Asiatischen Elefanten.\nIn Aktion treten\nSo k\u00f6nnen Sie helfen:\n\u00dcbersetzung aus dem Englischen von Inga B.

We\u2019ll then discover more about threatened animals with a list of endangered animals facts for kids.\nYou can see a list of endangered animals here: Endangered Animals List.\nEndangered Animals Facts For Kids: What Is An Endangered Animal?\n\u2018Endangered animal\u2019 is a term used to describe a species that is in danger of becoming extinct.\nMore specifically, an Endangered Species is a species that has been identified by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as being under threat of global extinction.\nThe International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is an international organisation that compiles data on endangered animals and places them into different threat categories. Their findings are presented on the IUCN Red List.\nThe term \u2018Endangered\u2019 is usually used to describe an animal\u2019s global status, rather than its local status.\nFor example, the number of Common Starlings is falling in Europe. However, in Asia there is no change in their numbers and in Africa the population is increasing. Therefore, Common Starlings are not considered to be endangered.\nAnimals can be \u2018locally endangered\u2019, or even \u2018locally extinct\u2019, without being globally endangered.\nThere are guidelines on how animals should be counted. How a species is categorized on the Red List (see below) depends on how fast its population is falling and how many animals have already been lost.\nExtinct Animals\nA species becomes extinct when the very last one of its kind dies. Animals that have become extinct include the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Terror Birds, the Dodo, and the Thylacine.\nThere are actually two official extinction categories, as we\u2019ll find out below.\nSpecies go extinct in the wild all of the time naturally. It\u2019s part of nature. However, we have a duty to prevent animals becoming threatened due to human activity.\nFacts About Endangered Animals: IUCN Categories\n\u2018Endangered\u2019 is one of three categories the IUCN uses for species that are threatened with extinction, and one of nine that the IUCN uses to rate all species. These categories are:\nLeast Concern (LC)\nNear Threatened (NT)\nVulnerable (VU)\nEndangered (EN)\nCritically Endangered (CR)\nExtinct in the Wild (EW)\nExtinct (EX)\nTwo other categories are also used. Not Evaluated (NE) is for species that haven\u2019t yet been studied. Data Deficient (DD) means that insufficient data has been collected.\nThe IUCN Red List is not just for animals; plants and fungi can become endangered, and are also included on the list.\nAs you can see from the list above, there are two degrees of extinction.\nIf a species is \u2018Extinct in the Wild\u2019, then there are still living specimens, but they are in zoos, or in places other than where they were naturally found.\nIf a species is \u2018Extinct\u2019, there is no way back. The species will never again be seen on Earth.\nEndangered Animals Facts For Kids\nBelow is a list of facts about endangered animals. There are several links you can follow to find out more about a particular animal. If you want to learn even more endangered animals information see our Endangered Animals List.\nAmur Leopards are the most endangered big cats (not including the South China Tiger, which scientists believe may already be extinct). Amur Leopards have been categorised by the IUCN as being \u2018Critically Endangered\u2019. Estimates of the number of Amur Leopards left in the wild range from around 70 to under 20.\nThere are two species of Orangutan: the Bornean Orangutan, and the Sumatran Orangutan. Both are on the Red List.\nThe Bornean Orangutan is endangered. There are only around 40,000 left in the wild.\nThe Sumatran Orangutan is critically endangered. Sadly only around 7,000 of these beautiful animals are left in the wild.\nThe main cause of Orangutans becoming endangered is habitat loss caused by deforestation.\nOf the seven species of Sea Turtle found in our oceans, two (Kemp\u2019s Ridley and Hawksbill) are Critically Endangered, one (Green) is Endangered, and three (Loggerhead, Olive Ridley and Leatherback) are Vulnerable. (Insufficient data have been collected on the Flatback Sea Turtle.)\nThe world\u2019s Tiger population has shrunk by around 97% since the beginning of the 19 th century.\ncentury. Today, it is possible that there are as few as 3,200 tigers left in the wild.\nOf the six tiger subspecies, 3 are Critically Endangered, and the other 3 are endangered.\nTigers are going extinct due to deforestation and habitat loss. Even today they are still hunted for their fur and body parts.\nThe most endangered tiger subspecies is the South China Tiger. Some scientists believe that it is already extinct in the wild.\nSeveral species of whale were hunted almost to extinction, including the Blue Whale. Whales were hunted for their meat and blubber. Their body parts were also used to make products including tools, ornaments, fuel, clothes and baskets.\nToday, five species of whale are classed as being endangered. These are: the Sei Whale, Blue Whale, Fin Whale, North Atlantic Right Whale, and North Pacific Right Whale.\nThe Sperm Whale is also threatened, and is classed as \u2018Vulnerable\u2019.\nOther whale species may be threatened, but there isn\u2019t enough data to classify them yet.\nToday\u2019s Blue Whale population is under 1% of its original size. However, due to hunting bans, the number of Blue Whales is growing. There may be as many as 12,000 Blue Whales alive today, but they are still at risk.\nEndangered animals don\u2019t just live in rainforests or far-flung foreign lands. Franklin\u2019s bumblebee is a critically endangered insect found in California and Oregon. The Dusky gopher frog is found in Mississippi. Many other threatened species are found in Northern America, Europe and Australia.\nIt\u2019s not all bad news: the Iberian Lynx was rated Critically Endangered in 2002. In 2014 its rating was changed to \u2018Endangered\u2019. However, there are still under 200 individuals left in the wild.\nThanks to conservation measures, populations of Blue Whales in some areas are approaching their original numbers. With our help, many other species around the world are making a comeback.\nHow Many Endangered Animals Are There In The World?\nThe numbers of species Listed As Near Threatened, Vulnerable, Threatened, Critically Endangered, and Extinct In The Wild on the IUCN Red List, as of February 2016, are:\nNear Threatened: 5,204\nVulnerable: 11,029\nEndangered: 7,323\nCritically Endangered: 4,898\nExtinct In The Wild: 69\nEndangered Animals Activity\nThe plight of endangered animals such as tigers, pandas and gorillas is well-known, and each has its own charity or charities.\nThere are many, many other species that are not as famous but whose situation is just as serious.\nWhy not learn about a lesser-known endangered animal, and try to raise awareness of its situation among your family and friends? You could design posters and give a presentation about your chosen animal.\nHere are some lesser-known critically endangered animals you might like to study: Great Indian bustard (a bird), Pygmy three-toed sloth, Northern bald ibis (a bird), Vaquita (a porpoise), Angel shark, Attenborough\u2019s echidna, Bulmer\u2019s fruit bat.\nEndangered Animals Facts For Kids Conclusion\nAs an animal lover it\u2019s easy to get upset when reading about endangered animals. However, the more we know about endangered animals, the more we can help them, either directly or indirectly. Don\u2019t forget that there are many conservation success stories!\nWhat can you do to make a difference?\nFind out about some of the world\u2019s most amazing endangered animals here: List Of Endangered Animals."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Unforgettable Elephants | Elephant Emotions | Nature | PBS", "url": "https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/unforgettable-elephants-elephant-emotions/5886/", "text": "Elephants, the largest land animals on the planet, are among the most exuberantly expressive of creatures. Joy, anger, grief, compassion, love; the finest emotions reside within these hulking masses. Through years of research, scientists have found that elephants are capable of complex thought and deep feeling. In fact, the emotional attachment elephants form toward family members may rival our own.\nJoy\nIn the wild, joy is an emotion that elephants have no shame in showing. They express their happiness and joy when they are amongst their loved ones-family and friends. Playing games and greeting friends or family members all elicit displays of joy.\nBut the one event that stirs a level of elephant happiness beyond compare is the birth of a baby elephant. In Unforgettable Elephants, the birth of Ebony is one such occasion. The excitement of several of the females in Echo\u2019s family can\u2019t be contained as they are heard bellowing and blaring during the birth of the new baby.\nAnother highly emotional occasion in an elephant\u2019s life is an elephant reunion. This joyful meeting between related, but separated, elephants is one of exuberance and drama. The greeting ceremony marks the incredible welcoming of a formerly absent family member. During the extraordinary event, the elephants about to be united begin calling each other from a quarter a mile away. As they get closer, their pace quickens. Their excitement visibly flows as fluid from their temporal glands streams down the sides of their faces. Eventually, the elephants make a run towards each other, screaming and trumpeting the whole time. When they finally make contact, they form a loud, rumbling mass of flapping ears, clicked tusks and entwined trunks. The two leaning on each other, rubbing each other, spinning around, even defecating, and urinating (for this is what elephants do when they are experiencing sheer delight). With heads held high, the reunited pair fill the air with a symphony of trumpets, rumbles, screams, and roars. Bliss.\nLove\nThere is no greater love in elephant society than the maternal kind. Nobody who observes a mother with her calf could doubt this. It is one of the most touching aspects of elephant social customs. The calf is so small compared to the adult that it walks under its mother, who, incredibly, does not step on it or trip over it. Mother and child remain in constant touch. If a calf strays too far from its mother, she will fetch it. The mother often touches her child with trunk and legs, helping it to its feet with one foot and her trunk. She carries it over obstacles and hauls it out of pits or ravines. She pushes it under her to protect it from predators or hot sun. She bathes it, using her trunk to spray water over it and then to scrub it gently. The mother steers her calf by grasping its tail with her trunk, and the calf follows, holding its mother\u2019s tail. When the calf squeals in distress, its mother and others rush to its protection immediately. It is easy to see why the bond between mother and daughter lasts 50 years or more.\nGrief\nOne of the most moving displays of elephant emotion is the grieving process. Elephants remember and mourn loved ones, even many years after their death. When an elephant walks past a place that a loved one died he or she will stop and take a silent pause that can last several minutes. While standing over the remains, the elephant may touch the bones of the dead elephant (not the bones of any other species), smelling them, turning them over and caressing the bones with their trunk. Researchers don\u2019t quite understand the reason for this behavior. They guess the elephants could be grieving. Or they could they be reliving memories. Or perhaps the elephant is trying to recognize the deceased. Whatever the reason, researchers suspect that the sheer interest in the dead elephant is evidence that elephants have a concept of death.\nResearchers have described mother elephants who appear to go through a period of despondency after the death of a calf, dragging behind the herd for days. They\u2019ve also witnessed an elephant herd circling a dead companion disconsolately. After some time, and likely when they realized the elephant was dead, the family members broke off branches, tore grass clumps and dropped these on the carcass. Another researcher noted a family of African elephants surrounding a dying matriarch. The family stood around her and tried to get her up with their tusks and put food in her mouth. When the rest of the herd finally moved on, one female and one calf stayed with her, touching her with their feet.\nRage and Stress\nTerror, rage and stress, unfortunately, are also commonplace in the elephant repertoire of emotions. Terror afflicts baby African elephants who wake up screaming in the middle of the night after they have witnessed their families murdered and poached \u2014 a type of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.\nSome researchers suggest a species-wide trauma is taking place in wild elephant populations. They say that elephants are suffering from a form of chronic stress after sustaining decades of killings and habitat loss. The recent surge in cases of wild elephant rage reported by the media is a sad indicator of the kind of stress that wild elephants are undergoing. Nearly 300 persons are killed every year by wild elephants in India. But the increasing numbers of deaths are closely correlated to the ever-increasing human presence in traditional wild elephant habitats, as well as the the effects of climate change, and loss of territory and resources. The ongoing competition between elephants and humans for available land and resources is leading to ever more unfortunate and often deadly consequences.\nHuman activity does more than put a stress on elephants to find resources. It can often disrupt the complex and delicate web of familial and societal relations that are so important in elephant society. Calves are carefully protected and guarded by members of the matriarchal elephant family. Any perception of danger triggers a violent reaction from the matriarch and, subsequently, the entire family. The extremes a family will go to protect a vulnerable new calf are reported in the news stories as fits of unprovoked \u201celephant rage.\u201d Charging a village, storming into huts where harvested crop is stored, plundering fields and, if disturbed, turning violent are some of the instances reported by the media.\nCompassion and Altruism\nCompassion is not reserved for offspring alone in elephant society. Elephants appear to make allowances for other members of their herd. Observers noted that one African herd always traveled slowly because one of its members had never recovered from a broken leg. And in another case, a park warden reported a herd that traveled slowly because one female was carrying around a dead calf. One perplexing report was of an adult elephant making repeated attempt to help a baby rhinoceros stuck in the mud. She continued to try to save the baby rhino despite the fact that its mother charged her each time. Risking her life for the sake of an animal that is not her own, not related to her, or even her own species is remarkably altruistic in nature.\nWhile there is a great deal more to learn about what elephants feel, such accounts are astonishing. They reveal a creature that weeps, revels, rages and grieves. They lead us to believe that the depth of elephant emotional capacity knows no limit. They are striking for they suggest that elephants act on feelings and not solely for survival."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Badger Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Badger-facts.html", "text": "badger Facts\nPortrait of an American Badger\nOne of the more curious badger facts is that a large part of their diet is earthworms. Badgers are stoutly built, powerful and cantankerous carnivores. There are eight species of badger ranging across several continents including North America, Africa, Europe and Asia.\nAll the badger species are fossorial, creating many-chambered underground dens, and spending much of their lives below ground.\nBadgers do allot of stalking at night, but are seen out and about in the daytime as well. They are excellent hunters of earth-dwelling prey including rabbits, groundhogs, ground squirrels, mice and snakes.\nSome of these animals can be fairly large in comparison to the badger, but are no match for this enormously aggressive predator.\nThe badgers sense of smell is very powerful and they can detect an animal in its burrow through soil as well as snow cover. When they locate their prey, they dig rapidly directly down into the animals den in a devastating surprise attack from above.\nBadgers also eat a variety of insects, grubs and vegetable matter including fruits and roots.\nThe word \"badger\" comes from the French word \"becheur\" meaning \"digger\" and is extremely appropriate. Everything about a badgers body says \"dig\".\nIt has massive, shovel-like front paws with five powerful toes, each tipped with curved claws as strong as steel. They can move yards of dirt in minutes, barreling in head first with long digging strokes of the front legs and quick, earth-moving shoves backwards with the rear legs.\nThe rear paws and claws are smaller and designed to doze away the soil that has already been loosened and dislodged by the front feet.\nBadgers have a third eyelid that protects their eyes from all the flying soil, and thick guard hairs in their nostrils and ears to keep them clear of debris.\nA badger being pursued by a large predator such as a wolf or mountain lion can dig backwards, fangs facing out for protection and disappear beneath the soil in a matter of seconds.\nIn addition, the badger has very thick fur and loose skin which allows it to twist around, even when having been grabbed from behind by a predator, to defend itself with its impressive canines.\nMost badgers live solitary lives once weaned from their mother, but have overlapping territories and may occasionally run into each other and socialize.. - Badger Facts\namerican or new world badger facts\nAmerican Badger\nThe American badger is a fixture across the plains and woodlands of the central United States. They range into Canada and Mexico as well, but the midwestern plains are their most common residence.\nThese badgers have a flattened appearance with a remarkably broad torso, short, powerful limbs, and massive front paws and claws. They have a grizzled grey body with whiter undersides and dark brown or black legs. The stripe down the center of the face is narrow compared to the European badger, and the skull and cheeks are wider with low-set ears and black cheek patches. And badgers have stout tails of a few inches in length.\nThe jaw of the American badger sets into the skull in a unique notch that locks it to the upper mandible and makes it impossible to be dislocated.\nMany of the animals the badger hunts are powerfully built diggers as well, such as the muscular groundhog and rugged prairie dog, who will wedge their sturdy legs against the walls of their dens trying to avoid extraction.\nThe specialized jaw, along with the badgers stout neck and shoulders helps the badger to dislodge its quarry.\nIt is occasionally reported that badgers and coyotes team up to hunt, but what actually occurs is that the always \"wily\" coyote waits at alternative exits for something to bolt loose from a burrow that the badger is invading. If the coyote snares an escaping gopher it does not share with the badger, and the badger certainly does not share with the coyote.\nThe American badger has numerous potential enemies on the Western plains, such as mountain lions, wolves and the ever annoying coyote.\nThese animals may out weigh a badger by three or four to one, but an adult badger is as fierce a combatant as one may encounter and more often than not, sends its agitator running for the hills. - Badger Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Once the female is impregnated, the development of the embryos is delayed over the winter, so that the baby badgers arrive when the weather is right. The eggs don't fully attach to the uterus until early spring. This is a process known as \"delayed implantation\", and is one of the more unusual badger facts.\nIn late winter or early spring, the eggs become implanted in the uteran wall and begin to develop. Although the entire pregnancy takes about 7 months from fertilization to delivery, the eggs do not develop at all for the first 5 months, and then, once implanted, take about 6 weeks to fully grow.\nFemales give birth deep inside their burrows to 2 to 5 baby badgers. The newborn badger babies are called cubs. They are blind and only very finely furred, and completely dependent on their mother.\nShe may leave every few days to hunt, but returns quickly. The mother badger may change dens once or twice during these critical weeks to ensure the safety of her family.\nShe carries each badger cub one at a time to the new sette. Baby badgers mature quickly and begin chewing on kills their mother provides for them, sometimes even before their eyes are open.\nBy the time they are 4 months old, a baby badger can hunt for themselves and they head out on their own at about 6 months old. - Badger Facts\nThe honey badger or ratel\nHoney Badger\nThe honey badger is in a separate genus from the American and European badgers, and is actually more closely related to wolverines and weasels.\nNevertheless, the honey badger is exceedingly \"badger-like\", and has a reputation for being one of the most fearless and relentless animals on Earth.\n- Go to Honey Badger Facts\na few more badger facts\nA group of badgers is called a \"cette\"\nBadgers live in huge underground burrows that can include up to 1/2 mile of tunnels\nBadgers can dig both forwards and backwards and often dig backwards disappearing straight into the ground when confronted by an enemy\nBadgers do not hibernate but may enter a state called \"torpor\" where they sleep deeply for up to three weeks\nThe word \"badger\" comes from the French word \"becheur\" which means \"digger\"\nBadgers have a third eyelid that protects their eyes while they dig.- Badger Facts!"}

For groups of species (i.e. antelopes) we\u2019ve included the number of species in the group and the group\u2019s name.\nAardvark\nScientific Name: Orycteropus afer\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe aardvark is a nocturnal mammal whose diet consists mainly of ants and termites. It uses its excellent sense of smell to find food, and its long, sticky tongue to capture its prey. The aardvark has thick skin to protect it from insect bites and stings.\nThe aardvark is an expert burrower. If threatened, it will retreat to the safety of its burrow. If no burrow is available, it will quickly dig a new one, reversing out backwards when the danger has passed.\nThe aardvark is the only member of the family Orycteropodidae, and the last remaining species of the order Tubulidentata.\nYou can find out more about the aardvark here: Aardvark Facts\nReturn to index\nAardwolf\nScientific Name: Proteles cristata\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nAardwolf means \u2018earth wolf\u2019 in Afrikaans, a language spoken in South Africa. Despite its name, the aardwolf is not a wolf or even a member of the dog family. In fact, it\u2019s one of the four living species of hyena, and a member of the hyena family Hyaenidae.\nThe aardwolf lives in scrubland (a habitat consisting of grass and small bushes) in eastern and southern Africa. It has a nocturnal lifestyle, sleeping in burrows during the day.\nUnlike the other three hyenas, the aardwolf doesn\u2019t eat large vertebrates. Instead, the aardwolf\u2019s diet consists mainly of termites and other small insects.\nThe aardwolf uses its long, sticky tongue to capture its prey. It can eat up to 250,000 termites in one night!\nYou can find out more about the aardwolf here: Aardwolf Facts\nReturn to index\nAfrican Buffalo\nScientific Name: Syncerus caffer\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe African buffalo is a large, powerfully-built hoofed animal. It belongs to the subfamily Bovinae, the members of which are known as bovids.\nThere are several subspecies of African buffalo. Each varies slightly in appearance and is found in a different region of Africa. The largest and best-known subspecies is the Cape buffalo, which is found in Southern Africa.\nBoth male and female African buffaloes have distinctive upward-curving horns, the tips of which can be over 1 m (3.3 ft.) apart in large males. The horns of full-grown adult males meet in the middle, creating a hard panel known as a \u2018boss\u2019.\nThe horns are used as a means of defense against predators. Males also use their horns when fighting for dominance in the herd.\nAn adult African buffalo is large, powerful and well-armed; it has little to fear from most predators; only a very brave or hungry lion would attack a full-grown buffalo.\nThese large animals are known for their unpredictable behavior and will occasionally attack humans.\nYou can find out more about the African buffalo here: African Buffalo Facts\nReturn to index\nAfrican Bush Elephant\nScientific Name: Loxodonta africana\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nThe African bush elephant is the largest land animal in the world. It stands up to 4 m (13.1 ft.) in height, and weighs up to 6,048 kg (13,334 lb.). Both male and female African bush elephants have tusks (only male Asian elephants have tusks).\nUntil recently, all elephants in Africa were considered to be the same species, the African elephant. Recent studies have shown that Africa\u2019s elephant population consists of two different species: the African bush elephant and the smaller African forest elephant.\nThe African bush elephant is herbivorous, eating a wide variety of plant matter. The species is found throughout sub-Saharan Africa, but its population is becoming increasingly fragmented.\nYou can find out more about the African bush elephant here: African Bush Elephant Facts.\nReturn to index\nAntelope\nNumber of species: 91\nFamily: Bovidae\nAntelopes are a group of hooved mammals within the family Bovidae (the family also includes animals such as bison, buffaloes, sheep, goats and cattle).\nAll antelopes have horns (although in some species they are only present on males), and most live in herds. Living in herds helps to keep antelopes safe from predators. With all those eyes and ears looking and listening out for danger, predators find it hard to approach undetected.\nThere are 91 species of antelope, most of which are native to Africa. They live in a range of habitats, including forests and grasslands. Antelopes are herbivores (plant eaters), and many species live in large herds.\nThe largest antelope is the giant eland, a species found in the savannas of Central Africa. The smallest is the royal antelope, which is found in Western Africa. It is just 25 cm (9.8 in.) tall at the shoulder.\nReturn to index\nBaboon\nNumber of species: 5\nGenus: Papio\nBaboons are monkeys in the genus (a group of related animals) Papio. They have long snouts and close-set eyes, giving their faces a dog-like appearance.\nThere are five species of baboon: the hamadryas baboon, Guinea baboon, olive baboon, yellow baboon, and chacma baboon. All five species are found in Africa.\nBaboons live in groups called troops. Troops range in size from 5 to 250 individuals. Male baboons use noises and visual threats, such as the baring of their long, sharp canine teeth, to establish dominance within the troop.\nThe conservation status of four of the five species of baboon is \u2018Least Concern\u2019. The Guinea baboon, the smallest of the baboons, is rated \u2018Near Threatened\u2019.\nYou can find out more about baboons here: Baboon Facts\nReturn to index\nBonobo\nScientific Name: Pan paniscus\nConservation Status: Endangered\nThe bonobo is an endangered primate that lives in the rainforests of Central Africa. It is closely-related to the chimpanzee. It is thought that the two species split fewer than 1 million years ago.\nBonobos can be told apart from chimpanzees by their lighter build, smaller heads, pink lips and black faces.\nBonobos and chimpanzees are our closest living relatives in the animal kingdom. They share over 98% of our genes, and are more closely related to us than they are to gorillas.\nYou can find out more about bonobos here: Bonobo Facts\nReturn to index\nBoomslang\nScientific Name: Dispholidus typus\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe boomslang is a highly venomous snake found in sub-Saharan Africa. Its name means \u2018tree snake\u2019 in Afrikaans (a language spoken in South Africa). This large snake is mainly arboreal (tree-dwelling).\nGreatly feared by local people, the boomslang is capable of delivering a bite that is potentially fatal if not treated.\nLike other members of the family Colubridae, to which it belongs, the boomslang\u2019s venom-delivering fangs are located at the back of its mouth. Snakes such as these are said to be \u2018rear-fanged\u2019.\nReturn to index\nBushbaby\nNumber of species: 18\nFamily: Galagidae\nBushbabies are nocturnal primates in the family Galagidae. Their huge eyes provide them with excellent night vision.\nThese small, monkey-like animals are expert jumpers. While leaping through dense vegetation, bushbabies fold their bat-like ears back for protection.\nBushbabies are also known as Galagos or Nagapies (which means \u2018little night monkeys\u2019 in Afrikaans, a language spoken in South Africa). Their English name is thought to come either from their baby-like appearance, or from the wails they make at night.\nReturn to index\nCheetah\nScientific Name: Acinonyx jubatus\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nThe cheetah is the world\u2019s fastest land animal. It uses its great speed to capture its prey, which consists of other fast-moving animals such as antelope and hares.\nThe cheetah\u2019s coat is pale brown / yellow and covered with distinctive black spots. The spots provide camouflage, breaking up the animal\u2019s outline against grasses and other foliage.\nThe cheetah is a member of the Felidae (cat) family. Although one of the larger cats, it is not considered to be a \u2018big cat\u2019 as it is neither a member of the subfamily Pantherinae, nor a member of the genus Panthera.\nThe cheetah\u2019s closest relatives are the cougar and the jaguarundi.\nClick here to learn more awesome cheetah facts.\nReturn to index\nCrocodile\nNumber of crocodile species found in Africa: 4\nNumber of crocodile species worldwide: 15\nSubfamily: Crocodylinae\nCrocodiles are semi-aquatic, meat-eating reptiles in the subfamily Crocodylinae.\nThese master ambush predators lie in wait in shallow water for their prey to approach. When the unsuspecting victim gets within range, the crocodile launches an explosive attack, capturing the prey in its immensely strong jaws.\nThere are four species of crocodile found in Africa: the slender-snouted crocodile, Nile crocodile, West African crocodile, and the dwarf crocodile.\nThe largest African crocodile is the Nile crocodile. It is the second-largest crocodile species: only Australia\u2019s saltwater crocodile is bigger!

Like all locusts it is a member of the grasshopper family Acrididae.\nMost of the time the desert locust is solitary and flies at night. However, under certain conditions \u2013 usually an increase in rainfall after a period of drought \u2013 the insects begin congregating and multiplying rapidly, forming huge swarms that fly during the day.\nDesert locust swarms can cover an area of 460 square miles (1,200 km2), and consist of up to 100 billion insects! These crop-destroying insect clouds can move at up to 124 miles (200 km) in a day.\nIt is said that a plague of locusts can affect the livelihood of one-tenth of all humans.\nReturn to index\nDriver Ant\nNumber of species: around 60\nGenus: Dorylus\nDriver ants live in huge colonies containing over 20 million insects. When food becomes short, driver ants march through the undergrowth in long lines consisting of many millions of insects, eating any insects (and occasionally larger animals) in their path.\nDriver ants have a sting, but usually attack with their powerful jaws. Their bite is extremely painful. Local people are known to use the insects\u2019 jaws, which remain closed even if the ant\u2019s head is separated from its body, to close wounds.\nReturn to index\nFennec Fox\nScientific Name: Vulpes zerda\nConservation Status: Least Concern\nThe fennec fox is the smallest member of the dog family.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "African forest elephant - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_forest_elephant", "text": "African elephant species\nThe African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) is one of the two living African elephant species. It is native to humid forests in West Africa and the Congo Basin. It is the smallest of the three living elephant species, reaching a shoulder height of 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in). Both sexes have straight, down-pointing tusks, which erupt when they are 1\u20133 years old. It lives in family groups of up to 20 individuals. Since it forages on leaves, seeds, fruit, and tree bark, it has been referred to as the 'megagardener of the forest'. It contributes significantly to maintain the composition and structure of the Guinean Forests of West Africa and the Congolese rainforests.\nThe first scientific description of the species was published in 1900. During the 20th century, the population declined due to hunting to less than 30,000 individuals estimated in 2013. It is threatened by habitat loss, fragmentation, and poaching. The conservation status of populations varies across range countries. Since 2021, the species has been listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List.\nTaxonomy [ edit ]\nLoxodonte was proposed as the generic name for African elephants by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cuvier in 1825. This name refers to the lozenge-shaped enamel of the molar teeth, which differs significantly from the shape of the Asian elephant's molar enamel. Loxodonte was latinized to Loxodonta by an anonymous author in 1827.\nElephas (Loxodonta) cyclotis was the scientific name proposed by Paul Matschie in 1900 who described the skulls of a female and a male specimen collected by the Sanaga River in southern Cameroon.\nPhylogeny [ edit ]\nThe African forest elephant was long considered to be a subspecies of the African elephant, together with the African bush elephant. Morphological and DNA analysis showed that they are two distinct species.\nThe taxonomic status of the African pygmy elephant (Loxodonta pumilio) was uncertain for a long time. Phylogenetic analysis of the mitochondrial genome of nine specimens from museum collections indicates that it is an African forest elephant whose diminutive size or early maturity is due to environmental conditions.\nPhylogenetic analysis of nuclear DNA of African bush and forest elephants, Asian elephants, woolly mammoths and American mastodons revealed that the African forest elephant and African bush elephant form a sister group that genetically diverged at least 1.9 million years ago. They are therefore considered distinct species. Gene flow between the two species might have occurred after the split, though. Analysis of ancient DNA from living and extinct elephantids indicates that the African forest elephant is one of three ancestors of the straight-tusked elephant (Palaeoloxodon antiquus).\nCharacteristics [ edit ]\nSkulls of African bush elephant (left) and African forest elephant (right)\nThe African forest elephant has a grey skin, which looks yellow to reddish after wallowing. It is sparsely covered with black coarse hair, which is 20\u2013200 mm (0.8\u20138 in) long around the tip of the tail. The length of the tail varies between individuals from half the height of the rump to almost touching ground. It has five toenails on the fore foot and four on the hind foot. Its oval-shaped ears have small elliptical-shaped tips. Its large ears help to reduce body heat; flapping them creates air currents and exposes the ears' inner sides where large blood vessels increase heat loss during hot weather. Its back is nearly straight. Its tusks are straight and point downwards.\nSize [ edit ]\nBulls reach a shoulder height of 2.4\u20133.0 m (7 ft 10 in \u2013 9 ft 10 in). Females are smaller at about 1.8\u20132.4 m (5 ft 11 in \u2013 7 ft 10 in) tall at the shoulder. They reach a weight of 2\u20134 t (2.2\u20134.4 short tons). Foot print size ranges from 12.5 to 35.3 cm (4.9 to 13.9 in).\nTrunk [ edit ]\nThe tip of the trunk of African elephants has two finger-like processes. The trunk is a prehensile elongation of its upper lip and nose. This highly sensitive organ is innervated primarily by the trigeminal nerve, and thought to be manipulated by about 40\u201360,000 muscles. Because of this muscular structure, the trunk is so strong that elephants can use it for lifting about 3% of their own body weight. They use it for smelling, touching, feeding, drinking, dusting, producing sounds, loading, defending and attacking.\nTusks and molars [ edit ]\nThe African forest elephant's tusks are straight and point downwards. Both male and female African elephants have tusks that grow from deciduous teeth called tushes, which are replaced by tusks when calves are about one year old. Tusks are composed of dentin, which forms small diamond-shaped structures in the tusk's center that become larger at its periphery. A conical layer on their tips consisting of tooth enamel is usually worn off when the elephant is five years old.\nThe African forest elephant has pink tusks, which are thinner and harder than the tusks of the African bush elephant. The length and diameter vary between individuals. Tusks of bulls grow throughout life, tusks of cows cease growing when they are sexually mature. They use their tusks for marking and debarking trees, digging for roots, minerals and water, to rest and protect the trunk, and also for defense and attack.\nThe tusks are used to push through the dense undergrowth of their habitat. Their tusks can grow to about 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) long and can weigh between 23 and 45 kg (50 and 100 lb).\nDistribution and habitat [ edit ]\nA family of African forest elephants in the Dzanga-Sangha Special Reserve wetlands, Central African Republic\nPopulations of the African forest elephant in Central Africa range in large contiguous rainforest tracts from Cameroon to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with the largest stable population in Gabon. where suitable habitat covers 90% of the country.\nHowever, it is estimated that the population of African forest elephants in central Africa declined by around 86% in the 31 years preceding 2021 owing to poaching and loss of habitat. In addition, Cameroon, Congo and the Central African Republic have suffered from high levels of conflict. The first survey in 30 years in 2021, by the Wildlife Conservation Society and the National Parks of Gabon, reported an estimated 95,000 forest elephants in Gabon. Prior to this the population had been estimated at 50,000 to 60,000 individuals.\nThey are also distributed in the evergreen moist deciduous Upper Guinean forests in Ivory Coast and Ghana, in West Africa.\nBehaviour and ecology [ edit ]\nAfrican forest elephants in a waterhole\nGroup of African forest elephants digging at a mineral lick\nA female with her calf drinking from a spring\nThe African forest elephant lives in family groups. Groups observed in the rain forest of Gabon's Lop\u00e9 National Park between 1984 and 1991 comprised between three and eight individuals. Groups of up to 20 individuals were observed in the Dzanga-Sangha Complex of Protected Areas, comprising adult cows, their daughters and subadult sons. Family members look after calves together, called allomothering. Once young bulls reach sexual maturity, they separate from the family group and form loose bachelor groups for a few days, but usually stay alone. Adult bulls associate with family groups only during the mating season. Family groups travel about 7.8 km (4.8 mi) per day and move in a home range of up to 2,000 km2 (770 sq mi). Their seasonal movement is related to the availability of ripe fruits in Primary Rainforests. They use a complex network of permanent trails that pass through stands of fruit trees and connect forest clearings with mineral licks. These trails are reused by humans and other animals.\nIn Odzala-Kokoua National Park, groups were observed to frequently meet at forest clearings indicating a fission\u2013fusion society. They stayed longer when other groups were also present. Smaller groups joined large groups, and bulls joined family units.\nDiet [ edit ]\nThe African forest elephant feeds on bark, leaves, and fruit\nThe African forest elephant is an herbivore. Elephants observed in Lop\u00e9 National Park fed mostly tree bark and leaves, and at least 72 different fruits. To supplement their diet with minerals, they congregate at mineral-rich waterholes and mineral licks.\nElephant dung piles collected in Kahuzi-Bi\u00e9ga National Park contained seeds and fruit remains of Omphalocarpum mortehanii, junglesop (Anonidium mannii), Antrocaryon nannanii, Klainedoxa gabonensis, Treculia africana, Tetrapleura tetraptera, Uapaca guineensis, Autranella congolensis, Gambeya africana and G. lacourtiana, Mammea africana, Cissus dinklagei, and Grewia midlbrandii. Dung piles collected in a lowland rain forest in the northern Republic of Congo contained seeds of at least 96 plant species, with a minimum of 30 intact seeds and up to 1102 large seeds of more than 1 cm (0.39 in) in a single pile. Based on the analysis of 855 dung piles, it has been estimated that African forest elephants disperse a daily mean of 346 large seeds per 1 km2 (0.39 sq mi) of at least 73 tree species; they transport about a third of the large seeds for more than 5 km (3.1 mi).\nSeeds passed by elephant gut germinate faster. The African forest elephant is one of the most effective seed dispersers in the tropics and has been referred to as the \"megagardener of the forest\" due to its significant role in maintaining plant diversity. In the Cuvette Centrale, 14 of 18 megafaunal tree species depend on seed dissemination by African forest elephants, including wild mango (Irvingia gabonensis), Parinari excelsa and Tridesmostemon omphalocarpoides. These 14 species are not able to survive without elephants. African forest elephants provide ecological services that maintain the composition and structure of Central African forests.\nCommunication [ edit ]\nSince this species is newly recognized, little to no literature is available on communication and perception. For these mammals, hearing and smell are the most important senses they possess because they do not have good eyesight. They can recognize and hear vibrations through the ground and can detect food sources with their sense of smell. Elephants are also an arrhythmic species, meaning they have the ability to see just as well in dim light as they can in the daylight. They are capable of doing so because the retina in their eyes adjusts nearly as quickly as light does.\nThe elephant's feet are sensitive and can detect vibrations through the ground, whether thunder or elephant calls, from up to 10 miles away.\nReproduction [ edit ]\nFemales reach sexual maturity between the age of 8 and 12 years, depending on the population density and nutrition available. On average, they begin breeding at the age of 23 and give birth every 5\u20136 years. As a result, the birth rate is lower than the bush species, which starts breeding at age 12 and has a calf every 3\u20134 years.\nBaby elephants weigh around 105 kg (232 lb) at birth. Almost immediately, they can stand up and move around, allowing the mother to roam around and forage, which is also essential to reduce predation. The baby suckles using its mouth while its trunk is held over its head. Their tusks do not come until around 16 months and calves are not weaned until they are roughly 4 or 5 years old. By this time, their tusks are around 14 cm (5.5 in) long and begin to get in the way of suckling.\nForest elephants have a lifespan of about 60 to 70 years and mature slowly, coming to puberty in their early teens. Bulls generally pass puberty within the next year or two of females. Between the ages of 15 and 25, bulls experience \"musth\", which is a hormonal state they experience marked by increased aggression. The male secretes fluid from the temporal gland between its ear and eye during this time. Younger bulls often experience musth for a shorter period of time, while older bulls do for a longer time. When undergoing musth, bulls have a more erect walk with their heads high and tusks inward, they may rub their heads on trees or bushes to spread the musth scent, and they may even flap their ears, accompanied by a musth rumble, so that their smell can be blown towards other elephants. Another behavior affiliated with musth is urination. Bulls allow their urine to slowly come out and spray the insides of their hind legs. All of these behaviors are to advertise to receptive females and competing bulls they are in the musth state. Bulls only return to the herd to breed or to socialize, they do not provide prenatal care to their offspring but rather play a fatherly role to younger bulls to show dominance.\nThe females are polyestrous, which means that they are capable of conceiving multiple times a year, which is a reason why they do not appear to have a breeding season. However, there does appear to be a peak in conceptions during the two rainy seasons of the year. Generally, the female conceives after two or three matings. Although the female has plenty of room in her uterus to gestate twins, twins are rarely conceived. The female African forest elephant's pregnancy lasts 22 months. Based on the maturity, fertility, and gestation rates, African forest elephants have the capabilities of increasing the species' population size by 5% annually under ideal conditions.\nThreats [ edit ]\nBoth African elephant species are threatened foremost by habitat loss and habitat fragmentation following conversion of forests for plantations of non-timber crops, livestock farming, and building urban and industrial areas. As a result, human-elephant conflict has increased. Poaching for ivory and bushmeat is a significant threat in Central Africa. Because of a spike in poaching, the African forest elephant was declared Critically Endangered by the IUCN in 2021 after it was found that the population had decreased by more than 80% over 3 generations.\nCivil unrest, human encroachment, and habit fragmentation leaves some elephants confined to small patches of forest without sufficient food. In January 2014, International Fund for Animal Welfare undertook a relocation project at the request of the Ivory Coast government, moving four elephants from Daloa to Assagny National Park.\nPoaching [ edit ]\nTridom is a hotspot for poaching of African forest elephants\nGenetic analysis of confiscated ivory showed that 328 tusks of African forest elephants seized in the Philippines between 1996 and 2005 originated in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo; 2,871 tusks seized in Hong Kong between 2006 and 2013 originated in Tridom, the tri-national Dja-Odzala-Mink\u00e9b\u00e9 protected area complex and the adjacent Dzanga Sangha Reserve in the Central African Republic. So did partly worked ivory confiscated between 2013 and 2014 at warehouses in Togo comprising 4,555 kg (10,042 lb) of tusks. The hard ivory of the African forest elephant makes for more enhanced carving and fetches a higher price on the black market. This preference is evident in Japan, where hard ivory has nearly monopolized the trade for some time. Premium quality bachi, a traditional Japanese plucking tool used for string instruments, is contrived exclusively from African forest elephant tusks. In the impenetrable and often trackless expanses of the rain forests of the Congo Basin, poaching is extremely difficult to detect and track. Levels of off-take, for the most part, are estimated from ivory seizures. The scarcely populated and unprotected forests in Central Africa are most likely becoming increasingly alluring to organized poacher gangs.\nLate in the 20th century, conservation workers established a DNA identification system to trace the origin of poached ivory. Due to poaching to meet high demand for ivory, the African forest elephant population approached critical levels in the 1990s and early 2000s. Over several decades, numbers are estimated to have fallen from approximately 700,000 to less than 100,000, with about half of the remaining population in Gabon. In May 2013, Sudanese poachers killed 26 elephants in the Central African Republic's Dzanga Bai World Heritage Site. Communications equipment, video cameras, and additional training of park guards were provided following the massacre to improve protection of the site. From mid-April to mid-June 2014, poachers killed 68 elephants in Garamba National Park, including young ones without tusks.\nAt the request of President Ali Bongo Ondimba, twelve British soldiers traveled to Gabon in 2015 to assist in training park rangers following the poaching of many elephants in Minkebe National Park.\nBushmeat trade [ edit ]\nIt is not ivory alone that drives African forest elephant poaching. Killing for bushmeat in Central Africa has evolved into an international business in recent decades with markets reaching New York and other major cities of the United States, and the industry is still on the rise. This illegal market poses the greatest threat not only to forest elephants where hunters can target elephants of all ages, including calves, but to all of the larger species in the forests. There are actions that can be taken to lower the incentive for supplying to the bushmeat market. Regional markets, and international trade, require the transporting of extensive amounts of animal meat which, in turn, requires the utilisation of vehicles. Having checkpoints on major roads and railroads can potentially help disrupt commercial networks. In 2006, it was estimated that 410 African forest elephants are killed yearly in the Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests.\nConservation [ edit ]\nIn 1986, the African Elephant Database was initiated with the aim to monitor the status of African elephant populations. This database includes results from aerial surveys, dung counts, interviews with local people, and data on poaching.\nBoth African elephant species have been listed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora on CITES Appendix I since 1989. This listing banned commercial international trade of wild African elephants and their parts and derivatives by countries that signed the CITES agreement. Populations of Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe were listed in CITES Appendix II in 1997 as was the population of South Africa in 2000. Hunting elephants is banned in the Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Senegal.\nAfrican forest elephants are estimated to constitute up to one-third of the continent's elephant population but have been poorly studied because of the difficulty in observing them through the dense vegetation that makes up their habitat. Thermal imaging has facilitated observation of the species, leading to more information on their ecology, numbers, and behavior, including their interactions with elephants and other species. Scientists have learned more about how the elephants, who have poor night vision, negotiate their environment using only their hearing and olfactory senses. They also appeared to be much more active sexually during the night compared to the day, which was unexpected.\nReferences [ edit ]\nNotes [ edit ]\nFurther reading [ edit ]"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Topsy (elephant) - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topsy_(elephant)", "text": "Elephant electrocuted in 1903\nTopsy (circa 1875 \u2013 January 4, 1903) was a female Asian elephant who was electrocuted at Coney Island, New York, in January 1903. Born in Southeast Asia around 1875, Topsy was secretly brought into the United States soon thereafter and added to the herd of performing elephants at the Forepaugh Circus, who fraudulently advertised her as the first elephant born in America. During her 25 years at Forepaugh, Topsy gained a reputation as a \"bad\" elephant and, after killing a spectator in 1902, was sold to Coney Island's Sea Lion Park. When Sea Lion was leased out at the end of the 1902 season and replaced by Luna Park, Topsy was involved in several well-publicized incidents, attributed to the actions of either her drunken handler or the park's new publicity-hungry owners, Frederic Thompson and Elmer \"Skip\" Dundy.\nTheir end-of-the-year plans to hang Topsy at the park in a public spectacle and charge admission were prevented by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The event was instead limited to invited guests and press only and Thompson and Dundy agreed to use a more sure method of strangling the elephant with large ropes tied to a steam-powered winch with both poison and electrocution planned for good measure, a measure supported by the ASPCA. On January 4, 1903, in front of a small crowd of invited reporters and guests, Topsy was fed carrots laced with 460 grams of potassium cyanide, electrocuted and strangled, the electrocution being the final cause of death. Among the invited press that day was a crew from the Edison Manufacturing movie company who filmed the event. Their film of the electrocution part was released to be viewed in coin-operated kinetoscopes under the title Electrocuting an Elephant. It is probably the first filmed death of an animal in history.\nThe story of Topsy fell into obscurity for the next 70 years but has become more prominent in popular culture, partly due to the fact that the film of the event still exists. In popular culture Thompson and Dundy's killing of Topsy has switched attribution, with claims it was an anti-alternating current demonstration organized by Thomas A. Edison during the war of the currents. Edison was never at Luna Park and the electrocution of Topsy took place ten years after the war of currents.\nLife [ edit ]\nForepaugh Circus [ edit ]\n1899 poster for the combined Forepaugh & Sells Brothers Circus featuring acrobats' \"Terrific flights over ponderous elephants\"\nTopsy was born in the wild around 1875 in Southeast Asia and was captured soon after by elephant traders. Adam Forepaugh, owner of the Forepaugh Circus, had the elephant secretly smuggled into the United States with plans that he would advertise the baby as the first elephant born in America. At the time Forepaugh Circus was in competition with the Barnum & Bailey Circus over who had the most and largest elephants. The name \"Topsy\" came from a slave girl character in Uncle Tom's Cabin.\nForepaugh announced to the press in February 1877 that his circus now boasted \"the only baby elephant ever born on American soil\". The elephant trader who sold Topsy to Forepaugh also sold elephants to P. T. Barnum and tipped Barnum off about the deception. Barnum exposed the hoax publicly and Forepaugh stopped claiming that Topsy was born in America, only advertising that she was the first elephant born outside a tropical zone.\nAt maturity, Topsy was 10 ft (3.0 m) high and 20 ft (6.1 m) long, with claims she weighed between 4 and 6 short tons (3.6 and 5.4 long tons; 3.6 and 5.4 metric tons). Over the years, Topsy gained a reputation as a \"bad\" elephant. In 1902, another event brought her again to prominence: the killing of spectator James Fielding Blount in Brooklyn, New York, at what was then the Forepaugh & Sells Brothers' Circus. Accounts vary as to what happened but the common story is that on the morning of May 27, 1902, a possibly drunk Blount wandered into the menagerie tent where all the elephants were tied in a line and began teasing them in turn, offering them a bottle of whiskey. He reportedly threw sand in Topsy's face and then burnt the extremely sensitive tip of her trunk with a lit cigar. Topsy threw Blount to the ground with her trunk and then crushed him with her head, knees, or foot. Newspaper reports on Blount's death contained what seem to be exaggerated accounts of Topsy's man-killing past, with claims that she killed up to 12 men, but with more common accounts that, during the 1900 season, she had killed two Forepaugh & Sells Brothers' Circus workers, one in Paris, Texas and one in Waco, Texas. Journalist Michael Daly, in his 2013 book on Topsy, could find no record of anyone being killed by an elephant in Waco; and a handler named Mortimer Loudett of Albany, NY attacked by Topsy in Paris, TX suffered injuries but there is no record of him dying. The publicity generated by Topsy's man killing brought very large crowds to the circus to see the elephant. In June 1902 during the unloading of Topsy from a train in Kingston, New York, a spectator named Louis Dondero used a stick in his hand to \"tickle\" Topsy behind the ear. Topsy seized Dondero around the waist with her trunk, hoisted him high in the air and threw him back down before being stopped by a handler. Because of this attack, the owners of Forepaugh & Sell Circus decided to sell Topsy.\nSea Lion and Luna Park [ edit ]\nTopsy was sold in June 1902 to Paul Boyton, owner of Coney Island's Sea Lion Park, and added to the menagerie of animals on display there. The elephant's handler from Forepaugh, William \"Whitey\" Alt, came along with Topsy to work at the park. A bad summer season and competition with the nearby Steeplechase Park made Boyton decide to get out of the amusement park business. At the end of the year he leased Sea Lion Park to Frederick Thompson and Elmer Dundy who proceeded to redevelop it into a much larger attraction and renamed it Luna Park. Topsy was used in publicity, moving timbers and even the fanciful airship Luna, part of the amusement ride A Trip to the Moon, from Steeplechase to Luna Park, characterized in the media as \"penance\" for her rampaging ways.\nDuring the moving of the Luna in October 1902, handler William Alt was involved in an incident where he stabbed Topsy with a pitchfork trying to get her to pull the amusement ride. When confronted by a police officer, Alt turned Topsy loose from her work harness to run free in the streets, leading to Alt's arrest. The occurrence was attributed to the handler's drinking. In December 1902, a drunk Alt rode Topsy down the town streets of Coney Island and walked, or tried to ride, Topsy into the local police station. Accounts say Topsy tried to batter her way through the station door and \"she set up a terrific trumpeting\", leading the officers to take refuge in the cells. The handler was fired after the incident.\nDeath [ edit ]\nTopsy, standing in the middle of press photographers and on-lookers, refusing to cross the bridge over the lagoon to the spot where she was supposed to be killed. She eventually had to be wired up where she stood.\nWithout Alt to handle Topsy, the owners of Luna Park, Frederick Thompson and Elmer Dundy, claimed they could no longer handle the elephant and tried to get rid of her, but they could not even give her away and no other circus or zoo would take her. On December 13, 1902, Luna Park press agent Charles Murray released a statement to the newspapers that Topsy would be put to death within a few days by electrocution. At least one local paper noted that the steady drone of events and reports regarding Topsy from the park had the hallmarks of a publicity campaign designed to get the new park continually mentioned in the papers. On January 1, 1903, Thompson and Dundy announced plans to conduct a public hanging of the elephant, set for January 3 or 4, and collect a twenty-five cents a head admission to see the spectacle. The site they chose was an island in the middle of the lagoon for the old Shoot the Chute ride where they were building the centerpiece of their new park, the 200-foot Electric Tower (the structure had reached a height of 75 feet at the time of the killing). Press agent Murray arranged media coverage and posted banners around the park and on all four sides of the makeshift gallows advertising, \"OPENING MAY 2ND 1903 LUNA PARK $1,000,000 EXPOSITION, THE HEART OF CONEY ISLAND\".\nOn hearing Thompson and Dundy's plans, the President of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, John Peter Haines, stepped in and forbade hanging as a \"needlessly cruel means of killing [Topsy]\" and also told Thompson and Dundy they could not conduct a public spectacle and charge admission. Thompson and Dundy discussed alternatives with Haines, going over methods used in previous attempts to euthanize elephants including poisoning, but that, as well as a 1901 attempt to electrocute an elephant named Jumbo II two years earlier in Buffalo, New York, were botched. After much negotiation, which included Thompson and Dundy trying to give the elephant to the ASPCA, a method of strangling the elephant with large ropes tied to a steam-powered winch was agreed upon. They also agreed they would use poisoning and electricity as well.\nThe date of Topsy's demise was finally set for Sunday, January 4, 1903. The press attention the event had received brought out an estimated 1,500 spectators and 100 press photographers as well as agents from the ASPCA to inspect the proceedings. Thompson and Dundy allowed 100 spectators into the park although more climbed through the park fence. Many more were on the balconies and roofs of nearby buildings, which were charging admission to see the event. The Electric Tower had been re-rigged with large ropes set up to strangle the elephant, which were inspected by the ASPCA agents to make sure they conformed to what had been agreed. The details of the electrocution part of the execution were handled by workers from the local power company, Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Brooklyn, under the supervision of chief electrician P. D. Sharkey. They spent the night before stringing power lines from the Coney Island electrical substation nine blocks to the park to carry alternating current they planned to redirect from a much larger plant in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. At Bay Ridge the staff was told to \"get an engine ready and clear a feeder and bus to Coney Island Station\".\nA press photograph of the electrocution of Topsy with the unfinished \"Electric Tower\" in the background.\nTopsy was led out of her pen into the unfinished Luna Park by Carl Goliath, an expert on elephants who formerly worked for animal showman Carl Hagenbeck. Newspaper accounts of the events noted that Topsy refused to cross the bridge over the lagoon, ignoring prodding by Goliath and even bribes of carrots and apples. The owners of Luna Park then tried to get William Alt, who would not watch the killing, to lead Topsy across the bridge, but he declined an offer of $25 to coax her to her death saying he would \u201cnot for $1,000\u201d. They finally gave up trying to get Topsy across the bridge and decided to \"bring death to her\". The steam engine, ropes, and the electrical lines were re-rigged to the spot where Topsy stood. The electricians attached copper-lined sandals connected to AC lines to Topsy's right fore foot and left hind foot so the charge would flow through the elephant's body. With chief electrician Sharkey making sure everyone was clear, Topsy was fed carrots laced with 460 grams of potassium cyanide by press agent Charles Murray who then backed away. At 2:45pm Sharkey gave a signal and an electrician on a telephone told the superintendent at Coney Island station nine blocks away to close a switch and Luna Park chief electrician Hugh Thomas closed another one at the park, sending 6,600 volts from Bay Ridge across Topsy's body for 10 seconds, toppling her to the ground. According to at least one contemporary account, she died \"without a trumpet or a groan\". After Topsy fell, the steam-powered winch tightened two nooses placed around her neck for 10 minutes. At 2:47, Topsy was pronounced dead. An ASPCA official and two veterinarians employed by Thompson and Dundy determined that the electric shock had killed Topsy. During the killing the superintendent of the Coney Island station, Joseph Johansen, became \"mixed up in the apparatus\" when he threw the switch sending power to the park and was nearly electrocuted. He was knocked out and left with small burns from the power traveling from his right arm to his left leg.\nFilm of the execution [ edit ]\nElectrocuting an Elephant, a , a 1903 film of the electrocution of Topsy shot by the Edison Manufacturing Co.\nAmong the press the day Topsy was killed was a film crew from the Edison film company, possibly directed by Edwin S. Porter or Jacob Blair Smith. The crew shot a 74-second film of Topsy's electrocution. Within a few weeks, it was added to the films viewable in Edison kinetoscopes under the title Electrocuting an Elephant. This was one of many short \"actuality\" films shot by the Edison Manufacturing Company from 1897 at Coney Island, depicting rides, bathing scenes, diving horses, and elephants. The Edison company submitted the film to the Library of Congress as a \"paper print\" (a photographic record of each frame of the film) for copyright purposes. The submission may have saved the film for posterity, since most films and negatives of this period decayed or were destroyed over time.\nMedia and culture [ edit ]\nElectrocuting an Elephant does not seem to have been as popular as other Edison films, and could not be viewed at Luna Park because the attraction did not have the necessary coin-operated kinetoscopes. The film and Topsy's story fell into relative obscurity in the intervening years, and appeared as an out-of-context clip in the 1979 film Mr. Mike's Mondo Video. In 1991, documentary maker Ric Burns made the film Coney Island, which included a segment recounting the death of Topsy, including clips from the film Electrocuting an Elephant.\nIn 1999 Topsy was commemorated in the Coney Island Mermaid Parade in a parade float by artist Gavin Heck. In 2003 Heck and a local arts group held a competition to select a memorial arts piece to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Topsy's death. The chosen piece, created by New Orleans artist Lee Deigaard and exhibited at the Coney Island USA museum, allowed the public to view Electrocuting an Elephant on a hand-cranked mutoscope while surrounded by hanging chains and standing on a copper plate.\nIn later years, portions of Electrocuting an Elephant have appeared in movies, music videos, TV shows, and video games. The theme of Topsy's electrocution also appears in songs, in the plot-line of several novels, and in poems such as U.S. poet laureate W. S. Merwin's \"The Chain to Her Leg\".\nAssociation with Thomas Edison [ edit ]\nThomas Alva Edison, often misassociated with the death of Topsy, pictured in around 1903\nIn popular culture, Topsy is often portrayed as being electrocuted in a public demonstration organized by Thomas Edison during the war of the currents to show the dangers of alternating current.\nExamples of this view include a 2008 Wired magazine article titled \"Edison Fries an Elephant to Prove His Point\" and a 2013 episode of the animated comedy series Bob's Burgers titled \"Topsy\". The events surrounding Topsy took place ten years after the end of the \"War\". At the time of Topsy's death, Edison was no longer involved in the electric lighting business. He had been forced out of control of his company by its 1892 merger into General Electric and sold all his stock in GE during the 1890s to finance an iron ore refining venture. The Brooklyn company that still bore his name mentioned in newspaper reports was a privately owned power company no longer associated with his earlier Edison Illuminating Company. Edison himself was not present at Luna Park, and it is unclear as to the input he had in Topsy's death or even its filming since the Edison Manufacturing film company made 1,200 short films during that period with little guidance from Edison as to what they filmed. Journalist Michael Daly, in his 2013 book on Topsy, surmises that Edison would have been pleased by the proper positioning of the copper plates and that the elephant was killed by the large Westinghouse AC generators at Bay Ridge, but he shows no actual contact or communication between the owners of Luna Park and Edison over Topsy.\nTwo things that may have indelibly linked Thomas Edison with Topsy's death were the primary newspaper sources describing it as being carried out by \"electricians of the Edison Company\u201d (leading to an eventual confusing of the unrelated power company with the man), and the fact that the film of the event (like many Edison films from that period) was credited on screen to \"Thomas A. Edison\".\nSee also [ edit ]"}

Sloths come in two and three toed varieties and are related to anteaters, who have similarly formed long arching toenails.\nSloths exist on a diet almost entirely of leaves, which is such an inferior source of nutrition and energy that it shapes their whole lifestyle. They end up spending almost every waking moment quietly munching on leaves with little time for grooming or any other activities.\nThe lack of grooming leads the sloths dense coat to actually grow algae during the rainy season, giving them a greenish tinge.\nWithin the sloths belly is a sea of micro bacteria that help to breakdown and eventually digest what they eat. The process takes so long that a leaf consumed in August might not be eliminated until October.\nWith so much effort exerted to extract a minimum of nutrients, the sloths metabolism is amazingly slow- the slowest in the entire animal kingdom. - Sloth Facts\nthe sloths very special equipment\nAll of the sloth species have numerous amazing adaptions, not only for an arboreal life high in the trees, but also for a life lived in an inverted position.\nSloths do not build nests, instead they find a leafy area and simply fall asleep hanging completely upside down with all four limbs grasping a branch.\nThree toed sloths rear legs, feet and claws are shorter than the front and both two-toed and three-toed sloths have three toes on the rear legs.\nThere is a suggestion that all sloths are three-toed because the front \"toes\" are actually \"fingers\".\nThe claws on the front feet are about 4 inches long, and can be used as a weapon when the sloth is cornered. The claws on all four limbs curve in toward the wrist creating four large, natural hooks. Muscle power is not required for the sloth to grip branches, in fact sloths have about 30% less muscle mass than other mammals of equal size.\nIt is the construction of the claws and limbs, and a natural retraction of the ligaments that creates the \"gripping reflex\" of the sloth. A sloth spends approximately 85% of its life hanging completely upside down, mainly because it requires no effort.\nThe entire sloth is designed for a life of inversion. All of its internal organs, including the heart, liver, spleen and stomach, are rearranged inside its body cavity so nothing gets crushed or obstructed.\nEven the fur on the sloths torso and limbs grows in the opposite direction than it would in other animals with the follicles pointing up the arms and away from the belly so the hairs guide rain water and debris to the ground.\nAs an example of the effortlessness with which sloths dangle from the highest limbs, it is not uncommon for a sloth to pass away and remain securely hooked to its final branch. - Sloth Facts\nsloth reproduction\ntwo toed sloth mother and baby\nSo we know that the sloth is incredibly slow. It takes about a month to digest a leaf, about a minute to move 15 feet and about 6 hours to make it to the bathroom and back.\nBut there is one thing that sloths do with amazing speed, and that one thing is sex.\nSloth females come into heat about once a year and they let the whole neighborhood know it. Normally demure, a lady sloth in heat screams continually until a male finds her or her season passes.\nShe generally does not leave her own trees and just waits for a suitor to arrive. Then, once a gentleman makes his way up to her, it is basically first come first served without any posturing or foreplay.\nIn fact, the whole experience from first contact to completion of deed may only be a matter of seconds. In some species the male may stay for a day or two and there may be several matings, but in other species the male departs right after a single 6 second act of intercourse.\nThe mother sloth gives birth to one pup after about 4 months of pregnancy. The baby is born fully furred, eyes open, and generously clawed. It is basically a miniature adult without the fauna developed in its fur yet, of course.\nThe pup clings to its mothers belly most of the first few months of life and begins to munch on leaves at about 2 months old.\nA baby sloth usually leaves its mother after a year or so, sometimes just moving a tree or two away, but generally has no contact with her once independent. - Sloth Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

That creature, most probably, lived on the ground.\nSo, although they appear to be very similar, they are better described as animals that evolved in the exact same way due to habitat, rather than being closely related. This is called convergent evolution and is a result of creatures changing in the same ways due to exposure to the same circumstances, and arriving at a very similar result that appears to be more closely related than it actually is.\nIn fact, the two-toed sloths actual closest relative is the now-extinct ground sloth. The ground sloths, including the gigantic megatherium or giant ground sloth existed throughout the southern United States up till about 10,000 years ago and was larger than an elephant.\nThese creatures probably lived in groups, as elephants do, and walked on all fours. They had curved claws like the modern sloths and walked on the sides of their feet like anteaters do, because the claws were over a foot long! - Sloth Facts\nwhat's the difference between three-toed and two-toed sloths?\nbrown-throated three-toed sloth\nmaned three-toed sloth\nHoffmanns two-toed sloth (hind foot is also in photo)\nThe three-toed sloth is kind of adorable, and has become a bit of an Internet darling. Most of the photos used in wallpapers and t-shirts are of either the brown-throated or pale-throated three-toed sloth.\nThese two species also have the characteristic dark eye patches that trail down to the neck. Three-toed sloths have fur on their faces, tiny, stumpy tails, three toes on both the front and rear feet, rear legs much shorter than front, and smaller noses than two-toed sloths.\nThe three-toed sloths also have extra neck vertebrae which allow them to swivel their heads 270 degrees around. Because of major skeletal differences like this, two-toed sloths are in a separate zoological family from three-toed.\nTwo=toed sloths are larger and faster and eat a more varied diet of fruits and insects along with leaves. This gives them a bit more energy than their smaller relatives, and they move about more freely in a larger range. Two-toeds have bare flesh on their faces, very large, wet noses, no visible tail (there is a tail vertebrae inside the body) and, of course, two toes on the front feet, three on the rear.\nTwo-toed sloth species are also completely nocturnal, sleeping motionless and almost invisible in the treetops all day long and not moving until after dark. There has been very little field research done on them for this reason, and so, as mysterious an animal as the three-toed sloth is, the two-toed sloth is an even deeper mystery.\nThree-toed sloths spend some time active during early morning or dusk so can be observed more easily. The three-toed in particular, has a tremendously mat-like body of thick fur, that it never grooms.\nThe fur becomes home to both vegetation and insects. Entire colonies of moths may live in their fur, and algae and lichen grow abundantly - particularly in rainy season- providing exceptional camouflage.\nSloths have long, thick, sticky tongues covered in a carpet of tiny, rear-ward pointing spikes that they can pull leaves in with. They have a four-chambered stomach like a cow, to process all the vegetation, but short intestines that don't extract as much energy.\nTheir bodies do not regulate temperature effectively and they must move to sunny spots to warm up. In cold rainy weather their temperature drops and they become inactive. Cold spells can be dangerous for sloth populations because they must move about to eat, but can't get warm enough to move. - Sloth Facts\nsloth lifestyle - pay it forward\nSloths live in very dense rain forest where the tops of mangrove, cecropia and trumpet trees form the famous \"canopy\"- a tangle of branches that can allow a creature like the sloth, or other small arboreal animals like monkeys and lizards to travel sometimes for miles across the rain forest, treetop to treetop, without ever touching the ground.\nAlthough their entire range may expand for several trees, there are many sloths, particularly the smaller, less active three-toed species that spend their entire lives in the limbs of just one single large tree.\nOnce every five to seven days the sloth will climb down to the ground and relieve itself at the base of the tree, burying its feces in basically the same area every time.\nThe buried stool breaks down quickly and provides excellent fertilizer for the parent tree.\nAlthough it is not known why they risk leaving the tree to defecate and don't simply relieve themselves from a branch, their habit of burying their stool at the roots of the tree they live in is an interesting example of the circle of life. - Sloth Facts.\na few more sloth facts\nthree-toed sloth on the ground\nThe sloth has the slowest metabolism of any mammal on Earth.\nSloths take about 25 days to digest one leaf.\nThe ancestors of todays sloth were as big as African elephants\nBoth two-toed and three-toed sloths have three toes on their hind limbs.\nThe sloth takes a potty break only once a week\nSloths sleep hanging completely upside-down\nThe sloths fur is home to algae, lichen and even moths.\nThe sloth turns green in the rainy season due to algae growing on its fur. - Sloth Facts"}

We use our teeth to eat, speak and show that we are happy. Animals can use their teeth not only to eat, but also to groom themselves, carry their young, defend themselves, and build their homes! Here are some interesting facts about animals and their very important teeth:\nBirds\nDo birds have teeth? Well... not really. But this species of toucan called a Collared Aracari sure looks like he does!\nCollared Aracari and his fierce looking \"teeth\".\n\u200d\nToucans and other species of birds like the Gray Goose have serrations (jagged edges) on their beaks that help them grip their prey. These aren't really like the teeth that mammals have\u2014they're more like the \"teeth\" on a saw or a comb.\nThis Gray Goose has a serrated bill and barbs on his tongue that look like teeth but really aren't.\n\u200d\nSome birds, like the King Penguin, have spine-covered tongues and upper palates* that hold wiggly fish in place. Unlike our teeth, the spines are pointed backward and work like barbs to keep food going in the right direction\u2014down their throats!\u2014since most birds swallow their food whole.\n*Your upper palate (the roof of your mouth) is smooth and made of soft tissue. Did you know the skin on your palate and tongue can be a hiding place for germs? It's important to brush your tongue and use mouthwash or swish with water after brushing to make sure your entire mouth is clean!\nThis King Penguin keeps fish from slipping out of his mouth with spines on his tongue that sure look like teeth!\n\u200d\nBaby birds can also have tiny barbs in their mouths (like these baby Cardinals on the left) and most have an \"egg tooth\" at the tip of their beaks to help them crack their shells when they are born!\nEven baby birds can appear to have teeth...but they don't really.\n\u200d\nBirds of prey, like the Common Kestrel Falcon we have pictured, may have a sharp \u201ctomial tooth\u201d to sever their prey\u2019s vertebrae. These aren't really like our teeth since they're not coated in enamel.\n\u200d\n\u200d\nDo snails have teeth?\nSnails may look soft and squishy but, believe it or not, they can have up to 14,000 teeth! (That means it takes them 5 1/2 hours to floss every day! \ud83d\ude09 ) Check out this video of a super cool GIANT African Land Snail:\nHaving trouble viewing this video? Click here to watch it on YouTube.\n\u200d\nElephants\nElephant tusks are modified incisors* that replace milk teeth when the baby elephant is between 6 and 12 months old. After this, their tusks grow about 6 1/2 inches each year! African elephants have tusks in both males and females, but in Asian elephants, only the males have large tusks while the females have very small ones or no tusks at all. Tusks are used for defense, digging for food and water, and carrying and lifting.\n*Your incisors are the teeth at the front of your mouth, four on top and four on the bottom, that are used for biting through crunchy apples and carrots! Learn more about the different kinds of teeth you have by clicking here.\nUnlike humans, whose teeth are pushed up through the gums, an elephant\u2019s teeth are developed from the back and push forward. An elephant has 6 sets of molars during their lifetime. As each tooth wears out through grinding, another tooth moves forward to replace it. A single elephant molar can weigh up to 5 pounds! In captivity, mature elephants are trained to open wide so their keepers can keep their teeth healthy since an elephant with unhealthy or missing teeth will starve to death.\nDogs\nPuppies lose their baby or milk teeth over a matter of weeks\u2014not years like human kids. Puppies have about 28 teeth that fall out by the time they\u2019re about 6 months old to make room for 42 adult teeth. That\u2019s 10 more teeth than people have!\n\u200d\nA dog\u2019s teeth are like human teeth in that they have layers: pulp in the middle, surrounded by dentin and coated in hard enamel (the white part of your teeth that you can see.) But dog teeth and people teeth are not shaped the same. Our molars are designed to grind against each other to smash up our food. But a dog\u2019s large, upper premolars and lower molars work together like scissors to slice food apart.\nAn adult dog's teeth work together to slice through meat. Do you see the cavity forming on this dog's teeth?\n\u200d\nDogs don\u2019t usually get cavities because the bacteria that cause cavities in human mouths (that love to feed on sugar!) don\u2019t typically live in dogs\u2019 mouths. When dogs do get cavities, it\u2019s usually from eating sweet treats like bananas or sweet potatoes.\nYou need to take care of your dog\u2019s teeth. They can get gum disease, which can lead to tooth loss (just like in people!) Look for plaque build-up on their teeth and brush it away with a toothbrush and toothpaste made especially for dogs! Dog dental treats or chews can also help keep your dog\u2019s teeth healthy.\n\u200d\nCats\nThese soft cuties also have interesting teeth! By about 4 months old, kittens have already replaced their baby teeth with 30 adult teeth! Since cats are carnivores (meat-eaters), they only have pointy and serrated teeth to clean meat off bones. Their front incisors are mainly used for grooming their fur, not eating.\nCats get cavities too\u2014and they hurt as much as human cavities. They usually start below the gum line, so it's important to get regular check-ups at the vet. You may need to brush your cat's teeth to keep them healthy!\nClick here to read more about cat teeth.\n\u200d\nTigers\nTake a bite out of these fun facts about this giant kitty's teeth! Tiger cubs are born without teeth but their tiny milk teeth come in after only a few days. They'll be pushed out by their permanent teeth so they're never missing any.\nHealthy adult tigers have 30 teeth and a large gap between their pointy front teeth and their back molars. This helps the tiger really latch onto their prey!\n\u200d\nA tiger's jaw can only move up and down, not from side to side, helping them exert up to 1,000 pounds of pressure when they bite! Aren't you glad you're not tiger prey?\nFor more facts about tiger teeth click here.\n\u200d\nRabbits & Squirrels\nThese adorable, fuzzy cuties are herbivores, so they don't have canine teeth. Instead, they have six incisors in the front that work like scissors to cut up grass, and 22 molars in the back that grind up food.\n\u200d\nUnlike people, rabbit teeth are not protected by enamel and wear down easily. As a result, their teeth are continually growing. They can grow 3-5 inches each year! If a bunny isn't fed the right amount of fibrous foods like grass and hay, their teeth can grow too long and cause major oral health problems that make it difficult to eat.\nThis pet bunny wasn't fed the proper food. A vet will have to fix his teeth, which have grown too long.\n\u200d\nSquirrels have four front teeth that, like rabbits and other rodents, continue to grow for their whole life. This keeps their teeth from wearing out as they gnaw on nuts, pine cones and bark. Sometimes the front teeth of a wild squirrel will not line up like they should. They will keep growing until the squirrel cannot eat anymore and the squirrel starves to death. \ud83d\ude22\nWhen our teeth don't line up the way they should it can be difficult to take care of them, chew, or speak properly. Luckily, unlike squirrels, people can go to an orthodontist to get braces!\n\u200d\nDid you know long-tailed macaques teach their young offspring how floss their teeth with strands of hair?! It's true!\nHaving trouble viewing this video? Click here to watch it on YouTube.\n\u200d\nIf baby monkeys can learn to floss, so can you! Click here for flossing tips.\nAlligators and Crocodiles\nAn adult alligator has between 74 and 84 teeth in its mouth. Alligator teeth aren\u2019t very sharp so they have to bite down very hard to make up for it. If an alligator loses a tooth, a new one will take its place\u2014producing up to 3,000 teeth in a lifetime!\nCrocodiles have between 60-110 teeth\u2014and they\u2019re very sharp! Crocs use their sharp teeth to tear apart flesh and swallow large chunks. A crocodile can replace each of its teeth up to 50 times and can go through 4,000 teeth in its lifetime. (That\u2019s A LOT of visits from The Tooth Fairy!)\nCrocodiles can\u2019t sweat. Instead, they open their mouths wide to exhale heat, similar to the way a dog pants to cool down. When the Nile Crocodile does this, a small bird called a Plover bird flies inside the croc\u2019s mouth to eat the bits of meat lodged around and between its teeth. The Plover gets a free meal and the croc gets a dental cleaning!\nSince Plover birds don't clean human teeth, you'll need to brush yours two times for two minutes every day. Be sure to visit your dental office two times every year too. The dental hygienist will give your teeth an extra good cleaning and make sure your gums are healthy too!\nThe Nile Crocodile has been measured to have the most powerful bite in the world\u2014exerting up to 5,000 pounds of pressure per square inch. This is 10 times more pressure than the feared great white shark!\n\u200d\nSnakes\nAll snakes have teeth, but only venomous snakes have fangs to inject venom into their prey. These fangs work like the hollow hypodermic needles used to give shots at the doctor's office.\n\u200d\nNot all venomous snakes are deadly. This parrot snake (below) has venom that causes pain near the bite and swelling that goes away after a few hours.\n\u200d\nLearn more interesting facts about snake teeth by clicking here.\n\u200d\nCows\nCows have no upper front teeth. To chew they press their bottom teeth against their hard palate. They eat for about 8 hours a day!\n\u200d\nDid you know the cheese we make from cow\u2019s milk helps protect our teeth from harmful acid and causes more cleansing saliva for fewer cavities? It\u2019s true! In fact, there are lots of foods that will help keep your teeth healthy. Read about them by clicking here.\n\u200d\nSharks\nBaby sharks are born with a complete set of teeth, which means they should visit the shark dentist right away! Baby humans should visit the dentist as soon as their first teeth emerge or by their first birthday (whichever comes first!)\nThe shark dentist is in:\nHaving trouble viewing this video? Click here to watch it.\n\u200d\nEach type of shark has a different shaped tooth depending on what they eat. Shark teeth don\u2019t have roots like our teeth do, so they fall out easily while the shark is eating. On average, sharks lose about one tooth per week. However, because sharks grow teeth much like a conveyer belt in rows, each tooth can be replaced within a day! Most sharks have 5-15 rows of teeth, except for the most dangerous shark in the world\u2014the Bull Shark can have up to 50 rows. Yikes!\nSharks never run out of teeth. A shark may grow as many as 20,000 over its lifetime!\nShark teeth are covered in fluoride, the same ingredient in toothpaste that helps to keep teeth strong, making them naturally resistant to cavities. (Your teeth aren't! So be sure to brush with fluoride toothpaste two times every day.)\nThe upper jaw of the white shark is able to come unhinged from the skull and move forward!

Remember\u2014just like animals need teeth to survive in the wild, you need to take care of your teeth to be healthy and to be able to eat healthy foods. Remember to brush two times for two minutes every day.

(With Other Facts!) - Animal Dome", "url": "https://animaldome.com/why-elephants-obey-humans/", "text": "Elephants are the largest animal on the land, and they look scary. They have robust bodies that can crush a car when they step into it. However, even though they are bigger than any land predators, elephants are still one of the animals that have the softest heart. Elephants can be attached and obey humans. Why do they obey humans despite their large size?\nWhy do elephants obey humans? When other animals are trained and tamed, they will obey humans. Same with the elephants. Elephants obey humans not because they want to, but because they\u2019ve been used to rewards. In simple words, elephants obey humans because humans trained them to do so.\nHowever, there are other things you can learn from our topic. We are going to tell you the truth if elephants are naturally friendly to humans or not. Also, we are going to answer some questions related to our subject. This topic will cover all about the relationship between elephants and humans. If you are ready, let\u2019s hit it!\nThe Other Reasons Why Elephants Obey Humans\nLike I have said above, elephants obey humans not because they want to. But because they were trained to do so. Humans will train the animals to obey them to get the benefits they want. They will train the animals harshly or softly.\nSome humans train elephants in a well-mannered way. They feed the elephants, but they don\u2019t keep them in a cage. Instead, they allow elephants to roam around. They don\u2019t paddle the elephant to follow them. Instead, they reward the elephants after the elephant followed what they asked.\nBy using this kind of training, it shows elephants that they can trust humans. They will enjoy obeying what humans asked them to do! Also, elephants will love and build a strong relationship with their owner if their owner trains them in a nice, well-mannered way.\nHowever, there is also a cruel way. The harsh way of training an elephant is like training a slave. Some people execute this kind of training so that the elephants will be scared and obey them. They smash and torture the elephant until the elephant builds a fear. When the elephant has fear already, it will start obeying humans.\nIn simple words, elephants will obey humans whether because of the reward or punishment they receive.\nHumans are very dangerous for elephants. Yes, you read that right. Humans are dangerous for elephants. Humans use elephants to work as a slave. What they usually do is they get the baby elephant from the wild and kill their mothers. The baby elephant they got will be trained, whether harshly or softly.\nHowever, even though the baby elephant will be trained softly, I still don\u2019t agree with it. Taking a baby animal from the wild and keeping it as a pet is illegal. Wildlife species are protected by state laws, federal laws, or both.\nKeeping a wild animal in captivity requires at least one special permit. However, I still don\u2019t agree, even though it is possible to keep an animal from the wild. Animals deserve better, and leaving them alone in the wild is what\u2019s best for them!\nAre Elephants Friendly To Humans?\nYes! Elephants are as friendly as humans, which means they are incredibly friendly. They are friends not just with humans but with other species too.\nHowever, elephants can also be hostile and violent. Elephants are smart mammals. They know what is happening around them. In fact, they can remember every incident that happened to them.\nThe personality of an elephant depends on its genes and its experiences in life. If they had a bad experience with humans before, they most likely stay away from humans.\nWild elephants that are not used to human interaction will not be affectionate towards humans. But if an elephant is used to human interaction, they can build a strong relationship with their human.\nElephants are friendly towards their fellow species, and they will still be even though they are not friendly to humans. However, their friendliness depends on their age, sex, and family affiliation like us humans.\nWhy Do Elephants Charge Humans?\nElephants charge humans as their way of protecting themselves, their homes, and their loved ones.\nMost of the charges elephants do are just mock charges to scare the humans but not harm the humans. They do this if the humans threaten them or go inside their territory.\nWild elephants are the ones that will do this. Domesticated elephants will never do this unless humans hurt or threaten their lives. Even though elephants love humans, of course, they also need to protect their lives.\nDo Elephants Understand Humans?\nAsian elephants certainly can recognize the gestures of humans and respond appropriately to them. This is why these elephants can be trained and tamed to perform on the stage. However, this is a horrific experience for elephants and something I don\u2019t recommend to you.\nThere is also one study made that shows that African elephants can understand humans, and they are listening to us. The elephants can tell the gender or age of a certain human.\nThey can also tell if a human is a threat based on the human\u2019s actions and clothes. The research illustrates how elephants protect themselves from humans.\nI am very sure that all elephants around the world can understand humans. Why? Because they can recognize aggressive and threatening behavior in humans. Also, as I have said above, elephants can form a strong relationship with their humans. So this means that elephants can understand if a human loves them.\nElephants are intelligent animals, and they have the largest brains of any land animal. Elephants have astounding memories, which is why they can remember what happened during their childhood.\nIf humans killed their parents while they were young, they will remember that and will most likely be afraid of humans for their whole lives.\nHow Do Elephants Show Affection?\nElephants love to live in a group. They can build strong relationships with their fellow elephants from the same herd. Elephants have many ways to show affection and love for one another. What are those ways?\nThe first way elephants show affection is by using their trunks. Elephants use their trunks to show love and affection to their fellow elephants. They will stroke or caress each others\u2019 heads and backs with the use of their trunks to comfort their fellow elephants. The baby elephants place their trunks in their mothers\u2019 mouths for reassurance.\nThe second way elephants show affection is by the use of their vocals. Elephants produce different kinds of sounds. Each sound has a different purpose why they use it. They use their vocalizations to express friendliness, love, sadness, and affection.\nElephants will make a low and soft noise, indicating satisfaction in their company with each other. The other sound you hear from the elephants, the famous one, is their trumpet-like sound.\nElephants will blow their trumpets as a sign of excitement or alarm. They will also blow their horns to express how happy they are with the birth of their newborn baby.\nElephants are like humans. They can show affection to each other with the use of vocalizations or body language. Elephants are smart animals that have emotions. Yes! Elephants can also feel.\nThey can feel sadness, anxiousness, and happiness. That is why we humans need to be very careful in every action we do to the elephants.\nCan Elephants Bond With Humans?\nYes! Elephants are capable of forming a strong relationship with their loved ones. Scientists have proven that these giant walking mammals are tightly bonded within their family unit. If humans show love to the elephants, the elephants can love them back and form a strong bond with them.\nDo Elephants Feel Love?\nYes! Elephants can feel love. Like I have said above, elephants can express their affection, love, and care with their fellow elephants. If they can express their love to others, they can also feel the love from their fellow elephants. Because you can\u2019t express love if you don\u2019t know the feeling of being loved.\nElephants can also feel the love from humans. They know if a human loves and cares for them, and they can recognize if humans are abusing them too. Scientists have found that elephants are capable of complex thought and deep feeling.\nHow Smart Are Elephants?\nElephants are incredibly smart creatures. They are the land animals that have the largest brain, and three times as many neurons as humans. Elephants can identify languages, use tools, understand human body language, show empathy and affection, and mimic human voices.\nResearchers have discovered that African elephants can identify what is the gender and age of a certain human. How? By the sound of the humans\u2019 voice. When they hear that the sound of the human is like a threat, they switch into defensive mode.\nThe study shows that elephants can remember and identify the sounds of their abusers. When the elephants hear the sound of their abusers, they most likely run away or will go into defensive mode. Also, the study shows that elephants are not afraid of women and children, and they are more scared of men.\nThe researchers played the voice of a woman and children in front of the elephants. The elephants did not run away nor switch into defensive mode. But when they play a man\u2019s voice, the elephants start to run and switch into defensive mode.\nElephants have emotions too. They can show empathy, affection, and love to their fellow elephants using their vocals and body language. Elephants also mourn like humans when their loved ones die. Check the video below about how elephants mourn for their dead loved ones.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku_GUNzXoeQ\nThe facts above alone proves how smart these giant creatures are!\nFinal Words\nElephants are loving and affectionate animals. They do not deserve to be abused by humans! Even though they can be trained softly, I still don\u2019t agree with it.\nElephants deserve better, and leaving them alone in the wild with their herd is best for them! Let\u2019s work together to make this world safer for elephants. They might get extinct when we do nothing."}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "War elephant - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_elephant", "text": "Elephant trained and guided by humans for combat\nThis article is about elephants trained for combat. For the album by Deer Tick, see War Elephant (album)\nElephant,craca called tusk swords, from India , are pairs of blades specially designed to be attached to elephant tusks.\nA war elephant was an elephant that was trained and guided by humans for combat. The war elephant's main use was to charge the enemy, break their ranks and instill terror and fear. Elephantry is a term for specific military units using elephant-mounted troops.\nWar elephants played a critical role in several key battles in antiquity, especially in Ancient India. While seeing limited and periodic use in ancient China, they became a permanent fixture in armies of historical kingdoms in Southeast Asia. During classical antiquity they were also used in ancient Persia and in the Mediterranean world within armies of Macedon, Hellenistic Greek states, the Roman Republic and later Empire, and Carthage in North Africa. In some regions they maintained a firm presence on the battlefield throughout the Middle Ages. However, their use declined with the spread of firearms and other gunpowder weaponry in early modern warfare. After this, war elephants became restricted to non-combat engineering and labour roles, as well as being used for minor ceremonial uses. They continued to be used in combat, however, in some parts of the world, such as in Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam, well into the 19th century.\nTaming [ edit ]\nwar of Lanka in the ancient Indian epic Ramayana, showing war elephants. A 17th-century depiction of the mythologicalin the ancient Indian epic, showing war elephants.\nAn elephant trainer, rider, or keeper is called a mahout. Mahouts were responsible for capturing and handling elephants. To accomplish this, they utilize metal chains and a specialized hook called an ankus, or 'elephant goad'. According to Chanakya as recorded in the Arthashastra, first the mahout would have to get the elephant used to being led. The elephant would have learned how to raise its legs to help a rider climb on. Then the elephants were taught to run and maneuver around obstacles, and move in formation. These elephants would be fit to learn how to systematically trample and charge enemies.\nThe first elephant species to be tamed was the Asian elephant, for use in agriculture. Elephant taming \u2013 not full domestication, as they are still captured in the wild, rather than being bred in captivity \u2013 may have begun in any of three different places. The oldest evidence comes from the Indus Valley Civilization, around roughly 2000 BC. Archaeological evidence for the presence of wild elephants in the Yellow River valley in Shang China (1600\u20131100 BC) may suggest that they also used elephants in warfare. The wild elephant populations of Mesopotamia and China declined quickly because of deforestation and human population growth: by c. 850 BC the Mesopotamian elephants were extinct, and by c. 500 BC the Chinese elephants were seriously reduced in numbers and limited to areas well south of the Yellow River.\nCapturing elephants from the wild remained a difficult task, but a necessary one given the difficulties of breeding in captivity and the long time required for an elephant to reach sufficient maturity to engage in battle. Sixty-year-old war elephants were always prized as being at the most suitable age for battle service and gifts of elephants of this age were seen as particularly generous. Today an elephant is considered in its prime and at the height of its power between the ages of 25 and 40, yet elephants as old as 80 are used in tiger hunts because they are more disciplined and experienced.\nIt is commonly thought that all war elephants were male because of males' greater aggression, but it is rather because a female elephant in battle will run from a male; therefore only males could be used in war, whereas female elephants were more commonly used for logistics.\nAntiquity [ edit ]\nIndian subcontinent [ edit ]\nConjectural reconstruction of the main gate of Kusinagara used by war elephants circa 500 BC adapted from a relief at Sanchi.\nThere is uncertainty as to when elephant warfare first started, but it is widely accepted that it began in ancient India. The early Vedic period did not extensively specify the use of elephants in war. However, in the Ramayana, the king of Gods and chief Vedic deity Indra is depicted as riding either Airavata, a mythological elephant, or on the divine horse, Uchchaihshravas, as his mounts. Elephants were widely utilized in warfare by the later Vedic period by the 6th century BC. The increased conscription of elephants in the military history of India coincides with the expansion of the Vedic Kingdoms into the Indo-Gangetic Plain suggesting its introduction during the intervening period. The practice of riding on elephants in peace and war was common among Aryans and non-Aryans, royalty or commoner, in the 6th or 5th century BC. This practice is believed to be much older than proper recorded history.\nThe ancient Indian epics Ramayana and Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, dating from 5th\u20134th century BC, elaborately depict elephant warfare. They are recognized as an essential component of royal and military processions. In ancient India, initially, the army was fourfold (chaturanga), consisting of infantry, cavalry, elephants and chariots. Kings and princes principally ride on chariots, which was considered the most royal, while seldom ride the back of elephants. Although viewed as secondary to chariots by royalty, elephants were the preferred vehicle of warriors, especially the elite ones. While the chariots eventually fell into disuse, the other three arms continued to be valued. Many characters in the epic Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata were trained in the art. According to the rules of engagement set for the Kurukshetra War two men were to duel utilizing the same weapon and mount including elephants. In the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata the akshauhini battle formation consists of a ratio of 1 chariot : 1 elephant : 3 cavalry : 5 infantry soldiers. Many characters in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata were described as skilled in the art of elephant warfare e.g. Duryodhana rides an elephant into battle to bolster the demoralized Kaurava army. Scriptures like the Nik\u0101ya and Vinaya Pitaka assign elephants in their proper place in the organization of an army. The Samyutta Nikaya additionally mentions the Gautama Buddha being visited by a 'hatth\u0101roho g\u0101ma\u1e47i'. He is the head of a village community bound together by their profession as mercenary soldiers forming an elephant corp.\nAncient Indian kings certainly valued the elephant in war, some stating that an army without elephants is as despicable as a forest without a lion, a kingdom without a king, or as valor unaided by weapons. The use of elephants further increased with the rise of the Mahajanapadas. King Bimbisara (c. 543 BC), who began the expansion of the Magadha kingdom, relied heavily on his war elephants. The Mahajanapadas would be conquered by the Nanda Empire under the reign of Mahapadma Nanda. Pliny the Elder and Plutarch also estimated the Nanda Army strength in the east as 200,000 infantry, 80,000 cavalry, 8,000 chariots, and 6,000 war elephants. Alexander the Great would come in contact with the Nanda Empire on the banks of the Beas River and was forced to return due to his army's unwillingness to advance. Even if the numbers and prowess of these elephants were exaggerated by historic accounts, elephants were established firmly as war machines in this period.\nChandragupta Maurya (321\u2013297 BC), formed the Maurya Empire, the largest empire to exist in South Asia. At the height of his power, Chandragupta is said to have wielded a military of 600,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, 8,000 chariots and 9,000 war elephants besides followers and attendants.\nIn the Mauryan Empire, the 30-member war office was made up of six boards. The sixth board looked after the elephants, and were headed by Gajadhyaksha. The gajadhyaksha was the superintendent of elephants and his qualifications. The use of elephants in the Maurya Empire as recorded by Chanakya in the Arthashastra. According to Chanakya; catching, training, and controlling war elephants was one of the most important skills taught by the military academies. He advised Chandragupta to setup forested sanctuaries for the wellness of the elephants. Chanakya explicitly conveyed the importance of these sanctuaries. The Maurya Empire would reach its zenith under the reign of Ashoka, who used elephants extensively during his conquest. During the Kalinga War, Kalinga had a standing army of 60,000 infantry, 1000 cavalry and 700 war elephants. Kalinga was notable for the quality of their war elephants which were prized by its neighbors for being stronger. Later the King Kharavela was to restore an independent Kalinga into a powerful kingdom using war elephants as stated in the Hathigumpha inscription or \"Elephant Cave\" Inscriptions.\nFollowing Indian accounts foreign rulers would also adopt the use of elephants.\nMallas defending the city of Kusinagara with war elephants, as depicted at Sanchi.\nThe Cholas of Tamil Nadu also had a very strong elephant force. The Chola emperor Rajendra Chola had an armored elephant force, which played a major role in his campaigns.\nEastern Asia [ edit ]\nElephants were used for warfare in China by a small handful of southern dynasties. The state of Chu used elephants in 506 BC against Wu by tying torches to their tails and sending them into the ranks of the enemy soldiers, but the attempt failed. In December 554 AD, the Liang dynasty used armoured war elephants, carrying towers, against Western Wei. They were defeated by a volley of arrows. The Southern Han dynasty is the only state in Chinese history to have kept a permanent corps of war elephants. These elephants were able to carry a tower with some ten people on their backs. They were used successfully during the Han invasion of Ma Chu in 948. In 970, the Song dynasty invaded Southern Han and their crossbowmen readily routed the Han elephants on 23 January 971, during the taking of Shao. That was the last time elephants were used in Chinese warfare, although the Wanli Emperor (r. 1572\u20131620) did keep a herd of elephants capable of carrying a tower and eight men, which he showed to his guests in 1598. These elephants were probably not native to China and were delivered to the Ming dynasty by Southeast Asian countries such as Siam.[full citation needed] During the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, the rebels used elephants against the Qing dynasty, but the Qing Bannermen shot them with so many arrows that they \"resembled porcupines\" and repelled the elephant charge.\n... the soldiers of the first column were attacked by the elephants. The flags of Major-general of the Guards, Walda of the Yellow Banner, and of Lieutenant Ulehi of the Manchu-Mongol cavalry were captured. As the elephants closed in on the encircled soldiers of the second column, the arrows shot by all of my men [into the elephants\u2019 hides] looked like the quills of a porcupine. The elephants fled towards the hills [but] I was greatly alarmed and had a strange feeling. The rebels withdrew from the plain and split into groups [to hide] in the thick forest of the mountain. \u2014 Dzengseo\nChinese armies faced off against war elephants in Southeast Asia, such as during the Sui\u2013L\u00e2m \u1ea4p war (605), L\u00fd\u2013Song War (1075\u20131077), Ming\u2013Mong Mao War (1386\u20131388), and Ming\u2013H\u1ed3 War (1406\u20131407). In 605, the Champa kingdom of L\u00e2m \u1ea4p in what is now southern Vietnam used elephants against the invading army of China's Sui dynasty. The Sui army dug pits and lured the elephants into them and shot them with crossbows, causing the elephants to turn back and trample their own army. In 1075, the Song defeated elephants deployed on the borderlands of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t during the L\u00fd\u2013Song War. The Song forces used scythed polearms to cut the elephants' trunks, causing them to trample their own troops. During the Mong Mao campaign, the elephants were routed by an assortment of gunpowder projectiles. In the war against the H\u1ed3 dynasty, Ming troops covered their horses with lion masks to scare the elephants and shot them with firearms. The elephants all trembled with fear and were wounded by the gun arrows, causing the Viet army to panic.\nAchaemenid Persia, Macedonia and Hellenistic Greek states [ edit ]\nFrom India, military thinking on the use of war elephants spread westwards to the Persian Achaemenid Empire, where they were used in several campaigns. They in turn came to influence the campaigns of Alexander the Great, king of Macedonia in Hellenistic Greece. The first confrontation between Europeans and the Persian war elephants occurred at Alexander's Battle of Gaugamela (331 BC), where the Persians deployed fifteen elephants. These elephants were placed at the centre of the Persian line and made such an impression on Alexander's army that he felt the need to sacrifice to Phobos, the God of Fear, the night before the battle \u2013 but according to some sources the elephants ultimately failed to deploy in the final battle owing to their long march the day before. Alexander won resoundingly at Gaugamela, but was deeply impressed by the enemy elephants and took these first fifteen into his own army, adding to their number during his capture of the rest of Persia.\nThis elephant and driver with a hunting howdah, including pistol, bows and a rifle are most likely from the Mughal Emperor's stable.\nBy the time Alexander reached the borders of India five years later, he had a substantial number of elephants under his own command. When it came to defeating Porus, who ruled in what is now Punjab, Pakistan, Alexander found himself facing a considerable force of between 85 and 100 war elephants at the Battle of the Hydaspes. Preferring stealth and mobility to sheer force, Alexander manoeuvered and engaged with just his infantry and cavalry, ultimately defeating Porus' forces, including his elephant corps, albeit at some cost. Porus for his part placed his elephants individually, at long intervals from each other, a short distance in front of his main infantry line, in order to scare off Macedonian cavalry attacks and aid his own infantry in their struggle against the phalanx. The elephants caused many losses with their tusks fitted with iron spikes or by lifting the enemies with their trunks and trampling them.\nArrian described the subsequent fight: \"[W]herever the beasts could wheel around, they rushed forth against the ranks of infantry and demolished the phalanx of the Macedonians, dense as it was.\"\nThe Macedonians adopted the standard ancient tactic for fighting elephants, loosening their ranks to allow the elephants to pass through and assailing them with javelins as they tried to wheel around; they managed to pierce the unarmoured elephants' legs. The panicked and wounded elephants turned on the Indians themselves; the mahouts were armed with poisoned rods to kill the beasts but were slain by javelins and archers.\nLooking further east again, however, Alexander could see that the kings of the Nanda Empire and Gangaridai could deploy between 3,000 and 6,000 war elephants. Such a force was many times larger than the number of elephants employed by the Persians and Greeks, which probably discouraged Alexander's army and effectively halted their advance into India. On his return, Alexander established a force of elephants to guard his palace at Babylon, and created the post of elephantarch to lead his elephant units.\nThe successful military use of elephants spread further. The successors to Alexander's empire, the Diadochi, used hundreds of Indian elephants in their wars, with the Seleucid Empire being particularly notable for their use of the animals, still being largely brought from India. Indeed, the Seleucid\u2013Mauryan war of 305\u2013303 BC ended with the Seleucids ceding vast eastern territories in exchange for 500 war elephants \u2013 a small part of the Mauryan forces, which included up to 9000 elephants by some accounts. The Seleucids put their new elephants to good use at the Battle of Ipsus four years later, where they blocked the return of the victorious Antigonid cavalry, allowing the latter's phalanx to be isolated and defeated.\nThe first use of war elephants in Europe was made in 318 BC by Polyperchon, one of Alexander's generals, when he besieged Megalopolis in the Peloponnesus during the wars of the Diadochi. He used 60 elephants brought from Asia with their mahouts. A veteran of Alexander's army, named Damis, helped the besieged Megalopolitians to defend themselves against the elephants and eventually Polyperchon was defeated. Those elephants were subsequently taken by Cassander and transported, partly by sea, to other battlefields in Greece. It is assumed that Cassander constructed the first elephant transport sea vessels. Some of the elephants died of starvation in 316 BC in the besieged city of Pydna in Macedonia. Others of Polyperchon's elephants were used in various parts of Greece by Cassander.\nAlthough the use of war elephants in the western Mediterranean is most famously associated with the wars between Carthage and Roman Republic, the introduction of war elephants there was primarily the result of an invasion by Hellenistic era Epirus across the Adriatic Sea. King Pyrrhus of Epirus brought twenty elephants to attack Roman Italy at the battle of Heraclea in 280 BC, leaving some fifty additional animals, on loan from Ptolemaic Pharaoh Ptolemy II, on the mainland. The Romans were unprepared for fighting elephants, and the Epirot forces routed the Romans. The next year, the Epirots again deployed a similar force of elephants, attacking the Romans at the battle of Asculum. This time the Romans came prepared with flammable weapons and anti-elephant devices: these were ox-drawn wagons, equipped with long spikes to wound the elephants, pots of fire to scare them, and accompanying screening troops who would hurl javelins at the elephants to drive them away. A final charge of Epirot elephants won the day again, but this time Pyrrhus had suffered very heavy casualties \u2013 a Pyrrhic victory.\nThe Seleucid king Antiochus V Eupator, whose father and he vied with Ptolemaic Egypt's ruler Ptolemy VI over the control of Syria, invaded Judea in 161 BC with eighty elephants (others say thirty-two), some clad with armored breastplates, in an attempt to subdue the Jews who had sided with Ptolemy. In the ensuing battle, near certain mountainous straights adjacent to Beth Zachariah, Eleazar the Hasmonaean attacked the largest of the elephants, piercing its underside and bringing the elephant down upon himself.\nNorth Africa [ edit ]\nThe Ptolemaic Egypt and the Punics began acquiring African elephants for the same purpose, as did Numidia and the Kingdom of Kush. The animal used was the North African elephant (Loxodonta africana pharaohensis) which would become extinct from overexploitation.[citation needed] These animals were smaller and harder to tame, and could not swim deep rivers compared with the Asian elephants used by the Seleucid Empire on the east of the Mediterranean region, particularly Syrian elephants, which stood 2.5\u20133.5 meters (8.2\u201311.5 ft) at the shoulder. It is likely that at least some Syrian elephants were traded abroad. The favorite, and perhaps last surviving, elephant of Hannibal's crossing of the Alps was an impressive animal named Surus (\"the Syrian\"), which may have been of Syrian stock, though the evidence remains ambiguous.\nSince the late 1940s, a strand of scholarship has argued that the African forest elephants used by Numidia, the Ptolemies and the military of Carthage did not carry howdahs or turrets in combat, perhaps owing to the physical weakness of the species. Some allusions to turrets in ancient literature are certainly anachronistic or poetic invention, but other references are less easily discounted. There is explicit contemporary testimony that the army of Juba I of Numidia included turreted elephants in 46 BC. This is confirmed by the image of a turreted African elephant used on the coinage of Juba II. This also appears to be the case with Ptolemaic armies: Polybius reports that at the battle of Raphia in 217 BC the elephants of Ptolemy IV carried turrets; these elephants were significantly smaller than the Asian elephants fielded by the Seleucids and so presumably African forest elephants. There is also evidence that Carthaginian war elephants were furnished with turrets and howdahs in certain military contexts.\nFarther south, tribes would have had access to the African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana oxyotis). Although much larger than either the African forest elephant or the Asian elephant, these proved difficult to tame for war purposes and were not used extensively. Some Asian elephants were traded westwards to the Mediterranean markets; Pliny the Elder stated that the Sri Lankan elephants, for example, were larger, fiercer and better for war than local elephants. This superiority, as well as the proximity of the supply to seaports, made Sri Lanka's elephants a lucrative trading commodity. Sri Lankan history records indicate elephants were used as mounts for kings leading their men in the battlefield, with individual mounts being recorded in history. The elephant Kandula was King Dutugamunu's mount and Maha Pambata, 'Big Rock', the mount of King Ellalan during their historic encounter on the battlefield in 200 BC, for example.\nPerhaps inspired by the victories of Pyrrhus of Epirus, Carthage developed its own use of war elephants and deployed them extensively during the First and Second Punic Wars. The performance of the Carthaginian elephant corps was rather mixed, illustrating the need for proper tactics to take advantage of the elephant's strength and cover its weaknesses. At Adyss in 255 BC, the Carthaginian elephants were ineffective due to the terrain, while at the battle of Panormus in 251 BC the Romans' velites were able to terrify the Carthaginian elephants being used unsupported, which fled from the field. At the battle of Tunis however the charge of the Carthaginian elephants helped to disorder the legions, allowing the Carthaginian phalanx to stand fast and defeat the Romans. During the Second Punic War, Hannibal famously led an army of war elephants across the Alps, although many of them perished in the harsh conditions. The surviving elephants were successfully used in the battle of Trebia, where they panicked the Roman cavalry and Gallic allies. The Romans eventually developed effective anti-elephant tactics, leading to Hannibal's defeat at his final battle of Zama in 202 BC; his elephant charge, unlike the one at the battle of Tunis, was ineffective because the disciplined Roman maniples simply made way for them to pass.\nRome [ edit ]\nRome brought back many elephants at the end of the Punic Wars, and used them in its campaigns for many years afterwards. The conquest of Greece saw many battles in which the Romans deployed war elephants, including the invasion of Macedonia in 199 BC, the battle of Cynoscephalae 197 BC, the battle of Thermopylae, and the battle of Magnesia in 190 BC, during which Antiochus III's fifty-four elephants took on the Roman force of sixteen. In later years the Romans deployed twenty-two elephants at Pydna in 168 BC. The role of the elephant force at Cynoscephalae was particularly decisive, as their quick charge shattered the unformed Macedonian left wing, allowing the Romans to encircle and destroy the victorious Macedonian right. A similar event also occurred at Pydna. The Romans' successful use of war elephants against the Macedonians might be considered ironic, given that it was Pyrrhus who first taught them the military potential of elephants.\nElephants also featured throughout the Roman campaign against the Lusitanians and Celtiberians in Hispania. During the Second Celtiberian War, Quintus Fulvius Nobilior was helped by ten elephants sent by king Masinissa of Numidia. He deployed them against the Celtiberian forces of Numantia, but a falling stone hit one of the elephants, which panicked and frightened the rest, turning them against the Roman forces. After the subsequent Celtiberian counterattack, the Romans were forced to withdraw. Later, Quintus Fabius Maximus Servilianus marched against Viriathus with another ten elephants sent by king Micipsa. However, the Lusitanian style of ambushes in narrow terrains ensured his elephants did not play an important factor in the conflict, and Servilianus was eventually defeated by Viriathus in the city of Erisana.\nFamously, the Romans used a war elephant in their first invasion of Britain, one ancient writer recording that \"Caesar had one large elephant, which was equipped with armor and carried archers and slingers in its tower. When this unknown creature entered the river, the Britons and their horses fled and the Roman army crossed over\" \u2013 although he may have confused this incident with the use of a similar war elephant in Claudius' final conquest of Britain. At least one elephantine skeleton with flint weapons that has been found in England was initially misidentified as these elephants, but later dating proved it to be a mammoth skeleton from the Stone Age.\nIn the African campaign of the Roman civil war of 49\u201345 BC, the army of Metellus Scipio used elephants against Caesar's army at the battle of Thapsus. Scipio trained his elephants before the battle by aligning the elephants in front of slingers that would throw rocks at them, and another line of slingers at the elephants' rear to perform the same, in order to propel the elephants only in one direction, preventing them turning their backs because of frontal attack and charging against his own lines, but the author of De Bello Africano admits of the enormous effort and time required to accomplish this.\nBy the time of Claudius however, such animals were being used by the Romans in single numbers only \u2013 the last significant use of war elephants in the Mediterranean was against the Romans at the battle of Thapsus, 46 BC, where Julius Caesar armed his fifth legion (Alaudae) with axes and commanded his legionaries to strike at the elephant's legs. The legion withstood the charge, and the elephant became its symbol. Thapsus was the last significant use of elephants in the West. The remainder of the elephants seemed to have been thrown into panic by Caesar's archers and slingers.\nParthia and Sassanian Persia [ edit ]\nThe Parthian Empire occasionally used war elephants in their battles against the Roman Empire[citation needed] but elephants were of substantial importance in the army of the subsequent Sassanid Empire. The Sasanian war elephants are recorded in engagements against the Romans, such as during Julian's invasion of Persia. Other examples include the Battle of Vartanantz in 451 AD, at which the Sassanid elephants terrified the Armenians, and the Battle of al-Q\u0101disiyyah of 636 AD, in which a unit of thirty-three elephants was used against the invading Arab Muslims, in which battle the war elephants proved to be \"double-edged sword\".\nThe Sassanid elephant corps held primacy amongst the Sassanid cavalry forces and was recruited from India. The elephant corps was under a special chief, known as the Zend\u2212hapet, literally meaning \"Commander of the Indians\", either because the animals came from that country, or because they were managed by natives of Hindustan. The Sassanid elephant corps was never on the same scale as others further east, however, and after the fall of the Sassanid Empire the use of war elephants died out in the region.\nAksumite Empire [ edit ]\nThe Kingdom of Aksum in what is now Ethiopia and Eritrea made use of war elephants in 525 AD during the invasion of the Himyarite Kingdom in the Arabian peninsula. The war elephants used by the Aksumite army consisted of African savannah elephants,[full citation needed] a significantly larger and more temperamental species of elephant. War elephants were again put to use by an Aksumite army in the year 570 in a military expedition against the Quraysh of Mecca.\nMiddle Ages [ edit ]\nA Romanesque painting of a war elephant. Spain, 11th century\nThe Kushan Empire conquered most of Northern India. The empire adopted war elephants when levying troops as they expanded into the Indian subcontinent. The Weil\u00fce describes how the population of Eastern India rode elephants into battle, but currently they provide military service and taxes to the Yuezhi (Kushans). The Hou Hanshu additionally describes the Kushan as acquiring riches including elephants as part of their conquests. The emperor Kanishka assembled a great army from his subject nations, including elephants from India. He planned on attacking the Tarim Kingdoms, and sent a vanguard of Indian troops led by white elephants. However, when crossing the Pamir Mountains the elephants and horses in the vanguard were unwilling to advance. Kanishka is then said to have had a religious revelation and rejected violence.\nThe Gupta Empire demonstrated extensive use of elephants in war and greatly expanded under the reign of Samudragupta. Local squads which each consisted of one elephant, one chariot, three armed cavalrymen, and five foot soldiers protected Gupta villages from raids and revolts. In times of war, the squads joined together to form a powerful royal army. The Gupta Empire employed 'Mahapilupati', a position as an officer in charge of elephants. Emperors such as Kumaragupta struck coins depicted as elephant riders and lion slayers.\nHarsha established hegemony over most of North India. The Harshacharita composed by B\u0101\u1e47abha\u1e6d\u1e6da describes the army under the rule of Harsha. Much like the Gupta Empire, his military consisted of infantry, cavalry, and elephants. Harsha received war elephants as tribute and presents from vassals. Some elephants were also obtained by forest rangers from the jungles. Elephants were additionally taken from defeated armies. Bana additionally details the diet of the elephants, recording that they each consumed 600 pounds of fodder consisting of trees with mangos and sugarcanes.\nThe Chola dynasty and the Western Chalukya Empire maintained a large number of war elephants in the 11th and 12th century. The war elephants of the Chola dynasty carried on their backs fighting towers which were filled with soldiers who would shoot arrows at long range. The army of the Pala Empire was noted for its huge elephant corps, with estimates ranging from 5,000 to 50,000.\nThe Ghaznavids were the first amongst the Islamic dynasties to incorporate war elephants into their tactical theories. They also used a large number of elephants in their battles. The Ghaznavids acquired their elephants as tribute from the Hindu princes and as war plunder. The sources usually list the number of beasts captured, and these frequently ran into hundreds, such as 350 from Qanauj and 185 from Mahaban in 409/1018-19, and 580 from the Raja Ganda in 410/1019-20. Utbi records that the Thanesar expedition of 405/1014-15 was provoked by Mahmad's desire to get some of the special breed of Sri lankan breed of elephants excellent in war\nIn 1526, Babur, a descendant of Timur, invaded India and established the Mughal Empire. Babur introduced firearms and artillery into Indian warfare. He destroyed the army of Ibrahim Lodi at the First Battle of Panipat and the army of Rana Sanga in 1527 at the Battle of Khanua.[citation needed] The great Moghul Emperor Akbar (r. 1556\u20131605 AD) had 32,000 elephants in his stables. Jahangir, (reigned 1605\u20131627 A.D.) was a great connoisseur of elephants. He increased the number of elephants in service. Jahangir was stated to have 113,000 elephants in captivity: 12,000 in active army service, 1,000 to supply fodder to these animals, and another 100,000 elephants to carry courtiers, officials, attendants and baggage (Lahiri Choudhury, 1988).\nKing Rajasinghe I laid siege to the Portuguese fort at Colombo, Sri Lanka, in 1558 with an army containing 2,200 elephants, used for logistics and siege work. The Sri Lankans had continued their proud traditions in capturing and training elephants from ancient times. The officer in charge of the royal stables, including the capture of elephants, was called the Gajanayake Nilame, while the post of Kuruve Lekham controlled the Kuruwe or elephant men. The training of war elephants was the duty of the Kuruwe clan who came under their own Muhandiram, a Sri Lankan administrative post.\nIn Islamic history there is a significant event known as the \u2018Am al-Fil (Arabic: \u0639\u064e\u0640\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0640\u0641\u0640\u064a\u0640\u0644, \"Year of the Elephant\"), approximately equating to 570 AD. At that time Abraha, the Christian ruler of Yemen, marched upon the Ka\u2018bah in Mecca, intending to demolish it. He had a large army, which included one or more elephants (as many as eight, in some accounts). However, the (single or lead) elephant, whose name was 'Mahmud', is said to have stopped at the boundary around Mecca, and refused to enter \u2013 which was taken by both the Meccans and their Yemenite foes as a serious omen. According to Islamic tradition, it was in this year that Muhammad was born.\nIn the Middle Ages, elephants were seldom used in Europe. Charlemagne took his one elephant, Abul-Abbas, when he went to fight the Danes in 804, and the Crusades gave Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II the opportunity to capture an elephant in the Holy Land, the same animal later being used in the capture of Cremona in 1214, but the use of these individual animals was more symbolic than practical, especially when contrasting food and water consumption of elephants in foreign lands and the harsh conditions of the crusades.\nThe Khmer army waged war with elephants against the Cham in the 12th century.\nThe Mongols faced war-elephants in Khorazm, Burma, Vietnam and India throughout the 13th century. Despite their unsuccessful campaigns in Vietnam and India, the Mongols defeated the war elephants outside Samarkand by using catapults and mangonels, and during the Mongol invasions of Burma in 1277\u20131287 and 1300\u20131302 by showering arrows from their famous composite bows. Genghis and Kublai both retained captured elephants as part of their entourage. Another central Asian invader, Timur faced similar challenges a century later. In 1398 Timur's army faced more than one hundred Indian elephants in battle and almost lost because of the fear they caused amongst his troops. Historical accounts say that the Timurids ultimately won by employing an ingenious strategy: Timur tied flaming straw to the back of his camels before the charge. The smoke made the camels run forward, scaring the elephants, who crushed their own troops in their efforts to retreat. Another account of the campaign reports that Timur used oversized caltrops to halt the elephants' charge. Later, the Timurid leader used the captured animals against the Ottoman Empire.\nIn Southeast Asia, the powerful Khmer Empire had come to regional dominance by the 9th century AD, drawing heavily on the use of war elephants. Uniquely, the Khmer military deployed double cross-bows on the top of their elephants. With the collapse of Khmer power in the 15th century, the successor region powers of Burma (now Myanmar) and Siam (now Thailand) also adopted the widespread use of war elephants. In many battles of the period it was the practice for leaders to fight each other personally on elephants. One famous battle occurred when the Burmese army attacked Siam's Kingdom of Ayutthaya. The war may have been concluded when the Burmese crown prince Mingyi Swa was killed by Siamese King Naresuan in personal combat on elephant in 1593. However, this duel may be apocryphal.\nIn Thailand, the king or general rode on the elephant's neck and carried ngaw, a long pole with a sabre at the end, plus a metal hook for controlling the elephant. Sitting behind him on a howdah, was a signaller, who signalled by waving of a pair of peacock feathers. Above the signaller was the chatras, consisting of progressively stacked circular canopies, the number signifying the rank of the rider. Finally, behind the signaller on the elephant's back, was the steerer, who steered via a long pole. The steerer may have also carried a short musket and a sword.: 40\u201341\nIn Malaysia, 20 elephants battled the Portuguese during the Capture of Malacca (1511).\nElephant troops (\"t\u01b0\u1ee3ng binh\") is an important part of the Vietnamese Nguyen dynasty army.\nThe Chinese continued to reject the use of war elephants throughout the period, with the notable exception of the Southern Han during the 10th century AD \u2013 the \"only nation on Chinese soil ever to maintain a line of elephants as a regular part of its army\". This anomaly in Chinese warfare is explained by the geographical proximity and close cultural links of the southern Han to Southeast Asia. The military officer who commanded these elephants was given the title \"Legate Digitant and Agitant of the Gigantic Elephants\". Each elephant supported a wooden tower that could allegedly hold ten or more men. For a brief time, war elephants played a vital role in Southern Han victories such as the invasion of Chu in 948 AD, but the Southern Han elephant corps were ultimately soundly defeated at Shao in 971 AD, defeated by crossbow shooting from troops of the Song Dynasty. As one academic has put it, \"thereafter this exotic introduction into Chinese culture passed out of history, and the tactical habits of the North prevailed\". However, as late as the Ming dynasty in as far north as Beijing, there were still records of elephants being used in Chinese warfare, namely in 1449 where a Vietnamese contingent of war elephants helped the Ming Dynasty defend the city from the Mongols.\nModern era [ edit ]\nThe Elephant Battery in Peshawar.\nWith the advent of gunpowder warfare in the late 15th century, the balance of advantage for war elephants on the battlefield began to change. While muskets had limited impact on elephants, which could withstand numerous volleys, cannon fire was a different matter entirely \u2013 an animal could easily be knocked down by a single shot. With elephants still being used to carry commanders on the battlefield, they became even more tempting targets for enemy artillery.\nNonetheless, in south-east Asia the use of elephants on the battlefield continued up until the end of the 19th century. One of the major difficulties in the region was terrain, and elephants could cross difficult terrain in many cases more easily than horse cavalry. Burmese forces used war elephants against the Chinese in the Sino-Burmese War where they routed the Chinese cavalry. The Burmese used them again during the Battle of Danubyu during the First Anglo-Burmese War, where the elephants were easily repulsed by Congreve rockets deployed by British forces. The Siamese Army continued utilising war elephants armed with jingals up until the Franco-Siamese War of 1893, while the Vietnamese used them in battle as late as 1885, during the Sino-French War. During the mid to late 19th century, British forces in India possessed specialised elephant batteries to haul large siege artillery pieces over ground unsuitable for oxen.\nInto the 20th century, military elephants were used for non-combat purposes in the Second World War, particularly because the animals could perform tasks in regions that were problematic for motor vehicles. Sir William Slim, commander of the XIVth Army wrote about elephants in his introduction to Elephant Bill: \"They built hundreds of bridges for us, they helped to build and launch more ships for us than Helen ever did for Greece. Without them our retreat from Burma would have been even more arduous and our advance to its liberation slower and more difficult.\" Military elephants were used as late as the Vietnam War.\nElephants are now more valuable to many armies in failing states for their ivory than as transport, and many thousands of elephants have died during civil conflicts due to poaching. They are classed as a pack animal in a U.S. Special Forces field manual issued as recently as 2004, but their use by U.S. personnel is discouraged because elephants are endangered. The last recorded use of elephants in war occurred in 1987 when Iraq was alleged to have used them to transport heavy weaponry for use in Kirkuk.[citation needed]\nTactical use [ edit ]\nThere were many military purposes for which elephants could be used. In battle, war elephants were usually deployed in the centre of the line, where they could be useful to prevent a charge or to conduct one of their own. Their sheer size and their terrifying appearance made them valued heavy cavalry. Off the battlefield they could carry heavy materiel, and with a top speed of approximately 30 km/h (20 mph) provided a useful means of transport, before mechanized vehicles rendered them mostly obsolete.\nThe elephant Citranand attacking another, called Udiya, during the Mughal campaign against the rebel forces of Khan Zaman and Bahadur Khan in 1567\nIn addition to charging, elephants could provide a safe and stable platform for archers to shoot arrows in the middle of the battlefield, from which more targets could be seen and engaged. The driver, called a mahout, was responsible for controlling the animal, who often also carried weapons himself, like a chisel-blade and a hammer (to kill his own mount in an emergency). Elephants were sometimes further enhanced with their own weaponry and armour as well. In India and Sri Lanka, heavy iron chains with steel balls at the end were tied to their trunks, which the animals were trained to swirl menacingly and with great skill. Numerous cultures designed specialized equipment for elephants, like tusk swords and a protective tower on their backs, called howdahs. The late sixteenth century saw the introduction of culverins, jingals and rockets against elephants, innovations that would ultimately drive these animals out of active service on the battlefield.\nBesides the dawn of more efficient means of transportation and weaponry, war elephants also had clear tactical weaknesses that lead to their eventual retirement. After sustaining painful wounds, or when their driver was killed, elephants had the tendency to panic, often causing them to run amok indiscriminately, making casualties on either side. Experienced Roman infantrymen often tried to sever their trunks, causing instant distress, and possibly leading the elephant to flee back into its own lines. Fast skirmishers armed with javelins were also used by the Romans to drive them away, as well as flaming objects or a stout line of long spears, such as Triarii. Other methods for disrupting elephant units in classical antiquity was the deployment of war pigs. Ancient writers believed that elephants could be \"scared by the smallest squeal of a pig\". Some warlords however, interpreted this expression literally. At the siege of Megara during the Diadochi wars for example, the Megarians reportedly poured oil on a herd of pigs, set them alight, and drove them towards the enemy's massed war elephants, which subsequently bolted in terror.\nThe value of war elephants in battle remains a contested issue. In the 19th century, it was fashionable to contrast the western, Roman focus on infantry and discipline with the eastern, exotic use of war elephants that relied merely on fear to defeat their enemy. One writer commented that war elephants \"have been found to be skittish and easily alarmed by unfamiliar sounds and for this reason they were found prone to break ranks and flee\". Nonetheless, the continued use of war elephants for several thousand years attests to their enduring value to the historical battlefield commander.[citation needed]\nCultural legacy [ edit ]\nElephants in use by Indian cavalry.\nThe use of war elephants over the centuries has left a deep cultural legacy in many countries. Many traditional war games incorporate war elephants. Chaturanga, the ancient Indian board game from which modern chess has gradually developed, calls its bishop Gaja, meaning elephant in Sanskrit; it is still called an elephant in Chinese chess. Also in Arabic \u2013 and derived from it, in Spanish \u2013 the bishop piece is called al-fil, Arabic for \"elephant\"; in Russian, too, the bishop piece is an elephant (\u0421\u043b\u043e\u043d). In Bengali, the bishop is called hati, Bengali for \"elephant\". In the Japanese game shogi, there used to be a piece known as the \"Drunken Elephant\"; it was, however, dropped by order of the Emperor Go-Nara and no longer appears in the version played in today's Japan.\nElephant armour, originally designed for use in war, is today usually only seen in museums. One particularly fine set of Indian elephant armour is preserved at the Leeds Royal Armouries Museum, while Indian museums across the sub-continent display other fine pieces. The architecture of India also shows the deep impact of elephant warfare over the years. War elephants adorn many military gateways, such as those at Lohagarh Fort for example, while some spiked, anti-elephant gates still remain, for example at Kumbhalgarh fort. Across India, older gateways are invariably much higher than their European equivalents, in order to allow elephants with howdahs to pass through underneath.\nWar elephants also remain a popular artistic trope, either in the Orientalist painting tradition of the 19th century, or in literature following Tolkien, who popularised a fantastic rendition of war elephants in the form of 'oliphaunts' or m\u00fbmakil.\nIn popular culture [ edit ]\nHathi from The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling is a former Indian war elephant who pulled heavy artillery for the British Indian Army. Kala-Nag from Toomai of the Elephants performed similar duties during the First Anglo-Afghan War.\nNumerous strategy video games feature elephants as special units, usually available only to specific factions or requiring special resources. These include Age of Empires, Celtic Kings: The Punic Wars, the Civilization series, the Total War series, Imperator: Rome, and Crusader Kings III.\nIn the 2004 film Alexander scene of the Battle of Hydaspes depicts war elephants fighting against the Macedonian phalanx.[citation needed]\nIn the 2017 video game Assassin's Creed Origins, they are distributed around the map as boss fights.\nIn The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, M\u00fbmakil or Oliphaunts are fictional giant elephant-like creatures used by the Witch-King, Sauron and his Haradrim and the Orc army to fight against Theoden, Aragorn, Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas, the Hobbits, Merry and Pippin and his Rohan and the King and his Army of the Dead in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and Minas Tirith.\nSee also [ edit ]\nNotes [ edit ]\nReferences [ edit ]"}

This eclectic lineage is an ancient one\u2014and so is the tapir itself. Scientists believe that these animals have changed little over tens of millions of years.\nBehavior\nTapirs have a short prehensile (gripping) trunk, which is really an extended nose and upper lip. They use this trunk to grab branches and clean them of leaves or to help pluck tasty fruit. Tapirs feed each morning and evening. During these hours they follow tunnel-like paths, worn through the heavy brush by many a tapir footstep, to reach water holes and lush feeding grounds. As they roam and defecate they deposit the seeds they have consumed and promote future plant growth.\nLife in the Water\nThough they appear densely built, tapirs are at home in the water and often submerge to cool off. They are excellent swimmers and can even dive to feed on aquatic plants. They also wallow in mud, perhaps to remove pesky ticks from their thick hides.\nTapir Species\nNew World tapirs generally live in the forests and grasslands of Central and South America. A notable exception is the mountain (or woolly) tapir, which lives high in the Andes Mountains. Woolly tapirs, named for their warm and protective coat, are the smallest of all tapirs.\nThe world's biggest tapir is found in the Old World\u2014Southeast Asia. The black-and-white Malay tapir can grow to 800 pounds. It inhabits the forests and swamps of Malaysia and Sumatra.\nAll tapir species are at-risk largely due to hunting and habitat loss."}

Recent evidence suggests that they are more closely related to a group of African mammals that includes elephants, sea cows, and aardvarks. Elephant shrews (also called sengis) are represented by a single family, the Macroscelididae, including four genera and 19 living species.\nThey take their name from their long pointed head and very long, mobile, trunk-like nose. They have rather long, legs for their size, which move in a hopping fashion like rabbits. They have a hunchbacked posture and a long, scaly tail. A gland on the underside of the tail produces a strong scent used to mark territories. This musky smell serves as a deterrent against many carnivores."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "22 Astonishing Crocodile Facts \ud83d\udc0a - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/crocodiles/", "text": "Crocodile Profile\nCrocodiles are large reptiles that habitat the tropics of the Americas, Australia, Africa and Asia. Europe is the only continent that they don\u2019t natively live in.\nThey are members of the order Crocodilia, which also includes alligators, caimans, and gharials.\nCrocodile Facts Overview\nHabitat: Wetland areas \u2013 Freshwater rivers, or lakes. Or saltwater \u2013 residing in estuaries, lagoons, or mangrove swamps. Location: Africa, Asia, The Americas, Australia Lifespan: 35 \u2013 75 Years Size: 4.9 \u2013 23 ft (1.5 m \u2013 7 m) Weight: 40 \u2013 2,600 lb (18 \u2013 1,200 kg) Color: Dark green when adult. Yellow with black striples when young. Diet: Fish, Amphibians, Birds, Reptiles, Mammals Predators: Other crocodiles. Big cats, such as jaguars and leopards. Anacondas and pythons. When small, large birds, such as heron or shoebill. Top Speed: 35 Kph (22 Mph) Swimming No. of Species:\n14 Conservation Status:\n4 Species Endangered: Orinoco, Philippine, Cuban, Siamese 2 Species Vulnerable: American, Dwarf.\nCrocodiles are semi-aquatic and live in wetland areas, freshwater rivers or lakes, or saltwater \u2013 residing in estuaries, lagoons, or mangrove swamps, rather than far out at sea.\nThere are 14 species of crocodiles, which vary in lifespan between 35 \u2013 75 years, and considerably in size. The smallest, the Dwarf Crocodile, grows to an average 4.9 feet (1.5 meters) in length, and weighs 40 \u2013 71 pounds (18 to 32 kg, or 3 to 5 stone).\nThe largest crocodile is the Saltwater Crocodile, which can grow up to 23.0 ft (7.0 m) in length, weighing 2,200 \u2013 2,600 lb (1,000 to 1,200 kg, or 150 to 190 stone).\nSome species are active during the day, while other species are only nocturnal. Crocodiles mostly hunt at night, are carnivorous animals and very efficient hunters, with excellent hearing and eyesight.\nThey are aggressive, ambush predators, waiting for their prey to venture close to their hiding position, before rushing to attack. A crocs diet mostly includes other animals, reptiles, birds and fish.\nInteresting Crocodile Facts\n1. Crocodiles are carnivores, which generally means they eat only meat. However, a recent study proved they also enjoy an occasional taste of fruit.\nThe 2013 study concluled \u201cthere is little doubt that on occasion, fruit is deliberately consumed, often in large quantities\u201c, along with their normal meat-heavy diets of mammals, birds, and fish.\n2. Crocodiles can go through 4,000 teeth over a lifetime.\nCrocodiles have between 60-110 teeth. When a crocodile loses a tooth, there is a small replacement already on standby. They are able to replace each of their 80 teeth up to 50 times over their lifespan.\n3. A crocodile\u2019s jaws can apply 5,000 pounds of pressure per square inch \u2013 the strongest bite of any animal in the world.\nA human\u2019s jaw only produces 100 pounds of pressure per square inch in comparison. A crocodiles bite is 10 times more powerful than a great white shark.\n4. Crocodiles have relatively weak jaw opening muscles, which can be held shut with just a rubber band, or your bare hands.\nAlthough, that\u2019s not advisable! However, it has enabled scientists to study them closer!\n5. An easy way to tell the difference between a crocodile and an alligator, is when a crocodile closes it\u2019s mouth, all teeth are visible \u2013 as the upper and lower jaw are the same width.\nWhereas an alligator possesses small depressions in the upper jaw for the lower teeth, meaning they are not visible when their mouth is shut.\n6. Another key difference to an alligator is snout shape. Alligators have wider, U-shaped snouts, while crocodiles are more pointed and V-shaped.\nCrocodiles are generally a little more aggressive, and often larger and stronger, too.\n7. The longest crocodile captured alive measured 6.17 m (20.2 ft) and weighed at 1,075 kg (2,370 lb) by a National Geographic team in Agusan del Sur Province, Philippines.\n\u2018Lolong\u2019 was a saltwater crocodile and the largest ever in captivity.\n8. Crocodiles don\u2019t sweat. To keep cool, they open their mouths which is known as \u201cmouth gaping,\u201d very similar to panting.\nThey are not displaying aggression when you see them with their mouths wide open! They often sleep with their mouths wide open to release heat.\n9. Crocodiles are extremely fast in the water, swimming up to speeds of 35 kilometers per hour (22 mph).\nThey use their powerful tails to propel themselves through water, and their feet as rudders to steer.\n10. It\u2019s a common myth that crocodiles can run fast on land. They can \u2018belly run\u2019 up to 17 kilometers per hour (11 mph) for short distances.\nCrocs tire easily on land and prefer to stay in water, coming ashore only to bask in the sun, or to lay eggs.\n11. Crocs can hold their breath underwater for more than an hour.\nCambridge researchers have shown that this ability depends on a tiny fragment of the animal\u2019s haemoglobin, which is the protein that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.\n12. Crocodiles swallow small stones to improve digestion. These stones help grind up the food in their stomachs.\nSwallowing stones (known as \u2018gastroliths\u2019) is especially beneficial for crocodiles that eat their prey whole, or for tougher animals with shells and bones. A gastrolith can remain inside the stomach for years.\n13. The expression to cry \u2018crocodile tears\u2019 (to display insincere or a false display of emotion), derives from crocodiles shedding tears, while they eat their prey.\nWhile this was originally an ancient belief, studies have shown that crocodiles eyes do water while they eat, but not with remorse \u2013 for biological reasons, due to the hisses and huffs during feeding.\n14. Crocodiles have acute senses, an evolutionary advantage that makes them highly successful predators.\nCrocodiles are mainly nocturnal hunters and have excellent night vision. Their sense of smell and hearing are also extremely well developed.\n15. Crocodiles have been known to occasionally cannibalize smaller crocodiles.\nThere have been recorded cases of larger crocodiles eating smaller, or younger crocs.\n16. Crocodiles are ambush and opportunistic predators, capable of preying upon large mammals, such as smaller elephants, hippos, sharks or big cats.\nSome species like the freshwater crocodile will mostly eat fish, while larger species like the saltwater crocodile or the Nile crocodile, will consume buffalo, zebra, deer and wild boar.\n17. Crocodiles have the most acidic stomach of any vertebrate.\nThis allows them to dissolve and digest bones, hooves and horns or shells from their prey.\n18. Crocodiles perform a \u2018death roll\u2019 to overcome prey, clamping on using their jaws, and spinning around powerfully.\nThe spinning motion of the roll disorientates the prey, dragging them under the water and helps separate limbs from the body of larger animals to easily ingest.\n19. Crocodiles vocalize to communicate. The young of some species squeak and grunt, while adult crocs can growl, hiss or roar at each other.\nMany species will also respond to other noises, such as engine noise, gun shots or even people mimicking crocodiles.\n20. Crocodiles can sleep with one eye wide open.\nOnly some other reptiles, birds and dolphins can do the same. They generally sleep with two eyes closed, though.\n21. Larger crocodiles can go for over a year without eating a meal.\nA croc\u2019s metabolism is super efficient, using and storing nearly the entirety of the food it consumes. In extreme circumstances, they are able to shut down and live off their own tissue for a long period of time.\n22. Worldwide, crocodiles are estimated to kill about 1,000 humans per year.\nHundreds of those crocodile attacks occur in Africa, often in small commuinities where they not widely reported.\nCrocodile Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification\nKingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Reptilia Order: Crocodilia Family: Crocodylidae Subfamily: Crocodylinae\nSpecies List & Habitat"}

It is found in the Sahara Desert and the Sahel; a dry grassland / savanna region that stretches across Africa from Mauritania in the west to Ethiopia and Eritrea in the east.\nWhy are African spurred tortoises endangered?\nPrimary causes for the African spurred tortoise\u2019s endangered status are habitat loss (due to farming and bush fires), capture for the pet trade, and being hunted for meat.\nBack to animal index\nAfrican Wild Dog\nScientific name: Lycaon pictus\nType of animal: Mammal\nWhere found: Africa\nAfrican wild dogs are found in Sub-Saharan Africa (the part of Africa south of the Sahara Desert). These endangered canids live in packs consisting of an alpha pair and their offspring. They hunt at dawn and dusk, pursuing prey such as Thomson\u2019s gazelles and other mid-sized antelopes.\nThe African wild dog is easily identified due to its patterned coat, which gives the species its alternative name of African Painted Dog.\nIt is estimated that fewer than 1,500 adult individual African wild dogs are left in the wild. The species\u2019 population is fragmented over a wide area.\nWhy are African wild dogs endangered?\nThe biggest threat to the African wild dog is habitat loss. This is a species that needs a lot of space; a growing human population in the dogs\u2019 natural habitat restricts the area in which it can hunt.\nYou can read more about African wild dogs on this page: African Wild Dog facts.\nBack to animal index\nAlabama Red-Bellied Cooter\nScientific name: Pseudemys alabamensis\nType of animal: Reptile\nWhere found: North America\nThe Alabama red-bellied cooter is a species of turtle found in Alabama\u2019s Mobile\u2013Tensaw River Delta, a 260,000 acre wetland region. The species is Alabama\u2019s official state reptile.\nThe Alabama red-bellied cooter grows up to 1 ft. / 30 cm in length and its plastron (the shell covering the turtle\u2019s undersides) is orange in color (hence the species\u2019 name).\nThis endangered reptile belongs to the family Emydidae, whose members are also known as \u201cpond turtles\u201d or \u201cterrapins\u201d.\nWhy are Alabama red-bellied cooters endangered?\nAlabama red-bellied cooters are endangered primarily due to habitat loss and illegal capture for sale to the pet trade.

It is small (2-3 in. / 5-7.5 cm) and stockily-built, with pale, olive-green / grey skin.\nOutside of the mating season, the arroyo toad spends much of the day buried in sand or mud, emerging at night to forage for ants and other small insects. During the dry season, it enters a state of dormancy known as aestivation.\nWhy are arroyo toads endangered?\nThe arroyo toad population currently consists of fewer than 3,000 individuals and continues to decrease. The species is endangered primarily due to habitat loss.\nBack to animal index\nAsian Elephant\nScientific name: Elephas maximus\nType of animal: Mammal\nWhere found: Asia\nAsian elephants are the largest land animals in Asia, and the second-largest in the world (after the African bush elephant, another endangered species). A large male has a shoulder height of around 9 ft / 2.74 m, and weighs around 4 metric tonnes / 4.4 short tons (8,818.49 lb.).\nAsian elephants have smaller ears and smoother skin than their African cousins. Only the males have tusks.\nWhy are Asian elephants endangered?\nAsian elephants are endangered due to poaching (male elephants are targeted for their valuable ivory tusks) and habitat loss.\nYou can find out more about elephants on this page: Elephant Facts.\nBack to animal index\nAtlantic Bluefin Tuna\nA diver attempts to release a large Atlantic bluefin tuna from a fishing net.\nScientific name: Thunnus thynnus\nType of animal: Fish\nWhere found: Atlantic Ocean\nThe Atlantic bluefin tuna is a large fish found in the Atlantic Ocean. The species grows to lengths of up to 8.2 ft / 2.5 m and weights of around 680 kg / 1,500 lb. It preys on squid and fish, and some individuals are thought to live as long as 50 years.\nWhy are Atlantic bluefin tuna endangered?\nThe Atlantic bluefin tuna is a popular food fish and the primary cause of its endangered status is overfishing.\nBack to animal index\nAye-Aye\nScientific name: Daubentonia madagascariensis\nType of animal: Mammal\nWhere found: Madagascar\nThe aye-aye is a species of lemur that lives in the rainforests of Madagascar, an island located in the Indian Ocean off the coast of East Africa.\nThe endangered mammal, which reaches a length of around 3 ft. (90 cm), including its long tail, is the world\u2019s largest nocturnal primate.\nThe aye-aye finds food by tapping on trees with its fingers; it can tell by the sound if there\u2019s an insect grub hidden beneath the bark.\nWhy are aye-ayes endangered?\nSome local people believe that the aye-aye brings bad luck, and the species has faced persecution due to these beliefs. This, and habitat loss, are the main reasons that the aye-aye is endangered.\nYou can find out more about aye-ayes on this page: Aye-Aye Facts\nBack to animal index\nBarbary Macaque\nScientific name: Macaca sylvanus\nType of animal: Mammal\nWhere found: Africa, Gibraltar\nA small colony of Barbary macaques lives in Gibraltar (a British territory on the southern coast of Spain), making the species the only monkey to be found in the wild in Europe. Barbary macaques are also found in northern Africa.\nUnlike most other monkeys, the Barbary macaque lacks a tail. This has led to the species\u2019 alternative name of \u201cBarbary ape\u201d (apes lack tails).\nWhy are Barbary macaques endangered?\nIn Africa, the Barbary macaque lives in high-altitude forests, and in Gibraltar, in rocky coastal areas. It is due to the loss of its African habitat that the monkey is endangered.\nBack to animal index\nBasking Shark\nScientific name: Cetorhinus maximus\nType of animal: Fish\nWhere found: Oceans worldwide\nThe basking shark is the world\u2019s second-largest fish. It grows to an average length of 26 ft / 7.9 m, but can reach lengths of up to 28 ft / 8.5 m; only the whale shark, another endangered species, is larger.\nUnlike most sharks, the basking shark is a filter feeder rather than an active hunter. It swims through clouds of zooplankton (tiny ocean animals) with its large mouth held wide open, filtering the food from the seawater with comb-like projections from its gills known as \u201cgill rakers\u201d.\nWhy are basking sharks endangered?\nThe basking shark is endangered due to overfishing. Although the species is no longer targeted, it is still caught accidentally and, due to its surface-feeding habits, is occasionally struck by boats.\nYou can find out more about basking sharks on this page: Basking Shark Facts\nBack to animal index\nScientific name: Mustela nigripes\nType of animal: Mammal\nWhere found: North America\nA list of endangered animals is not just about famous animals such as tigers and elephants; other, lesser-known species are also facing extinction.\nThe black-footed ferret is one such animal. Found in North America, it is a member of the family Mustelidae, which also includes weasels, badgers, the wolverine, and related animals.\nIn 1979 the black footed ferret was thought to be extinct in the wild, but in 1981 a small population was discovered in Wyoming.\nA captive breeding program saw the species being reintroduced in several locations in North America.\nAlthough several thousands of black footed ferrets have been reintroduced since the 1990\u2019s, today\u2019s wild population consists of just 206 adults.\nWhy are black-footed ferrets endangered?\nBlack-footed ferrets are endangered due to persecution of its main prey source, prairie dogs. The black-footed ferret\u2019s fortunes are directly linked to the availability of these prey animals. Prairie dogs are capable of damaging crops, and were therefore persecuted by farmers.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephant cognition - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_cognition", "text": "Intelligence and awareness in elephants\nElephant cognition is animal cognition as present in elephants. Most contemporary ethologists view the elephant as one of the world's most intelligent animals. With a mass of just over 5 kg (11 lb), an elephant's brain has more mass than that of any other land animal, and although the largest whales have body masses twenty times those of a typical elephant, a whale's brain is barely twice the mass of an elephant's brain. In addition, elephants have around 257 billion neurons. Elephant brains are similar to humans' and many other mammals' in terms of general connectivity and functional areas, with several unique structural differences. Although initially estimated to have as many neurons as a human brain, the elephant's cortex has about one-third of the number of neurons as a human brain.\nElephants manifest a wide variety of behaviors, including those associated with grief, learning, mimicry, play, altruism, use of tools, compassion, cooperation, self-awareness, memory, and communication. Further, evidence suggests elephants may understand pointing: the ability to nonverbally communicate an object by extending a finger, or equivalent. It is thought they are equal with cetaceans and primates in this regard. Due to such claims of high intelligence and due to strong family ties of elephants, some researchers argue it is morally wrong for humans to cull them. Aristotle described the elephant as \"the animal that surpasses all others in wit and mind.\"\nStructure of the brain [ edit ]\nCerebral cortex [ edit ]\nThe elephant (both Asian and African) has a very large and highly complex neocortex, a trait also shared by humans, apes and certain dolphin species.\nAsian elephants have the greatest volume of cerebral cortex available for cognitive processing of all existing land animals. It exceeds that of any primate species, with one study suggesting elephants be placed in the category of great apes in terms of cognitive abilities for tool use and tool making.\nThe elephant brain exhibits a gyral pattern more complex and with more numerous convolutions, or brain folds, than that of humans, other primates, or carnivores, but less complex than that of cetaceans. Elephants are believed to rank equal with dolphins in terms of problem-solving abilities, and many scientists tend to rank elephant intelligence at the same level as cetaceans; a 2011 article published by ABC Science suggests that, \"elephants [are as] smart as chimps, [and] dolphins\".\nOther areas of the brain [ edit ]\nElephants also have a very large and highly convoluted hippocampus, a brain structure in the limbic system that is much bigger than that of any human, primate or cetacean. The hippocampus of an elephant takes up about 0.7% of the central structures of the brain, comparable to 0.5% for humans and with 0.1% in Risso's dolphins and 0.05% in bottlenose dolphins.\nThe hippocampus is linked to emotion through the processing of certain types of memory, especially spatial. This is thought to be possibly why elephants suffer from psychological flashbacks and the equivalent of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nThe encephalization quotient (EQ) (the size of the brain relative to body size) of elephants ranges from 1.13 to 2.36. The average EQ is 2.14 for Asian elephants, and 1.67 for African, with the overall average being 1.88.: 151 In comparison to other animals, the La Plata dolphin has an EQ of 1.67; the Ganges river dolphin of 1.55; the orca of 2.57; the bottlenose dolphin of 4.14; and the tucuxi dolphin of 4.56; chimpanzees at 2.49; dogs at 1.17, cats at 1.00; and mice at 0.50. Humans have an EQ of 7.44.\nBrain size at birth relative to adult brain size [ edit ]\nComparing brain size at birth to the size of a fully developed adult's brain is one way to estimate how much an animal relies on learning as opposed to instinct. The majority of mammals are born with a brain close to 90% of the adult weight, while humans are born with 28%, bottlenose dolphins with 42.5%, chimpanzees with 54%, and elephants with 35%. This may indicate that elephants require the second highest amount of learning while developing (next to humans), and that their behavior is less instinctual than taught. This is further supported by the elephant's long juvenile period and large temporal lobes, which are associated in the storage of memories.\nSpindle neurons [ edit ]\nSpindle cells appear to play a central role in the development of intelligent behavior. As well as in humans and the rest of the great apes, spindle neurons are also found in the brains of both Asian and African elephants, as well as humpback whales, fin whales, killer whales, sperm whales, bottlenose dolphins, Risso's dolphins, and beluga whales. The remarkable similarity between the elephant brain and the human brain supports the thesis of convergent evolution.\nElephant society [ edit ]\nThe elephant has one of the most closely knit societies of any living species. Elephant families can only be separated by death or capture. Cynthia Moss, an ethologist specialising in elephants, recalls an event involving a family of African elephants:\nTwo members of the family were shot by poachers, who were subsequently chased off by the remaining elephants. Although one of the elephants died, the other, named Tina, remained standing, but with knees beginning to give way. Two family members, Trista and Teresia (Tina's mother), walked to both sides of Tina and leaned in to hold her up. Eventually, Tina grew so weak, she fell to the ground and died. However, Trista and Teresia did not give up but continually tried to lift her. They managed to get Tina into a sitting position, but her body was lifeless and fell to the ground again. As the other elephant family members became more intensely involved in the aid, they tried to put grass into Tina's mouth. Teresia then put her tusks beneath Tina's head and front quarters and proceeded to lift her. As she did so, her right tusk broke completely off, right up to the lip and nerve cavity. The elephants gave up trying to lift Tina but did not leave her; instead, they began to bury her in a shallow grave and throw leaves over her body. They stood over Tina for the night and then began to leave in the morning. The last to leave was Teresia.\nBecause elephants are so closely knit and highly matriarchal, a family can be devastated by the death of another (especially a matriarch), and some groups never recover their organization. Cynthia Moss has observed a mother, after the death of her calf, walk sluggishly at the back of a family for many days.\nEdward Topsell stated in his publication The History of Four-Footed Beasts in 1607, \"There is no creature among all the Beasts of the world which hath so great and ample demonstration of the power and wisdom of almighty God as the elephant.\" Elephants are believed to be on par with chimpanzees with regard to their cooperative skills.\nElephant altruism [ edit ]\nElephants are thought to be highly altruistic animals that even aid other species, including humans, in distress. In India, an elephant was helping locals lift logs by following a truck and placing the logs in pre-dug holes upon instruction from the mahout (elephant trainer). At a certain hole, the elephant refused to lower the log. The mahout came to investigate the hold-up and noticed a dog sleeping in the hole. The elephant only lowered the log when the dog was gone. When an elephant is hurt, other elephants (even if they are unrelated) aid them.\nCynthia Moss has often seen elephants going out of their way to avoid hurting or killing a human, even when it was difficult for them (such as having to walk backwards to avoid a person). Joyce Poole documented an encounter told to her by Colin Francombe on Kuki Gallman's Laikipia Ranch. A ranch herder was out on his own with camels when he came across a family of elephants. The matriarch charged at him and knocked him over with her trunk, breaking one of his legs. In the evening, when he did not return, a search party was sent in a truck to find him. When the party discovered him, he was being guarded by an elephant. The animal charged the truck, so they shot over her and scared her away. The herdsman later told them that when he could not stand up, the elephant used her trunk to lift him under the shade of a tree. She guarded him for the day and would gently touch him with her trunk.\nElephants in Africa self-medicate by chewing on the leaves of a tree from the family Boraginaceae, which induces labour. Kenyans also use this tree for the same purpose.\nDeath ritual [ edit ]\nScientists often debate the extent to which elephants feel emotion. Elephants have been one of few species of mammals other than Homo sapiens sapiens and Neanderthals known to have or have had any recognizable ritual around death. Elephants show a keen interest in the bones of their own kind (even unrelated elephants that have died long ago). They are often seen gently investigating the bones with their trunks and feet while remaining very quiet. Sometimes elephants that are completely unrelated to the deceased still visit their graves.\nElephant researcher Martin Meredith recalls in his book an occurrence of a typical elephant death ritual as witnessed by Anthony Hall-Martin, a South African biologist who had studied elephants in Addo, South Africa, for over eight years. The entire family of a dead matriarch, including her young calf, were all gently touching her body with their trunks, trying to lift her. The elephant herd were all rumbling loudly. The calf was observed to be weeping and made sounds that sounded like a scream, but then the entire herd fell silent. They then began to throw leaves and dirt over the body and broke off tree branches to cover her. They spent the next two days quietly standing over her body. They sometimes left to get water or food, but they would always return.\nOccurrences of elephants' behaving this way around human beings are common throughout Africa. On many occasions, they have buried dead or sleeping humans or aided them when they were hurt. Meredith also recalls an event told to him by George Adamson, a Kenyan game warden, regarding an old Turkana woman who fell asleep under a tree after losing her way home. When she woke up, there was an elephant standing over her, gently touching her. She kept very still because she was very frightened. As other elephants arrived, they began to scream loudly and buried her under branches. She was found the next morning by the local herdsmen, unharmed.\nGeorge Adamson also recalls when he shot a bull elephant from a herd that kept breaking into the government gardens of northern Kenya. George gave the elephant's meat to local Turkana tribesmen and then dragged the rest of the carcass half a mile (800 m) away. That night, the other elephants found the body and took the shoulder blade and leg bone and returned the bones to the exact spot the elephant was killed.\nPlay [ edit ]\nJoyce Poole on many occasions has observed wild African elephants at play. They apparently do things for their own and others' entertainment. Elephants have been seen sucking up water, holding their trunk high in the air, and then spraying the water like a fountain.\nMimicry [ edit ]\nRecent studies have shown that elephants can also mimic sounds they hear. The discovery was found when Mlaika, an orphaned elephant, would copy the sound of trucks passing by. So far, the only other animals that are thought to mimic sounds are whales, dolphins, bats, primates and birds. Calimero, an African elephant who was 23 years old, also exhibited a unique form of mimicry. He was in a Swiss zoo with some Asian elephants. Asian elephants use chirps that are different from African elephants' deep rumbling noises. Calimero also began to chirp and not make the deep calls that his species normally would.\nKosik, an Indian elephant at Everland Amusement Park, South Korea can imitate up to five Korean words, including sit, no, yes and lie down. Kosik produces these human-like sounds by putting his trunk in his mouth and then shaking it while breathing out, similar to how people whistle with their fingers.\nEcologist O\u2019Connell-Rodwell\u2019s conducted research in 1997 which concluded that elephants create low-frequency vibrations (seismic signals) through their trunks and feet to communicate across long distances.Elephants use contact calls to stay in touch with one another when they are out of one another's sight. In 2004, Joseph Soltis conducted a study to understand the low-frequency vocalization elephants used to communicate across short-distances. The research found that closely allied female elephants were more likely to produce \u2018rumbles\u2019 to other members at twice the rate of those who had lesser integrated members. Female elephants are able to remember and distinguish the contact calls of female family and bond group members from those of females outside of their extended family network. They can also distinguish between the calls of family units depending upon how frequently they came across them.\nJoyce Poole, of the Amboseli Elephant Research Project, Kenya, has demonstrated vocal learning and imitation in elephants of sounds made by each other and in the environment. She is beginning to research whether sounds made by elephants have dialects, a trait that is rare in the animal kingdom.\nTool use [ edit ]\nElephants show a remarkable ability to use tools, using their trunks like arms. Elephants have been observed digging holes to drink water and then ripping bark from a tree, chewing it into the shape of a ball, filling in the hole and covering over it with sand to avoid evaporation, then later going back to the spot for a drink. They also often use branches to swat flies or scratch themselves. Asian Elephants have also been known to drop large rocks onto an electric fence to break the fence or to cut off the electricity. Asian elephants in India have been known to break electric fences using logs and clear the surrounding wires using their tusks to provide a safe passageway.\nArt and music [ edit ]\nAn elephant painting\nLike several other species that are able to produce abstract art, elephants, using their trunks to hold brushes, create paintings which some have compared to the work of abstract expressionists. Elephant art is now commonly featured at zoos, and is shown in museums and galleries around the world. Ruby at the Phoenix Zoo is considered the original elephant art star, and her paintings have sold for as much as $25,000. Ruby chose her own colors and was said to have a keen sense of which color she wished to use. The Asian Elephant Art & Conservation Project, an \"elephant art academy\" in New York, teaches retired elephants to paint. For paintings that resemble identifiable objects, teachers give the elephants guidance. An example of this was shown in the TV program Extraordinary Animals, in which elephants at a camp in Thailand were able to draw portraits with flowers. Although the images were drawn by the elephants, there was always a trainer assisting and guiding the movement.\nA popular video showing an elephant painting a picture of another elephant became widespread on Internet news and video websites. The website Snopes.com, which specializes in debunking urban legends, lists the video as \"partly true\", in that the elephant produced the brush strokes, but notes that the similarity of the produced paintings is indicative of a learned sequence of strokes rather than a creative effort on the part of the elephant.\nIt was noted by ancient Romans and Asian elephant handlers (mahouts) that elephants can distinguish melodies. Performing circus elephants commonly follow musical cues and Adam Forepaugh and Barnum & Bailey circuses even featured \"elephant bands\". German evolutionary biologist Bernhard Rensch studied an elephant's ability to distinguish music, and in 1957 published the results in Scientific American. Rensch's test elephant could distinguish 12 tones in the music scale and could remember simple melodies. Even though played on varying instruments and at different pitches, timbres and meters, she recognized the tones a year and a half later. These results have been backed up by the Human-Elephant Learning Project which studies elephant intelligence.\nAn elephant named Shanthi at the National Zoo in Washington D.C. has displayed the ability to play the harmonica and various horn instruments. She reportedly always ends her songs with a crescendo.\nRecording group Thai Elephant Orchestra is an ensemble of elephants who improvise music on specially made instruments with minimal interaction from their handlers. The orchestra was co-founded by pachyderm expert Richard Lair, who works at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, and David Sulzer (artist name, Dave Soldier) who studies the role of dopaminergic synapses in memory consolidation, learning, and behavior at Columbia University. According to neurobiologist Aniruddh Patel, the orchestra's star drummer named Pratidah, exhibits musicality, stating: \"Either when drumming alone or with the orchestra, Pratidah was remarkably steady,\". He also noted that she developed a swing-type rhythm pattern when playing with other elephants.\nProblem-solving ability [ edit ]\nElephant stacking blocks to allow it to reach food\nElephants are able to spend substantial time working on problems. They are able to change their behavior radically to face new challenges, a hallmark of complex intelligence.\nProblem-solving experiments [ edit ]\nA 2010 experiment revealed that in order to reach food, \"elephants can learn to coordinate with a partner in a task requiring two individuals to simultaneously pull two ends of the same rope to obtain a reward\", putting them on an equal footing with chimpanzees in terms of their level of cooperative skills.\nA study by Dr. Naoko Irie of Tokyo University has shown that elephants demonstrate skills at arithmetic. The experiment \"consist[ed] of dropping varying numbers of apples into two buckets in front of the [Ueno Zoo] elephants and then recording how often they could correctly choose the bucket holding the most fruit.\" When more than one apple was being dropped into the bucket, this meant that the elephants had to \"keep running totals in their heads to keep track of the count.\" The results showed that \"Seventy-four percent of the time, the animals correctly picked the fullest bucket. An African elephant named Ashya scored the highest with an amazing eighty-seven percent \u2026 Humans in this same contest managed a success rate of just sixty-seven percent.\" The study was also filmed to ensure its accuracy.\nA study on Discovery News found that elephants, during an intelligence test employing food rewards, had found shortcuts that not even the experiment's researchers had thought of.\nAdaptive behavior in captivity [ edit ]\nIn the 1970s, at Marine World Africa, USA, there lived an Asian elephant named Bandula. Bandula worked out how to break open or unlock several of the pieces of equipment used to keep the shackles on her feet secure. The most complex device was a Brummel hook, a device that closes when two opposite points are slid together. Bandula used to fiddle with the hook until it slid apart when it was aligned. Once she had freed herself, she would help the other elephants escape. In Bandula's case and certainly with other captive elephants, there was an element of deception involved during the escapes, such as the animals looking around making sure no one was watching.\nIn another case, a female elephant worked out how she could unscrew iron rods with an eye hole that was an inch (2.5 cm) thick. She used her trunk to create leverage and then untwisted the bolt.\nRuby, an Asian elephant at Phoenix Zoo would often eavesdrop on conversations keepers would have talking about her. When she heard the word paint, she became very excitable. The colors she favored were green, yellow, blue and red. Once, a fire truck came and parked outside her enclosure where a man had just had a heart attack. The lights on the truck were flashing red, white and yellow. When Ruby painted later on in the day, she chose those colors. She also showed a preference for colors that the keepers wore.\nHarry Peachey, an elephant trainer, developed a cooperative relationship with an elephant named Koko. Koko would help the keepers out, \"prompting\" them to encourage him with various commands and words that Koko would learn. Peachey stated that elephants are almost predisposed to cooperate and work with humans as long as they are treated with respect and sensitivity. Koko worked out when his keepers needed a bit of \"elephant help\" when they were transferring the females of the group to another zoo. When the keepers wanted to transfer a female, they would usually say her name, followed by the word transfer (e.g., \"Connie transfer\"). Koko soon figured out what this meant. If the keepers asked an elephant to transfer and it did not budge, they would say, \"Koko, give me a hand.\" When he heard this, Koko would help. After 27 years of working with elephants, Peachey firmly believes that they can understand the semantics and syntax of some of the words they hear. This is something thought to be very rare in the animal kingdom.\nAccording to one source, elephants can figure out how to retrieve distant objects that they cannot otherwise reach by using a stick.\nAdaptive behavior in the wild [ edit ]\nIn the wild, elephants display clever methods of finding resources. Elephants have keen memories, and when evaluating foraging locations, respond more strongly to long\u2010term patterns of productivity than to immediate forage conditions. In times of scarcity, they return to areas which have been reliable over many years rather than the last sites visited. They also favor travelling on dirt roads in the dry season, as easy walking terrain to conserve energy.\nAlthough it is common for herbivores to find salt licks or to ingest inorganic matter for sodium, elephants in the Mount Elgon National Park, Kenya, have learned to venture deep into Kitum Cave to utilize its minerals in what has been described as 'quarrying' and 'salt mining'. Although the elephants clearly do not understand that they require salt in their diet, they show interest only in the cation-rich zeolite, tusking it into smaller edible fragments. This activity is performed in groups, and years of tusk marks indicate the knowledge of the cave has been passed down over generations. Poaching has caused the elephants to alter their behavior and avoid the more widely known caves.\nApplying the string-drawing task to elephants [ edit ]\nIn 1956, W. H. Thorpe explained:\n\"The ability to pull up food which is suspended by a thread, the pulled in loop being held by the foot while the bird reaches with its beak for the next pull, is doubtfully inborn and it has been subject to many experiments. The act appears at first sight to be a real and sudden solution of the problem from the start, and thus to qualify for inclusion under 'insight learning.' Successful performance in this task has been documented in well over ten bird species.\"\nMore recently, Bernd Heinrich and Thomas Bugnyar concluded that ravens' \"behaviour in accessing meat on a string is not only a product of rapid learning but may involve some understanding of cause\u2013effect relation between string, food and certain body parts.\" String-pulling behavior has been likewise studied in seven Asian elephants by presenting them with a retractable (bungee) cord. In this setup, the cord is tied to a heavy log a few meters away from the elephant. A sugarcane (a favorite elephant treat) is attached to the cord, and can only be retrieved by repeated, coordinated, action of the trunk and another body part. The results were clearcut:\n\"All seven logging elephants fully mastered the string-drawing sequence within 1\u20133 experimental sessions. In all cases of retractable rope pulling, the sequence involved pulling by the trunk, and then securing the rope by either foot or mouth. After 2\u20136 coordinated pulls, while still holding the rope with either mouth or foot, the elephants disengaged the sugarcane from the rope while still using mouth or forefoot as an anchor, and then consumed the sugarcane. All elephants seemed to be flexible about the use of anchor, interchangeably using mouth, foreleg, or both.\"\nElephants have joined a small group of animals, including great apes, bottlenose dolphins and eurasian magpies, that exhibit self-awareness. The study was conducted with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) using elephants at the Bronx Zoo in New York. Although many animals respond to a mirror, very few show any evidence that they recognize it is in fact themselves in the mirror reflection.\nThe Asian elephants in the study also displayed this type of behavior when standing in front of a 2.5-by-2.5-metre (8.2 ft \u00d7 8.2 ft) mirror \u2013 they inspected the mirror and brought food close to the mirror for consumption.\nEvidence of elephant self-awareness was shown when the elephant Happy repeatedly touched a painted X on her head with her trunk, a mark which could only be seen in the mirror. Happy ignored another mark made with colorless paint that was also on her forehead to ensure she was not merely reacting to a smell or feeling.\nFrans De Waal, who ran the study, stated, \"These parallels between humans and elephants suggest a convergent cognitive evolution possibly related to complex society and cooperation.\"\nSelf-awareness and culling [ edit ]\nThere has been considerable debate over the issue of culling African elephants in South Africa's Kruger National Park as a means of controlling the population. Some scientists and environmentalists argue that it is \"unnecessary and inhumane\" to cull them since \"elephants resemble humans in a number of ways, not least by having massive brains, social bonds that appear to be empathetic, long gestations, high intelligence, offspring that require an extended period of dependent care, and long life spans.\": 20824 A South African animal rights group asked in a statement anticipating the announcement, \"How much like us do elephants have to be before killing them becomes murder?\"\nOthers argue that culling is necessary when biodiversity is threatened. However, the protection of biodiversity argument has been questioned by some animal rights advocates who argue that the animal which most greatly threatens and damages biodiversity is humanity, so if we are not willing to cull our own species we cannot morally justify culling another.\nArguments against intelligence [ edit ]\nThis section summarizes experiments that cannot be readily reconciled with the view that elephants are highly intelligent. These experiments, in turn, rely on pioneering early work with dogs and cats.\nDiscrimination tasks [ edit ]\nEdward Thorndike argued that his cats and dogs escaped puzzle boxes through a mindless process of trial and error. Because understanding something as simple as pulling a loop to open a door must occur rapidly or not at all, it should have induced, at some point during the repeated introductions of his animals into the box, a sudden reduction in escape time. The actual, gradual, slope of the time-curve that he did observe suggested to him that his subjects failed to understand the cause-effect relationships between their actions and escape.\nIn 1957, researchers reported that a young Asian elephant needed 330 trials, over a period of several days, to consistently choose the reinforced response in her first discrimination task. In an experiment which employed another sense modality, an 8-year-old took 7.5 months to distinguish 12 tones.\nSimilarly, in discrimination experiments with Asian elephants in the logging camps of Myanmar, only 13 Burmese elephants mastered black/white or large/small visual discrimination tasks, while 7 elephants failed to master the task.\nLike Thorndike's cats and dogs, the 13 elephants that did master a black/white or large/small discrimination task did so gradually, over several sessions. The slope of the time-curve again suggested the elephants failed to understand the cause-effect relationships between lid removal and food retrieval.\nThe pre-training that preceded these Myanmar discrimination experiments involved learning to remove a lid from a bucket or to displace a box to uncover a hole in the ground. On average, the 20 elephants required 3.4 sessions to master the pre-training task.\nPossible absence of causal reasoning [ edit ]\nThorndike's dogs and cats learned to escape a box by, for instance, pulling a loop attached to a string that opened the box. On subsequent introductions to an open box when string-pulling no longer served a purpose, the animal continued to pull a string before getting out of the box. Thorndike concluded that the animal solved the task mechanically, without understanding the causal link between string-pulling and escaping.\nA conceptually similar experiment involved pre-training four logging Asian elephants to remove food from a cover-less bucket by inserting their trunk into the bucket. Next, a treat was placed at the bottom of a bucket and, at the same time, the bucket was covered with a lid. The elephants were then trained to obtain the treat by removing the lid. Once this behavioral sequence was established, a treat was placed inside the bucket and, at the same time, the lid was placed on the ground alongside the bucket, so that the lid no longer obstructed access to the food.\nAs in the Thorndike case, if the elephants understand the nature of the task, they should ignore the lid on the ground and retrieve the reward directly, as they used to do in pre-training sessions before the lid was introduced. But if they fail to understand the causal link between lid removal and food retrieval, they might continue to remove the lid before retrieving the food. The observations supported Thorndike's mechanical learning hypothesis.\nSee also [ edit ]"}

When it is backed by science and carried out in a humane manner, it can protect the welfare of both animals and humans from greater threats. Yet when science is replaced by public hysteria, and humane killing by bizarre plots, the endgame can mean everyone loses.\nSee Also: 10 Animals That Surprisingly Benefit From Climate Change\n10 Grinding Baby Chicks Alive\nIt only takes one rooster to tend to several hens, but roughly half of chicken eggs that come to term are male. Common sense would say that the males are butchered, but chickens used for meat are a different variety than those used to lay eggs. Males of the egg-laying type are too lean to be sold in supermarkets for meat, so they have no value in the chicken industry.\nLike any kind of waste, they are disposed of. Usually in their first few hours of life. They can be suffocated in plastic bags, electrocuted, but more likely they are macerated and ground up while still alive. Grinding male chicks is actually recommended as the humane way to dispose of them, since the grinding is near-instant. Zipping through a high-speed grinder is presumably less painful than being slowly suffocated.\nNaturally, animal rights group still take issue with grinding billions of baby animals alive, no matter at what speed. The chicken industry also has a problem with it too, albeit for entirely different reasons\u2014it\u2019s expensive. They would sooner avoid wasting money.\nTo this end, researchers are finding ways to determine if an embryo is male or female while the egg is still viable for sale. This would save billions of baby chicks from the grinder, and potentially billions of dollars.\n9 Culling Endangered Species\nNot all culling is for humans\u2019 benefit. African wildlife conservationists sometimes kill endangered animals as a means of maintaining the stability of an ecosystem. They aren\u2019t concerned with only one species of animal, after all, but the biodiversity of the entire park.\nA large predator population means competition for limited resources. Lions, for example, will kill other species of big cats that are even more vulnerable. Even prey may need to be depopulated. Kruger National Park had to cull many of its hippos after a drought left the population with tool little food to survive.\nStill, research suggests that culling should be an option of last resort. Historic elephant culls left survivors without older elephants to teach younger generations typical behaviors like recognizing hierarchy and responding to threats. It even gave them the elephant equivalent of shell shock.\n8 Denver Has Enough of Goose Poop\nCanadian geese flying overhead is a common sight in some parts of the world, as is the feces they leave behind. A single goose creates about a pound of poop per day. Aside from the nuisance it creates, and the effort required to clean it, their feces contaminates waterways and can cause disease. Eventually, Denver, Colorado\u2019s Parks and Recreation Department had enough of it.\nSo they culled them. During the geeses\u2019 early-summer molting season, they are flightless, so it\u2019s easy for contracted federal employees to corral and load them into crates. The geese are then slaughtered, butchered, and sent to food pantries where they can be eaten by those in need. Although it\u2019s a tough kind of meat that requires long cooking times, goose meat was once called the \u201croast beef of the skies.\u201d\n7 Australia Kills the Wrong Sharks\nA series of fatal shark bites in Western Australia prompted the government to protect its beach-goers with drum lines set out to cull great whites, which were responsible for the majority of fatalities. But drum lines don\u2019t discriminate, and the program was controversial because researchers feared they would harm the region\u2019s biodiversity by ensnaring other fish.\nThe drum lines captured 172 sharks, with 68 meeting the criteria for culling. Out off all the sharks, however, none were actually great whites. 94% were tiger sharks that have not been responsible for a Western Australian fatality since before 1930. Nevertheless, they were still killed.\nThe culling prompted the Australian Environmental Protection Agency call things off, stating there was \u201cscientific uncertainty\u201d about killing a population of sharks that had nothing to do with the fatalities that prompted the cull in the first place.\n6 Marius the Worthless Giraffe\nMarius the giraffe was the victim of an international breeding program designed to expand the giraffe population in zoos. The program was so successful that Marius\u2019 genetic material was no longer of value to any zoo in the program. Letting Marius breed with any one of the program\u2019s giraffes would have caused inbreeding in the population, so Marius was declared valueless and destined for, quite literally, the chopping block.\nThe decision to cull Marius just because he was of no value to a breeding program naturally caused an uproar. The zoo had allowed him to be born and live on its grounds, but when he was no longer useful, they decided to kill him.\nThe option of sterilizing him came up, but the zoo said that he would still take up resources that could be used to support viable genetic breeders. Other zoos offered to take Marius in, but the Copenhagen zoo would only share its giraffes with zoos that adhered to certain guidelines in its breeding program. It denied all offers.\nSo, without any use for Marius, and after refusing to relocate him, the zoo killed him. An autopsy and dismemberment was performed in front of an audience, one that included children. Afterwards, parts of Marius were saved for research while others were fed to the zoo\u2019s carnivores.\nRegarding all the outrage, an official said that they did not understand it.\n5 Widespread Human Death\nWhen China\u2019s communist government rose to power in 1949, disease was running rampant throughout the country. It began a vaccines and sanitation campaign that included eliminating the animal carriers of the diseases. It was called the The Four Pests Campaign because it focused on the culling of mosquitoes, flies, rats, and sparrows.\nMillions of kilograms of flies and mosquitoes were eliminated, as well as an estimated 1.5 billion rats. By all accounts the campaign was a roaring success, until people realized the ecological disaster that culling 1 billion sparrows created in the countryside. Sparrows were carriers of disease, but they also played a vital role in the ecosystem. Eliminating so many of them left a gaping hole in China\u2019s food chain that had dire consequences.\nChina had been implementing the Great Leap Forward, where people were ordered to stop agricultural work and begin creating steel. But ignoring agricultural production meant that people did not have enough food. Starvation was already widespread at the time of the Four Pests Campaign, and the elimination of sparrows meant that insects like locusts exploded in population. This devastated what grain was still left after the government\u2019s industrialization campaign. Millions died in what became known as the Great Famine of China.\n4 Emus Defeat the Australian Army\nWestern Australia Makes War On Emus\nWatch this video on YouTube\nAfter WWI, Australian soldiers returned home to government-subsidized plots of land they were given to raise wheat and sheep. Unfortunately, some of the land they were given was difficult to actually raise anything on. This, coupled with the start of the Great Depression, made life difficult for the inexperienced farmers.\nThen there were the emus.\nThe thousands strong population of emus did not leave when the soldiers-turned-farmers took over their land. They stayed, and started to eat their crop, which further devastated the struggling farmers\u2019 livelihood. Once protected animals, the emus were reclassified as pests to be eliminated. The government wanted them dead so badly they paid hunters bounties for each emu they brought in.\nEmus are resilient birds, though. Despite the culling, they maintained their numbers. The farmers did not have the resources to kill so many birds, so the Australian government brought in the army to begin the Great Emu War.\nThe army hunted them with machine guns, but the emus scattered so far the soldiers only ever succeeded in killing a few hundred out of thousands. The army tried again and again to mount military campaigns against the birds, but in the end, the emus won the war.\nThe army eventually just gave up and gave the ammunition to the farmers. Now, properly supplied, the farmers (who, we will remind you, were war veterans) succeeded in culling nearly 60,000 in half a year.\n3 Sewing Rodent Anuses Shut\nNutria, also known as coypu, are an invasive species of rodent on almost every continent. The are native to South America, but international trading and breeding farms saw them spread all over the world. Eventually, some either escaped or were released into the wild, where they bred and spread.\nOne researcher in Korea came up with a particularly novel idea to be rid of the rodents. He suggested that they capture several nutria and sew their anuses shut. This would stress them, he said, which would cause them to eat their babies. He had once used this very same technique when he worked for a zoo with rat problems. Apparently, sewing their anuses shut had eliminated every single one of the pests.\nDespite the technique\u2019s apparent success, animal rights groups took issue with it. They said that causing the animal enough pain to drive it to cannibalism is unethical and constitutes abuse. Unsurprisingly, the researcher\u2019s suggestion fell on deaf ears and his plan was never instituted.\n2 Mauritius Culls Endangered Animal, Makes Things Worse\nThe Mauritius flying fox is classified as an endangered animal. Since 2015, the government has culled more than half of its population in order to make life easier for plantation owners. The foxes caused around 10% of the loss growers of mangos and lychees suffer each year, so a cull was implemented to stem losses.\nThe result was a decrease in yearly yield. Ecologists say that the flying fox is an important pollinator for more than half of the island\u2019s flora. Moreover, when the government instituted its cull, it quickly found that shooting the bats that were eating fruit on plantations was extremely difficult, so the hunters went into the mountains and killed them in their native habitat. The flying fox, however, tends to stick to one area, so killing the ones in the mountains meant that they were not actually doing anything to address the loss of the plantation fruit. Some conservationists claim that the government is simply keeping the culling going in order to win votes instead of actually fixing the problem. Conservationists filed a lawsuit against the Mauritius government to halt the culls.\n1 The Complicated World of Canadian Seal Hunting\nThe Canadian Seal hunt is an annual and extremely controversial event where tens of thousands of seals are hunted for meat, fur, other products, and, some say, population control. But many countries around the world have banned seal products imported from Canada. This helped lead to such an extreme decrease in demand that anti-hunting activists say profits from the hunt are now almost twice as less than what the government spends to monitor it. The Canadian government, however, says that the hunt has other indirect economic benefits and still supports the cull.\nOne group that claims they do not see these economic benefits is the Inuit. The native peoples of Canada hunt seals as a part of their ancient culture and for survival. International bans on seal products exempt the Inuits, but the demand has plummeted due to the contempt the government-sponsored hunt has brought.\nSome are now saying that an expansion of the hunt is necessary in order to protect the local salmon population, since salmon are the prey of seals. Scientists disagree, saying that the seals are only being used as a scapegoat. Regardless, the seal hunt is important to the survival of certain Canadian communities. But opponents argue that if the Canadian government stopped subsidizing it, the free market would let it go extinct as an unsustainable business.\nAbout The Author: Mike spends his free time at the beach enjoying the sun."}

Sorry, no. Putting your dog in a funny costume? Getting there, but still a ways off. An elderly couple walking down the street holding hands? Close, but no cigar. It turns out there is actually nothing more adorable than baby animals. Yup, that\u2019s right, NOTHING! And we consider ourselves authorities on this matter. This is part of why the internet exists: to brighten up your day with the miniature versions of full-grown beasties.\nSo, if the world has been getting you down a bit (or even if it hasn\u2019t) let\u2019s take a break from all the chaos and learn some charming facts about our favorite subject in the world: baby animals.\nBaby Animals Facts\n40. Alpha Betta Momma\nBefore they are even born, Siamese fighting fish need all the help they can get. For whatever reason, female fighting fish have an innate hankering for the taste of their own eggs (caviar anyone?), meaning that in almost every instance, the Siamese father must step in and fight their right to live a life aquatic.\nOk so that one was\u2026 maybe not so cute. But stick with us! It gets better from here on out.\n39. Parrot Names\nBaby parrots are all essentially given names at birth. After giving birth, a parrot will develop a particular call for its offspring, who will then adopt the same call, with some slight variation to make it its own.\nAdditionally, parrots experience a phenomenon common to most species of birds called \u201cimprinting\u201d, whereby new-born parrots latch on to the first moving/living thing they lay eyes on, and accept it as their parent. Most often, of course, this is their mom or dad\u2026 but if a parrot opens its eyes to see a human being, they\u2019ll often assume the person is their family.\n38. Consider us Lucky\n97% of the animal kingdom does not experience the privilege of a childhood under the care of both mom and dad. For the vast majority of creatures on Earth, the responsibilities of parenthood fall primarily on one gender.\nHowever, puffin babies are just like us in this regard: they almost invariably get the full benefits of two parents growing up.\nPuffins are monogamous maters and after childbirth\u2014the male will usually stick around to raise the child in tandem with the mother.\n37. Lizard Lunch\nBasically no-one on Earth spends enough time being thankful that they weren\u2019t born a Long-Tailed Skink Lizard. Heck, many of us don\u2019t even think about it at all. But, if you happen to have a spare 5 minutes right now, it might be worth saying a quick thanks to the universe for making you a person. It might not be all fun-and-games in a typical human life\u2026 but at the very least, most of us avoid being eaten by our moms.\nSee, unlike most lizards, skink moms do hang around long enough to ensure their babies grow up, if not happy, at the very least healthy and strong. So far, so good right? Well\u2026 not so much. When the going gets tough, the skink mom has basically only one trick up her sleeve: if their nest is threatened before the babies grow to maturity, they will waste no time in devouring children, presumably with the idea that consuming the extra calories will give them enough energy to make a successful escape.\nImagine if every time your mom got scared, she gave serious thought to eating you. Welcome to the wonderful world of the Skink.\n36. Cotton-Top Cooperative\nIf born as a baby cotton-top tamarin, the chances are that you are one of a pair of twins, as these monkeys have twins babies more often than single babies. After being born, babies are raised cooperatively by the entire group.\n35. It\u2019s Not a Contest\u2014Except for When It Is\nMale pipefish are held solely responsible for the carrying and birthing of their offspring. However, they don\u2019t receive female eggs from just one other pipefish, but many others as well. The babies that end up being born are those from the more attractive female. The male selects which embryos to nourish based on how attracted they were to their mother.\nLove is a cruel game for the lady pipefish.\n34. Helplessly Adorable\nA giant panda isn\u2019t so giant when it is a baby\u2014it\u2019s actually about the size of a stick of butter. They are also completely hairless and vulnerable, making them, somehow, even cuter.\n33. Baby Horns\nFully-grown rhinos are a confusing animal to behold, if only because they sit directly on the line between being adorable and fascinating\u2026 while they\u2019re simultaneously entirely capable of squishing you like a fly. If any animal is worthy of the description, \u201cbasically an actual tank\u201d, it\u2019s these guys.\nWhich may be why it\u2019s so surprising that baby rhinos aren\u2019t actually born with a horn. Instead, it takes the calves about five months for their horn to begin emerging from their snout. And in the meantime, they look like the most adorable, fat, and wrinkly little ponies that nature ever accidentally created.\n32. Practice Makes Elephants\nBaby elephants try to grow up fast. They spend their childhood days practicing all their mechanics in order to blossom once they reach adulthood.\nWhich, in case you\u2019re ever interested in losing 5 hours to a life-changing Youtube binge, makes for absolutely adorable videos. A baby elephant in the process of figuring out what their trunk is, makes for one of life\u2019s greatest little joys. \u201cWhy is there another arm on my face???? Who owns this thing????\u201d\nSign up to our newsletter. History\u2019s most fascinating stories and darkest secrets, delivered to your inbox daily. Making distraction rewarding since 2017.\n31. Bonobo Bonds\nBonobo babies learn the importance of community and kinship early on in their youth. They form emotional bonds through touch and the relationships they build will last long, throughout their youth into their adult life.\n30. No Smell Deer\nIn order to help their chances of survival (because that\u2019s the name of the game) baby deer do not have a scent.\nIt\u2019s a pretty cool trick of evolution. Given how much of animal hunting is based on smell, most hungry predators would find a fawn to be essentially invisible. That\u2019d be like if human babies were designed to be un-kidnap-able, by having the ability to camouflage themselves like chameleons.\nOnce again, we have proof that other animals get all the cool superpowers.\n29. Meerkat Kindergarten\nThe Meerkat social order is intensely co-operative. Seriously: if you\u2019re ever looking for a real team-building exercise, you might consider pretending to be Meerkats.\nThese little guys spend their entire lives working as a unit. And nowhere is this more evident than in the way their babies are raised. Meerkat parents essentially form collective clubs, in which the duties of raising and teaching the young are shared amongst the adults. Young ones are raised together as if they were in a school, as the pups learn all their skills through this upbringing.\n28. Gray Flamingo\nThat beautiful fluorescent pink flow of the flamingo must look incredibly on baby flamingos, right? Nope. When a flamingo is born it a small gray ball of feathers, like a tropical version of the old ugly duckling story.\n27. Arrested Development\nOf all the great apes, orangutan babies take the longest time to mature. It takes up to eight years for a baby orangutan to be weaned from their mothers and truly escape the bonds of childhood.\nAnd never has it been better for our reputation as a species to not be considered a \u201cgreat ape\u201d. We are simply regular apes\u2026 which might normally feel like a bit of an insult, but in this case might be for the best. Seeing as our transition out of childhood takes a cool\u2026 10 years longer than these guys? At the best? It\u2019s probably good that we\u2019re not comparing ourselves directly to them.\n26. Milking It\nGiven the outrageous amount of growing they\u2019ve got to do, a baby elephant must drink a ton of milk, right? Well, they actually, quite literally, drink over two tons of milk! As a calf, elephants drink as much as 2,200 gallons of milk from their mother.\nIf you are a lactose-intolerant baby elephant, life is really, really, really unpleasant.\n25. Color Doesn\u2019t Matter\nMany monkey babies are born a different color than their parents. The langur, for instance, is colored black, but their babies are orange.\nWhich is why the langur version of the Jerry Springer Show is so famously confusing. \u201cYou are\u2026 maybe the father? Honestly, we can\u2019t tell.\u201d\n24. Joey Beans\nBaby koalas, known as joeys, are particularly fragile babies. They\u2019re born blind, deaf, and almost the exact size of a jelly bean (although presumably less delicious).\nOnce bigger, they will stay with their moms by attaching themselves to her back.\n23. Teeth the Shell\nEver wonder how a baby reptile breaks out of their shell in order to actually be born? Many reptiles, including baby crocodiles, have what is called an \u201cegg tooth\u201d that allows them to crack the shell and break free into the world. Two months after hatching, this tooth will be resorbed back into its body.\n22. Big Babies\nLiving for up to as many as 75 years, ostriches are the world\u2019s largest bird. But it doesn\u2019t take them very long to grow up, as baby ostriches hatch larger than chickens and nearly reach full-grown height after only six months.\n21. Do You Wanna Build a Snowman?\nMacaques are playful animals, but in their youth, they take it to another level. When it snows, they will often roll up snowballs for fun and have a grand old time with them.\n20. Chimp Barbies\nOne way in which baby chimpanzees will get ready for when it is their time to raise their own offspring is by making dolls to play with as if they had babies of their own. They will gather together sticks and rocks to build their dolls and then raise them in reflection to their own parents.\n19. Not Rittens?\nDon\u2019t get confused\u2014baby rabbits are also called kittens! I mean, even if you were to confuse them, the result is still tiny adorable animal friends. It\u2019s a win-win situation.\n18. Limited Resources in Hotel California\nEagles are nothing to mess with, so it shouldn\u2019t be any surprise that neither are their chicks. After hatching, baby eagles will sometimes go to extreme measures in order to get privileged access to the resources their mother provides. \u201cWell that\u2019s not so bad,\u201d you might be thinking, \u201cafter all, what siblings don\u2019t squabble a little bit. Fair enough. But eagles do take it a little far. In this case, \u201cextreme measures\u201d means killing and maiming their brothers and sisters in the nest.\nOh\u2026\n17. Watching the Youth\nWhen elephants are still in their baby calf stage, other female elephants in the herd will often babysit them. Though all of the female elephants will look after the youth, it is mostly young females (who have yet to have any calves of their own) who will babysit. These babysitters are called \u201callomothers\u201d and the act proves to be beneficial for the entire herd.\nLittle did I know that my dream job title is Allomother. Now I\u2019ve got something to strive for.\n16. Trunk Comfort\nMuch like a baby human sucking its own thumb, baby elephants will wrap their trunk around and suck on it as a way to comfort itself.\n15. Poor Baby Earwig\nThe earwig is an animal that is all about survival\u2014after all, is there a human on Earth who wouldn\u2019t kill one on sight? After giving birth, the mother earwig will gravitate to the healthiest of her nymphs through scent, and nurture them with more care than the others. Because the earwig gives birth to as many as 60 children at a time, some babies will inevitably die, so it makes sense to give more attention to those who have a better chance at survival.\n14. Deadbeat Dads\nMale seahorses get a lot of credit for giving birth to their offspring, rather than the females. After birthing their babies and keeping them comfortable in his pouch until they are healthy enough to deal with the salinity of the surrounding water, the male disappears and leaves his seahorses babies to grow up fatherless.\n13. Water Wings\nDue to being born in the arid climate of Southern Africa, sandgrouse bird chicks aren\u2019t able to get much water. In comes dad to the rescue, who travels far distances in order to soak himself in water and then fly back to allow his babies to drink from his feathers which have coiled up water in them. Now that\u2019s how you father your kids, seahorses!\n12. Panda Survival\nSure, there are few things cuter than a baby panda, but each one who makes it actually only has a 50/50 shot at being raised by their panda mother. Though they often give birth to two offspring, the panda mother will focus exclusively on one of her children. As she has to expend an enormous amount of energy to raise her cub, she doesn\u2019t have much of a choice if she wants to ensure survival for her offspring.\n11. Like Man, Like Dog\nLike humans, dogs are born with fewer teeth. Puppies have only 28 teeth, but as they grow, so do their teeth, and they up with 42 in the mature adulthood.\n10. Straight From the Source\nDespite the whole \u201cliving their entire lives underwater\u201d thing, baby dolphins have to somehow drink their mother\u2019s milk\u2014remember, dolphins are mammals\u2014without getting any salt water in it.\nWhat to do?\nEvolution solved this one by fitting them with spines on the sides of their tongue, which mold into a sort of straw for them to drink their milk directly from their mother without any contamination.\n9. Babbling Marmosets\nWhat can be cuter than a baby pygmy marmoset? Listening to it babble! Much like how human babies babble themselves into oblivious in order to develop their language and communication skills, so too do infant pygmy marmosets.\n8. Pouch Life\nAll baby marsupials are born prematurely. This is why they all have pouches, ensuring that they can live in a safe, warm, comfortable place and be nurtured by their mother until they can fully develop into a strapping youth marsupial.\n7. Chivalrous Pups\nNot only are puppies the most adorable thing, boy puppies have an inner kindness. Whenever they play fight with girl puppies, they often allow them to win.\n6. Falling Into the World\nGiraffes don\u2019t go to the hospital to give birth. Nor do they lay down. When a baby giraffe is born, they come into the world with a sharp *THUD*. That\u2019s the sound of them hitting the dirt, after falling six feet from the birth canal. That\u2019s right, despite the obvious challenges the strategy presents to their babies, giraffes give birth standing up.\n5. Too Fluffy to Fail\nA baby sea otter is so covered with fluff that it couldn\u2019t drown even if it tried; they float like little furry beach balls.\nThe flip side of that extremely cute coin? They are also born with so much fluffy hair that they can\u2019t pull themselves out of the water. Meaning they must wait to learn how to dive (and therefore live alone) until they mature and lose some of their cuddle capacity.\n4. Baby\u2019s First Steps\nGiraffes don\u2019t need any time to walk! It only takes about 30 minutes for a baby giraffe to get to stepping and begin honing its long stride. Though it does take them some time to shake their adorable clumsiness.\n3. Playmates\nA pack of lions sticks together. One way their connection is maintained is in the way that they all give birth around the same time as each other, which allows for their cubs to grow up together and form bonds.\n2. Talking Through the Shell\nBefore they even hatch, baby chicks form a communication bond with their mothers by chirping through their eggshells. This process of tapping, chirping, and generally causing a ruckus, is called pipping or piping. Farmers recognize this stage in a chick\u2019s development as the moment the begin to learn how to breathe, and strengthen their lungs for a life outside the shell.\n1. No Squirrel Left Behind\nSquirrels look out for their own. If one squirrel has found an abandoned baby squirrel, it will adopt it and raise it as its own. I\u2019m not crying, you\u2019re crying.\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9"}

(The Pleistocene Epoch began 2.6 million years ago and ended 11,700 years ago. The Holocene Epoch began 11,700 years ago and continues through the present.)\nwoolly mammoth Lyuba, the most well-preserved woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) ever found, on display at the Field Museum, Chicago. It died in Siberia about 42,000 years ago and was about one month old. M. Spencer Green/AP\nThe woolly, Northern, or Siberian mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) is by far the best-known of all mammoths. The relative abundance and, at times, excellent preservation of this species\u2019s carcasses found in the permanently frozen ground of Siberia has provided much information about mammoths\u2019 structure and habits. Fossil mammoth ivory was previously so abundant that it was exported from Siberia to China and Europe from medieval times. Scientific evidence suggests that small populations of woolly mammoths may have survived in North America until between 10,500 and 7,600 years ago. An examination of a fossil tooth discovered in 2015 indicated that a tiny population of mammoths persisted on Wrangel Island, an Arctic island located off the coast of northern Russia, as late as 4,300 years ago before succumbing to extinction from the effects of inbreeding and the loss of genetic diversity. The oldest preserved mammoth DNA, which also has the distinction of being the oldest known animal DNA, dates to more than one million years ago and may belong to a direct ancestor of the woolly mammoth.\nMammoths figured significantly in the art of primitive humans; cave dwellers in Europe realistically depicted herds of these animals. Mammoths were sometimes trapped in ice crevasses and covered over; they were frozen, and their bodies were remarkably well preserved. In fact, cases have been reported in which sled dogs actually were fed the meat from frozen mammoth carcasses that had begun to thaw out of the ice that had held them for almost 30,000 years.\nA variety of distinct species are included in the genus Mammuthus. Most mammoths were about as large as modern elephants. The North American imperial mammoth (M. imperator) attained a shoulder height of 4 metres (14 feet). At the other extreme were certain dwarfed forms whose ancestors became isolated on various islands. Many mammoths had a woolly, yellowish brown undercoat about 2.5 cm (1 inch) thick beneath a coarser outer covering of dark brown hair up to 50 cm (20 inches) long. Under the extremely thick skin was a layer of insulating fat at times 8 cm (3 inches) thick. The skull in Mammuthus was high and domelike. The ears, small for an elephant, were probably adaptively advantageous for an animal living in a cold climate; the smaller amount of exposed surface area diminished heat losses. A mound of fat was present as a hump on the back. This structure is lacking in fossil remains, but evidence for its presence comes from cave paintings. The prominent tusks were directed downward and were very long; in older males they sometimes curved over each other. Mammoth dentition was made up of alternating plates of enamel and a denture that often became worn down by constant back-to-front chewing motions. Remains of arctic plants have been found in the digestive tracts of frozen mammoth carcasses. It is clear that the mammoth was hunted by early North American hunters."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of our Rhinoceros pictures in the gallery.\nView all of the Rhinoceros images!\nThis horned mammal is one of the most endangered animals on Earth\nThe rhinoceros is an animal that was once found from Southeast Asia across Africa. Today, three rhino species are listed as \u201cCritically Endangered\u201d and clinging to small pockets of habitat.\nWith its distinctive horn and massive size, the rhino is one of the most unique animals on Earth. However, heavy poaching for its horn threatens several rhino species today.\nTypes of Rhino \u2013 The 5 Rhino Species\nThere are five separate species of rhino that vary dramatically in size and anatomy. Today, the rhino is an animal that lives across Africa and Asia.\nThe largest species of rhino, the white rhinoceros, is an animal that is native to Africa. While the Southern white rhino has rebounded from the brink of extinction today, the Northern white rhino is now functionally extinct after the last male died in 2018.\nKnown for its triangular upper lip, the black rhinoceros is an animal that once roamed across nearly all of sub-Saharan Africa. However, today it\u2019s critically endangered.\nThe largest rhinoceros native to Asia, the Indian rhinoceros has a range that extends across the foothills of the Indian subcontinent. The Indian rhinoceros has a distinct appearance with a single horn and skin that has the appearance of \u201cbody armor.\u201d\nOnce found from India to the island of Borneo, today the Sumatran rhinoceros is critically endangered and located in just a few isolated pockets deep inside jungles.\nWhile the Sumatran rhinoceros can still weigh up to 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds), it\u2019s the smallest species of rhinoceros in the world. Sumatran rhinos are known for their prehistoric appearance, with hair that can cover their entire bodies.\nOnce roaming across Southeast Asia, The Javan rhinoceros today is limited to a single nature preserve in Indonesia named Ujung Kulan National Park.\nRhinoceros Scientific Name\nThe name rhinoceros is derived from the Greek words that mean \u201cNose-horn.\u201d The rhinocerotidae family has five species with the following scientific names:\n\u00b7 Black Rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis)\n\u00b7 White Rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum)\n\u00b7 Indian Rhinoceros Rhinoceros unicornis\n\u00b7 Sumatran Rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis)\n\u00b7 Javan Rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus)\nRhino: The Animal\u2019s Appearance\nRhinos are the second largest land animal, behind only the elephant. The species first evolved during the Eocene \u2013 an era that ended about 33.9 million years ago \u2013 and are one of the last surviving \u201cmegafauna.\u201d That is, animals which are simply massive by today\u2019s standards.\nThey have a robust, cylindrical body with a large head, relatively short legs, and short tail. The characteristic feature of these animals is a large horn in the middle of their faces; some species have a second, smaller horn.\nRhinos have brilliant hearing and the rhino also has a keen sense of smell, but the rhino is well known for having extremely poor eyesight. They are usually grey, black, or brown (though one species is called the \u201cwhite rhino\u201d).\nRhino: The Animal\u2019s Weight\nRhino species vary widely in length and weight, but average about 1.5 tons (1,360 kg) in weight as adults. The largest species, the white rhino can weigh up to 3,600 kg (7,920 pounds), which makes it nearly four times the weight of the smaller Sumatran rhinoceros on average!\n\u00b7 White rhino: 1,440 \u2013 3,600 kg (3,168-7,920 lbs)\n\u00b7 Black rhino: 800-1,400 kg (1,800-3,100 lbs)\n\u00b7 Indian rhino: 2,200 \u2013 3,000 kg (4,900-6,600 lbs)\n\u00b7 Javan rhino: 900 \u2013 2,300 kg (2,000-5,100 lbs)\n\u00b7 Sumatran rhino: 500 \u2013 800 kg (1,100-1760 lbs)\nRhino horn\nThe most notable features of rhinos are the large horns that grow from their heads.\nThe horns of a rhinoceros are made of keratin, the same type of protein that makes up hair and fingernails in most animals including humans. Both African species of rhino and the Sumatran rhinoceros have two horns, while the Indian rhino and Javan rhinoceros have just one horn.\nFemale Javan rhinos are notable in that they often lack a horn or have a smaller \u201cbump\u201d on their nose.\nUnfortunately, rhinos face incredible pressure from poaching as their horn is desired for both traditional Chinese medicine and as a status symbol.\nLongest rhino horns\nIn 2006, Dr. Nico van Strien conducted a study on the longest rhino horns by species.\nWhite rhino: 59 inches (150 cm)\nBlack rhino: 51 inches (130 cm)\nSumatran rhino: 32 inches (81 cm)\nIndian rhino: 23 inches (57 cm)\nJavan rhino: 11 inches (27 cm)\nRhino horns can grow in a variety of shapes. For example, a white rhino held in captivity in Sequim, Washington had a horn that grew to more than four feet in size that grew parallel to the ground. The horn grew so large it had to be trimmed twice using a chainsaw!\nRhino: The Animal\u2019s behavior\nRhinos generally live a solitary lifestyle. Black rhinos will more aggressively defend their territory while Indian and Javan rhinos have more loosely defined territory that may overlap. Sumatran rhinos, which live in more dense forests and vegetation are diligent about marking trails with feces and urine.\nGroups of rhinos\nWhile most rhino species are solitary, the white rhino is the most social of all species. Groups of a dozen or more white rhinos will often form. This behavior is particularly common among females with calves, as it can help mothers protect their offspring at a time they face greater threats from predators.\nA group of rhinos is called a \u201ccrash.\u201d\nRhino Habitat\nThe rhinoceros is generally found in thick forests and savannas where there is plenty of food to eat and lots of cover for the rhino to hide in. Rhinoceros\u2019 once spanned a range that spanned across the majority of Africa and Southeast Asia, however today their range has been significantly reduced.\nIn Africa, the rhinoceros\u2019 historical range was on grasslands and savannah stretching across most of sub-Saharan Africa. Today, while black rhinos can still be found stretching from Ethiopia to South Africa, their populations are limited to smaller pockets on nature preserves and other protected areas.\nThe Sumatran and Javan rhino live in denser forests and once saw their range extend across all of Southeast Asia, however today the Javan rhino can be found in only a single nature preserve while the Sumatran rhino has few remaining pockets of surviving population.\nLike other rhino species, the Indian rhinoceros has seen its range dramatically decreased. It lives in tall grasslands and forests near the foothills of the Himalayas mountain range.\nRhino Population \u2014 How Many White Rhinos Are Left?\nThree rhino species \u2013 the black, Sumatran, and Javan \u2013 are listed as \u201cCritically Endangered,\u201d while the Indian rhinoceros is listed as \u201cVulnerable,\u201d and the white rhino is \u201cNear Threatened.\u201d\nAccording to the International Rhino Foundation, in 2019 there is the following populations of each species:\nWhite rhino: 18,000\nBlack rhino: 5,500\nIndian rhino: 3,600\nSumatran rhino: 80\nJavan rhino: 72\nFour out of the five rhino species have seen their populations increase between 2009 and 2019.\nThe lone exception is the Sumatran rhino, which lives in isolated pockets and continues to suffer from poaching. Between 2009 and 2019 it saw its population decrease from an estimated 250 individuals down to fewer than 80.\nExtinct Rhino Species\nNo species of modern rhinoceros has gone extinct. However, numerous subspecies of rhinos have gone extinct in recent years. Historically, there were three subspecies of the Javan rhino, but only one remains after the last surviving Vietnamese Javan rhino was killed in 2010.\nThe Sumatran rhino subspecies in Malaysia was declared extinct in November 2019 after the last male and female died that year. The Northern white rhino is now functionally extinct after the last surviving male died in 2018. In 2011, the Western black rhino was declared extinct. There had been no sighting of the subspecies since 2001.\nThe last rhino species to go extinct was the Woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta), which is believed to have gone extinct around 8,000 BC.\nRhino Predators\nRhinos face few predators in the wild. While juveniles, they can be attacked by large cats like lions or jaguars in addition to crocodiles and other larger predators.\nBeyond the rhino\u2019s imposing horn and significant size, the species also has thick skin that serves as a form of natural \u201cbody armor.\u201d Learn about the strongest animals in the world here.\nThe number one threat to rhinos remains poachers. In South Africa alone, 769 rhinos were poached in 2018. Rhino poaching varies by species, with no Javan rhinos having been poached in more than 25 years as of 2019.\nRhino Diet: what does the animal eat?\nThe rhinoceros is a herbivore and eats grasses, leaves, shoots, buds and fruits in order to gain the nutrients that the rhino needs to grow and survive.\nAlthough the rhino is a herbivore, they are known for their aggressive nature and will often charge towards oncoming predators in order to scare them away. Most rhinoceros individuals that are killed by poachers, are caught out when they are quietly drinking from a water hole and therefore drop their guard. For a complete list of foods rhinos eat, check out our \u201cWhat Do Rhinos Eat?\u201d page.\nRhino Reproduction and Life Cycles\nRhinos have one of the longest gestation periods of all animal species at about 450 days. The longest reported captive gestation period was a white rhinoceros that was 548 days\u2019 gestation (about 18 months).\nThis long gestation period means that rhinos typically don\u2019t give birth again for an additional 3 to 5 years. This long gestation period and extended length between birthing new calves has made repopulating rhinoceroses an especially challenging problem.\nHow long do white rhinos live? The oldest white rhino in captivity lived to 55 while the oldest record of a black rhino was 52 years, and oldest Indian rhino lived to 48. Generally, rhino species can live to be between 35 to 50 years old.\nIncredible Rhino Facts\nAn \u201carmored\u201d animal\nRhinos have unique skin structure and materials that make it quite different from most mammals. Compared to their body size, rhino skin is three times thicker than predicted and contains crosslinked collagen fibers. At its thickest, rhino skin can be about 2 inches (5 cm) thick.\nWhat\u2019s in a rhino horn? The horn of a rhino is made of hair grown tightly together, awhile a natural \u201cglue\u201d from glands on the rhino\u2019s nose packs these hairs tightly together. You may have heard rhino horns are made of the same material as your fingernails, that\u2019s because rhino horns contain tubules of keratin, a protein found across hair, skin, and nails.\nToday, 85% of rhinos live in just one country While rhinos historically roamed across most of sub-Saharan Africa and SE Asia, today an estimated 85% of living rhinos are located in just one country: South Africa.\nFrom a million black rhinos to 5,500 today It was estimated that at the beginning of the 20thcentury more than a million black rhinos lived across Africa, today their population numbers just 5,500 individuals. While that population loss is staggering, the black rhino population continues to rebound.\nWhy did rhino poaching skyrocket? Between 1960 and 1995, 98% of black rhinos were killed by poachers. This upswell in poaching can be traced to China\u2019s Chairman, Mao Zedong, promoting the return of traditional Chinese medicine which utilized rhino horns as a cure. Today, strict bans has slowed rhino horn trade in China, while demand in Vietnam has led to a spike in poaching.\nTwo of the most critically endangered large mammals in the world With less than 100 individuals, the Sumatran rhinoceros and Javan rhinoceros are two of the most critically endangered large mammals in the world. While the Javan rhinos population has stabilized in recent decades, some estimates believes there could be as few as 30 Sumatran rhinos surviving today.\nThere is hope for even the most endangered species Thanks to incredible conservation efforts there are hopes for rhino species. The population of black rhinos has doubled this century. White rhinoceros populations have rebounded from about 50 rhinos to nearly 20,000 individuals. In addition, the Indian rhino has rebounded from less than 100 individuals to a population of about 3,600 today.\nNearly a quarter of rhinos live on private game reserves Today, more than 5 million acres of private game reserves house 6,500 rhinos, or about \u00bc of the entire rhino population.\nIllegal rhino horn trade goes beyond poaching While the illegal trade in rhino horns has led to significant poaching across the past decade, thieves have targeted rhino horns from unusual places. In 2011, thieves robbed a museum in Dublin, stealing four rhino horns from a museum. Its estimated the robbery could be sold for $650,000 on black markets. In addition, in 2011 a rhino horn was stolen from a museum in Ipswich, England. Between 2002-2011 there were more than 20 reported cases of thieves robbing rhino horns from museums.\nFighting Back Beyond protecting rhinos on reserves where rangers and other (often armed) guards can protect rhinos, there are conservations efforts underway to protect rhinos in unique ways like dying their horns with red dyes, 3D printing horns to depress the price of rhino horns, and even introducing rhinos into new environments and private reserves.\nYou can help with the fight to save the rhino There are numerous organizations dedicated to helping rhino conservation efforts. These efforts include Save the Rhino (savetherhino.org) and the WWF (worldwildlife.org)\nView all 71 animals that start with R"}

In North America, mastodons probably persisted into post-Pleistocene time and were thus contemporaneous with Paleo-Indian groups. Mastodons had a worldwide distribution; their remains are quite common and are often very well preserved.\nA characteristic feature of the mastodons, which appear to have fed upon leaves, is the distinctive nature of the grinding teeth, which in many respects are relatively primitive. They are low-crowned, large, and strongly rooted, with as many as four prominent ridges separated by deep troughs; the teeth are much smaller and less complex, however, than those in the true elephants. The prominent upper tusks were long and grew parallel to each other with an upward curvature. Short lower tusks were present in males but absent in females.\nMastodons were shorter than modern elephants but were heavily built. Although the skull was lower and flatter and of generally simpler construction than that of the modern elephants, it was similar in appearance. The ears were smaller and not as prominent as those of elephants. The body was relatively long, and the legs were short, massive, and pillarlike. Mastodons were covered with long reddish brown hair.\nIt is likely that mortality caused by rapid changes in climate combined with human hunting pressure contributed to their extinction. DNA studies of the North American mastodon (Mammut americanum) support the hypothesis that the mastodon\u2019s genetic diversity declined as conditions warmed, resulting in a retreat of the continental ice sheets and the animal\u2019s geographic range."}

A mature Siberian tiger can top out at 11 feet long and close to 700 pounds.\nTigers once inhabited most of Asia, from the tropical islands to Siberia. Today they are restricted to small patches of territory and very limited populations of each of the 6 living subspecies.\nThe largest of the tigers, the Siberian or Amur tiger, lives in the coniferous forests of Russia where its thick fur and full neck ruff keep it warm in deep snow.\nIn contrast, the much smaller Sumatran tiger lives in thick southern jungles and regularly bathes in ponds or streams to keep cool.\nThe Bengal tiger is the most common of the subspecies. They are almost as large as Siberians with top weights in the 500 pound range. Bengal tigers live in India, Bangladesh and Nepal in semi-tropical jungles.\nThe tiger is a stalk and ambush style hunter, and it's familiar stripes provide camouflage in thick underbrush as it waits for prey as large as 1000 pound water buffalo.\nThey have the largest fangs in the animal world and are very swift killers. The tiger is basically a solitary animal with a typical feline lifestyle. They roam wide and have very large overlapping territories but conflict and aggression between individuals is rare, and amazingly, wild tigers have been known to share their kill with other individuals, not always family members, who may happen upon them feeding.\nThis fascinating behavior, so different from the highly food-aggressive African lion, has been well documented.\nThe tiger, (and particularly the Bengal due to its proximity to civilization) is responsible for more human deaths then any other cat, hence the common term \"man-eating tiger\".\nA symbol of conservation efforts, the tiger is critically endangered throughout much of its range, but many of its small, pocket populations have remained stable for years due to government crackdowns on poaching. - Tiger Facts\ntiger, tiger\nBengal tigers\nAs the third largest carnivore on land, the tiger is smaller only than the polar bear and the brown bear.\nBut Bengal tigers in particular eat some of the largest prey, including gaur antelope, sambar deer, and massive water buffalo over 1200 pounds.\nTigers have been known to kill and eat sloth bears and Asian black bears, baby rhinos and even leopards. There have been isolated incidents reported of Bengal tigers taking down young elephants and even full grown infirmed adults.\nSiberian tigers - the largest of the tiger subspecies - actually prey on smaller game than the Bengal, with deer and mountain goats being their most common fare.\nThe Bengal is also the most likely tiger to kill human beings because its range has been so severely impacted by advancing development.\nMost wild tiger subspecies do not intermingle, because their populations are separated by wide swaths of civilization, but captive individuals in zoos, preserves and private possession have been housed together, and have inter-bred for decades and are not usually pure representatives of any one subspecies.\nMore often than not they are of mixed heritage, out crossed between the subspecies for so many generations of captivity that they are effectively \"mutts\". .\ngorgeous tigers\ntiger reproduction\nmother tigress and cubs\nMale and female tigers will pair up when the female is in estrus. After mating numerous times over the course of 4 or 5 days the male will return to a basically solitary life.\nThe female tigers pregnancy is 3 1/2 to 4 months long. In the last few days of pregnancy, the tigress will secure a safe nesting place because where she will deliver her 3 to 5 cubs.\nThe newborn tiger cubs weigh only about 2 pounds, are blind, completely helpless, and fully striped. The mother only stays in the same nest for a day or two and moves her cubs from hiding place to hiding place one at a time for the first few months of their lives.\nThis is a very dangerous time for the cubs, as she must leave them alone while she hunts. Often entire litters are lost when they are discovered by bears, leopards or snakes.\nFathers do not take part in the rearing of the cubs, although they have been known, on rare occasions, to return to visit and rest nearby.\nMother tigers begin to take their cubs on hunts when they are about 6 months old, but they won't be able to successfully hunt for themselves until they are about 2 years old.\nOnce the tiger cubs are fairly efficient hunters, they begin to branch off from their family, slowly developing their own territory, which they will mark by clawing trees, spraying urine and leaving strategic droppings.\nYoung females with their new litters will occasional visit with their mothers to show off the grandkids. Alliances of adult females occur briefly, from time to time, but food of the size and quantity that tigers must have is scarce and requires that tigers spread out in order to survive.\nThe depletion of large game animals throughout their native lands is the single factor in the endangered status of the tiger.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Monkey Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Monkey-facts.html", "text": "monkey Facts\nPortrait of a Howler Monkey\nMonkeys, gibbons and apes are all primates, but belong in different families. The most obvious difference between monkeys and apes is that apes do not have tails.\nA few isolated monkey species do not have tails either, but they are the exception rather than the rule.\nThe great apes, which are the human being, the orangutan, the gorilla, the chimpanzee and the bonobo, are much larger than monkeys and much more highly evolved.\nThe gibbon, which has many aspects of both monkeys and apes, is truly its own separate creature, although it is often lumped in with either apes or monkeys by virtue of many different arguments, both scientific and not so scientific.\nWe have separated the gibbons and offer their own article. We have also separated the baboon into it's own page because it is so well known, but the baboon is in fact an Old World monkey with the customary large size and non-prehensile tail..\nMonkeys are highly intelligent and active primates that are broken into two groups known as Old World monkeys and New World monkeys.\nThe Old World monkeys (including baboons) inhabit Africa and Asia, and are more closely related to apes. They are generally larger than New World monkeys, have more elongated faces, and have a tail that is not \"prehensile\".\nNew world monkeys are five families of primates that inhabit Central America, South America and some parts of Mexico. New world monkeys are generally smaller, have more flattened faces and have \"prehensile tails\" which they are capable of gripping with.\nThe prehensile tail is slim, muscular and very long, usually longer than the body length, and can easily support the weight of the entire monkey. These tails often have a patch of bare rough skin called a tactile pad or friction pad, that helps in grasping objects.\nWhile the tail is used primarily to assist in climbing and keeping the hands free for foraging and carrying, some monkey species will use it almost as an extra hand to hold and manipulate food items.\nNew world monkeys often use their tails to grab each other during wrestling and play, and will wrap their tails around each other for comfort.\nThe Old World baboons are the largest of the monkeys with males reaching almost 4 feet long and weighing nearly 80 pounds. The tiny pygmy marmosets of the New World rain forests are the smallest monkeys and can be as tiny as 4 inches and 4 ounces!\nof monkey hands and tails\nProboscis Monkeys - Old World\nSpider Monkey - New World\nOld World monkeys are most quickly differentiated from New World monkeys by looking at their tails.\nThe Old World monkeys have non-prehensile tails that can not grip. The New World monkeys have long. slim prehensile tails that they may climb with and that they can carry and manipulate items with.\nThe most dexterous tail in the monkey kingdom belongs to the spider monkey. These monkeys can hold, carry and even catch items with their tails, and will gesture with them as well.\nThere is a small bare area of rough skin on the underside of the last vertebra in the tail. This \"tactile pad\" has many nerve endings like a fingertip, which aids in delicate tasks like peeling a banana.\nThe prehensile tail is surely a product of the New World monkeys densely forested environment. Most New World monkeys are largely arboreal, spending the majority of their time high in the forest canopy, and some never leave the trees at all.\nWhile many Old World monkeys like the baboons, spend most of their time on the ground walking around on all fours like a dog.\nAnother area of monkey anatomy that shows some variety is the hand. All of the great apes have opposable thumbs meaning that the thumb can be swiveled around so that the pad of the thumb faces the pads of the fingers and can be brought together in a \"pincer\" grip.\nLikewise, all of the Old World monkeys have opposable thumbs.\nBut many New World monkeys, including marmosets, spider monkeys and capuchins do not have opposable thumbs.\nThese animals thumbs range from completely unopposable where the thumb can not be rotated, as in the marmoset and the tamarin, pseudo-opposable where there is partial rotation of the thumb to the side of the hand, and a third situation, as in the spider monkey, where the thumb is actually a very small digit - only 15% the length of the other fingers, and has very little use at all.\nThe New World monkeys life high in the trees no doubt plays a part. Using all five digits together to encircle a branch with more of a cupping motion rather than grasping, seems more effective when speed and mobility are of the essence.\nWith a tail that is able to help as well as its hands, the spider monkey swings from limb to limb with incredible ease, and with a thumb that is always in harmony with the rest of the hand.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Bachelor males may live either in small groups, or completely alone. Proboscis are similar to lions in that when a new male displaces the dominant male, he may kill the existing infants.\nThis is not the typical monkey lifestyle however. Most monkeys live in social groups from 5 to 30 individuals, and separate into pairs for a few days while mating takes place.\nOften there is a change that signals both the males and females readiness to mate, including swelling of the genitals, and reddening of both the genitals and sometimes the face.\nFemales may mate with several males and usually give birth alone.\nSome species, like macaques and baboons, give birth on the ground, but many others make nests up in the trees.\nOne infant is standard, and the baby will be held close to the chest for a few hours to up to two weeks before they graduate to riding on the mothers back.\nInfant monkeys live exclusively on mothers milk for as many as three months, but even after starting solid food, they will continue to nurse for up to a year.\nIn some species, there is some mild cooperation within the group in the rearing of young, but the mother is mostly responsible, and most male monkeys do not treat their own offspring with any special interest.\nYoung monkeys are agile, active and incredibly curious. The most advanced monkey species have their own culture, including greatly varied \"accents\" to their vocalizations, even from troop to troop of the same species.\nLittle ones are taught social codes, local ways to gather and handle food, hunting techniques, seasonality of fruits and nuts, the safest places to sleep and eat.\nLike humans and apes, monkeys have been seen to demonstrate actions in order to teach young ones. In one such instance a mother macaque was observed repeatedly washing a piece of fruit until the toddler caught on and began dipping his own lunch in the river. - Amazing Monkey Facts\nmonkey face\nthe many faces of monkeys\nThere are over 260 known species of monkeys, all of whom display their own distinct look. Colors and patterns, Mohawks and mono-brows, variations in eye shape, skull, nostril, and ear structure, bare skin to fur ratios, and overall proportions produce a slide show of differences unrivaled by any other animal group.

There are 16 species within the tamarin genus.\nMarmosets and tamarins differ in jaw shape and skull construction but otherwise have a very similar appearance and lifestyle. They are the smallest monkey species and differ from other monkey families in several ways.\nTheir teeth are specially designed to strip open the bark of trees exposing the sap inside. Some marmoset species may get up to 70% of their diet from tree sap. Otherwise they will eat insects, birds eggs, flowers and fruits.\nMarmosets and tamarins have more primitive brains than other monkeys, and they have claws on their hands and feet as opposed to the flat nails that other monkeys and apes have.\nThese beautiful little monkeys have an amazing variety of face and head decorations, from the flowing red locks of the Golden Lion tamarin, to the feather like extensions of the cotton eared marmoset, to the outrageous mustache of the emperor tamarin.\nThese monkeys almost always give birth to twins.

Living similiar to a pack animal, moving in fairly large groups on the ground, walking usually on all fours.\nThey are still good climbers and will hunt small prey and gather fruits in the trees, but also scavenge around on the ground like dogs might, with their noses low to the ground.\nMany of the Old World monkeys are built for life on the ground, with stronger, wider and more developed lower bodies, while the New World spider monkeys have tiny hips and legs as thin as their arms.\nnight monkey\nMost Old World monkey species sit down fully on their buttocks much as humans do when resting and eating giving them a sort of \"little old man\" quality, while the New World monkeys rest on flexed haunches, more like a cat.\nWhile the majority of monkey species are diurnal - out and about by day- there is an entire family of New World monkeys known as \"night monkeys\" eleven nocturnal species who have large forward facing round eyes like an owl for night vision.\nEqually diverse are the temperatures and habitats monkeys may be found in. Many monkeys naturally live in hot - even sweltering- desert or rain forest environments, but there are some species that live in ice and snow like Japans amazing macaques.\nThese monkeys range farther North than any primate species living in the highlands of central Japan where the snowfall is extensive.

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Woolly Mammoth images!\nThe woolly mammoth was a furry elephant-like mammal. It\u2019s closest relative that is still alive today is the Asian elephant. Woolly mammoths lived at the same time as humans. Isolated populations on a few islands lived as recently as 4,000 years ago! Woolly mammoths are well known for their long curved tusks, and mammoth ivory is still a hot commodity among humans to this day.\nDescription and Size\nWoolly mammoths were the same size as today\u2019s African elephants. Males stood between nine and 11 feet high at the shoulder and females were slightly smaller\u20148.5-9.5 feet high at the shoulder. Males could weigh as much as 12,000 pounds, and females weighed 8,000 pounds. A newborn woolly mammoth would have weighed 200 pounds.\nWoolly mammoths were covered in fur, likely to keep them warm in the wintery environments they inhabited. Genetic tests revealed that woolly mammoths ranged in color from blonde to dark brown or black. However, they aren\u2019t sure if there was an evolutionary advantage to this coloring. Preserved woolly mammoth hair is often orangish when it is found, but researchers believe that is due to ground conditions changing the pigmentation. What is most interesting is that the gene researchers used to determine the animals\u2019 coloring is still present in animals today \u2013 including humans. This gene causes people to have red hair, and in some other animals, it causes yellow or blonde hair.\nWoolly mammoths had long trunks, like elephants, and huge, curved tusks. Researchers believe they used their tusks in a similar manner to modern elephants. They could use their tusks for fighting and use their trunks for handling items and help with foraging.\nThe main difference between woolly mammoths and modern elephants is their ears. They had much smaller ears, likely to minimize the chance of frostbite. Besides their tusks, they had four large molars to grind their food. Their molars would get replaced six times throughout their lifetime.\nWhat Did Woolly Mammoths Eat?\nWoolly mammoths likely lived on a diet of mainly grasses and sedges\u2014grass-like plants with flowers. However, evidence found preserved in the stomachs of mammoths shows that they also snacked on flowers, shrubs, materials found on trees, and moss. Different samples show that what the mammoths ate specifically depended on their location.\nSome evidence shows that baby mammoths may have eaten excrement to promote the growth of a gut biome that would help them to digest plants as they grew and stopped drinking their mother\u2019s milk.\nSince they were so large, they needed to eat a lot of food. Experts believe they had to eat nearly 400 pounds of food each day and could have spent up to 20 hours a day searching for food.\nWhen and Where Woolly Mammoths Lived\nWoolly mammoths lived in a type of environment called \u201cmammoth steppe\u201d or \u201ctundra steppe.\u201d This area was found in the northern regions of what we now call Asia, Europe, and North America. There are actually two groups of woolly mammoths that experts are researching to find out if they should be two different subspecies. The first group went extinct about 45,000 years ago and stayed closer to the arctic. The second group went extinct about 12,000 years ago and skeletons of this type have been found as far south as the Shandong Province in China and Granada in Spain.\nWoolly mammoths may have gotten onto North America by crossing the land bridge on what is now the Bering Strait over 300,000 years ago.\nResearchers consider the woolly mammoth to be one of the most successful mammals of its era because it was present in so many places. They estimate its habitat covered over 33,301,000 square kilometers.\nOther mammoth species were present millions of years ago. Woolly mammoths started to diverge from other mammoth species about 800,000 years ago. They went extinct in most places around 10,000 years ago, except for isolated populations on islands that went extinct 4,000 years ago.\nWoolly Mammoth Threats and Predators\nAs such large animals, woolly mammoths may not have had many predators. However, young mammoths and weak or sick animals would have been vulnerable to wolves, cave hyenas, and large predatory cats of the era. There is some evidence that woolly mammoths may have been hunted by humans, but it\u2019s not clear how prevalent that was. There were other, smaller, and easier to hunt animals available to humans at the time. What is more common to see in mammoth skeletons is that humans scavenged the remains after a predator had already killed it or it had died of natural causes.\nThreats to woolly mammoths were also environmental. They were sensitive to the long winters when it was harder to find food. This is evidenced by their tusk growth rings, which slowed in the winter. One study of mammoth remains in North America found that the most common time for them to die was in the winter or spring when food was hardest to come by.\nClimate change was also likely a threat to woolly mammoths. The final downturn of the woolly mammoth\u2019s population occurred towards the end of the last ice age. However, experts believe that woolly mammoths\u2019 decline could also have contributed to the warming of the environment. They were no longer eating trees, specifically birch trees, that have a sunlight absorbing and warming effect. So, birch forests grew more readily and could have warmed the environment by 0.2 degrees celsius. That doesn\u2019t sound like much, but it did make an effect!\nDiscoveries and Fossils\nMammoth skeletons are very plentiful. A simple search reveals numerous articles about hundreds of mammoth skeletons being found in one location or another. In 2020, nearly 200 skeletons were found at a construction site in Mexico City. Samples are plentiful, however, there are some notable ones that have helped scientists to learn a lot about woolly mammoths.\nThere are two types of woolly mammoth remains that can be found. Skeletons or fossils, and actual remains. Many woolly mammoth remains are found frozen. However, one mammoth was found in Poland with preserved soft tissue. It had been naturally mummified in a petroleum seep.\nEarly frozen mammoth remains from the 1700s were cut up and sold off to the highest bidder. In the 1800s, some were even fed to dogs! Fortunately, since then, scientists have found many well-preserved frozen specimens to study.\nSome of the most informative frozen mammoths are mammoth calves. These specimens give us an idea of how mammoths grew and how they cared for their young. For example, by studying these specimens, scientists believe that calves were nursed for 2-3 years before transitioning to a diet of plants.\nOne frozen mammoth that was found in 2013 still had liquid blood in its abdomen, leading researchers to believe that their blood may have had some anti-freezing capabilities.\nExtinction: When and Why Did The Woolly Mammoth Die Out?\nThere are a few different theories as to why the woolly mammoth died out. The one thing everyone is sure about is when they died out. Most died out about 10,000 years ago. However, a few isolated populations remained on the islands. They lived on Saint Paul Island, which is part of Alaska, until 5,600 years ago. They lived on Wrangel Island, in Russia, until about 4,000 years ago.\nIt is a bit easier to determine the cause of extinction for the smaller island-based populations. The mammoths on St. Paul Island went extinct because their habitat shrank due to sea-level rise, and that likely reduced the amount of freshwater available.\nThe Wrangel Island mammoths seem to have been killed by a catastrophic event, which could have been the arrival of humans on the island or changes in the climate. Their disappearance did happen around the same time that humans first came to the island. That pattern is seen in some other mammoth populations. For example, in what is now Alaska and Yukon, mammoths died out 1,000 years after humans appeared.\nExperts believe that a shrinking habitat due to a changing climate put the population in a declining trend. Then, human activity and hunting likely sealed their fate.\nMammoth Ivory\nIvory from woolly mammoths is a hot commodity to this day. This is in part because it is illegal in many places to trade or sell elephant ivory, so people use mammoth ivory instead. Climate change and human activity are revealing more and more mammoth skeletons and tusks, especially in Siberia. A lucrative market has formed, particularly exporting mammoth ivory to China, where expert craftspeople carve it into beautiful and traditional designs and figures.\nEarly humans and Neanderthals used mammoth ivory to make tools and even used mammoth bones as a building material. They also used mammoth ivory to make spear tips.\nBringing Back the Woolly Mammoth\nSome people want to bring back the woolly mammoth using preserved genetic evidence. This process is complicated. First, the genome of the extinct animal must be sequenced. Then, scientists must edit the DNA of a close living relative, meaning one must exist. Luckily, in the case of mammoths, the Asian elephant is a good candidate.\nThe people who want to recreate woolly mammoths believe their return to our ecosystem could help our modern problem of climate change. These experts believe that re-introducing grazers such as woolly mammoths to the current tundra could turn it back into grassland, which may help preserve the permafrost there. They also believe it could help us to learn more about preserving endangered species that already exist today.\nSimilar to the Woolly Mammoth\nSimilar animals to the woolly mammoth include:\nMastodons \u2013 Smaller than the woolly mammoth, they emerged about 25 million years and may have been the mammoth\u2019s predecessors.\nGomphotheres \u2013 Giant four-tusked animals that looked similar to a modern elephant.\nAsian Elephant \u2013 This is the mammoth\u2019s closest living relative and has several different subspecies living in Asia today.\nAfrican Bush Elephant \u2013 A modern elephant species living in Central and Southern Africa.\nAfrican Forest Elephant \u2013 A subspecies of the African bush elephant, these elephants live in forests and grasslands in central Africa.\nView all 72 animals that start with W"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Bonobo Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Bonobo-facts.html", "text": "bonobo Facts\nPortrait of a Bonobo\nOne of the most fascinating bonobo facts is that the bonobo uses sexual contact to diffuse conflicts rather than resorting to violence. The bonobo and the chimpanzee are in the same genus and were considered the same species until the 1920's.\nOriginally the bonobo was called the \"pygmy chimpanzee\", and is sometimes still referred to by that name. The average size for a bonobo is about 3 1/2 feet tall and 65 to 80 pounds, although males can be as heavy as 150 pounds. The largest male chimps top 200 pounds, but overall, the size difference between the two species is not that significant, and in the mid 1950's the \"pygmy\" term was largely discarded and replaced with the name \"bonobo\".\nPhysical differences between chimps and bonobos are not obvious. Chimps tend to be bulkier with shorter limbs and more pronounced muzzles. The bonobo usually has pink or red lips and black skin on the face, which is seen in juveniles as well, while juvenile chimps will have light colored faces, and may retain a lighter skin tone as adults, though adult coloration varies.\nBonobos in the wild generally have full heads of black hair parted oddly right down the middle, but in captivity many bonobos are bald. The balding occurs presumably through excessive mutual grooming. One theory is that troops in the wild have more members so the grooming is spread around, but that idea does not stand up to simple logic - wouldn't more members mean more individuals not just to groom, but to be groomed by? Boredom, stress, or other environmental factors are far more likely the cause.\nThe word \"bonobo\" may be a misspelling of the village of Bolobo, located in the heart of bonobo territory in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This one country in Central Africa is where all wild bonobos live. Their entire population in the wild is unknown, but is believed to number between 30,000 and 50,000 individuals. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is plagued by civil unrest, and the government is not currently able to protect the population from poaching and deforestation. Bonobos are currently considered endangered, and may be extinct in the wild within 30 years if their situation does not improve.\nBonobos are highly intelligent, extremely social great apes. They live in very cooperative and peaceful groups, known as troops, with as many as 70 members, but 15 to 30 is most common. Their fluid social structure is known as fission-fusion, which means they may come together in various sized groups, or separate for different activities, different times of year, and depending on who is available to \"hang out\" with. Just as we do.\nThey are omnivorous, eating a large variety of fruits and plant stuffs, as well as small animals and fish. Like chimps, they will hunt together in groups, sneaking up on and cornering monkeys, reptiles and young antelope.\nBonobos live in deep forest and swamplands in an unstable region of the world, so there was little study of them in the wild when they were first discovered. Some of what was known about them, however, so confused and disturbed the scientific community that it was kept secret for decades.\nThe fact is, the bonobo has a social structure that incorporates regular and very casual sexual contact between all members, that has nothing to do with reproduction.\nAlthough some of this contact is clearly just for fun, much of it is a social skill used to avoid conflict, reassure one another, and build bonds. The result is a society with very little violence, and where lethal aggression and infanticide - quite common in chimps and human beings, is virtually unheard of.\nSo is violence simply in the genes of certain species?\nWell, when researchers sequenced the genome of the chimpanzee in 2005 and the bonobo in 2012, they found that they still share 99.6% of their DNA, while human beings share about 98.7% of our DNA with both chimps and bonobos, suggesting that something other than genetic makeup.\nHumans and bonobos share one thing that chimps do not possess - a pattern in the brain cells called spindle cells or Von Economo Neurons. This is a pattern associated with empathy and other complex social skills, that is also found in whales and elephants - fascinating bonobo facts.\nbonobo sex life\nMany people in Religious and scientific circles have erroneously contended that human beings are alone in the pursuit of sexual activity purely for pleasure, and although many animals, (and birds) engage in what appears to be recreational sex, the bonobo snuffs that myth with abandon.\nBonobos engage in orgies, homosexuality, and masturbation, not necessarily in that order and certainly not to the exclusion of any one activity. It is exceedingly casual, comforting, usually very fleeting and apparently quite pleasurable.\nOne of the hallmarks of Christian civilization was the idea that humans were the only land animals to have intercourse face to face. In fact, teaching this position to other communities they encountered was one of the goals of Christian missionaries, and is the reason why we call it the \"missionary position.\"\nBut bonobos copulate face to face all the time.\nThis fact, and the shear frequency of the sexual contact caused the scientific community to keep details about the bonobo lifestyle a secret for decades, and wasn't openly discussed until the 1970's.\nThe sexual contact among bonobos serves many purposes and is critical to their community. Often it is an expression of excitement in a situation that might cause aggression in other species.\nWhile dominant male chimps will put on angry, sometimes violent displays to keep subordinates away from new found food, bonobos will celebrate the discovery of food as a group by touching and rubbing against each other before settling down to eat.\nIn fact, most situations that might cause other creatures to become violent, such as accidentally stepping on a sleeping neighbor, are greeted with sexual contact by bonobos.\nUltimately, it is a system that works, and they are largely peaceful animals.\nfemale dominance in bonobo society\nBetween 4 and 8 million years ago, our ancestors began to evolve separately from those of chimps and bonobos. Then, when the Congo river was formed one million years ago, the chimp population was split geographically. Chimpanzees continued to develop north of the river, and bonobos evolved to the south.\nThe southern landscape was rich in resources, a lush, tropical world, that may ultimately have required less adaptions for continued survival. The bonobo is physiologically less specialized than the chimpanzee, and may be closer to what our common ancestors really looked like.\nMore importantly for the present-day animal, it's nurturing environment may have allowed it to remain more peaceful, with less competition, and may have allowed the females to become the leaders and rule-makers.\nBonobos have a matriarchal society where females dominate and make most of the decisions as far as group activities. Like chimpanzees, males generally stay with family groups for life, while female bonobos are the ones that may set off on their own to join a new family, or form a new troop. As a result, most of the adult females in a bonobo community are unrelated.\nBut how the female bonobo attains acceptance and status in that new group is vastly different from how the female chimp gains favor. And is one of the many significant differences between chimps and bonobos.\nA young female chimp gains favor by submitting to dominant males. A young female bonobo finds acceptance by pandering to the dominant females in her new group. And she will use sexual contact in the form of genital touching, to win them over.\nFemale bonobos even regularly lay with eachother in the missionary position and rub their genitals together, often quite energetically and joyfully.\nThe relationships that these non-related females form is very unique in the animal world, and is one of the other fascinating things we have in common with them. These adult bonobo females, who are usually unrelated because they relocate to new groups, actually form tighter bonds than do the males in the group, many of whom are assumed to be related, because they all remain in the group their whole lives.\nUltimately, female bonobos run things by teaming up. Males may be as much as 25% larger, but they don't develop the close bonds that females do, and they don't work together. The females come to eachothers aid against aggressive males, stick together, and dominate by acting as a gang.\nMale bonobos generally concede to females, wait for them to eat first, give up favorite sunning spots, simply move out of the way. If they don't, they may be on the receiving end of some of the only violent acts that occur in the bonobo community. Groups of female bonobos will occasionally attack males, and have been known, in particular, to actually bite off their fingers or toes.\nThis behaviour has been witnessed infrequently in the wild, but unfortunately seems to increase in captivity. Stress and overcrowding is probably the cause of the increase, but nevertheless, the bonobo is definitely capable of violence, and it is usually the females who inflict the most damage. - Bonobo Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Even now the Congo prevents contact between chimps and bonobos in the wild.\nThe environment north of the Congo is more challenging, and chimpanzees have devised strategies to cope. Tool use and tool making among chimps is widespread, very common, and is cultural in nature. Adults will demonstrate the use of a tool to youngsters, and different troops may have different techniques in using the same tool, or may use different tools for similar tasks.\nChimps fashion sticks to use in catching termites, throw rocks, and amazingly have even been observed sharpening the ends of broken branches with their teeth, and using them to spear prey.\nBonobos in the wild have demonstrated very limited tool use, and little if any tool making. They have been observed using twigs as toothpicks, making rainhats out of leaves and branches, and using moss as a sponge to soak up liquid.\nMany of these skills were created out of necessity, and the bonobos lush, rainforest environment may simply not warrant a multitude of inventions.\nIn captivity, both species show high levels of capability when it comes to manipulating objects and using tools that have been demonstrated to them, even using computers, building campfires and playing video games.\nAnother indication of intelligence is the kind of play that animals engage in. Here, the bonobos rule. They are far more playful than chimps, and remain so into adulthood, with adults regularly playing with other adults. Adult chimps don't play anywhere near as much as adult bonobos, and if they do, it is at the insistence of a juvenile.\nBonobos are extremely expressive and will engage eachother with direct gazes that precede incidence of play and also sex, sort of like, \"are you thinking what I'm thinking?\".\nThis isn't surprising when you consider that their brains show patterns of neuron activity called VENs, or spindle neurons, that are only found in significant numbers in four other animals - whales, dolphins, humans and elephants - the creatures considered to have advanced emotional capacity, and in particular, empathy for one another.\nThere is no clear answer to the question of whether bonobos are smarter than chimps, but it is clear that they are markedly different mentally and emotionally, and both are simply brilliant in their own ways.\n- Amazing Bonobo Facts!\nbonobo reproduction\nWhile most female animals are sexually active only seasonally, including their cousins the chimpanzees, female bonobos may engage in copulation with males at any time. There is virtually no competition between males, and no pair bonding. Either sex may initiate sexual activity. Nearly 30% of intercourse occurred with females who were not ovulating, and 30% of intercourse occurs face to face, with mutual gazing, and even French kissing .\nYoung female bonobos will leave their birth troop at about the time of their first monthly menstrual cycle, usually around 9 or 10 years old. They will join a new troop and gain acceptance from the dominant females through grooming, play, and sexual contact.\nThe first pregnancy is usually at about 13 or 14, and bearing her first infant will raise the young females social standing within the troop. Pregnancy lasts 8 months, and a single 2 to 3 pound infant is born well-furred with eyes open.\nBonobo infants develop more slowly than baby chimps. They do not leave their mother for the first three months of life, clinging tightly to her with hands and feet while being held against her chest.\nIt takes a full three years for the youngster to wander more than 30 feet away, and by that age they are riding on her back. Mothers and babies spend lots of time in little groups together, and baby bonobos play constantly with eachother. These are extraordinarily active, joyful little youngsters with a variety of games played both with eachother and with the adults in the troop.\nBaby bonobos live on breast milk for the first year or so, and then begin to sample a variety of foods. They are not fully weaned until 4 or 5 years old, and may sleep with and travel with their mother for several years after that, occasionally assisting in the raising of a new sibling.\nYoung males will stay with the troop they were born into, will stay relatively close to their mothers throughout their lives, and will benefit from her high social ranking. Young females leave their mothers and their troop at about 9 years of age to join another troop, but may recognize and briefly socialize with their mother if they run into eachother.\nAdult male bonobos do not contribute to the care of youngsters, and because there is no clear bonding, and no way of knowing which are their offspring, they are prone to indifference. At the same time, they are amenable towards youngsters, playful, casually affectionate and will protect them from predators.\nUnlike male chimps who can be quite violent towards infants and juveniles, male bonobos rarely exhibit any aggression towards youngsters, and infanticide among bonobos has never been observed.- Bonobo Facts\na few more bonobo facts\nA group of bonobos is called a \"troop\" or a \"community\"\nThe bonobo and the chimpanzee are our closest living relatives sharing 98.7% of our DNA\nBonobos have opposable thumbs and opposable big toes too\nThe bonobo was originally called the \"pygmy chimpanzee\"\nThe bonobo is probably the sexiest animal on Earth\nBonobos have sex face to face and French kiss\nThe bonobo was one of the last large mammals to be discovered in the wild\nBonobos and chimps were once thought to be the same animal\nBonobos were recognized as a separate species in 1929\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Primates\nFamily Hominidae\nSubfamily Ponginae\nGenus Pan\nSpecies: paniscus (bonobo)\nBonobo Facts - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT male female infant, baby group GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD troop,\ncommunity Africa jungle, rainforest fruit ENEMIES ENDANGERED TOP SPEED LIFESPAN leopard,human yes 28 mph 40-50 years GENDER DIFFERENCE DIFFERENCE\nFROM CHIMP AVG..HEIGHT AVG.

On average, the lion is the tallest of the big cats, but the Siberian tiger tends to be considerably longer and heavier.\nThe ultimate apex predator and an awesomely beautiful creature, the adult male lion has a flamboyant ruff of remarkably long hair around the head and neck known as a mane, which begins to develop when he is about 10 months old.\nAlthough it has been speculated that the purpose of the mane is to provide protection in fights with other males, it is more likely an indication of fitness, condition and virility and it's color has been found to be linked to testosterone levels.\nLions with darker manes had more testosterone, and were found to be more appealing to female lions, and more intimidating to male opponents.\nAn adult male African lion is over 400 pounds and 4 feet tall at the shoulder. They are equipped with enormous fangs and incredibly powerful necks, forelimbs and claws that allow them to hunt, on average, the largest prey of any land animal.\nRegularly taking down 600 pound plains zebras and 1,300 pound cape buffalo, African lions will also take on giraffes and even elephants in the right situation.\nCompared to other cats, lions are very social animals and live in groups of 5 to 25 individuals called prides. The pride is made up of several related adult females, their cubs, and some adult males.\nThese pride males, often brothers, may come and go, and even be members of more than one pride at a time. They must continually prove themselves as established pride leaders, fending off all other males in serious, sometimes fatal fights.\nThe females hunt together, only occasionally being helped by the male members, but when the hunt is over, the adult males, generally 30 to 40 percent larger, eat first.\nMany adult male lions, however, live alone or in small \"bachelor\" groups, not bold enough or strong enough to take on established males. And pride leaders themselves, worn down from constant battles, will eventually succumb to a stronger rivals and retreat back to a solitary lifestyle.\nAfrican lions roam the grasslands and vast savannas of central and south Africa, The smaller, lighter colored Asiatic lion lives in the jungles of south Asia in very small numbers. - African Lion Facts\nking of the jungle?\nAsiatic lions\nKing of the Jungle? Of the 20,000 lions in the wild, only 500 - 525 highly endangered Asiatic lions live in the Gir jungle of India.\nThe familiar African lion lives on the savanna grasslands of central and southern Africa.\nAsiatic lions are also called Persian lions or Indian lions. They are a bit smaller than African lions, have distinctive skin folds that can be seen running along the sides of the torso, and a much sparser mane.\nThey have been actively protected by the Indian government for the last 30 years, and their small jungle territory was declared a national park where human activity is prohibited.\nThanks to this concerted effort the number of Asiatic lions in the wild has increased from a low of about 250 individuals to over 500 in a fairly short period.\nAwesome African Lions\nAfrican lion reproduction\nlion cub close-up\nThe female lion is poly-estrus, which means she may ovulate up to 4 times a year until she is impregnated. When in estrus or \"heat\", she will pair up with a male of the pride for a few days during which time they will mate repeatedly.\nHer pregnancy takes 3 1/2 to 4 months and when ready to deliver she will leave the pride to find a good nesting spot. She delivers 2 to 4 cubs and remains secluded with them for several weeks before returning to the pride and introducing the new members.\nThis is a dangerous time for mother and cubs, and she will usually fast for days while tending to her young. When she returns to the pride with the new cubs she is greeted with much nuzzling, inspecting and celebrating.\nThe cubs will be nurtured by the whole pride at this point, and if cubs are orphaned, another lioness will usually adopt them and even nurse them.\nFemale cubs will live with the pride their entire lives and never leave. Male cubs will leave the pride, usually driven off by the adult males, when they are about two years old. They will live alone, or band together in small groups of \"bachelor\" males called \"coalitions\" Many male lions will never return to a pride, and will never mate.\nOnly the strongest and boldest will attempt to takeover a pride by driving the established males out. Once a new male or new group of males take over, they will often - but not always- kill the youngest cubs in order to begin their own families.\nThe mothers are helpless against this, but in the life of a lioness this doesn't happen often. New males may come in every two years or so, and if the timing is right, the cubs may be old enough not to be harmed.\nThe main catalyst for the killing of the cubs appears to be an attempt to free up those mother lions to mate again, and, in fact, lionesses who lose their cubs for almost any reason will come back into heat very quickly. - African Lion Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

They may spend years alone or in small bachelor groups of other males called rouges, often made up of brothers.\nAs they mature and grow, they prepare to return to the pride or neighboring prides and unseat the dominant males, in fierce, sometimes fatal battles. If they succeed they will often kill any cubs from the former king.\nNow, as the dominant males, they will mate with the females in the pride as they come into season, and otherwise doze in the sun or sleep in the shade up to 20 hours a day, waiting for the females to catch dinner.\nThey will battle any males who try to overthrow them, and eventually they will loose the fight, after only a few months or short years of glory, and sometimes to one or more of their own sons.\nBanished again from the pride, older and war-weary, they most likely spend the rest of their years on the outside of the pride looking in.\nKind of a thorny crown, don't you think? - African Lion Facts\ngood hair goes a long way\nRivaled only by the horse, the male African lion in full mane is a true icon of the animal kingdom.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Hyena Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Hyena-facts.html", "text": "Hyena Facts\nOne of the least known hyena facts is that they are actually accomplished hunters, not just sneaky scavengers. Although they resemble both dogs and cats, the three species of hyenas and the aardwolf are in their own separate and very unique family called Hyaenidae.\nThe most well-known is called the spotted hyena, also known as the laughing hyena due to the unusual and eerie sounds it makes. After the African lion, the spotted hyena is the largest carnivore in Africa, weighing up to 180 pounds and standing up to 30 inches at the shoulder. These are complicated, intelligent, and highly social animals with a really awful reputation.\nFor centuries hyenas were said to have the souls of the damned trapped inside of them, and when a clan is on the hunt, calling and squealing to one another, it certainly sounds like cackling demons.\nIn addition, female spotted hyenas have very unusual genitalia that outwardly resemble that of a male. This shocks even many modern cultures who fear it as a sign of anarchy or the work of the devil.\nAnd, of course, hyenas have long been considered scurrilous and sneaky scavengers, but they are actually skilled hunters and clans will organize to take down prey as large as zebra. Most clans hunt and kill the majority of what they eat, but, like all the animals of the African plains, they will also steal absolutely anything that isn't nailed down.\nAlthough they are zoologically classified in their own family, hyenas share tendencies with both felines and canines. Like canines they hunt by running down their prey and grabbing it with their mouths, not their paws. But, like felines, they groom themselves often and scent-mark their territory.\nUnique to hyenas are their amazing bone-crushing teeth. Short, powerful canines are on display towards the front of the jaw, but deep in the back of the jaw where they can exert the most leverage, are massive carnassials which pulverize the entire skeletons of prey as big as wildebeast. So much bone material is consumed that the hyenas droppings have a chalky white color.\nSocially, the spotted hyena lives in a matriarchal society quite rare in the world of mammals. Females are larger, more muscular and definitely more aggressive. The highest ranking male in the clan is generally subordinate to the lowest ranking female. These spotted hyena clans are rude, boisterous, highly social groups that spend allot of time pushing and shoving but will ultimately spend the afternoon siesta snuggled in a huge shaggy pile. - Hyena Facts\nThe Artful Hyena\nThe older the hyena, the gnarlier their ears are. Why? Because although they are tight-knit and extremely dependent on eachother, the members of a hyena clan spend alot of time beating eachother up.\nMost interesting and unique is that it's the females doing most of the damage.\nFemale hyenas actually have more testosterone then males, can be about 30% larger, and significantly more muscular. Why this arrangement? Nobody is really sure, but the hyena is a very successful species that has adapted to many situations over thousands of years.\nIn ancient Egypt, spotted hyenas were raised and harvested for their meat, occasionally being kept as rather large and messy pets. More recently, as humans have encroached further and further into their world, hyenas have learned the skills of dodging traffic and dumpster diving.\nOn the savanna, hyenas center their lives around a specific territory well marked by community \"latrines\" where the entire clan will leave mounds of chalk-colored feces.\nHyenas have such powerful teeth and jaws that they will eat every inch of a carcass - including the bones. When the bones are digested they turn the hyenas excrement a very distinctive off-white color, so piles of white poo mean \"this land is ours!\" - Hyena Facts\nBaby hyena\nOne of the most amazing hyena facts is that they are almost impossible to sex. Their appearance, habits and sounds are already weird, but when it comes to sex, there is no more confusing creature than the spotted hyena. Unusually high testosterone levels in female spotted hyenas create not only larger, stronger and more aggressive girls, but also transform the female sex organs.\nThe clitoris of the female spotted hyena is a tube-like pseudo penis 6 to 7 inches long that looks almost identical to a male penis. Completing the illusion, the labia are fused together in what appears to be a scrotum.\nThese organs make it nearly impossible for even experienced hyena observers to tell the difference, and have caused many to believe that hyenas are clans of devilish hermaphrodites whose cackles mock the norm.\nBut actual intercourse is no laughing matter, it is a delicate and stressful process where a submissive male must somehow arch his way under the female and insert his penis into a dangling tube.\nThe female urinates and gives birth through the urogenital canal which runs down the center of the clitoris. Birth is extremely difficult due to the length of the canal, and death during the first delivery is about 1 in 10. Subsequent deliveries are easier. There are usually two cubs delivered, but fighting between the cubs often occurs, particularly if they are the same sex, and the weaker sibling will often perish in the first weeks.\nYoung males will leave the clan at about 2 years, females will remain for life. - Hyena Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Hence the common question \"is a hyena a dog or a cat? Or maybe a bear?\" Fact is, hyenas are hyenas, or more scientifically, members of the small 4 species family called Hyeanidae.\nIn the carnivore family tree are two main groups, feliformia, or \"cat-like\" carnivores, and caniformila, or \"dog-like\" carnivores. The ancestors of the modern hyena were cat-like tree dwellers that spawned not only cats but civets, mongoose and binterong.\nSo hyenas are in the sub-order feliformia, along with all modern felines. But over the course of evolution, hyenas developed many of the behaviors and physical features of the dog species that lived in the same environment. Because those behaviors and physical attributes were effective adaptions to the environment and filled a similar ecological niche, this is called concurrent evolution, and it is why hyenas look and act so much like African wild dogs even though they do not share the same ancestors.\nUltimately, hyenas are hyenas, or more scientifically four species in the very specialized family Hyaenidae. They share biological ancestors with cats but developed more like dogs. Among modern animals, they are most closely related to the civets which are medium sized carnivores that resemble weasels, but also have their own separate family. - Hyena Facts\nlaughing all the way\nmath and the next meal\nJust like in any rough neighborhood, the kids on the Savanna find safety in numbers.\nFive hyenas might steal a fresh kill from a lion, Ten African wild dogs can take a zebra carcass from a hyena, and a big enough gang of vultures will drive just about everyone away from whatever is left.\nHolding on to a meal on the plains comes down to stealth, intellect, courage, and -most important- your peeps beside you.\nWhile lions, hyenas and wild dogs all hunt and kill much of their own prey, stealing is part of the rhythm, and plunder keeps you fat, but the vulture does not hunt at all, and is the only true scavenger in this circle of adversaries. .. Hyena Facts\nother hyena species\nFor those who might find the common spotted hyenas appearance slightly off-putting we offer the two uncommon cousins, the straggly brown hyena, and the amazingly odd, joker-face of the striped hyena.\nSmaller and far less populous than the spotted hyena, these two species somewhat mirror the spotted in lifestyle and fill the same ecological niche. The biggest difference, however, is 'tude.\nWhile the infamous spotted hyena is pugnacious and will defend itself with startling ferocity, the striped hyena and the very shy brown hyena will actually \"play dead\", similar to a opossum, when faced with a threat. So, even for the rugged spotted hyena it's true - our closest relatives can be the source of our deepest embarrassment! - Hyena Facts\na few more hyena facts\nHyenas were long believed to be hermaphrodites because the females genitalia look almost exactly like the males.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephant seal - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_seal", "text": "Genus of aquatic carnivores\n\"Sea elephant\" redirects here. For the superfamily of sea slugs, see Pterotracheoidea\nElephant seals are large, oceangoing earless seals in the genus Mirounga. The two species, the northern elephant seal (M. angustirostris) and the southern elephant seal (M. leonina), were both hunted to the brink of extinction for oil by the end of the 19th century, but their numbers have since recovered. They are the largest extant carnivorans, weighing up to 4,000 kilograms (8,800 lb).\nThe northern elephant seal, somewhat smaller than its southern relative, ranges over the Pacific coast of the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The most northerly breeding location on the Pacific Coast is at Race Rocks, at the southern tip of Vancouver Island in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The southern elephant seal is found in the Southern Hemisphere on islands such as South Georgia and Macquarie Island, and on the coasts of New Zealand, South Africa, and Argentina in the Peninsula Vald\u00e9s. In southern Chile, there is a small colony of 120 animals at Jackson Bay, Admiralty Sound (Seno Almirantazgo), Tierra del Fuego.\nThe oldest known unambiguous elephant seal fossils are fragmentary fossils of an unnamed member of the tribe Miroungini described from the late Pliocene Petane Formation of New Zealand. Teeth originally identified as representing an unnamed species of Mirounga have been found in South Africa, and dated to the Miocene epoch; however, Boessenecker and Churchill (2016) considered these teeth to be almost certainly misidentified odontocete teeth. The elephant seals evolved in the Pacific Ocean during the Pliocene period.\nElephant seals breed annually and are seemingly faithful to colonies that have established breeding areas.\nTaxonomy [ edit ]\nJohn Edward Gray established the genus Mirounga in 1827. The generic name Mirounga is a Latinization of miouroung, which is said to have been a term for the seal in an Australian Aboriginal language. However, it is not known which language this represents.\nDescription [ edit ]\nElephant seals are marine mammals classified under the order Pinnipedia, which, in Latin, means feather- or fin-footed. Elephant seals are considered true seals, and fall under the family Phocidae. Phocids (true seals) are characterized by having no external ear and reduced limbs. The reduction of their limbs helps them be more streamlined and move easily in the water. However, it makes navigating on land more difficult because they cannot turn their hind flippers forward to walk like the Otariids. In addition, the hind flippers of elephant seals have a lot of surface area, which helps propel them in the water. Elephant seals spend the majority of their life (90%) underwater in search of food, and can cover 100 kilometres (60 miles) a day when they head out to sea. When elephant seals are born, they can weigh up to 36 kilograms (79 pounds) and reach lengths up to 122 cm (4 ft 0 in). Sexual dimorphism is extreme, with male elephant seals weighing up to 10 times more than females, and having a prominent proboscis.\nElephant seals take their name from the large proboscis of the adult male (bull), reminiscent of an elephant's trunk, and considered a secondary sexual characteristic. The bull's proboscis is used in producing extraordinarily loud roaring noises, especially during the mating season. More importantly, however, the nose acts as a sort of rebreather, filled with cavities designed to reabsorb moisture from their exhalations. This is important during the mating season when the seals do not leave the beach to feed, and must conserve body moisture as there is no incoming source of water. They are very much larger than other pinnipeds, with southern elephant seal bulls typically reaching a length of 5 m (16 ft) and a weight of 3,000 kg (7,000 lb), and are much larger than the adult females (cows), with some exceptionally large males reaching up to 6 m (20 ft) in length and weighing 4,000 kg (9,000 lb); cows typically measure about 3 m (10 ft) and 900 kg (2,000 lb). Northern elephant seal bulls reach a length of 4.3 to 4.8 m (14 to 16 ft) and the heaviest weigh about 2,500 kg (5,500 lb).\nThe northern and southern elephant seal can be distinguished by various external features. On average, the southern elephant seal tends to be larger than the northern species. Adult male elephant seals belonging to the northern species tend to have a larger proboscis, and thick chest area with a red coloration compared to the southern species. Females do not have the large proboscis and can be distinguished between species by looking at their nose characteristics. Southern females tend to have a smaller, blunt nose compared to northern females.\nExtant species distributions [ edit ]\nPhysiology [ edit ]\nSkull of a northern elephant seal\nElephant seals spend up to 80% of their lives in the ocean. They can hold their breath for more than 100 minutes \u2013 longer than any other noncetacean mammal. Elephant seals dive to 1,550 m (5,090 ft) beneath the ocean's surface (the deepest recorded dive of an elephant seal is 2,388 m (7,835 ft) by a southern elephant seal, while the record for the northern elephant seal is 1,735 m (5,692 ft)). The average depth of their dives is about 300 to 600 m (1,000 to 2,000 ft), typically for around 20 minutes for females and 60 minutes for males, as they search for their favorite foods, which are skates, rays, squid, octopuses, eels, small sharks and large fish. Their stomachs also often contain gastroliths. They spend only brief amounts of time at the surface to rest between dives (2\u20133 minutes). Females tend to dive a bit deeper due to their prey source.\nMale elephant seals fighting for mates\nElephant seals are shielded from extreme cold more by their blubber than by fur. Their hair and outer layers of skin molt in large patches. The skin has to be regrown by blood vessels reaching through the blubber. When molting occurs, the seal is susceptible to the cold, and must rest on land, in a safe place called a \"haul out\". Northern males and young adults haul out during June to July to molt; northern females and immature seals during April to May.\nElephant seals have a very large volume of blood, allowing them to hold a large amount of oxygen for use when diving. They have large sinuses in their abdomens to hold blood and can also store oxygen in their muscles with increased myoglobin concentrations in muscle. In addition, they have a larger proportion of oxygen-carrying red blood cells. These adaptations allow elephant seals to dive to such depths and remain underwater for up to two hours.\nElephant seals are able to slow down their heartbeat (bradycardia) and divert blood flow from the external areas of the body to important core organs. They can also slow down their metabolism while performing deep dives.\nElephant seals have a helpful feature in their bodies known as the countercurrent heat exchanger to help conserve energy and prevent heat loss. In this system, arteries and veins are organized in a way to maintain a constant body temperature by having the cool blood flowing to the heart warmed by blood going to external areas of the animal.\nMilk produced by elephant seals is remarkably high in milkfat compared to other mammals. After an initially lower state, it rises to over 50% milkfat (human breast milk is about 4% milkfat, and cow milk is about 3.5% milkfat).\nAdaptations [ edit ]\nElephant seals have large circular eyes that have more rods than cones to help them see in low light conditions when they are diving. These seals also possess a structure called the tapetum lucidum, which helps their vision by having light reflected back to the retina to allow more chances for photoreceptors to detect light.\nTheir body is covered in blubber, which helps them keep warm and reduce drag while they are swimming. The shape of their body also helps them maneuver well in the water, but limits their movement on land. Also, elephant seals have the ability to fast for long periods of time while breeding or molting. The turbinate process, another unique adaptation, is very beneficial when these seals are fasting, breeding, molting, or hauling out. This unique nasal structure recycles moisture when they breathe and helps prevent water loss.\nElephant seals have external whiskers called vibrissae to help them locate prey and navigate their environment. The vibrissae are connected to blood vessels, nerves, and muscles making them an important sensing tool.\nDue to evolutionary changes, their ear has been modified to work extremely well underwater. The structure of the inner ear helps amplify incoming sounds, and allows these seals to have good directional hearing due to the isolation of the inner ear. In addition to these adaptations, tissues in the ear canal allow the pressure in the ear to be adjusted while these seals perform their deep dives.\nBreeding season [ edit ]\nDominant males arrive at potential breeding sites in spring, and fast to ensure that they can mate with as many females as possible. Male elephant seals use fighting, vocal noises, and different positions to determine who will be deemed the dominant male. When males reach eight to nine years of age, they have developed a pronounced long nose, in addition to a chest shield, which is thickened skin in their chest area. They display their dominance by showing their noses, making loud vocalisations, and altering their postures. They fight each other by raising themselves and ramming each other with their chests and teeth.\nWhen females arrive, the dominating males have already selected their territory on the beach. Females cluster in groups called harems, which could consist of up to 50 females surrounding one alpha male. Outside of these groups, a beta bull is normally roaming around on the beach. The beta bull helps the alpha by preventing other males accessing the females. In return, the beta bull might have an opportunity to mate with one of the females while the alpha is occupied.\nBirth on average only takes a few minutes, and the mother and pup have a connection due to each other's unique smell and sound. The mothers will fast and nurse up to 28 days, providing their pups with rich milk. The last two to three days, however, females will be ready to mate, and the dominant males will pounce on the opportunity. Males and females lose up to a third of their body weight during the breeding season. The gestation period for females is 11 months, and the pupping seasons lasts from mid to late summer. The new pups will spend up to 10 additional weeks on land learning how to swim and dive.\nLife history [ edit ]\nThe average lifespan of a northern elephant seal is 9 years, while the average lifespan of a southern elephant seal is 21 years. Males reach maturity at five to six years, but generally do not achieve alpha status until the age of eight, with the prime breeding years being between ages 9 and 12. The longest life expectancy of a male northern elephant seal is approximately 14 years.\nFemales begin breeding at age 3\u20136, and have one pup per breeding attempt. Most adult females breed each year. Breeding success is much lower for first-time mothers relative to experienced breeders. Annual survival probability of adult females is 0.83 for experienced breeding females, but only 0.66 for first-time breeders indicating a significant cost of reproduction. More male pups are produced than female pups in years with warmer sea surface temperature in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.\nFemales and males utilize different feeding strategies in order to maximize their reproductive success. Males feed in benthic regions with more abundant food sources, but also more abundant predators. Females feed in pelagic regions where they are less likely to find prey, but also less likely to be preyed upon. They employ these different strategies because females are smaller, requiring less food, and it is also most important for them to have as many breeding seasons as possible in order to maximize reproductive success. On the other hand, males can live a riskier lifestyle in the hopes of gaining as much mass as possible, and thus being able to have one extremely successful breeding season.\nMolting [ edit ]\nOnce a year, elephant seals go through a process called molting where they shed the outer layer of hair and skin. This molting process takes up to a month to complete. When it comes time to molt, they will haul out on land to shed their outer layer, and will not consume any food during this time. The females and juveniles will molt first, followed by the sub adult males, and finally the large mature males.\nPredators [ edit ]\nThe main predator of elephant seals is the great white shark. Orcas are also another predator of elephant seals. Cookie cutter sharks can take bites from their skin.\nMilk stealing [ edit ]\nSheathbills, Skuas, Western Gulls and African feral cats have been reported to directly pilfer milk from the elephant seals' teats.\nStatus [ edit ]\nThe IUCN lists both species of elephant seal as being of least concern, although they are still threatened by entanglement in marine debris, fishery interactions, and boat collisions. Though a complete population count of elephant seals is not possible because all age classes are not ashore at the same time, a 2005 study of the California breeding stock estimated approximately 124,000 individuals. The animal is protected in most countries where it lives. In Mexico, the northern elephant seal is protected in the Guadalupe Island Biosphere Reserve where it was rediscovered after being believed to be extinct.\nGallery [ edit ]\nSouthern elephant seal\nNorthern elephant seals on Piedras Blancas beach, near San Simeon, California\nNorthern elephant seal male, female and pup\nNorthern elephant seals during molting season at Piedras Blancas beach, near San Simeon, California\nTwo northern elephant seal bulls fighting\nMale northern elephant seal snout\nJuvenile southern elephant seal\nBeachmasters, the dominant southern elephant seal bulls fighting at Macquarie Island\nNorthern elephant seals at Piedras Blancas, California\nSee also [ edit ]"}

No wonder they capture our imaginations.\nEven though Asian elephants are smaller than their African cousins, they still get up to 7-12 feet tall and weigh between 6,600 and 11,000 pounds. (The massive skull makes up 12 to 25 percent of their body weight!) Their broad feet distribute their bulk so well that elephants hardly leave any tracks when they walk.\nBecause of their large size, elephants can't reach the ground with their mouth. Natural selection solved this problem over the millennia by lengthening the animals' upper lip and nose into a trunk. The trunk is not only used for feeding, but for a host of other behaviors, including drinking, greeting, caressing, fighting, squirting water and throwing dust.\nThe well-known tusks of elephants are actually two enlarged upper teeth that grow throughout their lives. In Asian elephants, the larger tusks of the males protrude from their mouth, while the females' tusks (called \"tushes\") are so small they don't extend beyond the lip. The molars fall out at the front when they're worn, and replacement teeth move forward as the elephant ages.\nThe skin of an elephant is thick and dry, with short, stiff hairs. The skin color varies from gray to brown (though the true color is often masked by the color of the soil where they live, since they constantly throw dirt over their back as a sunscreen and insect repellent.)"}

Elephants drink between 140 and 230 litres a day on average.\nElephants love to eat peanuts\nMyth. Elephants certainly don\u2019t eat peanuts in the wild, and they\u2019re not a typical diet for captive animals either. Elephants are the world\u2019s biggest land animals and have to spend 16 to 18 hours a day eating. Peanuts, on the other hand, are tiny.\nElephants are the only mammal that can\u2019t jump\nMyth. It is true that adult elephants can\u2019t jump. But there are other mammals that can\u2019t either, like sloths, hippos and rhinos. Although, unlike elephants, hippos and rhinos can have all four feet off the ground at the same time when they run.\nElephants can \u2018hear\u2019 with their feet\nFact. Elephants have excellent hearing, but African elephants can also detect rumbles in the ground with sensory cells in their feet. An elephant will \u2018hear\u2019 these vibrations when they travel to its front feet, up its legs and shoulder bones and to its middle ear. The elephant will be able to tell where the sound is coming from by comparing the timing of the signals.\nThe elephant\u2019s closest relative is a guinea pig lookalike\nFact. The rock hyrax is a small, furry, rat-like mammal that lives in rocky landscapes across sub-Saharan Africa and along the coast of the Arab peninsula. Amazingly, elephants and rock hyraxes share several common features in the toes, teeth and skull; like two tusks, and flattened nails on the tips of their digits (as opposed to claws commonly seen on other mammals). It has been about 60 million years since their common ancestor existed.\nThe Chinese translation of \u2018ivory\u2019 is \u2018elephant tooth\u2019\nFact. Although tusks are actually the elongated incisor teeth of the elephant, they can\u2019t just \u2018fall out\u2019 like human teeth. Many people in China \u2013 where the ivory trade is booming - might not realise that elephants are brutally killed for their tusks. Polls by the International Fund for Animal Welfare found that 70 per cent of Chinese people didn\u2019t realise that ivory comes from dead elephants.\nToday, just 650,000 elephants remain on the planet, and they are in real danger of extinction.

And increasingly, they're pushing back.\nAccording to the National Geographic Channel documentary Elephant Rage, some 500 people are killed by elephant attacks each year. Such attacks are becoming increasingly common, researchers say.\n\"I do think that elephants are becoming more aggressive towards humans in very compressed areas where they are being shot at and harassed,\" said Caitlin O'Connell-Rodwell, a biologist at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.\n\"It is a difficult dilemma in areas where elephant habitat is shrinking and the human population is increasing such that poor farmers have little choice but to expand their farms to make ends meet,\" she said in a telephone interview from a Namibian field camp.\nElephants are the world's largest vegetarians. They don't attack any animal for food\u2014yet food is at the root of many elephant conflicts.\nAn adult elephant may eat over 400 pounds (180 kilograms) a day. A herd can consume an entire field in one night. Fences and other deterrents are often useless against hungry herds.\nNot only can elephants grow as large as about 13 feet (4 meters) tall and weigh as much as about 6 tons, but they can run 25 to 30 miles an hour (40 to 48 kilometers an hour).\nYet despite their size, intelligence, and speed, elephants fare worse in human-elephant confrontations. According to the Elephant Rage documentary, perhaps a thousand elephants are killed each year for their ivory or food, or because they have become a danger to humans living around them.\nOverall, elephant numbers have declined dramatically. The conservation nonprofit WWF, for example, estimated that there were about 1.3 million African elephants in 1970. By 1989 that number had slid to 600,000.\nIn some African locales, though, elephant populations are stable or growing because of preservation measures such as bans on ivory trade.\nMany protected areas, however, seem to be too small for their increasing elephant populations. As a result, officials often take steps to reduce elephant numbers through controlled hunts and other measures.\nIn some areas, including much of Asia, humans continue to invade elephant country even as animal populations are dwindling.\n\"The issue in Asia endangers the viability of [elephant] populations,\" said Tom Dillon, director of the Species Conservation program at World Wildlife Fund in Washington, D.C.\n\"The Sumatran subspecies, for example, is rapidly disappearing in large measure because [Sumatra's] forests have been cut at perhaps the fastest rate of deforestation in the world,\" he said. \"The elephants don't have anywhere to go, so they end up causing crop damage, and then they get poisoned or shot for it.\"\n\"The traditional reverence for elephants in northeast India is eroding as people are being killed or losing their livelihoods,\" Dillon added.\nElephant Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder?\nO'Connell-Rodwell, the Stanford biologist, notes that elephant aggression toward humans is unlike the aggression she's observed in elephant-to-elephant conflicts over many years in Namibia's Etosha National Park.\n\"Battles over territories rarely come to extreme violence\u2014nothing like what is happening in India, with elephants killing farmers on a very frequent basis,\" she said.\nDuring more then 30 years in Kenya, elephant researcher Joyce Poole has heard tales of elephants intentionally killing humans. Poole and Petter Granli run the Savanna Elephant Vocalization Project (SEVP), which is based in Norway and Kenya. (See \"Elephants Can Mimic Traffic, Other Noises, Study Says.\")\n\"I have always believed that these are elephants who have suffered some severe trauma at the hands of man,\" she said. \"An elephant whose family members are killed by people is unlikely to forget it very quickly\u2014just as you or I wouldn't forget if an elephant killed a member of our family.\"\nPoole and numerous colleagues have studied the disruption of complex elephant social structures. They have suggested that some animals may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) much like humans.\n\"African elephant society has been decimated by mass deaths and social breakdown from poaching, culls [systematic killing to control populations], and habitat loss. Wild elephants are displaying symptoms associated with human PTSD,\" she wrote in a study she co-authored in a February edition of the journal Nature.\n\"Much of what elephants feel, think, and do is acquired through social learning,\" Poole told National Geographic News.\n\"If a matriarch has a bad experience with people, her behavior will be adjusted accordingly\u2014either more fearful or more aggressive depending upon her own personality,\" Poole said.\n\"Other members of the family will follow her lead during moments of crisis, and younger elephants will learn how to act. Aggressive behavior toward people can be learned. Just as children learn prejudices from their parents, so, too, do elephants,\" she added.\n\"In Amboseli [Kenya] the elephants are fearful/aggressive toward Masai [people] but not toward tourists,\" she noted. \"The reason? They are regularly speared by Masai.\"\nChili Bombs and \"Flying Squads\"\nIn the fight to protect both elephants and humans, the chemical agent capsaicin, found in chili peppers, is a secret weapon. Elephants, with their very sensitive trunks, simply cannot take the heat.\nAs a stopgap measure, chili power, in the form of spicy ropes and exploding \"chili bombs,\" is proving effective at protecting fields and preventing elephant-human encounters.\nMeanwhile, Indians are employing \"flying squads\" (a term adapted from Hindi) of domestic elephants to drive their wild relatives from fields to natural habitat. \"In one area of Assam [India], during the past dry season we had 200 of these drives, and groups of 4 or 5 elephants were able to move groups of 100 to 200 wild elephants,\" WWF's Dillon explained.\nBut such measures don't address the larger problem of increasingly shrinking and balkanized elephant habitat.\n\"Elephants are being squeezed out of their traditional areas,\" said the SEVP's Poole. \"As less and less resources are available for wildlife, there will, inevitably, be conflicts. And with the current trends of rapidly increasing human population and little or no land-use planning, we can expect conflict to get worse before elephants are slowly eliminated, area by area.\"\nBut hope may lie with a different economic dynamic.\n\"In areas where communities benefit from elephant-related tourism, elephant habitat has more of a value,\" said Stanford's O'Connell-Rodwell. \"This trend should be encouraged if elephants [are to] have a hope of surviving this war over the most basic resources: food, shelter, and water.\""}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Stress and lack of exercise are killing elephants, zoos warned | Animal ...", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/dec/12/elephants-animal-welfare", "text": "Animal welfare officers yesterday urged zoos to phase out keeping elephants, after two damning reports found the animals suffer serious health problems and die much younger in captivity.\nElephants born and raised in zoos live less than half as long as those living in their native Africa and Asia, despite being protected from predators and having better care, according to one of the reports.\nMany of the deaths are thought to be linked to obesity, because the animals are well fed but get very little exercise in their small enclosures. Scientists also blamed high stress levels, which the animals suffer most after being transferred between zoos and being separated from their mothers.\nScientists called on zoos to introduce immediate health checks on elephants to identify obese and stressed animals.\nIn one study, researchers led by Ros Clubb, a wildlife scientific officer at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, analysed records of 786 Asian and African female elephants kept in European zoos between 1960 and 2005. They then compared the lifespans of the captive animals with Asian elephants used by a logging company in Burma, and African elephants living in the Amboseli national park in Kenya.\nAsian elephants born in captivity typically lived for 18.9 years, while those used as working animals in Burma survived for 41.7 years. African elephants also fared worse, living for 16.9 years in captivity and 35.9 years in the wild. When the scientists discounted African elephants killed by people in the national park, the typical lifespan reached 56 years, more than three times as long as those kept in zoos.\n\"You would expect captive elephants to live at least as long, if not longer, than those in the wild because they are better cared for, but that is not the case. The difference is massive,\" said Clubb, whose study appears in the US journal Science.\nA second report, commissioned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, examined the welfare of 77 elephants in 13 UK zoos. It found that the animals spent 83% of their time indoors and 71 were overweight. Only 11 were able to walk normally.\n\"We often hear that zoos play a vital role in conserving elephants but patently this is not the case,\" said Rob Atkinson, head of wildlife science at the RSPCA.\n\"The new data shows elephants die young in Europe's zoos, and those Asian elephants born in captivity have a poor chance of survival. Surely the way forward is to encourage conservation programmes in native habitats rather than condemn elephants to a shortened and unhealthy existence in our zoos.\"\nHe added: \"Elephants are having a torrid time in our zoos, judging by this overwhelming evidence, and action must be taken to alleviate their welfare problems as a matter of urgency.\"\nZoo enclosures for elephants are typically 60 to 100 times smaller than the smallest wild territories. African elephants can roam over 2,000 square miles, and Asian elephants 300 square miles. In captivity, researchers said, elephants are also at risk from infanticide, tuberculosis, herpes and lameness."}

They make useful fans, but also have other mechanisms that cool the elephant down in more subtle ways. Thin flaps dissipate heat fast and therefore the ears are immediately cooler than other parts of the body, but to accentuate this elephants control the volume of blood that flows through their ears via a network of blood vessels. The vessels can be dilated to increase the flow of blood to the ears and increase heat loss. It works in a similar way to a car radiator and when needed, they can pump up to 12 litres of blood through each ear every minute."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephant Evolution: Phosphatherium to the Woolly Mammoth", "url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/50-million-years-of-elephant-evolution-1093009", "text": "Thanks to a hundred years of Hollywood movies, many people are convinced that mammoths, mastodons and other prehistoric elephants lived alongside dinosaurs. In fact, these huge, lumbering beasts evolved from the tiny, mouse-sized mammals that survived the K/T Extinction 65 million years ago. And the first mammal even remotely recognizable as a primitive elephant didn't appear until five million years after the dinosaurs went kaput.\nThe Phosphatherium\nThat creature was Phosphatherium, a small, squat, pig-sized herbivore that popped up in Africa about 60 million years ago. Classified by paleontologists as the earliest known proboscid (an order of mammals distinguished by their long, flexible noses), Phosphatherium looked and behaved more like a pygmy hippopotamus than an early elephant. The giveaway was this creature's tooth structure: we know that the tusks of elephants evolved from incisors rather than canines, and Phosphatherium's choppers fit the evolutionary bill.\nThe two most notable proboscids after Phosphatherium were Phiomia and Moeritherium, which also lived in northern African swamps and woodlands circa 37-30 million years ago. The better known of the two, Moeritherium, sported a flexible upper lip and snout, as well as extended canines that (in light of future elephant developments) could be considered rudimentary tusks. Like a small hippo, Moeritherium spent most of its time half-submerged in swamps; its contemporary Phiomia was more elephant-like, weighing about half a ton and dining on terrestrial (rather than marine) vegetation.\nYet another northern African proboscid of this time was the confusingly named Palaeomastodon, which should not be confused with the Mastodon (genus name Mammut) that ruled the North American plains 20 million years later. What's important about Palaeomastodon is that it was recognizably a prehistoric elephant, demonstrating that by 35 million years ago nature had pretty much settled on the basic pachyderm body plan (thick legs, long trunk, large size and tusks).\nToward True Elephants: Deinotheres and Gomphotheres\nTwenty-five million years or so after the dinosaurs went extinct, the first proboscids appeared that could easily be discerned as prehistoric elephants. The most important of these, from an evolutionary perspective, were the gomphotheres (\"bolted mammals\"), but the most impressive were the deinotheres, typified by Deinotherium (\"terrible mammal\"). This 10-ton proboscid sported downward-curving lower tusks and was one of the largest mammals ever to roam the earth; in fact, Deinotherium may have inspired tales of \"giants\" in historical times, since it survived well into the Ice Age.\nAs terrifying as Deinotherium was, though, it represented a side branch in elephant evolution. The real action was among the gomphotheres, the odd name of which derives from their \"welded,\" shovel-like lower tusks, which were used to dig for plants in soft, swampy ground. The signature genus, Gomphotherium, was especially widespread, stomping across the lowlands of North America, Africa and Eurasia from about 15 million to 5 million years ago. Two other gomphotheres of this era--Amebelodon (\"shovel tusk\") and Platybelodon (\"flat tusk\")--had even more distinctive tusks, so much so that these elephants went extinct when the lakebeds and riverbeds where they dredged up food went dry.\nThe Difference Between Mammoths and Mastodons\nFew things in natural history are as confusing as the difference between mammoths and mastodons. Even these elephants' scientific names seem designed to befuddle kids: what we know informally as the North American Mastodon goes by the genus name Mammut, while the genus name for the Woolly Mammoth is the confusingly similar Mammuthus (both names partake of the same Greek root, meaning \"earth burrower\"). Mastodons are the more ancient of the two, evolving from gomphotheres about 20 million years ago and persisting well into historical times. As a rule, mastodons had flatter heads than mammoths, and they were also slightly smaller and bulkier. More importantly, the teeth of mastodons were well-adapted to grinding the leaves of plants, whereas mammoths grazed on grass, like modern cattle.\nMammoths emerged on the historical scene much later than mastodons, popping up in the fossil record about two million years ago and, like mastodons, surviving well into the last Ice Age (which, along with the hairy coat of the North American Mastodon, accounts for much of the confusion between these two elephants). Mammoths were slightly bigger and more widespread than mastodons, and had fatty humps on their necks, a much-needed source of nutrition in the harsh northern climates in which some species lived.\nThe Woolly Mammoth, Mammuthus primigenius, is one of the best-known of all prehistoric animals since entire specimens have been found encased in Arctic permafrost. It's not beyond the realm of possibility that scientists will one day sequence the complete genome of the Woolly Mammoth and gestate a cloned fetus in the womb of a modern elephant!\nThere is one important thing mammoths and mastodons shared in common: both of these prehistoric elephants managed to survive well into historical times (as late as 10,000 to 4,000 B.C.), and both were hunted to extinction by early humans."}

During 2011 alone, roughly one of every twelve African elephants was killed by a poacher.\nIn central Africa, the hardest-hit part of the continent, the regional elephant population has declined by 64 percent in a decade, a finding of the new study that supports another recent estimate developed from field surveys.\nThe demand for ivory, most notably in China and elsewhere in Asia, and the confusion caused by a one-time sale of confiscated ivory have helped keep black market prices high in Africa.\nThe new study, published in the August 19 issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, led by George Wittemyer of Colorado State University, included local and regional population estimates and concluded that three-quarters of local elephant populations are declining.\nThe study authors conducted the first large-scale analysis of poaching losses using data on illegally killed elephants maintained by CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora).\nWittemyer and his team hope the new information will move the discussion beyond anecdotes and wild guesses. \"I think it's the only quantitatively based estimate out there,\" he said.\nResearchers and conservationists hope the analysis will prompt policy makers to take further action to stem the years-long onslaught of poaching, which now threatens the survival of elephants in Africa.\nPrevious estimates of population declines produced by study co-authors Julian Blanc and Kenneth Burnham, both of CITES, used similar data to examine poaching trends, but those estimates limited the analysis to just 66 sites that were being monitored.\n\"Nobody's put out any scientifically-based numbers for the continent,\" Wittemyer said. \"People have said numbers, but they're based off guesses. This is the first hard estimate we have at that level.\"\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\nTargeting the Policymakers\nAlthough conservationists have agreed for years that there's an ongoing poaching crisis with huge implications for the future of African elephants, the authors point out that it's been \"notoriously difficult to quantify\" the raw number of animals killed by poachers.\nIn recent years poachers have perpetrated mass killings, such as the 2012 slaughter of hundreds of elephants with automatic weapons in Bouba Ndjidah National Park in Cameroon.\nPoachers have also used poisoned arrows to kill iconic individual elephants. In February, a poison-tipped arrow killed Torn Ear, a well-known Kenyan elephant. (See \"Mourning the Loss of a Great Elephant: Torn Ear.\") Three months later, Satao, another of Kenya's most beloved elephants, was also killed by a poisoned arrow by poachers, who cut off his face to remove his massive tusks. (See \"Beloved African Elephant Killed for Ivory\u2014'Monumental' Loss.\")\nThese criminal acts have prompted some official actions, including a U.S. ban on the commercial trade in ivory, but the killings continue at an unsustainable level, with new births unable to keep pace with the killings.\n\"At the higher policy levels there have been a lot of questions and debate about what the numbers actually are, what they indicate, and how we should be interpreting them,\" Wittemyer noted.\n\"There hasn't been a robust scientific piece to rely on definitively as the source. In my mind what we've locked down here and provided the community\u2014and in my mind we're really targeting the policymakers\u2014are definitive numbers on which they can act and on which they can discuss and debate approaches they can take.\"\n4:42\nHard-Won Numbers\nIn 2002 CITES created a program called MIKE (Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants) to attempt to quantify the number of elephants killed by poachers. Rangers at MIKE sites note all dead elephants they find and determine what proportion of the dead animals was illegally killed.\nBut the growing number of locations where monitoring is done\u2014the program now monitors between 30 and 40 percent of the population\u2014is still only a portion of the range of the species, and there are big differences in how closely these sites are monitored.\nAnother problem is that no one knows how many African elephants there are. Elephants are present over many thousands of square miles, which makes it expensive and time-consuming to estimate their overall numbers.\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\nThe most recent comprehensive population estimate for the continent\u2014a range of between 472,000 and 690,000 elephants\u2014was published in 2007 by the IUCN's African Elephant Specialist Group. That figure was based on the best available data at the time, which for some locations were already nearly a decade old.\nThe African Elephant Specialist Group continually collects updated population survey data for portions of the continent and shares them with researchers via its public database. But it has yet to produce a new comprehensive population estimate for the continent. Meanwhile, a continent-wide aerial survey, the Great Elephant Census, is under way, with results expected in mid-2015.\nModeling the Numbers\nFor their study, Wittemyer and his co-authors used the most recent population numbers available from the African Elephant Specialist Group database for well-monitored locations. The researchers calculated that in the absence of poaching, about 3 percent of an elephant population would be expected to die each year.\nApplying the percentage of deaths from poaching in 2010 through 2012, derived from MIKE data at the most closely monitored sites, they were able to calculate the percentage, and the numbers, of elephants poached regionally and continent-wide.\nKenneth Burnham, the statistician with the MIKE program who devised this method, used a similar approach to project the number National Geographic magazine used in its October 2012 cover story, \"Ivory Worship.\" The magazine reported that \"it is 'highly likely' that poachers killed at least 25,000 African elephants in 2011. The true figure may even be double that.\"\nThe new study puts the 2011 number at 40,000 elephants slaughtered at the hands of poachers.\nTrevor Jones, of the Southern Tanzania Elephant Project, who didn't participate in the study, said, \"I think this paper represents an honest attempt to interpret the MIKE data, and no doubt its results and conclusions are broadly correct in describing an overall trend of large declines in elephant populations across Africa.\"\nHe points to continued misgivings about the MIKE numbers because they are based on a smaller number of carcasses than aerial surveys. \"Aerial censuses of the Selous Game Reserve,\" Jones said, \"estimate a decline from 2009 to 2013 of 39,000 to 13,000\u2014yet the MIKE data estimate 4,931 elephants poached from 2010 to 2012.\"\nJones, like many others, is eager for the results of the forthcoming Great Elephant Census. \"The best way to update data on population sizes in most areas is by aerial sampling, and I strongly suspect that the census is going to confirm the unprecedented scale of the current crisis for elephants across the continent. Those results cannot come a day too soon.\"\nBut aerial surveying has drawbacks too. Forest elephants can't be seen from the air, and assessing their numbers takes labor-intensive foot surveys of dung piles. A recent forest elephant survey took \"80 foot-surveys; covering 13,000 km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork,\" according to the study abstract.\nWhat We Lose When We Lose Elephants\nThe huge scale of the losses of African elephants could reduce genetic diversity to the point where healthy and robust populations become dangerously weakened.\nBut, as Wittemyer said, the problem is greater than genetic diversity. \"You're talking about the distribution of species and its ecological role.\"\nElephants are vital to the web of life in Africa. As a keystone species, they help balance all the other species in their ecosystem, opening up forest land to create firebreaks and grasslands, digging to create water access for other animals, and leaving nutrients in their wake. Sometimes called the \"megagardeners of the forest,\" elephants are essential to the dispersal of seeds that maintain tree diversity.\nSince three out of four local populations are declining, those losses have serious ecological implications. \"That's a problem we probably didn't speak to strongly enough in this paper,\" Wittemyer said.\nFollow Brad Scriber on Twitter.\nRELATED"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Indian elephant - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_elephant", "text": "The most widespread subspecies of Asian elephant\nFor the species also referred to as the Indian elephant, see Asian elephant\nThe Indian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus) is one of three extant recognised subspecies of the Asian elephant and native to mainland Asia.\nSince 1986, the Asian elephant has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List as the wild population has declined by at least 50% since the 1930s to 1940s, i.e. three elephant generations. The Asian elephant is threatened by habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation.\nCharacteristics [ edit ]\nIn general, Asian elephants are smaller than African elephants and have the highest body point on the head. The tip of their trunk has one finger-like process. Their back is convex or level. Indian elephants reach a shoulder height of between 2 and 3.5 m (6.6 and 11.5 ft), weigh between 2,000 and 5,000 kg (4,400 and 11,000 lb), and have 19 pairs of ribs. Their skin colour is lighter than that of E. m. maximus with smaller patches of depigmentation, but darker than that of E. m. sumatranus. Females are usually smaller than males, and have short or no tusks.\nThe largest Indian elephant was 3.43 m (11.3 ft) high at the shoulder. In 1985, two large elephant bulls were spotted for the first time in Bardia National Park, and named Raja Gaj and Kanchha. They roamed the park area together and occasionally visited female herds. Raja Gaj stood 3.43 m (11.3 ft) tall at the shoulder and had a massive body weight. His forehead and domes were more prominent than in other Asian bull elephants. His appearance has been compared to that of a Stegodon and mammoth due to his high bi-domed shaped head.\nIndian elephants have smaller ears, but relatively broader skulls and larger trunks than African elephants. Toes are large and broad. Unlike their African cousins, their abdomen is proportionate with their body weight but the African elephant has a large abdomen as compared to the skulls.[citation needed]\nDistribution and habitat [ edit ]\nWild elephants in Munnar , Kerala\nThe Indian elephant is native to mainland Asia: India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Malay Peninsula, Laos, China, Cambodia, and Vietnam. It is regionally extinct in Pakistan. It inhabits grasslands, dry deciduous, moist deciduous, evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. In the early 1990s, the estimated wild populations included:\n2,500\u20133,200 in Thailand, mainly in the mountains along the border with Myanmar, with smaller fragmented populations occurring in the peninsula in the south;\n2,100\u20133,100 in Malaysia;\n500\u20131,000 Laos, where they remain widely but patchily distributed in forested areas, both in the highlands and lowlands;\n200\u2013250 in China, where they survive only in the prefectures of Xishuangbanna, Simao, and Lincang of southern Yunnan;\n250\u2013600 in Cambodia, where they primarily inhabit the mountains of the south-west and in Mondulkiri and Ratanakiri Provinces;\n70\u2013150 in the southern parts of Vietnam.\nElephant corridors [ edit ]\nThere are a total of 138 state elephant corridors, 28 interstate corridors and 17 international state corridors where Indian elephant populations are found. The table below enlists the corridors.\nRegion-wise Distribution of Corridors Region Number of Corridors Area (km2) Percentage of elephant population North-East 58 41,000 33% East 54 23,500 10% North 8 5,500 4% South 46 40,000 53%\nEcology and behaviour [ edit ]\nWild Indian elephants\nElephants are classified as megaherbivores and consume up to 150 kg (330 lb) of plant matter per day. They are generalist feeders, and both grazers and browsers. In a study area of 1,130 km2 (440 sq mi) in southern India, elephants were recorded to feed on 112 different plant species, most commonly of the order Malvales, and the legume, palm, sedge and true grass families. They graze on the tall grasses, but the portion consumed varies with season. When the new flush appears in April, they remove the tender blades in small clumps. Later, when grasses are higher than 0.5 m (1.6 ft), they uproot entire clumps, dust them skilfully and consume the fresh leave tops, but discard the roots. When grasses are mature in autumn, they clean and consume the succulent basal portions with the roots, and discard the fibrous blades. From the bamboos, they eat seedlings, culms and lateral shoots. During the dry season from January to April, they mainly browse on both leaves and twigs preferring the fresh foliage, and consume thorn bearing shoots of acacia species without any obvious discomfort. They feed on the bark of white thorn and other flowering plants, and consume the fruits of wood apple, tamarind, kumbhi and date palm.\nIn Nepal's Bardia National Park, elephants consume large amounts of the floodplain grass, particularly during the monsoon season. They browse more in the dry season with bark constituting a major part of their diet in the cool part of that season. During a study in a tropical moist mixed deciduous forested area of 160 km2 (62 sq mi) in Assam, elephants were observed to feed on about 20 species of grasses, plants and trees. Grasses such as Imperata cylindrica and Leersia hexandra constituted by far the most predominant component of their diet.\nThe movement and habitat utilisation patterns of an elephant population were studied in southern India during 1981\u201383 within a 1,130 km2 (440 sq mi) study area. The vegetation types of this area encompasses dry thorn forest at 250 to 400 m (820 to 1,310 ft), deciduous forest at 400 to 1,400 m (1,300 to 4,600 ft), stunted evergreen forest and grassland at 1,400 to 1,800 m (4,600 to 5,900 ft). Five different elephant clans, each consisting of between 50 and 200 individuals had home ranges of between 105 km2 (41 sq mi) and 320 km2 (120 sq mi), which overlapped. They preferred habitat where water was available and food plants were palatable. During the dry months of January to April, they congregated at high densities of up to five individuals per km2 in river valleys where browse plants had a much higher protein content than the coarse tall grasses on hill slopes. With the onset of rains in May, they dispersed over a wider area at lower densities, largely into the tall grass forests, to feed on the fresh grasses, which then had a high protein value. During the second wet season from September to December, when the tall grasses became fibrous, they moved into lower elevation short grass open forests. The normal movement pattern could be upset during years of adverse environmental conditions. However, the movement pattern of elephants in this region has not basically changed for over a century, as inferred from descriptions recorded during the 19th century.\nIn the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve three elephant clans had overall home ranges of 562 km2 (217 sq mi), 670 km2 (260 sq mi) and 799 km2 (308 sq mi) in the beginning of the 1990s. During three years of survey, their annual home ranges overlapped to a large extent with only minor shifts in the home ranges between years.\nInteraction with humans [ edit ]\nElephants have a significant role in the culture of Kerala.\nThreats [ edit ]\nA large male in Mudumalai National Park\nA calf in the Nagarhole National Park with injuries on the head indicating a possible attack by a leopard or a tiger\nIvory chopsticks\nThe pre-eminent threats to Asian elephants today are habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation, which are driven by an expanding human population, and lead in turn to increasing conflicts between humans and elephants when elephants eat or trample crops. Loss of significant extents of elephant range and suitable habitat continues; their free movement is impeded by reservoirs, hydroelectric projects and associated canals, irrigation dams, numerous pockets of cultivation and plantations, highways, railway lines, mining and industrial development.\nPoaching of elephants for ivory is a serious threat in some parts of Asia. Poaching of tuskers impacts on sex ratios that become highly female biased; genetic variation is reduced, and fecundity and recruitment may decline. Poaching has dramatically skewed adult sex ratios in the Periyar Tiger Reserve, where between 1969 and 1989 the adult male:female sex ratio changed from 1:6 to 1:122.\nElephant conservation in northern West Bengal has been set back due to high-levels of human\u2013elephant conflict and elephant mortality owing to railway accidents. The railway track between Siliguri and Alipurduar passes through 74 km (46 mi) of various forest divisions. Every day, 20 trains run on this track at high speeds. Elephants that pass through from one forest patch to another dash against the trains and die. A total of 39 dead elephants were reported during the period of 1958 to 2008, of which ten were reported killed between 2004 and 2008.\nIn Bangladesh, forested areas that served as prime elephant habitat have undergone drastic reduction, which had a severe impact on the wild elephant population. Habitat loss and fragmentation is attributed to the increasing human population and its need for fuel wood and timber. Illegal timber extraction plays a significant role in deforestation and habitat degradation. As a result of the shrinking habitat, elephants have become more and more prone to coming into direct conflict with humans.\nIn Myanmar, demand for elephant ivory for making tourist items is higher than ever before. The military government shows little interest in reducing the ivory trade, while the elephants in the country have become the silent victims. After the worldwide ivory ban, prices of raw ivory in the country skyrocketed from $76 a kilo for large tusks in 1989/90 to over $200 a kilo by the mid-1990s. Foreign tourists are responsible for the massive rise in price of ivory tusks which fuels the illegal killing of elephants. There is also a sizeable trade in ivory chopsticks and carvings, smuggled by traders from Myanmar into China.\nYoung wild-born elephants are removed from their mothers in Myanmar for use in Thailand's tourism industry. Mothers are often killed in the process, and calves are placed alongside unrelated cows to suggest they are with their mothers. The calves are often subjected to a 'breaking in' process, which may involve being tied up, confined, starved, beaten and tortured, as a result of which two-thirds may perish.\nElectrocution due to contact with electric poles and transformers has been reported as another major threat to elephants in India, with an estimated 461 elephants having been electrocuted between 2009 and 2017.\nFor disease risk, see Elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus.\nConservation [ edit ]\nElephas maximus is listed on CITES Appendix I. Project Elephant was launched in 1992 by the Government of India Ministry of Environment and Forests to provide financial and technical support of wildlife management efforts by states for their free ranging populations of wild Asian Elephants. The project aims to ensure long-term survival of viable conservation reliant populations of elephants in their natural habitats by protecting the elephants, their habitats and migration corridors. Other goals of Project Elephant are supporting research of the ecology and management of elephants, creating conservation awareness among local people, providing improved veterinary care for captive elephants.\nSee also [ edit ]\nReferences [ edit ]\nFurther reading [ edit ]"}

The scent pulled his attention skyward. There, seemingly suspended in the air, was a sprig of bamboo decorated with bits of cantaloupe and honeydew. Stretching out his trunk, he managed to get the fruit and break off a piece of the branch, but the rest of the tasty leaves remained tantalizingly out of reach. Without hesitation he marched straight to a large plastic cube in the yard, rolled it just beneath the hovering bamboo and used it as a step stool to pull the whole branch to the ground. Seven-year-old Kandula had never before interacted with a cube in this manner. Determined to satisfy his stomach and his curiosity, he did something scientists did not know elephants could do: he had an aha moment.\nA couple weeks earlier a team of researchers led by Diana Reiss and Preston Foerder, then at City University New York, had visited Kandula\u2019s home at the National Zoo in Washington D.C. They placed sticks and sturdy cubes around the yard and strung a kind of pulley system similar to a laundry line between the roof of the elephant house and a tree. From the cable they dangled fruit-tipped bamboo branches of various lengths both within and without of Kandula\u2019s reach. After preparing the aerial snacks they retreated out of sight, turned on a camera and waited to see what the young elephant would do. It took several days for Kandula to achieve his initial insight, but after that he repeatedly positioned and stood on the cube to wrap his trunk around food wherever the scientists suspended it; he learned to do the same with a tractor tire; and he even figured out how to stack giant butcher blocks to extend his reach.\nOther elephants had failed similar tests in the past. As it turns out, however, those earlier studies were not so much a failure of the elephant mind as the human one. Unlike people and chimpanzees, elephants rely far more on their exquisite senses of smell and touch than on their relatively poor vision, especially when it comes to food. Previously, researchers had offered elephants only sticks as potential tools to reach dangling or distant treats\u2014a strategy at which chimps excel. But picking up a stick blunts an elephant\u2019s sense of smell and prevents the animal from feeling and manipulating the desired morsel with the tip of its dexterous trunk. Asking an elephant to reach for a piece of food with a stick is like asking a blindfolded man to locate and open a door with his ear. \u201cWe are always looking at animals through our human lens\u2014it\u2019s hard not to,\u201d Reiss says. \u201cBut now we have an increased appreciation of diverse thinking creatures all around us because of so much research on so many species. It\u2019s fascinating to try and find ways of testing animal minds so they can show us what they are really capable of.\u201d\nPeople have been telling legends of elephant memory and intelligence for thousands of years and scientists have carefully catalogued astounding examples of elephant cleverness in the wild for many decades. In the past 10 years, however, researchers have realized that elephants are even smarter than they thought. As few as eight years ago there were almost no carefully controlled experiments showing that elephants could match chimpanzees and other brainiacs of the animal kingdom in tool use, self-awareness and tests of problem-solving. Because of recent experiments designed with the elephant\u2019s perspective in mind, scientists now have solid evidence that elephants are just as brilliant as they are big: They are adept tool users and cooperative problem solvers; they are highly empathic, comforting one another when upset; and they probably do have a sense of self.\nDespite the sharpened awareness of elephant sentience, many zoos around the world continue to maintain or expand their elephant exhibits and increasing numbers of heavily armed poachers are descending on Africa to meet the soaring demand for ivory, killing as many as 35,000 elephants a year. The U.S. recently banned ivory trade, with some exceptions, but there have been no steps toward outlawing elephant captivity. At least a few zoos are using the latest science to transform their elephant enclosures, giving the animals more room to roam as well as intellectually stimulating puzzles. Only some zoos can afford to make such changes, however, and many elephant experts maintain that, given everything we know about the creatures\u2019 mental lives, continuing to keep any of them locked up is inexcusable.\nMental mettle\nThe modern elephant mind emerged from an evolutionary history that has much in common with our own. The African bush and forest elephants, the Asian elephant, and their extinct relatives, the mammoths, all began to assume their recognizable forms between three and five million years ago in Africa. As Louis Irwin of The University of Texas at El Paso explains, both humans and elephants adapted themselves to life in Africa's forests and savannas around the same time, emigrating to Europe and Asia; both evolved to live long and often migratory lives in highly complex societies; both developed intricate systems of communication; and both experienced a dramatic increase in brain size.\nOver the years numerous observations of wild elephants suggested that the big-brained beasts were some of the most intelligent animals on the planet. They remembered the locations of water holes hundreds of kilometers apart, returning to them year after year. They fashioned twigs into switches to shoo flies and plugged drinking holes with chewed up balls of bark. They clearly formed strong social bonds and even seemed to mourn their dead (see \u201cWhen Animals Mourn\u201d in the July 2013 issue of Scientific American). Yet scientists rarely investigated this ostensibly immense intellect in carefully managed experiments. Instead, researchers looking for evidence of exceptional mental aptitude in nonhuman animals first turned to chimpanzees and, later, to brainy birds like ravens, crows and some parrots. Only in the past 10 years have scientists rigorously tested elephant cognition. Again and again these new studies have corroborated what zoologists inferred from behavior in the wild.\nScientists living among herds of wild elephants have long observed awe-inspiring cooperation between family members. Related elephant mothers and their children stay together throughout life in tight-knit clans, caring for one another\u2019s children and forming protective circles around calves when threatened by lions or poachers. Elephant clan members talk to one another with a combination of gentle chirps, thunderous trumpets and low-frequency rumbles undetectable to humans, as well as nudges, kicks and visual signals such as a tilt of the head or flap of the ear. They deliberate among themselves, make group decisions and applaud their achievements. \u201cBeing part of an elephant family is all about unity and working together for the greater good,\u201d says Joyce Poole, one of the world\u2019s foremost elephant experts and co-founder of the charity ElephantVoices, which promotes the study and ethical care of elephants. \u201cWhen they are getting ready to do a group charge, for example, they all look to one another: \u2018Are we all together? Are we ready to do this?\u2019 When they succeed, they have an enormous celebration, trumpeting, rumbling, lifting their heads high, clanking tusks together, intertwining their trunks.\u201d\nCynthia Moss, director of the Amboseli Trust for Elephants and another preeminent elephant researcher, once saw a particularly amazing example of elephant cooperation. One day the young and audacious Ebony, daughter of a matriarch named Echo, bounded right into the midst of a clan that was not her own. As a show of dominance, that clan kidnapped Ebony, keeping her captive with their trunks and legs. After failing to retrieve Ebony on their own, Echo and her eldest daughters retreated. A few minutes later they returned with all the members of their extended family, charged into the clan of kidnappers and rescued Ebony. \u201cThat took forethought, teamwork and problem-solving,\u201d Moss says. \u201cHow did Echo convey that she needed them? It's a mystery to me, but it happened.\u201d\nIn 2010 Joshua Plotnik of Mahidol University in Thailand and his colleagues tested elephant cooperation in a controlled study for the first time. At a Thai conservation center, they divided an outdoor elephant enclosure into two regions with a volleyball net. On one side stood pairs of Asian elephants. On the other side the researchers attached two bowls of corn to a table that slid back and forth on a frame of plastic pipes. They looped a hemp rope around the table so that when both ends of the rope were pulled simultaneously the table moved toward the elephants, pushing the food underneath the net. If a single elephant tried to pull the rope by him or herself, it would slip out and ruin any chance of getting the food. All the elephants quickly learned to cooperate and even to patiently wait for a partner if the scientists prevented both animals from reaching the rope at the same time. One mischievous young elephant outsmarted the rest. Instead of going through the hassle of tugging on one end of the rope, she simply stood on it and let her partner do all the hard work.\nSome scientists studying wild elephants have argued that, in addition to cooperating for survival\u2019s sake, the creatures are capable of genuine empathy. Poole recalls, for example, one elephant flinching as another stretched her trunk towards an electric fence; it was fortunately inactive at the time but had been live in the past. Elephants often refuse to leave their sick and injured behind, even if the ailing animal is not a direct relative. Poole once observed three young male elephants struggle to revive a dying matriarch, lifting her body with their tusks to get her back on her feet. Another time, while driving through Kenya\u2019s Amboseli National Park, Poole saw a female elephant give birth to a stillborn baby. The mother guarded her dead calf for two days, trying over and over to revive its limp body. Realizing that the grieving mom had not had any sustenance this whole time, Poole drove near her with an offering of water. The elephant stretched her trunk inside the car and eagerly drank her fill. When she was done, she remained with Poole for a few moments, gently touching her chest.\nWhen elephants encounter an elephant skeleton, they slow down, approach it cautiously, and caress the bones with their trunk and the bottoms of their sensitive padded feet. Elephants do not show the same interest in the remains of other species. In one experiment elephants spent twice as much time investigating an elephant skull as those of either a rhinoceros and buffalo and six times longer probing ivory than a piece of wood. Moss has witnessed elephants kicking dirt over skeletons and covering them with palm fronds.\nPlotnik and renowned animal behavior expert Frans de Waal of Emory University recently teamed up to study elephant empathy. On a monthly basis between the spring of 2008 and 2009 they observed 26 Asian elephants at the Elephant Nature Park in Thailand, looking for signs of what researchers call \u201cconsolation.\u201d Many animals are capable \u201creconciliation\u201d\u2014making up after a tussle. Far fewer animals display true consolation: when a bystander goes out of his or her way to comfort the victim of a fight or an individual that is disturbed for some reason. On dozens of occasions Plotnik and de Waal saw elephants consoling one another. A perturbed elephant often perks up its ears and tail and squeals, roars or trumpets. Over the course of the study, many elephants behaved in this way, because of an altercation, because they were spooked by something\u2014such as a helicopter or dog\u2014or for an unknown cause. When other elephants recognized these signs of anxiety, they rushed to the upset animal\u2019s side, chirping softly and stroking their fellow elephant\u2019s head and genitals. Sometimes the elephants put their trunks in one another\u2019s mouths\u2014a sign of trust because doing so risks being bitten.\nThe aspect of elephant intelligence that is the trickiest to gauge\u2014the one that has really challenged scientists to think like an elephant\u2014is self-awareness. Scientists now have preliminary evidence that elephants are indeed self-aware, overturning previous findings. To determine whether an animal has a sense of self, researchers first place a mark on an animal\u2019s body that it can identify only with the help of a mirror. Then they wait to see if the animal tries to get rid of the mark when it encounters its reflection. Doing so, the reasoning goes, means the animal understands when it is looking at itself rather than another animal. In the earliest studies on elephant self-awareness, researchers placed a one by 2.5\u2013meter mirror outside the bars of an enclosure, angled in such a way that the animals could see only the upper thirds of their bodies. The elephants reacted to the reflection as they would to another elephant, raising their trunks in greeting. When the scientists dabbed the elephants\u2019 faces with white cream, the animals failed to recognize that the marks were on their own bodies.\nBut what if the experimental design itself prevented the elephants from understanding that they were looking at themselves in the mirror? After all, elephants identify one another primarily by touch, scent and sound\u2014not sight\u2014and the animals in the study could not physically investigate the mirror. So Reiss, de Waal and Plotnik decided to redo these experiments, this time allowing the elephants to use all their senses.\nIn 2005 the trio constructed a 2.5 by 2.5\u2013meter shatterproof mirror and bolted it to a wall surrounding an elephant yard at the Bronx Zoo in New York City. Three female Asian elephants named Patty, Maxine and Happy were free to approach and inspect the sturdy mirror at their leisure. When they first encountered the contraption, Maxine and Patty swung their trunks over it and attempted to scale the wall to which it was attached, as though checking to see whether another elephant was hiding behind the glass. When they found nothing, all three elephants swayed their trunks and bobbed their heads while looking right into the mirror, just as we might wave our hands to see whether a shadow is our own. They stared at their reflection and stuck their trunks inside their mouths as though searching for snagged spinach.\nA few days later the scientists painted a white X onto the right side of each elephant\u2019s face. Maxine and Patty did not seem to notice the marks, but Happy began to touch the X on her face with her trunk after strolling past the mirror a few times. Eventually she faced her reflection and repeatedly swiped at the painted part of her face with the tip of her trunk.\nThe fact that only one of three elephants noticed the X on its face might seem a disappointing performance, but it is actually quite remarkable. Reiss points out that even in studies with chimpanzees\u2014which most researchers accept are self-aware\u2014sometimes fewer than half pass the mirror test. Plotnik argues that expecting elephants to pay attention to a random blotch on their face may not have been the best test of their self-awareness anyhow. Whereas chimpanzees are fastidious groomers that spend hours picking nits and gnats out of one another\u2019s hair, elephants stay clean by getting dirty, routinely spraying themselves with dust and dirt to deter insects and parasites. And they love to galumph in mud. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to think elephants would have same kind of vanity,\" Plotnik says.\nBrains behind bars\nAll the new evidence of elephant intelligence has intensified the debate about whether to continue keeping the creatures in captivity. Former elephant caretaker Dan Koehl maintains a thorough database of elephants around the world. He has records of 7,828 elephants currently in captivity: 1,654 in zoos or safari parks; 4,549 in \"elephant camps\" where tourists can ride the animals; 288 in circuses; and the remaining in temples, sanctuaries or private residences. The latest research on the well-being of U.S. zoo elephants is not particularly encouraging. With mny collaborators, animal welfare expert and Vistalogic, Inc., consultant Cheryl Meehan recently completed a gint study on nearly all of the 300 or so elephants in North American zoos accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). The researchers assessed the physical and mental health of captive elephants with a combination of photographs, videos, blood and hormone tests, veterinary reports, and surveys filled out by caretakers: about 75 percent of the elephants were overweight or obese; between 25 and 40 percent had foot or joint problems of some kind depending on the year; and 80 percent displayed behavioral tics, such as pacing and continual head bobbing or swaying.\nStephen Harris of the University of Bristol and his colleagues conducted a similar study on U.K. zoo elephants in the late 2000s. I asked him whether it is possible to keep an elephant physically and mentally healthy in a zoo. His answer was succinct: \u201cNo.\u201d The elephants he studied spent up to 83 percent of their time indoors, often in cramped conditions; the majority had abnormal gaits; 75 percent were overweight; more than 50 percent had behavioral tics; and one individual displayed tics for 14 hours in a single day. Captive elephants also have higher rates of infertility and die younger on average than their uncaged counterparts. Whereas wild elephants migrate great distances through the forest or savanna in search of food and water\u2014eating huge amounts of tough, fibrous grasses and shrubs that are difficult to digest\u2014zoo elephants spend too many hours standing idle on concrete and consume calorie-rich foods they would rarely encounter in their native habitat. Researchers have also learned that many zoo elephants do not get the rest they need because they do not like to lie down and sleep on stone or other hard surfaces.\nFew zoos can adequately re-create the complex social life of wild elephants. Female elephants in captivity are often strangers acquired from here and there. Any friendships that do form can dissolve in an instant when a zoo decides to relocate an animal. \u201cSometimes people treat these creatures like furniture,\u201d Moss says. Researchers used to think that male elephants, which leave their clans in young adulthood, were loners. They now know, however, that male elephants socialize extensively with one another. Yet zoos mix males and females in ways that would never occur in the wild and try to offload adult males if they become too cantankerous or lustful.\nNow that the evidence of the elephant\u2019s intellect and emotional life is no longer mostly anecdotal the zoological community faces even more pressure to answer a daunting question: Why keep elephants in captivity at all? Zoos usually give two main reasons: to rescue elephants from dire situations, such as the threat of poachers or the stress of living in so-called rehabilitation centers in Asia that keep the creatures leashed to trees; and to teach the public how amazing elephants are, in hopes of promoting their conservation.\nThese arguments have become increasingly tenuous over time. Few elephants in zoos today were rescued from an awful life; instead they were born in captivity. In the mid-2000s zoos embarked on an especially aggressive captive elephant breeding program, trying to compensate for all the animals they had lost to disease and frailty. \"For every elephant born in a zoo, on average another two die,\" concluded a comprehensive 2012 investigative report by The Seattle Times. As for educational outreach, modern technology has rendered zoos obsolete. \u201cWhen I was a kid we had no television and even when we did wildlife images were very few,\u201d Harris says. \u201cYou went to the zoo to interact with elephants, to ride on them and touch them\u2014there was no other way to get a sense of them. Now of course there\u2019s an information overload. You can get a sense of scale and see all kinds of wonderful behaviors from photography and films that you would never see in captivity.\u201d Consider how much one can learn from vivid scenes of wild elephants in a nature documentary of Planet Earth caliber compared with the experience of staring at an arthritic bobble-headed zoo elephant.\nOther scientists think that, even if there are few good reasons to keep elephants in zoos in the first place, arguing for an abrupt end to elephant captivity is naive and idealistic, especially outside North America and Europe. \u201cAlthough I believe all elephants should be wild, unfortunately that is not realistic,\" Plotnik says. In Asia, where he works, people have been using elephants as beasts of burden for centuries and currently have thousands of the animals captive in camps. Suddenly releasing all those animals is simply not feasible; there may not even be enough wild habitat left to accommodate them all. Plotnik thinks the best way forward is maintaining the wild Asian elephant population through conservation and slowly phasing out the captive one by finding new, equally lucrative jobs for elephant caretakers. Moss wants something similar for elephants in zoos in the U.S. and Europe: \u201cI would like to see them live out their lives and have no more breeding or importation.\u201d Meehan hopes the kind of information she has collected will help improve the well-being of zoo elephants.\nIn recent years at least a few zoos have been trying to use animal welfare science to make their elephant enclosures more like sanctuaries. The Oregon Zoo in Portland is close to remodeling its elephant habitat in a way it claims will improve the livelihood of its four male and four female Asian elephants. Elephant Lands, set to open in 2015, is a hilly 2.5-hectare habitat covered mostly in deep sand rather than concrete and featuring a 490,000-liter pool for wallowing, bathing and playing. Elephants will be free to roam from one part of the terrain to another, explains elephant curator Bob Lee, which should hopefully allow males and females to interact as they choose. Various feeding machines will provide elephants with food at random intervals, because studies have linked such unpredictability to healthier body weights. Other feeders will exercise the elephants\u2019 trunks and brains with out-of-reach snacks and mechanical puzzles.\nRefurbishing elephant enclosures so they are roomier and more intellectually stimulating is at once an acknowledgment and dismissal of the research on elephant intelligence and welfare. After all, if the zoos really have the animals\u2019 best interests at heart, they would close their elephant exhibits. In 2005 the Detroit Zoo became the first to give up its elephants solely on ethical grounds. Spending so much time in close quarters\u2014and waiting out the harsh Michigan winters indoors\u2014left their two Asian elephants physically and mentally ill. Wanda and Winky were moved to the Performing Animal Welfare Society's (PAWS) 930-hectare sanctuary in San Andreas, Calif. A handful of zoos have followed suit, but they are in the minority.\nEd Stewart, president and co-founder of PAWS, thinks that even his massive haven is not adequate to keep the elephants as healthy as they would be in the wild. \"Elephants should not be in captivity\u2014 period,\" he says. \"It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a zoo, a circus or a sanctuary. The social structure isn't correct, the space is not right, the climate is not right, the food is not right. You can never do enough to match the wild. They are unbelievably intelligent. With all of that brainpower\u2014to be as limited as they are in captivity\u2014it's a wonder they cope at all. In 20 years I hope we will look back and think, 'Can you believe we ever kept those animals in cages?'\""}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Why the Circus Is Saying Goodbye to Elephants - Time", "url": "https://time.com/3733447/elephants-animal-cruelty-abuse-circus/", "text": "On Thursday, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus announced they would phase out their iconic elephant acts by 2018. The decision was spurred by public concern about the treatment of elephants in circuses, and perhaps a growing understanding that being kept as an entertainment spectacle is emotionally damaging to the sensitive, intelligent animals.\nElephants are social creatures in the wild with close-knit family units. They even perform funeral rituals and spend weeks mourning their dead. So those that have long been in circuses and zoos can come to exhibit symptoms of depression, aggression or post-traumatic stress disorder, most likely as a result of the confinement and isolation.\nIn 2006, the New York Times article described the trauma elephants undergo in captivity: \u201cBeing kept in relative confinement and isolation [is] a kind of living death for an animal as socially developed and dependent as we now know elephants to be,\u201d author Charles Siebert wrote.\nThere have been many reports of elephants in captivity experiencing abuse by their handlers. In 2011, Mother Jones published a year-long investigation into Ringling Bros.\u2019 treatment of its elephants. Among its claims:\nRingling elephants spend most of their long lives either in chains or on trains, under constant threat of the bullhook, or ankus\u2014the menacing tool used to control elephants. They are lame from balancing their 8,000-pound frames on tiny tubs and from being confined in cramped spaces, sometimes for days at a time. They are afflicted with tuberculosis and herpes, potentially deadly diseases rare in the wild and linked to captivity.\nFeld Entertainment, owner of Ringling Bros, said that its elephants were in fact \u201cpampered performers\u201d who \u201care trained through positive reinforcement, a system of repetition and reward that encourages an animal to show off its innate athletic abilities.\u201d\nBut apparently Ringling is slowly coming to understand that keeping elephants in bondage, animals with a highly developed emotional intelligence, places an uncomfortable mirror on humanity. The New York Times article describes a former circus elephant who had turned violent: \u201cShe and the others have suffered, we now understand, not simply because of us, but because they are, by and large, us.\u201d\nWrite to Tessa Berenson at tessa.berenson@time.com."}

Well, these are 10 cool facts for you!\n1. Did you know some animals that eat insects actually look through poop to find insects to eat? Some types of monkeys and birds do this, for example.\n2. Picture an ant, and it\u2019s eating bird poop. Little does it know that there is a parasite that makes the ant\u2019s head look like a berry! Of course, a bird thinks it is a berry \u2014 and eats the ant! Then, the parasite starts laying eggs in the bird\u2019s dropping, and it starts all over again!\n3. Did you know lots of mammal herbivores actually eat their parents\u2019 poop? These include koalas, pandas, elephants, rats, mice and rhinos! When these animals are babies, they don\u2019t have the bacteria they need in their stomachs to digest the food, so they eat their parents\u2019 poop. (Luckily, their parents have the right bacteria!)\n4. Vultures eat rotten flesh, right? So, it must be very dirty! They found a way around that. To keep their feet clean after eating rotten flesh, they poop on their feet. Their poop has the bacteria to kill all the rotten flesh germs.\n5. What does coffee have to do with poop? I\u2019ll tell you what! The most expensive coffee is made from beans that are collected from a palm civet\u2019s poop! It\u2019s called kopi luwak. (So, think about it next time you drink that kind of coffee!)\n6. There are two types of caterpillars that disguise themselves as poop: the viceroy and the white admiral. A spider named the dung spider got its name from the same thing.\n7. Did you know there is a type of fish called the tambaqui fish that actually eats seeds and, with its poop, plants the seed? It can travel a tree seed for more than 3 miles!\n8. I\u2019ve noticed that, when I pick up my pet rats, they poop everywhere. This is because, when they\u2019re preyed on in the wild, they have a strong fight-or-flight response that can happen when humans touch them, too. They poop as a defense mechanism.\n9. Sloths normally spend all their time in trees, and you\u2019d think that, when they have to go poop, it\u2019d just go straight down. Nope! Every week, the sloth goes down from the tree and poops.\n10. There is a type of facial (a skin treatment for your face) that uses poop from nightingales! The company who makes it says it will make you look younger!\nBonus Fact! Did you know there is a bird called the double-banded courser that lives in Africa, and it disguises its eggs as poop?\nLearn more facts about animal poop by getting the book Get the Scoop on Animal Poop by Dawn Cusick.

A young dugong remains close to its mother for about 18 months, sometimes catching a ride on her broad back.\nThese languid animals make an easy target for coastal hunters, and they were long sought for their meat, oil, skin, bones, and teeth. Dugongs are now legally protected throughout their range, but their populations are still in a tenuous state.\nSome believe that dugongs were the inspiration for ancient seafaring tales of mermaids and sirens."}

Their long necks, richly patterned coats, and stubby ossicones on their heads make them the most easily recognizable of all the animals on earth.\nFast Facts: Giraffe Scientific Name: Giraffa camelopardalis\nGiraffa camelopardalis Common Name(s): Nubian giraffe, reticulated giraffe, Angolan giraffe, Kordofan giraffe, Masai giraffe, South African giraffe, West African giraffe, Rhodesian giraffe, and Rothschild's giraffe\nNubian giraffe, reticulated giraffe, Angolan giraffe, Kordofan giraffe, Masai giraffe, South African giraffe, West African giraffe, Rhodesian giraffe, and Rothschild's giraffe Basic Animal Group: Mammal\nMammal Size: 16\u201320 feet\n16\u201320 feet Weight: 1,600\u20133,000 pounds\n1,600\u20133,000 pounds Lifespan: 20\u201330 years\n20\u201330 years Diet: Herbivore\nHerbivore Habitat: Woodland and savanna Africa\nWoodland and savanna Africa Population: Unknown\nUnknown Conservation Status: Vulnerable\nDescription\nTechnically, giraffes are classified as artiodactyls, or even-toed ungulates\u2014which puts them in the same mammalian family as whales, pigs, deer, and cows, all of which evolved from a \"last common ancestor\" that probably lived sometime during the Eocene epoch, about 50 million years ago. Like most artiodactyls, giraffes are sexually dimorphic\u2014that is, males are significantly bigger than females, and the \"ossicones\" atop their heads have a slightly different appearance.\nWhen fully grown, male giraffes can attain a height of almost 20 feet\u2014most of that, of course, taken up by this mammal's elongated neck\u2014and weigh between 2,400 and 3,000 pounds. Females weigh between 1,600 and 2,600 pounds and stand about 16 feet tall. That makes the giraffe the tallest living animal on earth.\nOn the top of a giraffe's head are ossicones, unique structures that are neither horns nor ornamental bumps; rather, they're hardened bits of cartilage covered by skin and anchored firmly to the animal's skull. It's unclear what the purpose of ossicones are; they may help males to intimidate one another during mating season, they may be a sexually selected characteristic (that is, males with more impressive ossicones may be more attractive to females), or they may even help to dissipate heat in the blazing African sun.\nAnton Petrus / Getty Images\nSpecies and Subspecies\nTraditionally, all giraffes belong to the same genus and species, Giraffa camelopardalis. Naturalists have recognized nine separate subspecies: the Nubian giraffe, the reticulated giraffe, the Angolan giraffe, the Kordofan giraffe, the Masai giraffe, the South African giraffe, the West African giraffe, the Rhodesian giraffe, and Rothschild's giraffe. Most zoo giraffes are either the reticulated or Rothschild variety, which are roughly comparable in size but can be distinguished by the patterns of their coats.\nGerman ecologist Axel Janke has argued that multi-local DNA analysis of giraffe genetic structure shows that there are actually four separate giraffe species:\nNorthern giraffe (G. cameloparalis, and including Nubian and Rothschild's, with Korofan and West African as subspecies),\nReticulated giraffe (G. reticulata),\nMasai giraffe (G. tippelskirchi, now known as Rhodesian or Thornicroft's giraffe), and\nSouthern giraffe (G. giraffa, with two subspecies the Angolan and South African giraffes).\nThese suggestions are not accepted by all scholars.\nHabitat\nGiraffes range in the wild throughout Africa, but are most often found are in combined savannas and woodlands. They are social creatures who mostly live in one of two types of herds: adult females and their offspring, and bachelor herds. There are also isolates, male bulls who live alone.\nThe most common herd is made up of adult females and their calves, and a few males\u2014these are typically between 10 and 20 individuals, although some can grow as large as 50. Typically, such herds are egalitarian, with no clear leaders or pecking order. Studies show that giraffe cows stay with the same group at least as long as six years.\nYoung bachelor males who are old enough to fend for themselves form temporary herds of between 10 and 20, essentially training camps in which they play and challenge each other before leaving the group to become isolates. They practice what adult males do during mating season, for instance: male giraffes will engage in \"necking,\" in which two combatants jostle one another and attempt to land blows with their ossicones.\nYann Arthus-Bertrand / Getty Images\nDiet and Behavior\nGiraffes subsist on a variable vegetarian diet that includes leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. Like camels, they don't need to drink on a daily basis. They have a diverse diet which can include as much as 93 different species of plants; but typically, only about a half dozen of those plants make up 75 percent of their summer diets. The main plant varies between members of the Acacia tree; giraffes are the only predator for acacia trees over 10 feet tall.\nGiraffes are ruminants, mammals equipped with specialized stomachs that \"pre-digest\" their food; they're constantly chewing their \"cud,\" a mass of semi-digested food ejected from their stomach and in need of further breakdown.\nHerds forage together. Each adult giraffe weighs about 1,700 pounds and needs as much as 75 pounds of plants each day. Herds have a home range that averages about 100 square miles, and the herds intersect, sharing one another's ranges without a social issue.\nPal Teravagimov Photography/Getty Images\nReproduction and Offspring\nGranted, very few animals (other than humans) tend to linger in the act of mating, but at least giraffes have a good reason to rush. During copulation, male giraffes stand almost straight up on their hind legs, resting their front legs along the female's flanks, an awkward posture that would be unsustainable for more than a few minutes. Interestingly, giraffe sex can provide clues about how dinosaurs like Apatosaurus and Diplodocus had sex\u2014doubtless equally quickly, and with roughly the same posture.\nThe gestation period for giraffes is approximately 15 months. At birth, calves are about five and a half feet tall, and at about one-year-old, they are 10.5 feet tall. Giraffes are weaned at 15\u201318 months, although some suckle up to 22 months of age. Sexual maturation occurs about 5 years of age, and females generally have their first calves at 5\u20136 years.\nbrytta/Getty Images\nThreats\nOnce a giraffe has reached its adult size, it's extremely unusual for it to be attacked, much less killed, by lions or hyenas; instead, these predators will target juvenile, sick, or aged individuals. However, an insufficiently wary giraffe can easily be ambushed at a water hole, since it has to adopt an ungainly posture when taking a drink. Nile crocodiles have been known to chomp on the necks of full-grown giraffes, drag them into the water, and feast at leisure on their copious carcasses.\nBirdImages / Getty Images\nConservation Status\nGiraffes are classed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), because of ongoing habitat loss (deforestation, land use conversion, expansion of agriculture and human population growth), civil unrest (ethnic violence, rebel militias, paramilitary and military operations), illegal hunting (poaching), and ecological changes (climate change, mining activity).\nIn some countries in southern Africa, hunting giraffes is legal, especially where populations are increasing. In other countries, such as Tanzania, poaching is associated with declines."}

The fact is, though, that the vast majority of animals on earth\u2014insects, crustaceans, sponges, etc.\u2014lack backbones, and are thus classified as invertebrates.\nThere Are Six Basic Invertebrate Groups iStockphoto The millions of invertebrate animals on our planet are assigned to six main groups: arthropods (insects, spiders and crustaceans); cnidarians (jellyfish, corals and sea anemones); echinoderms (starfish, sea cucumbers and sea urchins); mollusks (snails, slugs, squids and octopuses); segmented worms (earthworms and leeches); and sponges. Of course, the variation within each of these groups is so wide\u2014scientists who study insects aren't much interested in horseshoe crabs\u2014that professionals tend to focus on specific invertebrate families or species.\nInvertebrates Do Not Have Skeletons or Backbones Christopher Murray / EyeEm / Getty Images Whereas vertebrates are characterized by the vertebrae, or backbones, running down their backs, invertebrates completely lack this feature. But this isn't to imply that all vertebrates are soft and squishy, like worms and sponges: insects and crustaceans support their bodily structures with hard external structures, called exoskeletons, while sea anemones possess \"hydrostatic\" skeletons, sheets of muscle supported by an internal cavity filled with fluid. Bear in mind, however, not having a backbone doesn't necessarily mean not having a nervous system; mollusks, and arthropods, for example, are equipped with neurons.\nThe First Invertebrates Evolved a Billion Years Ago up close with nature / Getty Images The earliest invertebrates were composed entirely of soft tissues: 600 million years ago, evolution had yet to hit on the idea of incorporating ocean minerals into exoskeletons. The extreme age of these organisms, combined with the fact that soft tissues were almost never preserved in the fossil record, leads to a frustrating conundrum: paleontologists know that the earliest preserved invertebrates, the ediacarans, must have had ancestors stretching back hundreds of millions of years, but there's no way to adduce any hard evidence. Still, many scientists believe that the first multicellular invertebrates appeared on earth as far back as a billion years ago.\nInvertebrates Account for 97 Percent of All Animal Species Chris Stein / Getty Images Species for species, if not pound for pound, invertebrates are the most numerous and widely varied animals on earth. Just to put things in perspective, there are about 5,000 mammal species and 10,000 bird species; among invertebrates, insects alone account for at least a million species (and possibly an order of magnitude more). Here are some more numbers, in case you're not convinced: there are about 100,000 species of mollusks, 75,000 species of arachnids, and 10,000 species each of sponges and cnidarians (which, by themselves, pretty much outclass all the earth's vertebrate animals).\nMost Invertebrates Undergo Metamorphosis www.victoriawlaka.com / Getty Images Once they hatch out of their eggs, the young of most vertebrate animals look just like the adults: all that follows is a more-or-less steady period of growth, That's not the case with most invertebrates, whose life cycles are punctuated by periods of metamorphosis, in which the full-grown organism winds up looking very different from the juvenile. The classic example of this phenomenon is the transformation of caterpillars into butterflies, via the intermediate stage of the chrysalis. (By the way, one group of vertebrates, the amphibians, do undergo metamorphosis; witness the transformation of tadpoles into frogs.)\nSome Invertebrate Species Form Large Colonies Inigo Cia / Getty Images Colonies are groups of animals of the same species that remain together throughout most of their life cycle; members divide up the work of feeding, reproducing, and sheltering from predators. Invertebrate colonies are most common in marine habitats, and the individuals are joined to the extent that the entire aggregation can seem like one giant organism. Marine invertebrate colonies include corals, hydrozoans, and sea squirts. On land, the members of invertebrate colonies are autonomous, but still joined together in complex social systems; the most familiar colony-forming insects are bees, ants, termites, and wasps.\nSponges Are the Simplest Invertebrates Global_Pics / Getty Images Among the least evolved invertebrates on the planet, sponges technically qualify as animals (they're multicellular and produce sperm cells), but they lack differentiated tissues and organs, have asymmetrical bodies, and they're also sessile (rooted firmly to rocks or the seafloor) rather than motile (capable of movement). As for the most advanced invertebrates on the planet, you can make a good case for octopuses and squids, which possess large and complex eyes, a talent for camouflage, and widely diffused (but well-integrated) nervous systems.\nVirtually All Parasites Are Invertebrates NNehring / Getty Images In order to be an effective parasite\u2014that is, an organism that exploits the life processes of another organism, either weakening or killing it in the process\u2014you have to be small enough to climb into that other animal's body. That, in a nutshell, explains why the vast majority of parasites are invertebrates\u2014lice, roundworms, and nematodes are sufficiently tiny to infest specific organs in their unfortunate hosts. (Some of the smallest parasites, like amoebas, aren't technically invertebrates, but belong to a family of single-celled animals called protozoans or protists.)\nInvertebrates Have Widely Varied Diets Michael Layefsky / Getty Images Just as there are herbivorous, carnivorous and omnivorous vertebrate animals, the same range of diets is enjoyed by invertebrates: spiders eat other insects, sponges filter small microorganisms from the water, and leaf-cutter ants import specific types of vegetation into their nests so they can cultivate their favorite fungus. Less appetizingly, invertebrates are also crucial for breaking down the carcasses of larger vertebrate animals after they die, which is why you'll often see the corpses of small birds or squirrels covered by thousands of ants and other icky bugs."}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Woolly Mammoth - Animals", "url": "https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/prehistoric/facts/woolly-mammoth", "text": "If you stepped outside 20,000 years ago, you\u2019d probably need a winter coat, even in summer. That\u2019s because Earth was experiencing an ice age\u2014a time when sheets of ice covered large parts of North America, Europe, and Asia. It was also a time when humans lived alongside a now-extinct group of elephants called mammoths.\nAncient elephant\nOne species, called woolly mammoths, roamed the cold tundra of Europe, Asia, and North America from about 300,000 years ago up until about 10,000 years ago. (But the last known group of woolly mammoths survived until about 1650 B.C.\u2014that\u2019s over a thousand years after the Pyramids at Giza were built!)\nThese animals grazed on plants, using their 15-foot-long tusks to dig under snow for food like shrubs and grasses. Like today\u2019s elephants, woolly mammoths likely gave birth to one calf at a time, and the females and their young roamed in herds of about 15 individuals. Male mammoths would leave the herd at about age 10.\nSnow ready\nWoolly mammoths were probably about the size of African elephants, around 13 feet tall. But woolly mammoths had much smaller ears, which kept them from losing body heat. They were also covered in two layers of fur\u2014the shaggy outer layer could be 20 inches long and helped them stay toasty in temperatures as low as minus 58\u00b0F. Woolly mammoths also had a lump on their back, which scientists think were fat stores that provided energy when food was scarce, sort of like a camel\u2019s hump.\nScientists aren\u2019t sure exactly why woolly mammoths went extinct: Some think that humans hunted too many of them, and others believe that they couldn\u2019t survive Earth\u2019s naturally warming climate. Or, it could\u2019ve been a combination of both."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "10 Amazing Animal Heart Facts - NC State Veterinary Medicine", "url": "https://cvm.ncsu.edu/10-amazing-animal-heart-facts/", "text": "They can be as big as a piano or too small to see without a microscope. They may beat as much as 1,000 \u2014 or as little as six \u2014 times a minute.\nThey are animal hearts and they\u2019re extraordinary.\nYes, the human heart is pretty astonishing, too. The thing has its electrical impulse, so with enough oxygen it can beat when outside of the body.\nBut then again, we just have one of them. The octopus has three. And it just gets more amazing from there.\nBeat It\nThe cheetah is one of the fastest land animals, but its resting heart beat is about 120 beats per minute, similar to a jogging human. Here\u2019s the difference: While it takes some time for a human heart to reach its limit, usually 220 BPM, the cheetah can go up to 250 BPM in just a few seconds.\nReally Beat It\nThe cheetah has a bit of competition, however, with the Etruscan shrew. The smallest known mammal by mass, the Etruscan shrew weighs in at under 2 grams and has a 25 beats per second heart rate. That\u2019s a 1,500 BPM. It\u2019s also kind of cute.\nSizing It Up\nThe human heart is about the size of a fist \u2014 and a cow\u2019s heart is the size of a human head. The largest animal heart is the blue whale\u2019s, which has been weighed at about 400 pounds (and it is not the size of a small car, contrary to popular belief).\nBut the animal with the largest heart-to-body-mass ratio is somewhat surprising: the dog. Compare a dog\u2019s heart to its body mass and it\u2019s a .8 percent ratio. Almost all other animals \u2014 including elephants, mice and humans \u2014 have a .6 percent ratio. Another animal with a ratio larger than most mammals is the dog\u2019s ancestor, the wolf.\nSizing it down\nThe smallest animal hearts belong to the .006-inch long fairyflies. You need a microscope to see its heart, which is a tube running along its back. A new species of fairyfly found in Costa Rica is named Tinkerbella nana.\nRoom for Growth\nThe tropical, freshwater zebrafish is a popular aquarium addition, but it\u2019s the animal\u2019s heart that deserves the most attention. It has amazing regenerative properties, quickly closing injuries and mending itself back to almost full function.\nThat\u2019s why researchers study the zebrafish to uncover possible treatments for heart failure and other cardiac injuries. At the CVM, the zebrafish is helping us unlock some of the mysteries of the human immune system.\nTriple Play\nHuman hearts, like those of all mammals, as well as birds, have four chambers. The heart\u2019s \u201cthump-thump\u201d sound is the four valves opening and closing as they pump blood. But frog hearts have three chambers \u2014 two atria and one ventricle (you can actually see how it works in a glass frog).\nA Little Help\nActually, all reptiles have three-chambered hearts with one exception. Crocodilian hearts have four chambers, but unlike mammals they have an extra flap that can close to keep blood from going to the lungs. Researchers believe the blood can be sent to the stomach to aid digestion, which is just a smidge helpful when bones are often on the menu.\nDive right in\nMany animals decrease their heart rate while diving into water. An emperor penguin\u2019s heart rate dips 15 percent from its resting rate when diving and drops even more during long dives (in between dives it jumps rapidly, likely to replenish tissues with oxygen). A manatee heart rate cuts by half while on a long dive and seals decrease their heart rate from 50 to 80 percent while diving. By the way, seals eat squids, which, like octopuses, have three hearts.\nComing Up Empty\nThere are also numerous animals with no hearts at all, including starfish, sea cucumbers and coral. Jellyfish can grow quite large, but they also don\u2019t have hearts. Or brains. Or central nervous systems. It\u2019s working for them, though. They\u2019ve been around at least 500 million years.\nHow \u2026 cute?\nPairs of dragonflies and damselflies (damselflies are different than dragonflies and, yes, that\u2019s what they\u2019re called) form heart shapes when mating. The male grabs the female behind its head and the female \u2026 uh, how about we just show you a photo?\nSources: The Central Florida Zoo; National Park Service; National Wildlife Federation; Journal of Experimental Biology; National Science Foundation\n~Jordan Bartel/NC State Veterinary Medicine"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Amazing facts about Aardvarks | OneKindPlanet Animal Education & Facts", "url": "https://onekindplanet.org/animal/aardvark/", "text": "Amazing Facts About the Aardvark\nAardvarks are tough mammals that live throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. They can eat 50,000 ants in a night and are brilliantly adapted to digging with their spade-shaped feet. Aardvarks are a vital part of the ecosystem as they are prey for many species, and their old burrows provide homes for other animals such as African Wild Dogs.\nWhere does the name Aardvark come from?\nThe name Aardvark comes from South Africa\u2019s Afrikaans language and means \u2018earth pig\u2019 or \u2018ground pig\u2019. Aardvarks are also known as \u2018antbears\u2019, \u2018anteaters\u2019, \u2018Cape anteater\u2019 and \u2018earth hogs\u2019.\nWhat do Aardvarks look like?\nAardvarks are distinctive looking animals with a pig like an appearance.\nThey have a stout body with an arched back, long thin head and neck and long tubular ears that are usually held upright but can be folded down. The hind legs are longer than the front ones, and they have powerful spade shaped feet and claws that are perfect for digging.\nAardvarks are pale yellowish-grey in colour with short fur on the head and tail and long fur on the legs. Their tails are muscular, cone-shaped and approximately 70 cm (28 in) in length.\nWhere do Aardvarks live?\nAardvarks are found in a wide variety of habitats in Sub-Saharan Africa, which is the part of Africa below the Saharan desert. They favour areas with ample supplies of ants and termites such as savannas, grasslands, woodlands and bushland but tend to avoid rocky or swamp areas, as they are less suited to digging.\nAardvarks are nocturnal, sleeping in underground burrows during the day and coming out at night to feed. When breeding, burrows can be extensive networks of over 10 m (33 ft) in length and with multiple entrances. The layout of the burrow can be altered frequently, and it is not unusual for aardvarks to leave borrows and move on to new homes.\nWhat happens to abandoned Aardvark burrows?\nOld aardvark burrows are good for the ecosystem as they often inhabited by smaller animals like the African Wild Dog.\nWhat do Aardvarks eat?\nAardvarks feed almost exclusively on ants and termites and are known to eat around 50,000 in one night. They can eat plants and often feed on an African cucumber known as the aardvark cucumber. The relationship between aardvarks and aardvark cucumbers is symbiotic, meaning both species benefit. The aardvark gets a source of food, and the cucumber benefits as the seeds are released into the environment when the aardvark defecates.\nAfter sunset, they leave their cool burrows and forage over many kilometres in grasslands and forests for their favourite food, termites, swinging their long nose from side to side to pick up the termites\u2019 scent.\nHow are Aardvarks adapted to eating insects in the soil?\nAs well as their powerful feet and claws that aid in digging, aardvarks have sticky wormlike tongues that can be up to 30.5 cm (12 in) long. Their hair is thick around the nostrils, which acts to filter dirt when eating, and the nostrils can be closed fully to prevent dirt getting in.\nDo Aardvarks get bitten by termites?\nAardvarks feed on termites, which do bite them, but aardvarks have tough skin which protects them.\nWhat predators do Aardvarks have?\nAardvarks are prey to many animals including lions, leopards, hunting dogs, hyenas, and pythons.\nAardvarks have a keen sense of hearing that enables them to detect approaching predators. If they need to escape, they can dig fast or run in zigzags. If not, they can strike with their claws, tail and shoulders, and have been known to flip onto their backs and lash out with all fours.\nIf attacked in the tunnel, aardvarks can seal the tunnel off behind them or turn around and attack with their claws.\nWhen do Aardvarks give birth to cubs?\nAardvarks are solitary and only come together to mate; females have a gestation period of seven months. One cub is born between May and July and will remain in the burrow for the first two weeks of life. Cubs start eating termites at around nine weeks of age, and start digging burrows at six months, but remain with the mother until the following mating season.\nWhat are the greatest threats to Aardvarks?\nAardvarks are listed as least concern by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\nThe extent of threats is mostly unknown, and no particular conservation measures are in place currently. Potential threats include the bushmeat trade, subsistence hunting and habitat loss due to agriculture."}

(put an X over NOT, so it says do feed the elephant) Glue it into the elephant\u2019s hands. The peanuts that you cut out can be \u201cfed\u201d to the elephant and fall into the bag.\nStand Up Elephant\nFold a 9 x 12 gray construction paper to form a 6 x 4 1/2 rectangle. Cut a half circle from the open edges to form legs and a body. Save the scraps to make ears later. Clip on the fold to make a slot for the head. Cut a circle from a 6\u2033 square of gray paper for the head. Add the half circle scraps for ears. Trim them up if you need to. Add a 1 X 6 strip for the trunk. You can roll it on a pencil to make it curl up. Put the head in the slot on the back. Use a gray scrap for a tail. Draw on eyes or glue on wiggly eyes. Stand up your elephant and give him/her a name.\nEdible Peanutty Play dough\n1/4 cup. peanut butter\n1/2 cup. dry milk\n1/2 tbs. honey\nKnead all ingredients in a zip lock bag. Use the dough to make edible sculptures (even peanut-loving elephants!). You can even decorate the sculptures with raisins or candies. A fun activity and a yummy snack.\nArt\nEncourage children to paint elephants. Fold 2\u2033x18\u2033 strip of gray construction paper accordion style to make an elephant trunk.\nElephant Film Canister Finger Puppet\n1. Remove the lid from a 35 mm plastic film canister.\n2. Glue gray paper around the sides and a paper circle on the bottom of the canister. Add eyes and trunk by gluing to the circle (trunk can be fan folded to make 3 D).\n3. Cut ears and glue to sides (close to front circle edge ). Add a tail to the back top.\n4. Place tissue inside the canister to help your finger fit snugly.\nElephant Masks\nMaterials:\nlarge paper plates, pantyhose (stockings), markers or crayons, newspaper or packing peanuts, elastic\nTake large paper plate and cut a hole in the middle. Cut one leg of a pair of panty hose and fill it with scrunched up newspaper or packing peanuts. Pull the opened end through the hole in the paper plate and knot it. Decorate the rest of the elephant mask with ears, eyes and mouth. You could use elastic on the back to hold the mask on.\nElephant Games and Activities\nWhat Shape Is An Elephant?\nGive a child a sheet of construction paper and tell them they will have to tear 6 shapes from this.\n1. The largest shape needs to be a square.\n2. Next tear a triangle about half the size of the square.\n3. Tear 4 rectangles all the same size.\n4. Put the shapes together to make an elephant that looks like he is walking.\n5. Add details with felt pen (eyes, wiggly lines for wrinkle skin, a tail)\nThe Elephants Are Here!\nA movement song to the tune of \u201cThe Farmer in the Dell\u201d\nThe elephants are here! (Look excited)\nThe elephants are here!\nLook at all the elephants! (Shade eyes as if looking)\nThe elephants are here!\nThey\u2019re exercising now.

If old enough have the children hold hands putting their \u201ctrunk\u201d between their legs. For little ones you can just have them hold hands, and not bend over. Do this until all the kids are called and walking back and forth holding hands.\nElephant Recipes and Snacks\nBaked Elephant Ears\nHow do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time! Start with this snack that\u2019s shaped like an elephant ear.\nYou will need:\n1 stick of pie crust mix\nMedium mixing bowl\nMeasuring spoons\nHot water\nFork\nWood board\nAll-purpose flour\nBaking sheet\n2 tablespoons sugar\n2 tablespoons ground cinnamon\nShaker or spoon\n1. Have adult break pie crust into little pieces in the bowl. Add 3 tablespoons of hot water. Mix with fork till the dough sticks together.\n2. Sprinkle the wood board with flour. Pat your hands with flour. Form the dough into a big ball on the board and divide into 4 parts. Form each part into a ball.\nTo make elephant ears, use your whole hand to flatten each ball. Press hard so that the dough gets thinner. It should be about 1/4 inch thick.\n3. Place each piece of dough onto an ungreased baking sheet. Mix sugar and cinnamon. Place in shaker. Sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar topping on your elephant ears. Be careful not to get the sugar on the baking sheet.\n4. Have adult bake at 350\u00ba for 20 minutes or until golden brown.

What about that snoozing lion cub at the zoo? As it turns out, many of our favorite animals aren't so different from us when it comes to sleep.\nScientists are still on the fence about how certain animals catch their z's. Sleep in human beings still isn't completely understood, which is pretty wild considering we spend a full third of our lives sleeping or trying to do so. The human race's need for sleep isn't up for debate\u2014it's universally accepted that we need sleep to survive\u2014but our biological purpose for doing so has remained somewhat of a mystery. The act of sleep affects almost every part of the human body, from the brain, heart, and lungs to the metabolism, immune system, and mood. Even more importantly, a lack of sleep or poor sleep quality can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and even depression.\nA common question regarding non-human animals and sleep is the presence of dreams. Humans spend about two hours a night dreaming even if we can't remember most, or anything, about those dreams. Many researchers believe dreams exist to help us process our emotions; however, the purpose of dreaming remains a mystery.\nWhen it comes to sleep in animals, needs range greatly between different species. Like humans, sleep among all mammals is necessary for survival and some have adapted unique habits and gone to incredible evolutionary lengths to avoid becoming susceptible to predators while resting.\nThe animal kingdom is full of unbelievable sleeping tendencies, from the slightly off-putting hibernation habits of frozen frogs to the cuddly approach to napping taken by baby otters. Stacker researched 30 different fascinating sleep habits of the world's most interesting animals using journalistic research papers, news articles, and more to give our readers a better understanding of the world of animals and sleep.\nYou may also like: What marriage was like the year you were born"}

A giraffe\u2019s front legs can be 10% longer than their back legs!\nFor more interesting facts and information on giraffes, keep reading or alternatively download our comprehensive worksheet pack to utilize within the classroom or home environment.\nGiraffe Facts\nThe giraffe is a tall hoofed mammal endemic to Africa\nIt belongs to the genus Giraffa .\nIt is the tallest living terrestrial animal.\nIt is also the largest ruminant (an even-toed mammal that chews regurgitated cud) on Earth.\nGiraffes require the least amount of sleep of any animal. They only need between 10 minutes and 2 hours of sleep a day.\nGiraffes are normally quiet animals. However, they do cough, whistle, bellow, moo, grunt, snort, and hiss.\nThe giraffe is easily identifiable by its very long neck and legs, its tan and white spotted pattern, and distinctive horn-like structures on its head called ossicones.\nIt is classified under the family Giraffidae , which also includes its relative from Central Africa \u2013 the forest-dwelling okapi\nThere are four subspecies, namely the Masai, reticulated, Rothschild, and Nubian.\nThe giraffe has a large range and can be found throughout Africa in countries like South Africa in the south, Somalia in the east, Niger in the west, and Chad in the north.\nleopards, Even though they\u2019re very big animals, they are still vulnerable to predators like lions wild dogs , and hyenas\nGiraffes are found in numerous game reserves and national parks and in many zoos around the world.\nAppearance\nAn adult giraffe stands between 14.1-18.7 feet tall (4.3\u20135.7 m). Males are generally taller than females.\nGiraffes are heavy animals. On average, an adult male weighs around 2,628 lb (1,192 kg), and 1,825 lb (828 kg) for an adult female.\nDespite its long neck and legs, a giraffe\u2019s body is relatively short.\nThe skin is mostly gray, or tan with a thickness of 20 mm (0.79 in).\nThe giraffe coat has dark blotches or patches, which can be orange, brown, chestnut, or nearly black, separated by lighter, cream-colored hair.\nEach giraffe has a unique coat pattern and the spots on each giraffe are very distinct, much like our fingerprints.\nMale giraffes become darker as they age.\nThe tail is between 80\u2013100 centimeters (31\u201339 in) long and ends in a long, dark tuft of hair which is used as a defense against insects.\nCalves inherit some coat pattern traits from their mothers.\nHead\nBoth sexes have prominent horn-like structures called ossicones, formed from cartilage, and covered in skin. The ossicones of females and young giraffes are thin and display tufts of hair on top, whereas those of adult males end in knobs and tend to be bald on top from rubbing and fighting.\nAs males age, their skulls become heavier and more club-like, helping them become more dominant in fights with other males. The animal can tilt its head straight up and grab food on the branches above with the tongue.\nGiraffe\u2019s eyes are located on both sides of the head, giving it good eyesight and a wide field of vision from its great height. The eye is large with a big retinal surface area. Giraffes\u2019 senses of hearing and smell are also sharp.\nThe giraffe\u2019s black tongue is prehensile and about 45 cm (18 in) long. It is useful for grasping foliage, and delicately removing leaves from branches.\nThe upper jaw lacks front teeth.\nNeck\nThe giraffe has an extremely elongated neck, which can be up to 2.4 m (7.9 ft) in length.\nAlong the neck is a mane made of short, erect hairs.\nThe neck typically rests at an angle of 50\u201360 degrees, though juveniles have straighter necks and rest at 70 degrees.\nEach cervical vertebra is over 28 cm (11 in) long, resulting in a very long neck.\nThe giraffe\u2019s head and neck are held up by large muscles which are anchored by long dorsal spines.\nGiraffes perform a behavior called necking. Necking duels occur when males fight.\nGiraffes also use their necks to show affection toward another giraffe.\nLegs\nA giraffe\u2019s long front and back legs are about the same length.\nThe hooves of large male giraffes reach a diameter of 31 cm \u00d7 23 cm (12.2 in \u00d7 9.1 in).\nA giraffe has only two gaits; walking and galloping. Walking is done by moving the legs on one side of the body, then doing the same on the other side. When galloping, the hind legs move around the front legs before the latter move forward, and the tail will often curl up.\nThe giraffe can reach a sprint speed of up to 60 km/h (37 mph), and can sustain 50 km/h (31 mph) for several kilometers.\nA giraffe rests by lying with its body on top of its folded legs. To lie down, the animal kneels on its front legs and then lowers the rest of its body. To get back up, it first gets on its front knees and shifts hindquarters onto its back feet. It then moves from kneeling to standing on its front legs and pulls the rest of its body upwards, swinging its head for balance.\nWhen the giraffe wants to bend down to drink, it either spreads its front legs or bends its knees.\nFeeding and Habitat\nGiraffes usually inhabit savannahs and open woodlands.\nGiraffes browse on the twigs of trees, preferring those of the subfamily Acacieae, important sources of calcium and protein to sustain the giraffe\u2019s growth rate.\nThey also feed on shrubs, grass, and fruit.\nA giraffe eats around 34 kg (75 lb) of foliage daily.\nAs a ruminate, the giraffe first chews its food, then swallows it for processing, and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again.\nGiraffes have a great effect on the trees that they feed on, delaying the growth of young trees for some years and giving \u201cwaistlines\u201d to too tall trees.\nReproduction and Care of Young\nFemales can reproduce throughout the year.\nMale giraffes assess female fertility by tasting the female\u2019s urine to detect oestrus.\nGiraffe gestation lasts 400\u2013460 days, after which a single calf is normally born, although twins occur on rare occasions.\nA newborn giraffe is 1.7\u20132 m (5.6\u20136.6 ft) tall.\nWithin a few hours of birth, the calf can run around.\nMothers with calves will gather in nursery herds, moving or browsing together.\nCalves may be weaned at six to eight months old but can remain with their mothers for up to 14 months.\nFemales become sexually mature when they are four years old, while males become mature at four or five years.\nRelationship with Humans\nWith its long neck and legs, and spotted coat, the giraffe has fascinated humans throughout history. For some cultures, the giraffe symbolizes flexibility, far-sightedness, femininity, fragility, passivity, grace, and beauty.\nGiraffes were depicted in art throughout the African continent.\nThe Kiffians were responsible for a life-size rock engraving of two giraffes, dated 8,000 years ago, that has been called the \u201cworld\u2019s largest rock art petroglyph.\u201d\nHow the giraffe got its height has been the subject of various African folktales.\nIn literature, Roald Dahl\u2019s The Giraffe and Pelly and Me published in 1985, the giraffe has a magical extendable neck.\nGiraffes have been kept in captivity since the ancient Egyptians and were often kept and displayed by wealthy Romans.\nThroughout human history, giraffes have been hunted for meat, their skin, traditional medicine, and for sport.\nGiraffes are listed as vulnerable because of habitat destruction, droughts, human encroachment, and hunting for bushmeat.\nGiraffe Worksheets\nThis bundle contains 9 ready-to-use Giraffe Worksheets that are perfect for students who want to learn more about giraffes, the tallest of all land animals, and are even-toed ungulates from the same family as the camel.\nDownload includes the following worksheets\nGiraffe Facts\nQuick Quiz\nGiraffe Basics \u2013 Color Giraffe\nExternal Anatomy\nSub-nine\nTaller than.. \u2013 Compare and Contrast\nSivatherium \u2013 Siva-drawn\nGir-activities \u2013 Sentence Acrostics\nSpeak Giraffe\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is a baby giraffe called?\nA baby giraffe is called a calf.\nWhat is a group of giraffes called?\nA tower is the collective noun for giraffes.

Activities are focused on both the African and Asian species of elephants in U.S. zoos, as well as managed populations in Southeast Asia.\nWild elephant populations are under siege. A major threat is the loss and fragmentation of habitat due to human expansion and agricultural land conversion, which leads to human-elephant conflict. Poaching for ivory is also a serious threat for both species, although more for African than Asian elephants. More than 60 percent of forest elephants in Africa have been killed for the ivory trade in the last decade.\nBreeding elephants in human care is increasingly viewed as a means of maintaining important populations as \u201cinsurance\u201d against environmental or anthropomorphic catastrophe. Globally, there are about 1,000 African elephants in human care, mostly in zoos, and upwards of 16,000 Asian elephants in zoos, circuses, sanctuaries, logging and tourist camps. Unfortunately, most captive elephant populations are not self-sustaining due to high mortality and low birth rates, and supplementation by wild capture and/or importation is widespread.\nCurrent Projects"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephant Species", "url": "https://www.elephant-world.com/elephant-species/", "text": "Elephant Species Overview\nIt is estimated that there were once more than 350 species of elephants in the world. Today we only have two of them left \u2013 the Asian and the Africa species. Both of them are at risk of extinction if more intense efforts to protect them aren\u2019t in place. Between illegal hunting of them for ivory as well as the destruction of their natural habitat things are simply closing in on them at an alarming rate.\nWhen you compare the two species of elephants you will notice quite a few differences among them. There are some sub species in each of these groups to mention. With the Asian elephants there are the Indian, Sri Lanka, Sumatran, and Borneo which is also called the Pygmy. Researchers are still conducting testing right now but there is a theory that a 5th sub species does exist. Once they complete the investigation the information will be shared with the public.\nThere are two sub species with the African elephants. They are the Savannah which is often called the Bush elephant. There is also the Forest elephants. All of these subspecies for both of the categories are named for the locations that are their natural habitat.\nPlenty of research has been conducted on the two remaining elephant species. What we know is that they are extremely intelligent animals. They are also highly adaptable but that doesn\u2019t mean they can continue to keep up with all the changes that we are throwing their way.\nAfrican Elephant \u2013 Loxodonta africana\nElephants are affectionate and they do well in captivity. However, if we are going to see a future for these animals then we need to do our part to make sure they are protected from hunters. We also need to stop destroying places where they are known to live and to migrate through.\nIt is estimated that only 600,000 elephants remain in the world. That is a higher number than many other animals but don\u2019t allow that to fool you. These animals desperately need to be protected in their natural environment. That way there is a future for them and not a continual decrease in their numbers."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephants! - Earth's Kids", "url": "http://www.earthskids.com/ek-elephants.aspx", "text": "Elephants\nElephants are one of the most exciting and endearing of wild animals!\nMost people know that modern elephants fall into two sub-species: the African elephant (Loxodonta africana), and the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). But few people can really explain the differences between the two -- other than continents of origin and perhaps ear size and shape. Here's the low down on the two basic types:\nAfrican Elephant (Loxodonta africana)\nHeight: shoulder height of males up to approximately 13 feet high (290cm); Weight: 13, 200 pounds (7,500 kg) maximum. Body shape: Flat forehead. Concave back (dips down, like a horse or cow). Tusks: Large. Present in both male and female. Trunk: \"Two-fingered\".\nHabitat: The largest living land animal, the African elephant lives both on the grasslands (savannahs) and in the forests. African elephants in grasslands regions tend to live in larger groups than those who live in the forests. In fact, savannah elephants may join together in loosely knit clans of up to 70 members! But most often they can be found roaming about in a basic family unit of about 10 elephants. According to the WWF , important populations of African elephants occur in Tanzania, Botswana, and Zimbabwe, and probably in Congo, Gabon, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nAsian Elephant (Elephas maximus)\nHeight: 10 feet at shoulder Weight: 14,000 pounds maximum. Body shape: Two large bumps on forehead.\nFlat or rounded back . Tusks: Small. Usually only present in males. Trunk: \"One-fingered\".\nDomestication: Asian elephants have been trained and domesticated by humans for thousands of years. They have been used in trade and construction for their abilities to lift and haul large or heavy loads, in transportation to add endurance and splendor to the travels of kings and warriors, and in entertainment events and religious rituals to infuse awe and power. Habitat: Asian elephants live in a variety of habitats including open grasslands and marsh lands, but are better known as denizens of Asia's lush tropical forests.\nBasic Facts About Elephants\nDid you know...\nElephants live approximately 70+ years.\nAlthough massive, they can run at speeds of up to 25 miles per hour and trample almost anything in their way.\nAn elephant will lose and regrow its teeth six times during its lifetime.\nA healthy adult elephant has little to fear from predators, except human beings. It's greatest threats come from poachers and habitat loss.\nElephants can communicate with each other over great distances using infrasound, vocalizations that are at such low frequency they cannot be heard by the human ear.\nElephants are highly intelligent creatures with very large and complexly organized brains. Not only do they have the largest brain of any land animal, but the structure and complexity of their brains is similar to that of a human.\nUnlike your dog or cat an elephant can actually reconize itself in a mirror. Other animals that share this trait include dolphins, apes, magpies, and of course humans.\nElephants are the largest land mammal yet their closest living cousin is the diminutive rock hyrax. Another close relative is the manatee.\nContrary to a popular old myth elephants are NOT afraid of mice, but they do try to avoid bees and ants.\nThe skin of an elephant is about one inch thick yet so sensitive that it can feel a fly land.\nAn elephant's trunk is prehensile, meaning that it can be used to grab, hold, and move objects. An elephant's trunk has over 150,000 muslces but no bones.\nSocial Structure\nElephant society is organized into two main groups: a male-centered bachelor group and a female-centered family herd.\nThe female family herd is not exclusively female. Baby males and young teenage males also live in this group. But the group largely consists of adult females, their babies, their other female relatives (sisters, aunts, cousins) and their offspring. Because this group is held together by ties to or between the adult females, or mothers, this group is also called \"matrifocal\", or mother centered. The group is led by the most senior adult female, also known as the \"matriarch\".\nThe matriarch has acquired decades of knowledge and experience that helps her lead the herd to the best feeding and watering sites during different seasons of the year and over vast distances. If there is not enough food and water to support the entire family herd it will break up into smaller groups that can forage separately. Matriarchs can use both scent gland secretions and infrasound (low frequency rumblings) to help them detect their sister bands even when many miles away.\nThe male centered or \"bachelor\" herd is made up of adult males and the older teenage males. Young males seem to follow a senior bull male, a kind of patriarch whom they watch and learn from.\nAll male elephants start out life as babies living with their mother in the matrifocal group. But as they mature they began straying from her more and more often and seeking out other young males. Young males enjoy play fighting and testing their strength against each other, an activity that prepares them for the real battles they will engage in as older bulls. By age thirteen or so these young males are ready to leave the protection and guidance of their mothers and aunties and begin their life in the bachelor herd. A bachelor herd is usually made up of four or five bulls, but there may be as many as thirty roaming together.\nAlthough the two groups may live very far apart, adult males know exactly when a female has entered into the rare and very brief stage during which she can can become pregnant (also known as \"estrus\"). Suddenly males appear as if out of nowhere, arriving right on time to mate with the receptive female.\nLife Cycle\nLike all mammals, an elephant starts it's life inside its mother's womb. Like most large mammals, the elephant takes a long time to develop, requiring a long pregnancy or \"gestation\". But elephant gestation takes much longer than any other mammal, on land or in the sea. In fact it takes an incredibly long 22 months to develop and grow before it is ready to be born. That's almost two years!\nBut the mother elephant's work is still not done. She will spend the next five years nursing her baby and protecting it from predators as it learns the fundamentals of elephant life. And even once the baby is weaned, it will continue to live with its mother and aunties. The herd protects the still developing youngster and helps it find water holes, mud wallows, and good grazing and foraging sites.\nAs noted above, in social structure, by the time a young male elephant hits puberty he will drift off to join a bachelor herd. However if the adolescent is a young female elephant, she will continue to live in her mother's herd, learning from the older females and helping to look after her younger siblings and cousins. By the time she is 12 to 14 years of age she will begin having her own babies.\nThe young male elephant, meanwhile will not be ready to mate for another ten years. And in fact, because access to females in estrus is fiercely fought over by the more senior bull elephants, he may not get a chance to reproduce until he is 35 or 40 years old!\nThreats To Survival\nPoaching: Most people know that elephants have long been hunted for their ivory. In fact, in the 1970s half the elephant population of Africa disappeared \u2015 ruthlessly slaughtered for their ivory tusks. But did you also know that in 1989, an international ban was imposed on the ivory trade? That means that while it is still legal to sell ivory within one's own country, it is illegal to export it to other countries (which is how the big money was made). Unfortunately, many tourists still purchase ivory trinkets and art objects while visiting African and Asian countries, and some people believe that it would be okay to allow some export of ivory, just to help out the economies of various African nations. Certainly we should not turn a deaf ear to the needs of our fellow humans, but is murdering such an exceptionally intelligent creature really the right solution?\nIn addition to being threatened by the ivory trade, Asian elephants are also hunted for their hide and bone. In Thailand the hide is turned into shoes and hand bags. And in China the bone is is turned into bone ash and used in traditional medicines treating ulcers of the skin and stomach.\nHabitat loss: An even greater threat to elephants than poaching may be habitat loss. Nearly everywhere that elephants live, there are human beings looking to turn the elephants' wild feeding and breeding grounds into domestic farm and ranch land. An elephant is a very large animal. Grass and leaves are not very calorie rich foods. Therefore, an elephant herd requires a vast territory to range over in order to consume enough plant food without stripping their feeding area bare. As elephants are forced onto smaller and smaller range territories, there is greater and greater threat that the very trees, bushes, and grasslands that support the elephants will become so badly damaged that they will no longer be able to re-grow themselves and thus no longer be able to feed the elephants or all the other wild animals that feed there.\nHabitat Fragmentation - Now that human beings have encroached so heavily on elephant habitats, it is not always possible for elephants to follow their normal migration paths. When elephants try to ignore the crops, fences, and other structures in their way, the local human residents get very alarmed. Human attempts to drive elephants away sometimes leads to elephants being injured, accidentally or deliberately. Similarly, the critical overlap of human and elephant habitats means that sometimes it is the elephants who accidentally harm the humans.\nEven when the elephants are not being attacked however, this human disruption of the migration path is still doing harm. First of all, elephants are unable to access the vast feeding areas that they need (see Habitat Loss, above). And secondly, elephants may become cut off from other elephant groups or subgroups. As a result family ties, social interaction, and mating are then disrupted.\nHigh Risk Capture Procedures In Asia many people would rather capture a wild elephant and train it than purchase one. Additionally, they find it much more attractive to have a large, productive adult elephant now, than to breed elephants and wait ten years for the babies to grow up.\nBut unfortunately, many of the methods of capture used too often result in the death of the elephant. Thankfully programs are currently underway to encourage rural people to discontinue this risky methods, and to educate them successful methods of raising their own elephants. But providing information will not be enough. The fate of these wild elephants depends on the willingness of human beings to act with compassion and integrity.\nOur Favorite Books About Elephants Elephant Walk\nWritten by Jean Craighead George, Illustrated by Anna Vojtech Poetic and heartwarming, this charming tale of a baby elephant named Odon introduces the reader into the subtle and sensual world of elephant family life.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Top 5 Strongest Animals in the Jungle (Facts & Pictures)", "url": "https://wildexplained.com/strongest-animals-in-the-jungle/", "text": "While traveling around the world, I was fortunate to book a jungle tour package. I got the opportunity to watch and learn about jungle animals up close.\nAs we were near the end of the tour, the travel guide asked us if we had any questions. My companion asked, \u201cWhat is the strongest animal in the jungle?\u201d\nThe African forest elephant definitely deserves the title King of the Jungle. Ironically, it was given to the lions, animals not living in the jungle.\nElephants are known for their immense strength, able to lift tons of pounds in one hold. No jungle creature can carry as much as they can.\nLet us get to know more about elephants and other strong jungle animals in this list:\n5 Strongest Animals in the Jungle\nAfrican Forest Elephants\nDung Beetles\nCrocodiles\nGorillas\nLeafcutter Ants\nAfrican Forest Elephants\nScientific Name: Loxodonta Cyclotis\nHeight: 5 \u2013 10 ft\nWeight: 4,000 \u2013 8,000 lbs\nAs mentioned, African forest elephants are the strongest animal in the jungle. They are found in the rainforests of central and West Africa. These magnificent beasts are currently considered endangered because of human activities.\nUnlike their elephant cousins roaming the savannas, forest elephants are smaller and have a slower reproduction rate. However, it does not affect the fact that they are the most powerful animal in the jungle.\nWeighing up to 8,000 pounds, these animals can carry 400 pounds with their trunk alone. Elephant strength is also crucial in carrying their massive body weight.\nElephants\u2019 trunks have an average of 40,000 muscles, which is probably why they possess such enormous strength. In comparison, a human has an average of 600 muscles in its body, which is almost 67 times fewer muscles!\nEven with their massive size and strength, African forest elephants are herbivores, and they mainly eat tree branches and leaves.\nOne adult African elephant can consume 300 pounds of food for one day. As a result, these giants keep foraging day and night for long distances without much sleep.\nIn addition to their herbivore diet, elephants go to mineral-enriched waterholes to drink nutrients that the tree lacks.\nAfrican forest elephants, just like their cousins, move in a herd and are headed by a matriarch. Once one of them gives birth, all of the elephants will be involved in raising the baby.\nDung Beetles\nScientific Name: Scarabaeidae\nHeight: 0.2 \u2013 1.2 in\nWeight: 0.1 \u2013 0.22 lbs\nDung beetles are found almost everywhere, including in the jungle. Well, except in Antarctica. As long as there is fecal matter, dung beetles can survive.\nThese insects will roll the feces into a ball to serve as a food source and breeding chambers. To form a ball, dung beetles use their back legs to wad the fecal matter and their front legs to dig it.\nIt is remarkable as dung beetles can roll a ball up to 1,141 times its weight. You can compare it to an average 150-pound person carrying six double-decker buses.\nDue to their strength, these small and strong animals are frequently compared to elephants. Some people also share the sentiment that these insects must carry the title of the strongest jungle animal.\nHowever, even though dung beetles can carry a thousand times their weight, elephants still lift the heaviest amount.\nInterestingly, these insects are able to lift that much weight because of their small size. Following the square-cube rule, the larger the creature is, the less strong it is pound for pound.\nStrength is relative to the cross-sectional area of the muscle. So if a creature doubles in length, its muscle cross-section goes up 4 times, but its volume and weight go up 8 times.\nIn other words, as a creature grows in size, it requires more and more muscles to achieve the same level of strength.\nCrocodiles\nScientific Name: Crocodylidae\nHeight: 11 \u2013 20 ft\nWeight: 1,000 \u2013 2,200 lbs\nCrocodiles are found in various parts of the world. They mostly live in Southeast Asia, South Asia, Sahara, Madagascar, East and West Indies, Australia, Mexico, and Central and South America.\nThese ancient animals are deemed strong because of their rough build. An adult crocodile weighs up to 2,200 pounds, almost as heavy as a compact car.\nBesides their tough exterior, crocodiles have long jaws and around 67-70 large teeth. With a single bite, these reptiles can exert force up to 3,700 pounds per square inch.\nIt is 23 times stronger than a human bite!\nCrocodiles\u2019 champs are enough to tear human limbs into shreds. Even though they will not actively hunt humans, they are opportunistic killers, and it\u2019s estimated that they are responsible for 1,000 human deaths per year (worldwide).\nTheir intense bites make them one of the strongest animals in the jungle. If you ever encounter a crocodile, slowly back away and do not make any sudden movement that can surprise them.\nCrocodiles will aggressively act when provoked or in danger. It is an automatic mechanism to protect themselves.\nIf it starts running towards you, run in a straight line. Unlike the typical zig-zag run advice, humans run faster than crocodiles on a linear path.\nIn addition to their brute strength, a recent study claims that crocodiles are highly intelligent creatures. Their communication skills, advanced parental care, and tool use distinguish them from other animals.\nGorillas\nScientific Name: Gorilla\nHeight: 4.4 \u2013 6.5 ft\nWeight: 250 \u2013 500 lbs\nThe king of the jungle is actually a common title at this point because even the gorillas share it with the lions. And these primates might deserve it for better reasons.\nGorillas were given the title after being recognized as the largest primate. An adult male can weigh up to 500 pounds, and much of that is muscle.\nTo carry their weight, gorillas walk on all four limbs. However, they can occasionally walk on their two feet. These primates\u2019 stance usually reminds a huge man walking.\nGorillas are further classified into upland and lowland gorillas.\nThere are physical differences between the two species. The upland primates have dark-colored, thick, long fur, while the lowland ones have lighter, softer, short hair.\nIn terms of their strength, gorillas are stronger than other primates, while a western lowland gorilla is the strongest gorilla subspecies. These bulky primates can carry and lift up to 4,000 pounds, whereas a well-trained human can only handle 880 pounds.\nIn addition, a western low land gorilla has a bite force of about 1,300 PSI, one of the strongest of all animals.\nEstimates state that a gorilla\u2019s strength is equivalent to four to nine people. Gorillas have dense muscle, four times higher than heavily muscled humans.\nIf a person gets targeted by a gorilla, he will suffer from severe injuries or even death. A gorilla punch can exert power between 1,300 to 2,700 pounds, strong enough to shatter a human skull.\nThankfully, gorillas are not particularly dangerous to humans, and they are known for being peaceful primates.\nLeafcutter Ants\nScientific Name: Atta\nHeight: 0.08 \u2013 0.4 in\nWeight: 0.01 \u2013 0.03 oz\nThe last member on our list of strongest animals in the jungle is the leafcutter ant.\nLeafcutter ants are endemic to Southern United States, Mexico, and Central and South America. They are usually found on the jungle floors, helping disturb the soil to create biogeochemical spots.\nThese insects are the tiniest but still one of the strongest jungle animals. You may wonder how?\nWell, leafcutter ants can carry about 20 times their weight!\nLike dung beetle, leafcutter ants have these extreme strength abilities due to their size. At the same time, it helps that they have muscles that cover their whole body.\nLeafcutter ants are light, and their muscles do not need to provide much support. So, they are able to shift that strength to carrying heavier things instead.\nThese tiny insects are not aggressive. However, leafcutter ants will not be afraid to bite you if you disturb their nest or activities.\nEven with their number, leafcutter ants are susceptible to the attack of predators. For example, an armadillo can quickly slurp the whole nest without fearing the ant bites.\nRead Also: Most Powerful Birds"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "10 Worst Zoos for Elephants 2020 - IDA USA", "url": "https://www.idausa.org/campaign/elephants/2020worstzoos/", "text": "2020: A Bitter Year for Humans and Elephants\nThe year 2020 was one for the history books, with lives everywhere upended or tragically cut short due to the coronavirus pandemic. As normal life ceased to exist, we learned a little of what captivity feels like. Lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders gave us a bitter, yet temporary taste of the imprisonment elephants and other animals experience in zoos their entire lives. Many elephants are separated without choice from those they once knew as a standard zoo practice. Others face complete social isolation from their own kind. All elephants in zoos face several diseases largely unique to captivity, some lethal. Untimely death and unnecessary suffering loom close-by, even for captive elephants in the \u201cbest\u201d zoos. Of the elephants who perished in North America\u2019s accredited zoos in 2020, two siblings died from a virus endemic to Asian elephants. Dead at one and five years, their only view of the world was through bars.\nDespite the world\u2019s sharp focus on suffering caused by confinement and disease, In Defense of Animals\u2019 list of the 10 Worst Zoos for Elephants in North America for 2020 reveals that zoos continued business as usual in profiting off elephants\u2019 lives throughout the pandemic \u2014 and concealed the price wild and captive elephants pay for zoo captivity.\nTransfer Abuse\nMany of the zoos on the 10 Worst Zoos list demonstrate how zoos engage in \u201ctransfer abuse,\u201d trafficking elephants from place to place, often multiple times. This unique cruelty is rife in zoos, even though it can cause significant trauma \u2014 both for elephants moved and those left behind. Elephants who suffer separation through transfer abuse are significantly more likely to perform abnormal \u201cstereotypic\u201d behaviors, a known indicator of compromised welfare. These strange repetitive movements are not seen in the wild and are a symptom of zoochosis \u2014 psychosis caused by confinement. It\u2019s a response to the physical and psychological frustration of confined animals\u2019 innate needs. Most zoo visitors do not realize that these odd behaviors can be stress-related.\nFor years, zoos wrongly claimed that repetitive transfers of male elephants don\u2019t impact captive elephant society, because of an outdated belief that males are \u201cloners\u201d in the wild. But a 2020 study revealed that male African elephants aren\u2019t quite the loners they appeared to be. Instead, when they strike off on their own as adolescents, they remain an essential part of the social fabric of elephant society, with older males passing along their wisdom to younger males. This upends two important human notions about elephants: that males are expendable and can therefore be targeted by trophy hunters with little impact; and that zoos can transfer males with no ill effects. Elephant culture in both males and females is passed down through generations.\nIn light of this new data, captive elephant facilities must stop breeding and transferring elephants because of the trauma it causes individuals piled on top of the cruelty inherent in captivity. Although the scientific case against transfer abuse has grown, the findings are still a mere inconvenience for zoos and other institutions. Zoos have a vested interest in exploiting elephants as commodities by trucking them from one location and climate to another, and breeding them so calves can spend their lifetimes in captivity that can subject them to painful diseases and ailments seldom, if ever, found in the wild.\nConservation of Wild Elephants is Impossible in Zoos\nZoos often respond with an excuse that captive elephants in North America and elsewhere outside of their natural ecosystems are insurance in case of extinction in the wild. This justification is used by zoos to spend many millions of dollars on new captivity structures, often diverted from directly benefiting wild elephants to prevent that extinction. No zoo elephant will be transferred to the wild.\nFor yet another year, the 10 Worst Zoos for Elephants list exposes how zoos considered by their supporters to be among the best in North America are ignoring the science \u2014 even when it comes to the most basic elephant welfare. Slowly but surely, zoos are killing captive elephants. Exposing this fact is the reason behind our annual list of the 10 Worst Zoos for Elephants, now in its seventeenth year.\nIt shouldn\u2019t take a significant tragedy like COVID-19 to show us just how bad captive elephants have it. The science is sound: elephants can often barely survive in zoos, let alone thrive. It\u2019s time to stop pretending we can improve this broken system and instead make one final transfer: turn over all captive elephants in zoos to accredited sanctuaries and end all attempts to import them from the wild as zoos fail elephants in captivity now as they always have.\n10 Worst Zoos 2020:\nDishonorable Mention: Rosamond Gifford Zoo, Syracuse, NY\n2020 10 Worst Zoos for Elephants in North America\n#1 Worst Zoo - African Lion Safari, Ontario, Canada\nThe Ugly Business of Endless Elephant Trafficking\nAfrican Lion Safari is a hub for elephant breeding and trafficking supplying U.S. zoos. It forces elephants to perform unnatural and demeaning circus acts and give rides to tourists. Photo: Boris Kasimov\nBoasting to be the facility with the most Asian elephants in North America \u2014 with 16 Asian elephants who have been forced to produce 21 calves \u2014 African Lion Safari, set in freezing-cold Ontario, Canada, is the #1 Worst Zoo because it is the epitome of an elephant exploitation business. This safari theme park intended to sell two mother elephants to Fort Worth Zoo thereby separating them from their two young calves. The \u201cSafari\u201d is an international hub selling adult elephants to other zoos, which receives and sends back elephants from distant zoos for years at a time at the expense of their families for breeding, forces elephants to perform demeaning tricks and carry people around on their backs, is set in a totally unsuitable cold climate, and dominates elephants with the threat of bullhooks.\nAfrican Lion Safari breeds and then sells captive elephants to zoos across North America \u2014 and had a pending sale of two elephants for a million dollars each with the #2 Worst Zoo. This Zoo, and others doing business with it, operates like an elephant-trafficking cartel.\nThe Safari has access to \u201canimal loan and exchange programs, including the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' (AZA) Species Survival Plan\u201d through its accreditation with Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA). This framework appears to give a green light for AZA-accredited zoos in the U.S. to buy elephants from African Lion Safari, even though it violates the AZA\u2019s requirement of restricted contact \u2014 ensuring there is a safety barrier between elephants and humans \u2014 and no elephant rides. The AZA is also phasing out bullhooks \u2014 weapons designed to control elephants with pain and fear \u2014 at member facilities. Because Canada and CAZA allow bullhooks and elephant rides, and do not yet require restricted contact, the AZA-accredited zoos doing business with African Lion Safari are encouraging and subsidizing these clear abuses of elephants.\nAfrican Lion Safari has a long history of collusion with zoos in separating females from their tight-knit social groups, often as part of a series of family separations and transfers to other zoos. This \u201ctransfer abuse\u201d violates elephants\u2019 social, psychological, and emotional needs and promotes lifelong trauma. In the summer of 2020, Ft. Worth Zoo, the #2 Worst Zoo this year, offered to buy two females from African Lion Safari for $1 million each, plus a $200,000 bonus if one gives birth \u2014 the highest known price ever paid for elephants in North America. Emily, age 15, would be separated from Gigi, her six-year-old calf; while Nellie, age eight, would be taken from her mother, Natasha. In the wild, females stay with their families their entire lives.\nA young elephant forced to balance on only front legs at African Lion Safari. Photo: CC Flickr\nAfrican Lion Safari makes elephant lives even more miserable by forcing them to perform demeaning tricks for tourists and carrying people around on their backs, while handlers stand by with bullhooks. These stresses are possibly what led one elephant to attack a handler who suffered serious injuries in 2019, in full view of nearby children and parents in line for cruel elephant rides. One family reported being traumatized seeing the employee thrown into the air and slammed against a wooden structure. A 14-year-old boy was leading an elephant when she stepped on him and broke his leg in 1995, and a \"trainer\" was crushed to death in 1989 by a bull elephant.\nAfrican Lion Safari is a cruel, dangerous, and profit-driven business supported by zoos. While Canada considers Senator Sinclair\u2019s Jane Goodall Act to stop these abuses, elephants will continue to be denied who they are and what they need. Their last trip must be to an accredited sanctuary for life.\nMARCH 5, 2021 UPDATE: Following the release of this 10 Worst Zoos list, Fort Worth Zoo and African Lion Safari announced the deal has been canceled! Our listing has been updated to reflect this victory for elephants. Learn more here.\n#2 Worst Zoo - Fort Worth Zoo, Fort Worth, Texas\n$2 Million Dollar Dirty Deal Threatens Elephants Everywhere\nFort Worth Zoo in Texas offered a Canadian theme park $2 million for two elephants and in the process would separate two mothers from their calves. Photo: Wasif Malik/Flickr\nFort Worth Zoo offered $2 million to this year\u2019s #1 Worst Zoo for Elephants to buy two female Asian elephants: eight-year-old Nellie and fifteen-year-old Emily. Fort Worth Zoo wanted to breed them and would have paid an additional $200,000 if a calf was born soon after their arrival. As the #2 Worst Zoo for Elephants in 2020, this dirty deal, and others like it, expose the zoo industry's powerful role in driving U.S. and international trade in traumatized elephants who suffer from serial \"transfer abuse,\" breeding, and endless captivity.\nIf the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service approved the import, Fort Worth Zoo would pay African Lion Safari \u2014 a theme park in Ontario, Canada \u2014 to separate Nellie from her mother, and Emily from her six-year-old calf, Gigi. Transfers are known to cause stress to elephants, and scientific research associates them with repetitive stereotypic behaviors that are considered \"an important indicator of compromised welfare.\u201d\nFort Worth Zoo's financial offer incentivizes circuses and theme parks like African Lion Safari to increase their rate of cruel and often invasive breeding procedures so they may sell the babies who survive into lifetimes of captive confinement. It also encourages countries with wild elephants to kidnap them from the wild and sell them into servitude.\nElephant trafficking takes place on a national and global scale, with zoos trading and buying elephants from businesses linked to circuses and theme parks. At least three male elephants now at Fort Worth Zoo came from these sordid sources: Casey, Romeo, and Colonel Tusko. Tusko was born at African Lion Safari in 1991. He was sent to Carson and Barnes Circus at around five years old, then to that circus' Endangered Ark Foundation \"sanctuary\" before going back to African Lion Safari and in 2013, to Fort Worth Zoo. The females at Fort Worth Zoo fare no better. Rasha was kidnapped from the wild in Thailand in 1971 and transferred at least five times before arriving at Fort Worth Zoo.\nZoos often claim they are going to save elephants from extinction in the wild by creating artificial African and Asian elephant \u201cherds\u201d in North America \u2014 yet elephants are dying faster in zoos than they can reproduce. Even if zoos could create a self-sustaining herd, none of the elephants will ever be returned to the wild. By offering to spend $2 million dollars on captive elephants for its public exhibits, Fort Worth Zoo is sending the message that wild elephants cannot be saved, all while diverting money away from projects that could actually help elephants in the wild.\nThis is the third time the Zoo has been listed on the 10 Worst Zoos for Elephants. The Fort Worth Zoo elephants should be retired to a sanctuary where they'll never face another traumatic transfer or breeding procedure again.\nMARCH 5, 2021 UPDATE: This entry has been updated to reflect that the deal between Fort Worth Zoo and African Lion Safari has been cancelled.\n#3 Worst Zoo - Pittsburgh Zoo, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nOne Hundred Twenty-Two Years of Concrete Elephant Abuse\nPittsburgh Zoo has used indoor concrete floors harmful to elephants since 1898 even though studies indicate softer substrates substantially reduce painful and ultimately lethal foot, leg and joint disease. Photo: Britt Menhart\nPittsburgh Zoo, and its International Conservation Center (ICC), was ranked as the #1 Worst Zoo in the 2019 list of the 10 Worst Zoos for Elephants in North America for keeping elephants in cramped exhibits with concrete flooring. Zoo visits conducted by In Defense of Animals in 2020 revealed that the Zoo appears to have done nothing to improve conditions for the elephants, earning it the unenviable title of #3 Worst Zoo for Elephants in 2020. Pittsburgh Zoo continues to keep elephants confined in barns devoid of anything natural, and standing on critically harmful concrete floors \u2014 and it turns out the Zoo has been subjecting elephants to these same grim conditions for 122 years.\nConcrete flooring is known to be a primary cause of foot and leg diseases, such as arthritis and foot lesions that are not typically seen in wild elephant populations. Chronic foot problems can cause elephants to walk unnaturally, producing musculoskeletal stresses often leading to arthritis and other diseases in their several-ton bodies. These cascading injuries can result in chronic pain and often death, and are one of the key reasons elephants die faster in captivity than in the wild.\nBetter flooring options are available and known to reduce the debilitating and deadly diseases caused by concrete under their feet. Instead, Pittsburgh Zoo has spent millions of dollars on new or upgraded facilities for its visitors, including a zipline; buying more animals; and constructing buildings to house female elephants for breeding, thereby sentencing their calves to a lifetime of captivity.\nWhen Pittsburgh Zoo opened in 1898 as Highland Park Zoo, it received Gusky, a young female Asian elephant, from a nearby zoo that closed soon after importing her from India. Newspapers noted the concrete floors in the then-new building and later, Gusky\u2019s sad life of being tied to a stake while constantly swaying \u2014 what today we know of as stereotypic behavior, a key indicator of chronic stress. Over a century later, the elephants imprisoned at Pittsburgh Zoo remain on indoor concrete floors and still exhibit repetitive stress behaviors, as shown by footage in this video recorded during an investigation by In Defense of Animals.\nFor 122 years, little has changed for elephants suffering on harmful concrete floors at Pittsburgh Zoo. Above: The elephant room in 1941. Below: The elephant room in 2019. Photos: Pittsburgh City Photographer, In Defense of Animals.\nIn August 2008, Pittsburgh Zoo established the International Conservation Center in Fairhope, PA, featuring barns costing $6 million, including an elephant \"maternity barn\" meant to warehouse twenty female African elephants. The ICC plan for mass elephant breeding has failed so far. Sadly, any baby elephants born there are destined for lifetimes in zoos, since captive-born elephants are not suitable for reintroduction into the wild.\nTransferring elephants repeatedly from one location to another and separating calves from their mothers can cause trauma. Moja had already been trafficked several times when she arrived at Pittsburgh Zoo. After the Zoo bred her, she birthed two calves. In 2015, the zoo cruelly separated Moja from her two calves, Victoria and Zuri, and shipped her to Oregon. In the wild, these female calves would have stayed with their mother\u2019s herd for life.\nForcing elephants to suffer on concrete like it\u2019s 1898 and trafficking elephants is barbaric. For over a century, Pittsburgh Zoo appears to have failed to replace the concrete floors in its elephant barns with a softer substrate, while spending money on elephant breeding infrastructure and tourist amenities. This is the Zoo\u2019s fourth time on the 10 Worst Zoos list, showing it has no concerns for the well-being of the elephants it imprisons.\nElephants don\u2019t need ziplines. They require ample space, warm weather and soft, natural ground on which to roam. Only an accredited sanctuary is able to come close to approximating life in the wild for elephants.\n#4 Worst Zoo - Seneca Park Zoo, Rochester, New York\nOne Foot in the Grave\nCold weather and cramped conditions lead to painful feet and joints. Photo: Kristina M D\u2019Hondt Democrat and Chronicle\nFrigid winters and captivity at Seneca Park Zoo in New York create a storm of debilitating ailments for African elephants. In 2019, female African elephant Chana died at only 37 years of age. Suffering from chronic foot ailments, as well as autoimmune skin disease, degenerative joint diseases, and other conditions, she reportedly lowered herself into a kneeling position one day. When she was unable to stand up again, the zoo euthanized her.\nTwo of the three remaining elephants, Jenny C and Lilac, are suffering from arthritis as well. Jenny C\u2019s is advanced, painful, and debilitating. This is no coincidence.\nChana was moved from Jacksonville Zoo in Florida to Seneca Park Zoo, Rochester, New York, in 2015 with life-long companion Moki. Both Zoos ignored their needs when they collaborated to ship both from a warm-weather climate to one that has extended cold and dark winters. For nearly five months of every year, the mean temperature is at or well below freezing. Seneca Park causes particularly egregious harm since the elephants must remain indoors for much of the cold winters.\nElephants can tolerate cold and snow up to a point, but the climate at Seneca Park Zoo often requires them to stay inside heated barns. AZA accreditation standards are clear that whenever the temperature goes below forty degrees longer than sixty minutes for an elephant, supplemental heat or other measures must be implemented and elephants must be monitored every sixty minutes. The frequent and far colder outdoor temperatures that last for months at the Zoo cannot be mitigated this way, so the elephants have to remain in the barn much of the time.\nIn Defense of Animals has measured the outdoor \u201cyards\u201d and barn, and found the outdoor yard is one-third smaller than the walled-in barn. The barn is about 0.87 acres, but it\u2019s not open space. It\u2019s divided into several steel-barred stalls. The outdoor \u201cyards,\u201d when available, are even smaller \u2014 one-third less in total. Outdoors, three large African elephants get only 0.54 acres for life, but even that is divided into three smaller parts at Seneca Park Zoo. That\u2019s a terribly small space for elephants.\nThe small Seneca Park Zoo elephant exhibit comprises a yard and a stalled-barn where elephants are forced to shelter from the cold for long periods. Photo: Google Earth\nJenny C and Lilac were the only elephants at Seneca Park Zoo from 1979 to 2015. For Chana and Moki, their arrival at Seneca Park was the fifth time they were shipped to a different location, all before age thirty-four. This was the latest act of transfer abuse, which is known to cause trauma in elephants as they are taken from familiar surroundings and elephants to yet another strange place, again and again.\nUnder these cold, restricted space conditions, it\u2019s no wonder that of the three elephants at the Zoo, two are currently being treated for arthritis. Genny C, age 44, has painful, debilitating arthritis that began when she was only 34. Lilac, age 43, has arthritis in her wrist. Since Chana was euthanized because of her suffering from severe arthritis as well, the pattern fits the science of how captivity kills elephants in zoos.\nBecause Genny C\u2019s arthritis is in both her front legs, she this year underwent an unnatural tusk \u201ctrimming\u201d procedure. Portions of her tusks have been sawn off in a bid to reduce the weight that strains her joints. Genny C likely would still have her tusks and healthy joints if she were not kept in zoo conditions. Arthritis and foot ailments are a leading cause of death in captive elephants, due in large part to the lack of exercise these animals are afforded. In the wild, elephants can walk 30-50 miles every day if the herd chooses to do so.\nTo help pay for their \u201cgeriatric\u201d foot care, Seneca Park Zoo sells paintings by Lilac. Genny C is also made to paint. These activities are unnatural to elephants, not educational, and mislead people into believing that elephants enjoy both painting and their captivity.\nNo zoo currently in operation can come close to providing elephants with open expanses available to them in their home ecosystems in Asia and Africa, and the autonomy to experience and make decisions responding to the complexities and rich life those ecosystems have given elephants for millenia.\nThe fast march to death at Seneca Park Zoo must end now. These African elephants deserve to be retired to a warm-weather sanctuary where they can once again be footloose in the sunshine.\n#5 Worst Zoo - Monterey Zoo, Salinas, California\nFalse Promises of Retirement and Sanctuary Life for Elephants\nElephants at Monterey Zoo are hardly retired. Photo: Rick Berg/Flickr\nMonterey Zoo, located in Salinas, CA, claims to be a place where elephants can \"retire\" \u2014 but a life of public display, while being constantly dominated by human trainers to make them interact with tourists, can hardly be called retirement for elephants. This \u201cretirement home\u201d is where most of its elephants die very young, even by zoo standards. The average age of three of the five who died there was 22.\nElephants Paula and Kristy were euthanized in 2019; Paula for severe osteochondrosis, Kristy for salmonella in her intestines and E.coli in her liver and intestines.\nFor years, Monterey Zoo ran the Elephants of Africa Rescue Society (EARS) which was founded by an exotic animal hobbyist who eventually established \"Wild Things Animal Rentals Inc.\" for film productions. Despite its \u201csanctuary\u201d moniker, EARS was notorious for hosting annual galas where people came into direct contact with elephants, sometimes without any physical boundary between humans and elephants. EARS was recently merged into its \"parent\" organization, Monterey Zoological Society, but the EARS website remains active, and elephant experiences continue at Monterey Zoo.\nEven in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, Monterey Zoo has encouraged people \u2014 including children \u2014 to come into close contact with elephants\u2019 trunks, even though any elephant can carry tuberculosis and with enough exposure, become infected from people as well. Studies are still underway about which animals can catch or transmit COVID-19, and though there still \u201cis no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19\u201d to humans based on limited studies, it is suspected the disease has already passed between humans and several species at zoos. Lions, tigers and other \u201cbig cats,\u201d at Bronx Zoo, a Tennessee Zoo, and a Kentucky Zoo have tested positive, while at San Diego Zoo, gorillas tested positive for COVID-19.\nReal sanctuaries are designed to provide for elephants\u2019 needs first and foremost; they are never bred, and never put to work entertaining humans or allowed to come into unprotected contact with people.\nUnprotected contact between elephants and humans is dangerous for reasons beyond disease transmission. A 2018 incident cited by PETA saw a trainer seriously injured after taking \u201caggressive action\u201d on Monterey Zoo captive female African elephant Paula, illustrating the dangers of unprotected contact to both elephants and humans. As well as engaging in dangerous unprotected contact, the Zoo is being sued for using bullhook-like weapons to dominate and control elephants in violation of California\u2019s ban on bullhooks and other pain-inflicting weapons.\nHundreds of people have been killed by captive elephants, largely the result of so-called free contact approaches, which is one of the reasons the leading accreditation body, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, requires protected contact at accredited zoos. The only accreditation Monterey Zoo has managed to secure is from the \u201cZoological Association of America,\u201d which is headed by the director of Pittsburgh Zoo \u2014 the #1 Worst Zoo for Elephants in 2019. This is the second time Monterey Zoo has been on our 10 Worst Zoos for Elephants list.\nIf the Monterey Zoo is truly sincere about giving these elephants the opportunity to retire, it should send them to a true sanctuary accredited by the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries.\n#6 Worst Zoo - Myrtle Beach Safari, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina\nBubbles, the Lonely Elephant Ignored by Tiger King\nBubbles, a female African elephant, has been socially isolated from other elephants for 36 years by notorious animal abuser Bhagavan Antle, featured in Netflix\u2019 documentary, \"Tiger King.\" Photo: JayPrehistoricPets/YouTube\nThe Netflix documentary Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness made a big splash in 2020, documenting the abuses of tigers at a roadside zoo in Oklahoma where the animals are endlessly used for photographs and petting experiences. The exploitation of big cats at Myrtle Beach Safari was included in the series, but a major character was left out: Bubbles, a 38-year-old female African elephant who has been kept socially isolated from other elephants all her life. Instead, she has been used to make money for her captor, Bhavagan Antle, since she was two, earning Myrtle Beach Safari sixth place on our 2020 list of the 10 Worst Zoos for Elephants in North America.\nAntle got his start decades ago as a traveling magician who used tigers, an elephant and other captives for his shows. Like a true magician, he has created the illusion he wasn\u2019t abusing Bubbles the elephant, tiger cubs and other species. That continues to this day.\nAntle claims he rescued Bubbles after her herd was wiped out for ivory. But this magician got Bubbles from David Meeks of Hollywild Animal Park in 1984. Between 1982 and 1984, Meeks trafficked at least twenty-two wild-born, mostly two-year-old African elephant calves, including Bubbles, for his elephant-taking business.\nWhile whole herds were being wiped out in massive killing programs, some calves were set aside for zoos, circuses, and private \u201cowners\u201d in the U.S. Meeks and others used this opportunity to sell and \u201cown\u201d elephants. For 36 years, Antle has denied Bubbles\u2019 right to, and innate elephant need for, essential social and physical relationships with other elephants. Like so many captive elephants in zoos and circuses, she witnessed her parents brutally massacred. Even when Bubbles was only two years old, Antle began to drag her from his former Buckingham Zoological Park in Virginia to work in a Wisconsin fair, where people were seen riding on Bubbles\u2019 back.\nThroughout her life and continuing to today, Antle has forced Bubbles to perform demeaning tricks and displays for audiences, such as wearing a Santa outfit. Bubbles\u2019 needs are denied \u2014 not even acknowledged to exist. Antle encourages people to climb all over her body and ride her, as if she weren\u2019t an elephant. Most often, countless, uninformed tourists hug her trunk and pose for photos only Myrtle Beach Safari is allowed to take \u2014 for profit.\nAntle\u2019s long record of conflict with the federal government\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service stretches back to 1984 and continues today. In October 2020, he was charged with animal cruelty and trafficking, for which he faces multiple felony counts, including violations of the Endangered Species Act and nine misdemeanor counts of animal cruelty. While these charges are related to lion cubs and at least one adult, they do nothing to address the situation of Bubbles.\nHow long Antle can keep up his illusions hiding what he does depends on informing the public about what is real and what is not. This is Myrtle Beach Safari\u2019s second time on our list. What is certain is that Bubbles deserves to be taken to an accredited sanctuary and leave Antle and his safari far behind.\n#7 Worst Zoo - Natural Bridge Zoo, Natural Bridge, Virginia\nFailed, Mocked, and Still Lonely at the Zoo\nLonely captive Asha was mocked and derided by her captor in front of Virginia politicians. Photo: Free All Captive Elephants\nThis is Natural Bridge Zoo\u2019s seventh consecutive year being featured on the list of the 10 Worst Zoos for Elephants \u2014 and in these seven years, little has changed for 38-year-old African elephant Asha. She has been forced to spend 33 of her 36 years held in social isolation since arriving at this roadside zoo that has accrued nearly 150 Animal Welfare Act violations. She is held in a small barren enclosure during the winters where she is essentially in storage. During the summers, Asha is forced to give rides to thousands of people each year, while under the constant threat of the bullhook.\nA glimmer of hope emerged in 2020 as a bill spearheaded by the Humane Society of the United States and supported by In Defense of Animals made its way through the Virginia state legislature aimed at prohibiting public contact with \u201cdangerous\u201d captive animals. The bill included elephants within its purview and would have banned elephant riding throughout the state. However, Karl Mogensen, owner of Natural Bridge Zoo, lobbied along with other groups to exclude elephants from the bill. During a hearing, Mogensen provided testimony where he sexualized Asha, referring to her as a \u201ccenterfold for elephant Playboy.\u201d Ultimately, elephants were excluded from the bill, leaving Asha and the public unprotected to this day.\nLegislators didn\u2019t get the whole story about how dangerous captive elephants can be. While elephants can be gentle, peaceful beings, the conditions of captivity can drive them to aggression, and unfortunately captive elephant attacks are quite common. Asha has attacked her handler, and attacked and killed another elephant in 1996 \u2014 facts which clearly demonstrate that elephants should be considered dangerous and that activities such as encouraging humans to ride on their backs can prove dangerous or even lethal. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums mandates protected contact \u2014 a barrier between elephants and humans, and in 2002 removed a provision from its accreditation standards of care that allowed for elephant riding; Natural Bridge Zoo abides by neither. Natural Bridge Zoo is not AZA-accredited, and will never be if it continues to treat Asha as poorly as it does.\nFailed by her captor and Virginia legislators, long-suffering Asha needs a miracle similar to the one experienced by Nosey to get to the accredited sanctuary she deserves.\n#8 Worst Zoo - Memphis Zoo, Memphis, Tennessee\nEven the Oldest Elephants Die Young in Zoos\nCaptive elephants at Memphis Zoo have sad histories that only an accredited sanctuary can heal. Photo: David Ellis/Flickr\nMemphis Zoo is one of many zoos with circus connections, having held nine elephants over the years who were subjected to these cruel businesses that are proven to harm elephants. In September 2020, one of those elephants, Tyranza, was put on hospice care and was eventually euthanized after her health dramatically declined. She was just 56 years old.\nMemphis Zoo touted Tyranza as being the oldest African elephant in North America \u2014 but this isn\u2019t saying much. Zoos frequently argue that elephants who live to great ages, whether captive or wild, are not representative of the lifespans of most elephants. \"Uncontrollable variables\" are another shield used by zoos against inconvenient data from studies into how long elephants live overall in zoos versus in the wild. But zoos cannot defend against one undeniable fact: research shows elephants die far younger in zoos than in the wild.\nTyranza, dead at 56, was a relatively long-lived outlier for a captive elephant, but she might have lived much longer if she hadn\u2019t been removed from her wild home. Wild female African elephants can live into their 70s \u2014 even though they face extra dangers in the wild. But comparing captive and wild elephant lifespans is a diversion from comparing what truly matters: captive versus wild elephant lives. Imprisoned elephants face lives of deprivation which bear no resemblance to the rich, natural context wild elephants have when living in ecosystems in Asia and Africa.\nBorn in the wild in 1965, Tyranza was captured and then forced into the entertainment business, including two years at a traveling circus. When she was 12 years old, Tyranza was eventually transferred to Memphis Zoo. By this young age she had already been cruelly separated from other elephants at least four times. Each transfer can cause fresh devastation for elephants, who form strong bonds and are highly social animals.\nTyranza is survived at Memphis Zoo by four female elephants including Daisy and Bambi, who sadly share similar backgrounds. They were added to the Memphis Zoo exhibit after suffering 42 years in circuses, each of them also suffering four transfers. Despite being \u201cretired\u201d from the circus, these elephants are still working for their keep, forced to be on public display day after day in small enclosures that erode elephants\u2019 minds and bodies through lack of mental stimulation and exercise.\nThe only form of true retirement for zoo and circus elephants is within an accredited sanctuary that does not breed elephants, force them to interact with humans, and that provides adequate social groups.\n#9 Worst Zoo - Cameron Park Zoo, Waco, Texas\nLone Elephant in Lone Star State\nTembo and Tanya were already an inadequate social grouping before Tanya's death. Photo: Wil C. Fry/Flickr\nAt Cameron Park Zoo in Waco, Texas, African female elephants Tanya and Tembo were held captive together for 13 years. Having only two elephants housed together is a woefully inadequate social setting for elephants, who live in herds of around a dozen or more individuals in the wild. But in September 2020, Tanya died, leaving Tembo all alone.\nTanya, captured from the wild as a baby, was just 41 years old when she died. As often occurs when elephants die in captivity, zoos frequently rely on data for captive lifespans, not those in the wild. Lifespans are variously cited as mean age, meaning half of elephants are alive above a certain age, half dead below that. When quoting an average age at death, it can be distorted by extremes on either end. When maximum lifespans are cited, they are exceptions. This causes some disagreement about how wild elephant research is cited by zoos and elephant advocates wanting elephants freed to accredited sanctuaries. Still, zoos too often refer to an ill or deceased elephant as geriatric when in the wild they would still be productive and healthy members of the herd. Female elephants can remain fertile into their sixties. Research reliably demonstrates that wild elephants live longer overall than those in zoos \u2014 and without the suffering and diseases of captivity.\nTembo, now 44 years old, was also captured from the wild and has been at Cameron Park Zoo since 1979. She has previously been forced to endure solitary confinement for years at a time at the Zoo until being provided with her latest companion, who has now died prematurely. Four elephants have died at Cameron Park Zoo at an average age of just 25. The Zoo says it will be exploring other companions for Tembo through Species Survival Programs \u2014 which are frequently used as an excuse to breed more elephants into lifetimes of captivity so that zoos can continue profiting off of their lives. Breeding also drives traumatic transfer abuse such as that suffered by traumatized Zoe. Now at Kansas City Zoo, Zoe suffered four transfers by age 23 \u2014 all after being taken from Africa at age two when her family was slaughtered.\nAny decision other than sending Tembo to an accredited sanctuary will be one made out of a profit motive rather than Tembo\u2019s best interest. This is Cameron Park Zoo\u2019s first time on our 10 Worst Zoos for Elephants list.\n#10 Worst Zoo - Hogle Zoo, Salt Lake City, Utah\nAccredited but Still Endangering Elephants & Children\nHogle Zoo puts elephants through years of social isolation and exposes children and elephants alike to pathways of potential airborne diseases. Photo: Paul T. Derdzinski\nHogle Zoo was featured on the 2019 10 Worst Zoos for Elephants list for keeping mother-daughter duo Christie and Zuri alone in a small, cold-weather enclosure. They are still alone. Keeping only two female elephants together, instead of a minimum of three, violates the AZA\u2019s elephant standards that recommend larger social groupings. But this accredited zoo has been listed again on the 2020 list in tenth place for additional best-practices violations.\nHogle Zoo has been allowing members of the public to come into close or direct contact with elephants\u2019 trunks \u2014 notably very young children and even an infant. The holes in the cage through which the trunks emerge are likely large enough to drag a child through. Potentially aggressive, unpredictable elephant behavior is the reason behind protected contact, a life-saving AZA standard requiring an effective barrier between elephants and the public and zoo staff. The high profile killing of captive gorilla Harambe at the Cincinnati Zoo in 2016 after a child entered his zoo exhibit tragically shows how contact poses danger to both animals and children.\nAnother dangerous factor arising from direct contact between humans and other animals is disease transmission. The tip of an elephant\u2019s trunk is akin to the nostrils on a human face; where transmissible diseases are present, touching these parts of an elephant potentially poses a risk of disease. Captivity can compromise elephants\u2019 immune systems, and tuberculosis \u2014 a deadly, highly infectious disease \u2014 has long existed in U.S. captive elephant populations. Captive elephants have infected numerous zoo staff at other facilities in recent years via zoonotic transmission. But humans aren\u2019t the only ones at risk: a process known as reverse zoonosis involves humans infecting elephants with TB. Reverse zoonosis is suspected to have been the way tigers in the Bronx Zoo became infected with COVID-19 during the early phases of the pandemic, and more recently, the gorillas at the San Diego Zoo. Zoonotic transmission can be especially dangerous for young infants and children whose immune systems are still developing.\nThis year, during the pandemic, Hogle Zoo began offering a brand-new revenue-generating \u201cfeeding experience.\u201d The coronavirus has hit businesses hard across the country, but this is no excuse to further exploit elephants by allowing people to feed them, thereby putting animals and people at risk \u2014 especially children. Now is the time for Hogle Zoo to begin looking at permanent accredited sanctuary retirement so Christie and Zuri can finally have the company of several other elephants so essential to their well-being.\nDishonorable Mention:\nRosamond Gifford Zoo, Syracuse, New York\nUnenviable Record for Dead Babies\nBabies Batu and Ajay died at Rosamond Gifford Zoo within days of each other. Photos: In Defense of Animals\nFor many so-called baby elephant \u201ctriumph\u201d celebrated by the Rosamond Gifford Zoo, there are often opposite tragedies. Rosamond Gifford Zoo has a track record for baby elephant deaths: 7 out of 10 calves have died there since 2005, all less than five years old. Three were stillborn, three from a virus endemic to Asian elephants, and one at five days old who had an accident at the Zoo\u2019s outdoor pool. In addition, Babe, an adult, died following an unsuccessful caesarean section to remove a stillborn calf in 1990.\nLess than two years after Rosamond Gifford Zoo celebrated its latest newborn baby, Ajay, the Zoo announced his death. Then, two days later, his five-year-old brother Batu also died. Mali was the mother of both who succumbed to the Elephant Endotheliotropic Herpes Virus (EEHV).\nRosamond Gifford Zoo\u2019s breeding of Asian elephants is what landed the Zoo a place on the 10 Worst Zoos list last year. It has shipped elephants for breeding to and from African Lion Safari, this year\u2019s #1 Worst Zoo for Elephants, and also to notorious commercial exploiters like Have Trunk Will Travel which is now called \u201cThe Preserve.\u201d Elephants remaining at Rosamond Gifford Zoo have fared no better: female Romani has been made to bear four calves. One died from EEHV and one was stillborn. Of her two surviving offspring, male Emmett was shipped to England at age six and his sperm has been shipped to other European zoos. Between 2002-2016, nine of Emmett\u2019s fifteen elephant babies have died, all very young.\nDoc, the only remaining male at the zoo was documented in 2019 by an In Defense of Animals investigator exhibiting zoochotic behavior, the endless repetition of behaviors like swaying back and forth due to the stresses of captivity common in many zoo-captive animals from many species.\nIn the same year, In Defense of Animals recorded a Rosamond Gifford representative stating the Zoo\u2019s intention to ship Doc and his then still-alive son Batu to other zoos, but the Zoo denied this intention after In Defense of Animals exposed the plans.\nYoung Ajay and Batu are only the latest tragic victims of Rosamond Gifford Zoo\u2019s breeding cycle: the Zoo celebrates a birth, the baby dies very young, or for those who manage to survive infanthood, they are shipped back and forth endlessly to reproduce and continue the cycle. None of this is acceptable. Rosamond Gifford Zoo must stop forcing elephants to suffer the often lethal consequences of breeding and send these suffering elephant families to accredited sanctuaries.\nWhat You Can Do\nHere's some of the ways you can take action for elephants...\nSign our alerts for elephants:\nTAKE ACTION\nBecome an elephant defender today:\nDONATE"}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Fun Facts About Africa's Baby Safari Animals - TripSavvy", "url": "https://www.tripsavvy.com/facts-about-africas-baby-safari-animals-1454088", "text": "In this article, we look at a few African safari animals and the adaptations that they have developed to help them through their vulnerable infancy. Most animals are born at the start of the rainy season when food is plentiful and life is relatively easy. If you want to see baby animals on safari, this is the best time to go.\nHowever, there's more to these tiny creatures than their adorable appearance. Unlike human infants, wild babies have to adapt quickly to life in the bush. Prey animals like Wildebeest and Impala have to be able to run within a few hours of being born, and even predator cubs have to learn quickly how to avoid danger.\nBaby animals are heart-warmingly cute, and the offspring of Africa's safari animals are no exception. From elephant calves covered in ginger fuzz to playful lion and cheetah cubs, spotting baby animals is a highlight of any safari.\n01 of 07 Lion Cub Andy Rouse / Stone / Getty Images Lion cubs are usually born as part of a litter of up to four siblings. Female lions often synchronize births so that all of the pride's cubs are born around the same time. In this way, females can take turns caring for the cubs, which will suckle indiscriminately from any of the mothers as they get older. Lion cubs are blind for the first week but can crawl within a few days. They learn to walk at around 3 weeks old and are fully weaned by the age of 7 months. The first weeks are the most vulnerable, and during this time the mother lion hides her cubs in patches of long grass to avoid detection by other predators. As they become more stable, cubs play with each other, instinctively mimicking behaviors and strategies useful for hunting. The two biggest threats to lion cubs are starvation and infanticide. The latter happens when a new male takes over the pride and kills the offspring of his predecessor. The best places to see lion cubs in the wild include South Africa's Kruger National Park,\u200b Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, and the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.\n02 of 07 Elephant Calf Arno Meintjes Wildlife / Getty Images Elephant calves may be small compared to their parents, but they still weigh around 260 pounds (150 kilograms) at birth. Thanks to an incredible 22 month gestation period, baby elephants are well developed when they finally arrive and can walk within a few hours of being born. Baby elephants are unsure what to do with their trunks at first and will often suck on them in the same way that a human baby sucks their thumb. Elephants grow quickly, drinking around three gallons of milk every day. Their family unit is so strong that if a mother dies or is unable to care for her baby, the calf will be taken care of and nursed by a surrogate mother. Calves are usually weaned by the time they reach their first birthday, although they still depend on the herd for protection for at least another year after that. Female elephants stay with the herd for the rest of their lives, while males will eventually leave to form their own herd. Great places to see elephants in Africa include Botswana's Chobe National Park, South Africa's Addo Elephant Park, and Tarangire National Park in Tanzania.\n03 of 07 Gorilla Infant Fabian von Poser / Getty Images Like human babies, baby gorillas are called infants\u2014and with only around 880 mountain gorillas left in the world, it's a real privilege to see them in the wild. Gorillas are also similar to humans in that gestation takes around eight and a half months, and female gorillas have an average of three offspring during their lifetime. Twins do occur but are relatively rare. Newborns typically weigh in at around 4.5 pounds (2 kilograms)\u200b and are entirely dependent on their mothers until they learn to crawl at about 2 months old. Baby gorillas can walk by the time they're 9 months old, but are only truly independent of their parents at around 3 years old. For the first few months, baby gorillas ride on their mother's back, using their powerful fingers to grip tightly onto her long hair. Unlike most other African animals, mountain gorillas do not have a specific breeding season\u2014which means that if you join a gorilla trek in Rwanda, Uganda or the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DMC), you stand a chance of seeing infants all year round.\n04 of 07 Cheetah Cub Tom Applegate / Getty Images Cheetahs are usually born in litters of three to five cubs. Cubs can weigh as little as 5.3 ounces (150 grams) at birth, although newborns are already capable of crawling and spitting. It takes up to 11 days for the cubs' eyes to open, and two weeks for them to start walking. In the wild, cheetah cubs are extremely vulnerable to predation by larger cats, so their mothers keep them well hidden for the first few weeks. They also have a mantle of long, bluish fur that disappears over time. It is thought that this acts as a deterrent to would-be predators, by helping the cubs resemble the fierce honey badger. Cheetah cubs are weaned by 6 months and start attempting to chase small animals around the same time. It usually takes over a year for juvenile cheetahs to make their first successful kill, however. In the meantime, they remain dependent on their mothers for meat. It's a rare treat to see baby cheetahs on safari, but your best bet is in the Serengeti, the Maasai Mara, and South Africa's Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park.\nContinue to 5 of 7 below.\n05 of 07 Giraffe Calf Kenneth Canning / Getty Images Giraffe calves are usually born singly, or more rarely, as twins. Female giraffes give birth standing up\u2014so that the calf starts its life by falling several feet to the ground. Newborn giraffes are already over an astonishing six feet (2 meters) tall and are able to walk and even run within a few hours of being born. \u200bCo-ordination takes a little longer to achieve, however! The giraffe's small horns, or ossicones, are flattened in the womb to make birth easier, but become erect within a few days. These horns help the calf to regulate its body temperature, and if it's a male, it will one day be used in fights with other giraffes. Calves are typically weaned at around 18 months but will start to try vegetation as early as 2 months. Despite their impressive height, baby giraffes are a target for hungry lions. They depend on their mother's powerful kick for defense. Like gorillas, giraffes have no set breeding season. They are easily spotted at most private and national reserves in Southern and East Africa.\n06 of 07 Spotted Hyena Cub Arno Meintjes Wildlife / Getty Images Spotted hyena cubs are almost always born in pairs. They are well developed and are the largest of all carnivore offspring in relation to the weight of their mothers. Spotted hyena cubs are also unique in that they are born with their eyes open, and with sharp canine teeth that can measure up to a quarter-inch (7 millimeters) in length. It is common for hyena cubs to attack their siblings, and often the weaker will be killed. Despite their teeth, spotted hyena cubs suckle their mothers for up to 16 months, growing strong on milk that has the highest protein content of any terrestrial carnivore. Spotted hyenas are quick to develop, displaying territorial and even sexual behavior before they are even a month old. After just one year, they are already adept hunters and can start producing their own young at 3 years of age. Spotted hyenas are widespread throughout the top safari destinations of sub-Saharan Africa. Often, night safari drives offer the best sightings."}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Manatees Facts and Information | SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment", "url": "https://seaworld.org/animals/facts/mammals/manatees/", "text": "Scientific Classification\nCommon Name manatee, sea cow Kingdom Animalia Phylum Chordata Class Mammalia Order Sirenia Family Trichecidae Genus Species Trichechus inunguis, the Amazonian manatee. The Amazonian manatee is the smallest of the manatees. Several physical characteristics distinguish it from the other two species. It lacks nails on its pectoral fins, and usually has whitish patches on its underside.\nTrichechus manatus, the West Indian manatee. There are two subspecies of the West Indian manatee: the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) and the Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus). These subspecies are distinguished by differences in cranial measurements and by their geographic distribution.\nTrichechus senegalensis, the West African manatee. About the same size and shape of the West Indian manatee, the West African manatee differs in some important respects: position of the eyes, snout, and cranial bones.\nFast Facts\nDescription The manatee's body is streamlined, full around the middle and narrowing to a paddle-shaped tail.\nThe true color of a manatee is gray, although it may appear brownish gray. Amazonian manatees usually have white or pink patches on the belly and chest.\nOrganisms such as algae, which may grow on the skin of slow-moving individuals, alter the body color and make some manatees look more green or brown. Size Adult West Indian and West African manatees average about 3 m (10 ft.) in length. Large individuals may reach lengths of up to 4 m (13 ft.).\nAmazonian manatees are the smallest of all 3 species. They are shorter and more slender. The longest specimen measured 2.8 m (9.2 ft.). Weight Average adult weights are approximately 363 to 544 kg (800 to 1,200 lbs.). One particularly large Florida manatee weighed 1,655 kg (3,650 lbs.). Females are generally larger than males. A particularly large Amazonian manatee individual weighed 480 kg (1,058 lbs.). Diet Manatees are primarily herbivores. They feed on a wide variety of submerged, emergent, floating, and shoreline vegetation. Manatees in Florida feed on more than 60 species of plants including turtle grass, manatee grass, shoal grass, mangrove leaves, various algae, water hyacinth, acorns, and hydrilla. Manatees consume about 4% to 9% (15 to 49 kg or 32 to 108 lbs. for an average adult manatee) of their body weight in wet vegetation daily.\nIn Sierra Leone, Africa, the West African manatee is considered a pest because they consume fields of planted rice.\nManatees have occasionally been seen to eat foods other than plants. Antillean manatees have been known to eat fish from nets and West African manatees have been known to eat clams.\nSome Amazonian manatees living in deep bodies of water apparently fast during dry seasons (November and December) when water levels drop as much as 9 to 15 m (30 to 50 ft.), eliminating their access to vegetation.\nBecause manatees have a very low metabolic rate, it is speculated that Amazonian manatees are able to fast for up to seven months if necessary. Incubation The exact gestation period of most manatee species is not known and is poorly studied. It is known, however, that a Florida manatee's gestation is approximately 12 months. Sexual Maturity Male: Male manatees (bulls) are sexually mature by about 9 to 10 years, although some have produced viable sperm at 2 to 3 years of age.\nFemale: Female manatees (cows) are sexually mature as young as 3 years of age. Life Span Manatees probably live a maximum of about 50 to 60 years. Range All living manatee species are found in warm tropical and subtropical waters.\nThe West Indian manatee was once abundant throughout the tropic and subtropical western North and South Atlantic and Caribbean waters. However, the manatee's numbers have been greatly reduced and is rarely seen throughout its range.\nThe range of the Florida manatee is primarily peninsular Florida but extends as far north as Rhode Island. Manatees have been rescued near Houston, Texas, and Mississippi.\nAntillean manatees have a patchy distribution throughout the Caribbean, Mexico, and northeastern South America. The southern range extends through Central and South America to Brazil.\nWest African manatees range from Senegal to Angola, on the west coast of Africa.\nAmazonian manatees are the only species of manatee confined to fresh water. They inhabit the Amazon Basin, mostly in Brazil. They are uncommon or close to extinction in Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. Habitat The West Indian and West African manatees inhabit rivers, bays, canals, estuaries, and coastal areas rich in seagrass and other vegetation. They can live in fresh, saline (salt), and brackish waters. They move freely between extremes.\nWest Indian manatees may be found in any waterway over 1 m (3.25 ft.) deep and connected to the coast. They prefer waters with temperatures above 21\u00b0C (70\u00b0F). Florida manatees rarely venture into deep ocean waters. However, manatees have been spotted as far offshore as the Dry Tortugas Islands, approximately 81 km (50 mi.) west of Key West, Florida.\nWest African manatees live in quiet coastal areas, large rivers, lagoons, and connected lakes, where the water temperature is above 18\u00b0C (64\u00b0F).\nThe Amazonian manatee is restricted to fresh water. They are most common in floodplain lakes and channels in white-water river systems with water temperatures ranging from 25\u00b0 to 30\u00b0C (77\u00b0 to 86\u00b0F).\nThe patchy distribution of manatees throughout all their ranges is due to their search of suitable habitat: plentiful aquatic plants and a freshwater source of water to drink. Population Global: Populations of all species of manatees have apparently declined over the past hundred years. These declines are due to such causes as hunting for their meat, destruction of their habitats, boating, pollution, and low reproduction rates. Antillean, Amazonian, and West African manatee populations are not known due to inadequate scientific research.\nRegional: An aerial census is done at least once a year on the Florida manatee. The Florida manatee census taken in February, 2004, found 2,505 individuals. The 2005 survey was 3,143. These figures represent the minimum amount of manatees known to be in the state of Florida at the time of the census. Detailed Florida manatee mortality statistics can be found at http://myfwc.com/research/manatee/rescue-mortality-response/mortality-statistics/ Status IUCN: All 4 species of sirenians are endangered or threatened.\nCITES: All 4 species of sirenians are Appendix I\nUSFWS: West Indian manatee, Florida manatee, and Antillean manatee are threatened: Amazonian manatee is endangered\nFun Facts\nManatees average 3 m (10 ft.) and 363 to 544 kg (800 to 1,200 lbs.). Manatees have paddle-like tails and foreflippers, and no hind limbs. Manatees belong to the mammalian order Sirenia. There are 3 species of manatee: Trichechus inunguis, the Amazonian manatee; Trichechus senegalensis, the West African manatee; and Trichechus manatus, the West Indian manatee. Scientists also recognize 2 subspecies of West Indian manatee: T.m. latirostris, the Florida manatee, and T.m. manatus, the Antillean manatee. The order Sirenia has one other living species, the dugong. A fifth species, Steller's sea cow, was hunted to extinction by 1768. All manatees inhabit tropical and subtropical waters of North and South America and Africa. The West Indian and West African manatees live in rivers, bays, estuaries, and coastal areas. They can move freely between freshwater and saltwater habitats. The Amazonian manatee is restricted to the freshwater Amazon basin. All manatees are herbivores. The Florida manatee feeds on more that 60 varieties of grasses and plants. A manatee's only teeth are molars, for grinding vegetation. Some research suggests that manatees periodically require fresh water. West Indian manatees have been seen congregating at river mouths and drinking from hoses, culverts, and sewage outfalls. A female manatee, called a cow, can give birth about once every 3 years. Gestation lasts about 12 months. At birth, West Indian manatees measure about 1.2 to 1.4 m (4 to 4.5 ft.) and weigh 27 to 32 kg (60 to 70 lbs.). A calf nurses from teats under the mother's pectoral flippers. Florida manatees are highly susceptible to cold; it's not unusual for them to die during extremely cold weather. But human activities pose a much greater threat to manatees. Each year, many Florida manatees are killed and injured by watercraft, the greatest human-induced cause of Florida manatee deaths. Other threats include entanglement, poaching, and habitat destruction. All manatees are threatened or endangered. They are protected by national and local legislation in every country in which they are found. Manatees are nonaggressive, nonterritorial herbivores that spend most of their time feeding (6 to 8 hours per day) and resting (2 to 12 hours per day). The remainder of their day is spent traveling, investigating objects, and socializing by interacting with other manatees. Marine zoological parks such as SeaWorld help conserve manatees. SeaWorld is authorized to rescue and rehabilitate ill, injured, or orphaned manatees. The first priority of the Manatee Rescue and Rehabilitation program is to return healthy manatees to their natural habitat. Manatees emit sounds under water. The chirps, whistles, or squeaks are probably produced in the larynx. They seem to make these sounds when they are frightened, sexually aroused, or interacting with each other. Manatees have well-developed eyes. In the water, they can detect objects from tens of meters away. A manatee's retinas contain both rod and cone cells, indicating that they probably have the ability to see both dim and bright light. Recent tests suggest manatees can distinguish between blue and green colors, although the full extent of their color vision is unknown and more studies are needed. For more information about manatees, explore the Manatee Info Book.\nEcology and Conservation\nAll species of sirenians are protected to some extent by national or local acts in every country they inhabit.\nFederal and state laws have been passed that protect Florida manatees. Federal laws prohibit hunting, capturing, killing, or harassing these animals. These laws include the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Penalties for breaking these federal laws could include a year in prison and a fine up to $20,000.\nThe Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act of 1978 is state legislation that allows the establishment of manatee sanctuaries in Florida.\nWest African manatees are protected under Class A of the African Convention of Nature and Natural Resources, signed by 38 African countries.\nAmazonian manatee hunting has been prohibited since 1973.\nThe Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is an international treaty developed in 1973 to regulate trade of wildlife items. All species of sirenians are protected by this treaty.\nBibliography\nNowak, R. M. and J. L. Paradiso. Walker's Mammals of the World.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephants - An English-Zone.Com Reading Text and Quiz at English-Zone.Com", "url": "http://english-zone.com/reading/elefants.html", "text": "The elephant is the largest animal to walk on Earth. An elephant can carry a load of 1200 pounds. They eat 300 pounds of food a day. An elephant baby can weigh 200 pounds at birth. Elephants can live up to 70 years. Elephants can be trained to carry logs with their trunks, and have been used in the forestry industry in Asia for many years. Elephants also use their trunks for drinking water, bathing, and eating and communicating. Recently it was discovered that elephants can communicate over a distance of several miles using infrasonic sounds inaudible to humans. Elephants use their ears as a cooling system. Blood flows through veins in the ears and as the elephant flaps his ears, the blood cools and flows through his body to cool off other parts. Elephant feet are large and round. They distribute the large animal's weight effectively. In the past, elephants were killed and their feet were made into umbrella stands and small tables for tourists. Now elephants are protected by special laws. There are two kinds of elephants: the African elephant and the Indian elephant. African elephants can be identified by the larger ears. The African elephant grows up to 10 feet tall and weighs as much as 12,000 pounds. The Indian elephant grows up to 9 feet tall, and weighs up to 8000 pounds. It's easier to identify because of its smaller ears. Most circus elephants are Indian elephants. Another name for the Indian elephant is the Asian elephant. Unfortunately, there is a growing conflict between elephants and humans as more of the elephants' habitat is developed. Elephants can destroy the crops of an entire village in a single night, and this also causes conflict. At the moment, there are about 600,000 elephants remaining in Africa. The greatest threat to elephants is the ivory trade. Most commercial ivory comes from elephant's tusks. From 1979 to 1989 was a bad time for African elephants. About 70,000 wild elephants were killed for ivory each year. In 1989 an international treaty limited the trade in ivory, decreasing the number of elephants killed, but elephants are still being killed for ivory. Please don't ever buy anything made from ivory!

This means that they are only found in Australia, and nowhere else on Earth.\nMarsupials\nMany of Australia\u2019s best-known animals are marsupials. Although marsupials are also present in the Americas, around 70% of the world\u2019s marsupial species are found on the Australian continent (which includes mainland Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea).\nMarsupials are mammals whose young are born at an early stage of development. After being born, the tiny infant marsupial crawls into a special pouch in its mother\u2019s body. Here it feeds on its mother\u2019s milk and continues to develop in safety until ready to emerge.\nAnimals such as kangaroos, possums, koalas and bandicoots are marsupials. You\u2019ll meet all of these \u2013 and more \u2013 in the list below!\nAustralian Animals List with Pictures & Facts\nScroll down to see all of the animals in alphabetical order, or use the index below to find a specific species:\nAustralian Magpie\nScientific name: Gymnorhina tibicen\nType of animal: Bird, member of the family Artamidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe Australian magpie is one of the most familiar Australian birds. This common species is found in habitats ranging from urban areas to forests, and is present across most of the country, only missing in some desert regions.\nThe Australian magpie has black and white plumage and orange-brown eyes. It is a similar size to the Eurasian magpie, but unlike that species is not a member of the crow family, Corvidae. Instead, it is a member of the family Artamidae, which also includes the butcherbirds.\nThe Australian magpie is famous for its warbling call.\nBack to animal index\nAustralian Sea Lion\nScientific name: Neophoca cinerea\nType of animal: Mammal, member of the eared seal family Otariidae.\nConservation status: Endangered\nThe Australian sea lion is a member of a group of animals known as the pinnipeds, which contains the seals, sea lions and walrus. The Australian sea lion is the only pinniped endemic to (only found in) Australia. The species is present along the southern and southwestern coastlines of the country.\nThis aquatic mammal feeds mainly on fish and molluscs such as squid and cuttlefish. It is also known to eat penguins.\nThe Australian sea lion was once heavily hunted. Although it is now protected, the population has not fully recovered.\nToday the species\u2019 primary threats are commercial fishing (although not targeted by the fishermen, the Australian sea lion often becomes entangled in gillnets) and habitat degradation.\nYou can find out more about the Australian sea lion here: Australian Sea Lion Facts\nBack to animal index\nBandicoot\nNumber of species: around 20\nType of animal: Mammal, member of the marsupial order Peramelemorphia (bandicoots and bilbies)\nBandicoots are a group of around 20 omnivorous, ground-dwelling marsupials found in Australia and New Guinea. They are rat-like animals with hunched backs, thin tapered noses and relatively long legs. Most are rabbit-sized. The largest bandicoot found in Australia is the northern brown bandicoot.\nBandicoots are found throughout Australia. They live in a variety of habitats, ranging from gardens to rainforests.\nBandicoots forage using their sensitive noses to detect food such as insects and earthworms buried in the ground, which they excavate with their forepaws. The holes that they leave in the ground are known as \u2018snout-pokes\u2019.\nYou can find out more about bandicoots here: Bandicoot Facts\nBack to animal index\nBarramundi\nScientific name: Lates calcarifer\nType of animal: Fish, member of the family Latidae\nConservation status: Unassessed\nThe barramundi is a fish found on the tropical coastline of northern Australia. It has large silver scales and a humped back, and grows up to around 1.6 m (5.3 ft.) in length.\nThe barramundi is found in both freshwater and marine habitats. It lives in rivers and travels downriver to breed in estuaries and coastal wetlands. Some populations spend all of their lives in marine environments.\nBarramundi begin their lives as males, but most become female after one or more spawning seasons.\nBack to animal index\nBilby (Greater)\nScientific name: Macrotis lagotis\nType of animal: Mammal, member of the marsupial order Peramelemorphia (bandicoots and bilbies)\nConservation status: Vulnerable\nSince the lesser bilby became extinct in the 1950\u2019s, the greater bilby is the only surviving bilby. (For this reason the greater bilby is often known simply as the \u2018bilby\u2019.)\nOnce present throughout southern Australia, the greater bilby is now only found in desert regions in central Australia.\nUnlike other bandicoots, the bilby is a burrowing animal. It is equipped with powerful forelimbs and robust claws. The female\u2019s pouch is rear-opening to prevent earth from entering while burrowing. The species\u2019 long ears give it the alternative name of \u2018rabbit-eared bandicoot\u2019.\nThe bilby uses its long tongue to forage for seeds, insects and bulbs.\nYou can find out more about bilbies here: Bilby Facts\nBack to animal index\nBlack Swan\nScientific name: Cygnus atratus\nType of animal: Bird, family Anatidae (the duck, geese and swan family)\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe black swan is a large waterbird found in wetlands throughout Australia. The species is an emblem of Western Australia, and appears on the state\u2019s flag and coat of arms.\nThis distinctive Australian bird has black plumage and a bright red bill with a pale tip. When it is flying or has its wings raised in an aggressive display its white flight feathers can be seen.\nThe black swan is mainly herbivorous, feeding on aquatic plants and algae. It uses its long neck to reach food, \u2018up-ending\u2019 with its head and shoulders submerged when necessary.\nBack to animal index\nBowerbirds\nType of animal: Birds, family Ptilonorhynchidae\nNumber of species: 20\nNumber of species found in Australia: 20\nBowerbirds are a family of birds found in Australia and New Guinea. Of the 20 species of bowerbird, 10 are found in Australia. Most live in rainforests and other forest habitats.\nBowerbirds are famous for their courtship ritual. This involves the male building an elaborate structure known as a bower on the forest floor. The bower is made out of sticks, and decorated with flowers, vegetation, and brightly-coloured objects, including man-made items.\nFemales usually mate with the male who has built the most impressive bower. The bower is built purely for courtship, and is not used as a nest.\nOne of the best-known Australian bowerbirds is the satin bowerbird, a species found in the coastal forests of eastern Australia. The male has glossy blue-black plumage, the female is olive-brown. Both have bright blue eyes.\nBack to animal index\nBrolga\nScientific name: Antigone rubicunda\nType of animal: Bird, member of the family Gruidae (the crane family)\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe brolga is a member of the crane family found in Australia and New Guinea. It was formerly known as the \u2018native companion\u2019. In Australia, it is found in wetlands and wet grasslands in the north, east and south-east of the country. The species is also found in New Guinea.\nLike all cranes, the brolga is a large, tall bird with long, thin legs and a long neck. Its plumage is grey and there is a red patch on the back of the head.\nAlthough the species\u2019 conservation status is \u2018Least Concern\u2019, it is thought that its numbers are declining, mainly as a result of habitat loss.\nBack to animal index\nBudgerigar\nScientific name: Melopsittacus undulatus\nType of animal: Bird, member of the order Psittaciformes (Parrots)\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe budgerigar is a small member of the true parrot superfamily, Psittacoidea. It is found in a variety of habitats, including deserts, farmland and urban gardens, and is present throughout much of Australia. The species has also been introduced to the United States.\nThe budgie is nomadic, moving from area to area in search of water and the seeds on which it feeds.\nThe budgie is the world\u2019s third most popular pet. In the wild its plumage is predominantly yellow and green, but captive birds have been selectively bred in a number of colour variations, including blue, grey and all yellow.\nBack to animal index\nCairns Birdwing Butterfly\nScientific name: Ornithoptera euphorion\nType of animal: Insect, member of the birdwing genus Trogonoptera, part of the swallowtail family Papilionidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nWith a wingspan of up to 15 cm (5.9 in), the Cairns birdwing is one of the largest butterflies found in Australia. The species is endemic to Australia. It lives in the tropical rainforests of northeast Queensland.\nMale Cairns birdwing butterflies are smaller than the females, but considerably more brightly-coloured. Their wings are a striking mix of black, yellow and green, while those of the females are mainly black with yellow patterning.\nThe species takes its name from Cairns, a coastal city in Queensland which is at the centre of the insect\u2019s range.\nBack to animal index\nCamel (Feral)\nGenus: Camelus\nType of animal: Mammal, member of the order Artiodactyla (the even-toed ungulates)\nConservation status: Domestic\nThere are around 300,000 feral camels living in Australia. Most are the dromedaries, but a number of feral Bactrian camels are also present. These large, hooved mammals were introduced during the 19th century, when they were used as transport.\nThe feral camel population of Australia was once as large as 600,000 individuals. Due to the damage this introduced species was causing to indigenous wildlife, measures were taken between 2009 and 2013 to reduce the population to its current size.\nYou can find out more about the Bactrian camel here: Bactrian Camel Facts\nBack to animal index\nCane Toad\nScientific name: Rhinella marina\nType of animal: Amphibian, member of the true toad family Bufonidae.\nConservation status: Least Concern\nMany Australians would rather the cane toad was not on a list of Australian animals! The amphibian is an invasive species in Australia and has spread rapidly across the country since its introduction in the 1940s.\nThe insect-eating frog was brought to Australia from its native South America in order to reduce the population of crop-destroying grey-backed cane beetles.\nUnfortunately, the cane toad bred rapidly and quickly spread across north-eastern Australia. The species\u2019 introduction has been catastrophic to many native Australian species, who fall ill after eating the poisonous toad.\nYou can find out more about cane toads here: Cane Toad Facts\nBack to animal index\nCassowary\nGenus: Casuarius\nNumber of species: 3\nNumber of species found in Australia: 1 (The southern cassowary)\nType of animal: Bird, member of the family Casuariidae (which also includes the emu)\nCassowaries are large, flightless birds found in Australia and New Guinea. There are three species of cassowary; only the Southern Cassowary (scientific name Casuarius casuarius) is found in Australia (the species is also found in New Guinea).\nThe southern cassowary inhabits the rainforests of north-eastern Australia. It is the world\u2019s second-heaviest bird, and the third-tallest.\nThe species is mainly black, with a blue neck and red collar. Its wattles (the fleshy growths that hang from the bird\u2019s neck) are red. On the cassowary\u2019s head is a bony, pointed, helmet-like structure known as a casque.\nCassowaries are fast runners. Their feet are equipped with dagger-like inner claws which may be used as weapons if the bird feels threatened.\nThe conservation status of the southern cassowary is Least Concern.\nYou can find out more about cassowaries here: Cassowary Facts\nBack to animal index\nCommon Stingaree\nScientific name: Trygonoptera testacea\nType of animal: Fish, superorder Batoidea (rays)\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe common stingaree is a stingray found in the coastal waters of south-eastern Australia. It is the commonest ray found in this region.\nLike all stingrays, the common stingaree has a round, flat body and long tail. It propels itself through the water with wave-like undulations of its wings. Its tail is equipped with either one or two venomous spines.\nThe species lives on sandbanks and mudflats, often lying partly buried on the sea bed. Although the fish will usually flee from bathers, if surprised it will lash out with its spines, and is capable of inflicting nasty injuries.\nBack to animal index\nCrocodiles\nType of animal: Reptile, member of the subfamily Crocodylinae (the true crocodiles)\nNumber of species found in Australia: 2 (the saltwater crocodile and the freshwater crocodile)\nConservation status (both species): Least Concern\nThere are two species of crocodile found in Australia: the freshwater crocodile and the larger saltwater crocodile.\nThe freshwater crocodile is a relatively small crocodile. It is endemic to Australia and is found in rivers and wetlands in the north of the country.\nThe saltwater crocodile is the largest reptile not only in Australia but also the world. In fact, this cold-blooded giant is the world\u2019s largest land predator. It is found on and near the coast in northern Australia, as well as in New Guinea and several Southeast Asian countries.\nBoth Australian crocodiles have armour-plated skin and strong jaws full of sharp teeth. Crocodiles are ambush predators, which means that they lie in wait for their prey to draw near before attacking with explosive speed and power.\nThe freshwater crocodile will usually only attack a human if threatened. It is capable of delivering a powerful bite.\nThe saltwater crocodile, due to its size, power and ferocity, is an extremely dangerous animal and areas in which it is found are best avoided.\nYou can find out more about the freshwater crocodile here: Freshwater Crocodile Facts\nYou can find out more about the saltwater crocodile here: Saltwater Crocodile Facts\nBack to animal index\nDingo\nScientific name: Canis lupus dingo\nType of animal: Mammal, member of the dog family Canidae\nConservation status: Vulnerable\nThe dingo is a large wild dog with sandy-gold fur. It lives in desert, grassland and forest habitats.\nMost zoologists consider the dingo to be a subspecies of grey wolf, giving it the scientific name Canis lupus dingo. Others consider the dingo to be a separate species in its own right, giving it the scientific name Canis dingo.\nThe dingo\u2019s closest relative is the New Guinea singing dog, a wild dog found on New Guinea.\nDingoes live and hunt in packs. Using teamwork they are able to bring down animals as large as the red kangaroo.\nYou can find out more about this species here: Dingo Facts\nBack to animal index\nDugong\nScientific name: Dugong dugon\nType of animal: Mammal, member of the order Sirenia\nConservation status: Vulnerable\nThe dugong is a marine mammal which, together with the three species of manatee, is a member of the order Sirenia. It is a large, round-bodied animal. Its unique, broad, downwards-pointing snout is an adaptation for feeding on seagrass.\nDugongs can live for up to 70 years, and in the past have been hunted for meat and oil. Today the main threats to the species are entanglement in gillnets, hunting, and boat strikes.\nYou can find out more about the dugong here: Dugong Facts\nBack to animal index\nEastern Brown Snake\nScientific name: Pseudonaja textilis\nType of animal: Reptile, member of the family Elapidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nBoth of the world\u2019s two most venomous snakes \u2013 the eastern brown snake and the inland taipan \u2013 are found in Australia.\nAlthough the venom of the eastern brown snake is less powerful than that of the inland taipan, the species is considered more dangerous, as it is found near human habitations and has an aggressive temperament. It is responsible for more fatalities per year in Australia than any other snake.\nThe eastern brown snake grows to lengths of up 2 m (7 ft.). It is a relatively thin snake that ranges in colour from pale to dark brown. It is found in a variety of habitats across eastern Australia.\nBack to animal index\nEastern Long-Necked Turtle\nScientific name: Chelodina longicollis\nType of animal: Reptile, member of the family Chelidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe eastern long-necked turtle is found in rivers and wetlands in south eastern Australia. It has a round, plate-sized carapace (shell) which is black or brown with black grooves. The species\u2019 neck is over half of the length of its shell.\nEastern long-neck turtles are members of the suborder Pleurodira, one of two turtle suborders (the other being the Cryptodira). Members of this suborder withdraw their heads into their shells with a sideways, rather than a straight, motion.\nBack to animal index\nEchidna (Short Beaked)\nScientific name: Tachyglossus aculeatus\nType of animal: Mammal, order Monotremata (the monotremes)\nConservation status: Least Concern\nEchidnas are members of a unique group of mammals known as monotremes. Unlike every other type of mammal the five species that make up the order Monotremata lay eggs rather than giving birth to live young. The monotremes comprise four species of echidna and the platypus.\nThe short-beaked echidna is the only echidna found in Australia. It is present throughout much of the country, and is also found in New Guinea.\nThe short-beaked echidna is a small to medium-sized animal, usually between 30 and 45 cm in length. Its most distinctive characteristic is its coat of hard spines. It is equipped with powerful forelimbs and clawed feet, and is capable of burrowing at high speeds.\nEchidnas are also known as \u2018spiny anteaters\u2019, but \u2013 although their diet consists of ants and termites \u2013 they are not related to the anteaters of the Americas.\nYou can find out more about echidnas here: Echidna Facts\nBack to animal index\nEmu\nScientific name: Dromaius novaehollandiae\nType of animal: Bird, member of the family Casuariidae (which also includes the cassowaries).\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe emu is a large flightless bird endemic to Australia. With an average weight of 33 kg (73 lb), it is the world\u2019s 5th largest bird, and the second-largest in Australia, after the southern cassowary.\nAlthough second to the southern cassowary in weight, the emu can reach a height of 1.9 metres (6.2 ft.), making it Australia\u2019s tallest bird.\nThe emu\u2019s plumage is light brown, and its sparsely-feathered neck is pale blue.\nThe flightless emu evades potential predators using its acute eyesight and hearing, and if necessary its high speed: it is capable of running at up to 48 km/h (30 mph). If cornered it can defend itself with its sharp claws and powerful legs.\nBack to animal index\nFairy Penguin\nScientific name: Eudyptula minor\nType of animal: Bird, member of the penguin family Spheniscidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe little penguin, commonly known as the fairy penguin in Australia, is the smallest species of penguin, standing at around 33 cm (13 in) tall and weighing around 1.5 kg (3.3 lb).\nThis small seabird is found along the south coast of Australia, both on the mainland and on coastal islands. The species is also found in New Zealand.\nThe dark sections of the little penguin\u2019s plumage are blue-grey in colour, giving the species the name \u2018little blue penguin\u2019 in New Zealand.\nLike all penguins the little penguin is flightless, its wings having adapted into flippers that allow it to \u2018fly\u2019 through the water. The little penguin spends around 80% of its life at sea, where it forages for fish and squid.\nYou can find out more about little penguins here: Little Penguin Facts\nBack to animal index\nFlatback Sea Turtle\nScientific name: Natator depressus\nType of animal: Reptile, member of the family Cheloniidae\nConservation status: Data Deficient\nThe flatback sea turtle is found in the coastal waters of northern Australia and New Guinea, but only nests on the islands and beaches of northern Australia.\nThis large marine reptile is the least migratory of the seven species of sea turtle. It can be distinguished from other sea turtles by its comparatively flat shell.\nYou can find out more about the flatback sea turtle animal here: Flatback Sea Turtle Facts\nBack to animal index\nFrill-Necked Lizard\nScientific name: Chlamydosaurus kingii\nType of animal: Reptile, member of the family Agamidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe frill-necked lizard is a large lizard found across northern Australia. The species is arboreal (tree-dwelling) and usually found in the canopy layer of forests and woodlands. Its average length is 85 cm (2.79 ft.).\nThe frill-necked lizard gets its name from the large ruff of brightly-coloured skin around its neck. The ruff is connected to the lizard\u2019s jaw bone. When threatened, the lizard opens the ruff out like an umbrella. This impressive display is intended to startle a potential predator, giving the lizard a chance to escape.\nYou can find-out more about this distinctive Australian reptile here: Frill-Necked Lizard Facts\nBack to animal index\nGalah\nScientific name: Eolophus roseicapilla\nType of animal: Bird, member of the family Cacatuidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe galah is a highly-social parrot with a widespread distribution across Australia. It occupies a diverse range of habitats, including woodlands, shrublands, meadows and urban areas.\nThe species forms large, noisy flocks that forage on the ground, feeding on the seeds of grasses, herbs and crops.\nA member of the cockatoo family Cacatuidae, the galah is easily identified by the vibrant pink-coloured feathers on its head, neck, and underparts, and by the paler pink crest that can either be held erect or laid back. The wings, back, and tail are grey.\nAlthough males and females look very similar, they can be distinguished by the colour of their irises: red or mid-brown for females and dark brown for males.\nBack to animal index\nGiant Burrowing Cockroach\nScientific name: Macropanesthia rhinoceros\nType of animal: Insect, member of the family Blaberidae.\nConservation status: Unassessed\nThe giant burrowing cockroach is the heaviest cockroach in the world, weighing up to 35 g and reaching a length of up to 8 cm. It has a lifespan of up to 10 years.\nThe giant burrowing cockroach doesn\u2019t have wings, and spends much of its life underground in burrows that can be up to 1m deep. The species emerges from its burrow at night to feed.\nUnlike most insects, the giant burrowing cockroach gives birth to live young rather than laying eggs. The species is ovoviviparous, with the eggs hatching inside the mother\u2019s body prior to being born.\nFemales give birth in underground chambers and care for their young for up to six months, at which point the young leave the chamber to fend for themselves.\nThe giant burrowing cockroach is mostly found in the tropical regions of Queensland, and prefers areas with sandy soil. Unlike other cockroaches, it is not considered a pest. The species plays an essential role in the ecosystem by consuming dead leaves and recycling matter.\nBack to animal index\nGiant Clam\nScientific name: Tridacna gigas\nType of animal: Bivalve, member of the family Cardiidae.\nConservation status: Vulnerable\nTridacna gigas, one of several species known as \u2018giant clams\u2019, is the world\u2019s largest bivalve mollusc. The species reaches lengths of up to 1.5 m and can exceed 500 lbs in weight. It is found in the warm waters of the South Pacific and Indian Ocean.\nThe giant clam\u2019s mantle is generally yellow or green with blue or purple spots. The clam\u2019s stunning colours are a result of algae that live within the mollusc\u2019s tissue.\nThe clam and its resident algae have a symbiotic relationship (a relationship between species that is mutually beneficial). The clam receives nutrients produced by the algae as a result of photosynthesis. In return, the algae receives carbon dioxide, phosphates, nitrates, and a place to live.\nThe giant clam\u2019s \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 conservation status is a result of its having been over-harvested for food and the aquarium trade.\nBack to animal index\nGoanna\nType of animal: Reptile, lizards in the genus Varanus (the monitor lizards)\nNumber of species found in Australia: 25\nGoannas are lizards in the genus Varanus (a group known as the monitor lizards). There are 25 goanna species found in Australia, and a further 5 species found in Southeast Asia.\nThe perentie (Varanus giganteus), which grows up to 2.5 m (8 ft. 2 in) in length, is Australia\u2019s largest lizard, and the fourth-largest lizard in the world. Australia\u2019s smallest goanna is the short-tailed monitor.\nGoannas are carnivores, equipped with sharp teeth and claws. Their diet consists of a variety of invertebrate and vertebrate species, including insects, spiders, snakes, birds, marsupials and rodents.\nGoannas aren\u2019t fussy eaters; in general the larger the goanna, the larger the prey animal it will consume. Goannas will also scavenge on carrion.\nYou can find out more about goannas here: Goanna Facts\nYou can find out more about the perentie here: Perentie Facts\nBack to animal index\nGoliath Stick Insect\nScientific name: Eurycnema goliath\nType of animal: Insect, member of the family Phasmatidae.\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe Goliath stick insect is found along the Australian east coast and southern Queensland. Despite being one of the largest insects in Australia, its camouflage and stick-like body make it tricky to find.\nFemale Goliath stick insects are much larger than males, reaching up to 25 cm in length.\nLike many stick insects, the goliath stick insect is capable of parthenogenesis, a form of reproduction that does not require mating.\nDespite having wings, females are unable to fly due to the size of their bodies. The smaller, thinner males are capable of flight.\nBack to animal index\nGreat White Shark\nScientific name: Carcharodon carcharias\nType of animal: Fish, member of the mackerel shark order Lamniformes\nConservation status: Vulnerable\nOne of the most feared of all ocean predators, the great white shark can grow to over 6 metres (19.7 ft.) in length. It is found in oceans all around the world, including those around Australia.\nThis big fish preys on a variety of animals, with juveniles more likely to target fish, and adults more likely to target marine mammals such as seals, dolphins and other cetaceans. The great white is also known to attack humans.\nThe great white shark uses a \u2018sixth sense\u2019 when hunting. Organs known as ampullae of Lorenzini in the shark\u2019s head act as electroreceptors, allowing the shark to sense the electrical fields produced in the muscles of other sea animals.\nYou can find out more about the great white shark here: Great White Shark Facts\nBack to animal index\nHercules Moth\nScientific name: Coscinocera hercules\nType of animal: Insect, member of the family Saturniidae.\nConservation status: Unassessed\nThe Hercules moth is Australia\u2019s largest moth and one of the three largest moths in the world. The species, which is found on New Guinea as well as in tropical Queensland, has a wingspan of up to 27 cm (10.63 in.). The surface area of this huge insect\u2019s wings is the largest of any insect.\nThe Hercules moth has large, brown wings with transparent windows and white edges. The female\u2019s wings are so large that it can often be mistaken for a bird. The male is smaller than the female and more vibrantly-coloured. Its wings have elongated tails.\nIn its imago stage (the winged, adult stage), the Hercules moth does not eat, and lives for only 2 to 8 days. Adult females emit pheromones which can be detected by males up to 3 km away. After mating, a female lays 80 to 100 eggs on the leaves of rainforest plants and dies shortly after.\nBack to animal index\nInland Taipan\nScientific name: Oxyuranus microlepidotus\nType of animal: Reptile, member of the family Elapidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe inland taipan is the world\u2019s most venomous snake. The potency of its venom is a result of the species having evolved specifically as a hunter of mammals. Just one bite is thought to contain enough venom to kill 100 men.\nDespite its formidable bite, the inland taipan is responsible for relatively few attacks on humans. Unlike the closely related coastal taipan (one of the world\u2019s most dangerous snakes), the species has a placid nature and lives in uninhabited areas.\nYou can find out more about this species here: Inland Taipan Facts\nBack to animal index\nKangaroo\nType of animal: Mammal, marsupial\nFamily: Macropodidae (the macropods)\nConservation status: A number of kangaroo species are under threat, in particular the tree kangaroos, many of which are endangered.\nNumber of species found in Australia: 4 species are commonly known as kangaroos; the family Macropodidae contains around 65 living species\nNo list of Australian animals would be complete without the kangaroo! There are over 30 million of these familiar marsupials living in Australia.\nThe family Macropodidae comprises the kangaroos, wallaroos and wallabies. It is mainly size that determines in which of these three groups an animal is placed; the largest species are known as kangaroos, the smallest as wallabies, and those in between are called wallaroos.\nFour species are commonly known as kangaroos. They are: the red kangaroo (Macropus rufus); the eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus); the western grey kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus); and the antilopine kangaroo (Macropus antilopinus). There are around 60 other species in the family Macropodidae.\nThe red kangaroo is not only the largest kangaroo, but also the largest living marsupial.\nKangaroos travel by hopping rather than by walking or running. This is a surprisingly efficient means of locomotion; kangaroos have special elasticated tendons which store and release energy as the kangaroo hops.\nKangaroos, like many of Australia\u2019s most famous animals, are marsupials. Marsupials are \u2018pouched mammals\u2019. After being born their babies \u2013 known as \u2018joeys\u2019 \u2013 climb into special pouches in their mothers\u2019 bodies. Here the joeys continue to grow for several more months before being able to jump around by themselves.\nYou can find out more about kangaroos here: Kangaroo Facts\nYou can find out more about the red kangaroo here: Red Kangaroo Facts\nBack to animal index\nKoala\nScientific name: Phascolarctos cinereus\nType of animal: Mammal, marsupial. The only living member of the family Phascolarctidae.\nConservation status: Vulnerable\nThe koala is one of the best-known of all Australian animals. This arboreal (tree-dwelling) marsupial is found mainly in eastern Australia.\nThe koala can be identified by its thick grey coat, prominent black nose and fluffy ears. It resembles a small bear, and because of this is sometimes known as the \u2018koala bear\u2019. However, the koala is not a bear; being a marsupial, it is not related to the true bears in the family Ursidae, which are placental mammals.\nKoalas spend most of their lives (up to 20 hours per day) sleeping. Their diet consists mainly of eucalyptus leaves, which contain little in the way of energy.\nDespite their cuddly appearance, male koalas can be surprisingly aggressive when competing for territory.\nYou can find out more about the koala here: Koala Facts\nBack to animal index\nKookaburra\nGenus: Dacelo\nType of animal: Birds, members of the kingfisher family Alcedinidae\nIf you\u2019ve ever been in the Australian bush and heard someone laughing, then don\u2019t worry, you weren\u2019t being made fun of; it was probably just a kookaburra \u2013 these Australian birds have a call that sounds like human laughter.\nKookaburras are birds in the subfamily of kingfishers known as the tree kingfishers, or Halcyoninae. The laughing kookaburra, with its famous call, is one of four species of kookaburra.\nKookaburras can be recognized by their large, powerful bills and the flashes of blue in their wings. Despite being members of the kingfisher family, they rarely eat fish, instead targeting a variety of small mammals and reptiles.\nYou can find out more about kookaburras here: Kookaburra Facts\nBack to animal index\nMarsupial Mole\nScientific name: Notoryctes caurinus; Notoryctes typhlops\nType of animal: Mammal, member of the family Notoryctidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThere are two species of marsupial mole: the northern marsupial mole (Notoryctes caurinus) and the southern marsupial mole (Notoryctes typhlops). Both inhabit the deserts of Western Australia.\nThese small, insectivorous (insect-eating) marsupials spend nearly all of their lives burrowing underground, rarely coming to the surface.\nMarsupial moles have undergone numerous adaptations for this underground lifestyle, including short limbs and powerful claws for digging, and the pouch of the female being rear-facing so as not to fill up with sand. Both species are completely blind.\nDespite being marsupials, marsupial moles are very similar in appearance to burrowing placental mammals such as the golden moles of Africa. This is an example of convergent evolution \u2013 the process by which unrelated species develop similar characteristics.\n(Another example of convergent evolution is the winged flight of both birds and bats.)\nBack to animal index\nMurray Cod\nScientific name: Maccullochella peelii\nType of animal: Ray-finned fish, member of the family Percichthyidae\nConservation status: Critically Endangered\nThe Murray cod is the largest native Australian freshwater fish species. It inhabits the Murray-Darling basin, an area which covers much of south-eastern Australia.\nThe species has a dark green mottled upper body and a creamy-white underside. It can weigh over 100 kg and reach lengths of up to 1.8 m long. Its lifespan can exceed 50 years.\nThe Murray cod is known to be a voracious and aggressive predator, feeding on other fish, ducks, snakes, mice, frogs, and even freshwater turtles.\nToday, this impressive fish is seriously threatened by commercial and recreational fishing, habitat destruction, water pollution, and invasive species.\nBack to animal index\nNumbat\nScientific name: Myrmecobius fasciatus\nType of animal: Marsupial, the only member of the family Myrmecobiidae\nConservation status: Endangered\nThe numbat is a small marsupial with an appearance somewhere between a cat and a rat. It has a pointed face, a long, bushy tail, and a series of distinctive white stripes running along its back.\nNumbats use their pointed muzzles to forage in the dirt for termites, which they scoop up with their long tongues.\nThe numbat has a number of natural predators, but it was the introduction of the red fox by settlers that led to the species becoming endangered. Today, only around 800 of this once widespread animal are left in the wild.\nYou can find out more about the numbat here: Numbat Facts\nBack to animal index\nPlatypus\nScientific name: Ornithorhynchus anatinus\nType of animal: Mammal, monotreme\nConservation status: Near Threatened\nThe platypus is one of Australia\u2019s best-known animals, and also one of the strangest. This distinctive mammal has the bill of a duck, the tail of a beaver, and the feet of an otter. It is also one of the few venomous mammals, with males being armed with a venomous spur on their feet.\nWhen the remains of a platypus were first brought to London for examination, the experts thought that someone was playing a trick on them!\nThe platypus belongs to a small group of mammals known as monotremes, whose members lay eggs instead of giving birth to their young. There are only five living monotremes: the platypus, and four species of echidna.\nThe platypus spends much of its life foraging for food on the beds of streams and rivers. It has electroreceptors in its bill with which it can detect electrical fields produced by the muscles of its prey.\nYou can find out more about the platypus here: Platypus Facts\nBack to animal index\nPossum\nType of animal: Marsupial\nSuborder: Phalangeriformes\nPossums are small to medium-sized nocturnal marsupials, most of which are arboreal (tree-dwelling). There are around 70 species of possum in the suborder Phalangeriformes. The group includes the \u2018gliders\u2019; a group of possums that have evolved the ability to glide from tree to tree.\nThe Tasmanian pygmy possum (Cercartetus lepidus) is the world\u2019s smallest possum, with a maximum nose to tail length of just 30 cm (12 in.).\nThe common brushtail possum is the largest possum found in Australia, and the world\u2019s third-largest possum, after the two bear cuscuses (which are both found in Indonesia).\nBack to animal index\nQueensland Lungfish / Barramunda\nScientific name: Neoceratodus forsteri\nType of animal: Lobe-finned fish, member of the family Ceratodontidae\nConservation status: Unassessed\nThe Queensland lungfish is a freshwater fish endemic to south-eastern Queensland. It is native to the Mary and Burnett River systems and has been introduced to other Queensland rivers, including the Coomera, Condamine, Albert and Logan.\nUnlike most other fishes, the Queensland lungfish is able to breathe air. It is one of six living lungfish species, and the only one found in Australia.\nWhereas the other five species of lungfish have two lungs and are unable to breathe with their gills, the Queensland lungfish has a single lung, which it uses in addition to its gills.\nThe species can live for up to 100 years.\nBack to animal index\nQuokka\nScientific name: Setonix brachyurus\nType of animal: Marsupial in the family Macropodidae\nConservation status: Vulnerable\nAround the size of a domestic cat, the quokka is an herbivorous marsupial that resembles a miniature kangaroo. It is a member of the same family, Macropodidae, as its kangaroo and wallaby cousins.\nThe quokka is found mainly on islands lying off the southwestern coast of Australia, with only a small population remaining on the mainland. The species suffered greatly as a result of the introduction of the red fox, and was once found across a much wider range.\nYou can find out more about the quokka here: Quokka Facts\nBack to animal index\nQuoll\nType of animal: Marsupials in the genus Dasyurus\nNumber of species found in Australia: 4\nQuolls are small to mid-sized, nocturnal, carnivorous marsupials. There are six species of quoll, four of which\u2013the western, eastern, northern and tiger quoll\u2013 are found in Australia. (The other two species\u2013the bronze quoll and the New Guinean quoll\u2013are found in New Guinea.)\nQuolls have brown or black coats marked with distinctive pale spots. They prey on small mammals, reptiles and birds.\nBoth the eastern quoll and the northern quoll are Endangered, while the conservation status of the other two Australian species is Near Threatened.\nLike many of Australia\u2019s native animals, quolls suffered greatly with the introduction of non-native predators such as the red fox and domestic cat.\nOne of the main threats to quolls comes in the form of another non-native animal: the cane toad. Although not predatory, the cane toad is poisonous. Native Australian animals that prey on the amphibian are likely to become ill or die.\nYou can find out more about the quoll here: Quoll Facts\nBack to animal index\nRedback Spider\nScientific name: Latrodectus hasselti\nType of animal: Arachnid, member of the family Theridiidae\nConservation status: Unassessed\nThe redback spider is one of Australia\u2019s best-known, and most feared, spiders. The species\u2019 notoriety is due to bite of the female, which is extremely painful and whose symptoms can last from several hours to several days. Although extremely uncomfortable, the redback spider\u2019s bite is seldom fatal to humans.\nWith a body length of around 1 cm, female redback spiders are over twice the size of males.\nThe species is black with a contrasting red stripe running along the centre of the back of the abdomen. On the underside of the abdomen is a red \u2018hourglass\u2019 marking.\nRedback spiders are widely distributed throughout Australia but are most often found in urban areas. Although their diet consists mainly of insects, they will also eat small birds, lizards, rodents, flies, crickets, and beetles.\nYou won\u2019t find many daddy redback spiders; during reproduction, females practice cannibalism.\nYou can find out more about the redback spider here: Redback Spider Facts\nBack to animal index\nRed-Eyed Tree Frog\nScientific name: Litoria chloris\nType of animal: Amphibian, member of the family Hylidae (the tree frogs)\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe red-eyed tree frog of Australia is a different species to the South American amphibian of the same name. Both species are in the tree frog family Hylidae.\nThe Australian red-eyed tree frog is found in rainforests and other moist forest habitats in eastern Queensland and New South Wales. It spends most of its life in the forest canopy, only coming down to the ground to breed after periods of heavy rain.\nThis Australian amphibian is bright green with yellow undersides. Its eyes \u2013 as its name suggests \u2013 are orange-red.

These act as wings, allowing the sugar glider to glide from tree to tree.\nThe omnivorous sugar glider eats insects, leaves and eucalyptus sap. This opportunist hunter may also eat small reptiles and birds when the chance arises.\nYou can find out more about sugar gliders here: Sugar Glider Facts\nBack to animal index\nSydney Funnel-Web Spider\nScientific name: Atrax robustus\nType of animal: Arachnid, member of the family Hexathelidae\nConservation status: Unassessed\nFound within a 100-km radius of Sydney, the Sydney funnel-web spider is known for its dangerous bite, which, if untreated, can be fatal. The species\u2019 venom is one of the most toxic of any spider.\nThe Sydney funnel-web spider is shiny dark brown / black, and between 1 and 5 cm in body length.\nThe species builds web-lined burrows from which it emerges to ambush passing prey. Web \u2018tripwires\u2019 alert the spider to the presence of prey outside of the burrow.\nThe spider prefers moist areas with constant humidity. It builds its burrows under logs and rocks, and in ground debris.\nThe Sydney funnel-web spider feeds mainly on insects such as cockroaches, beetles, and various larvae. It will also occasionally prey on snails, frogs and other small vertebrates.\nYou can find out more about the Sydney funnel-web spider here: Sydney Funnel-Web Spider Facts\nBack to animal index\nTasmanian Devil\nScientific name: Sarcophilus harrisii\nType of animal: Marsupial\nConservation status: Endangered\nThe Tasmanian devil is a carnivorous marsupial today found only in Tasmania, but once also found on mainland Australia. Its extinction on the mainland may have been caused by the presence of dingoes introduced by Aboriginal Australians.\nThe species is known for its ferocity, particularly when feeding, when it makes a distinctive screeching sound. It is this \u2018devilish\u2019 sound that gives the species its name.\nThe Tasmanian devil has the strongest bite force in relation to body size of any carnivorous mammal.\nToday, the Tasmanian devil\u2019s very survival is threatened by the spread of a killer disease known as devil facial tumour disease (DFTD). This highly-contagious disease, which causes sores to break out around the animal\u2019s face, has caused a huge decline in the species\u2019 population.\nYou can find out more about the Tasmanian devil here: Tasmanian Devil Facts\nBack to animal index\nThorny Devil\nScientific name: Moloch horridus Type of animal: Reptile; lizard in the family Agamidae Conservation status: Least Concern\nThis fearsome-looking lizard is found in the dry inland regions of Australia. Despite its aggressive appearance, the thorny devil is only dangerous if you happen to be an ant (this little reptile eats several thousand ants every day).\nThe thorny devil has a number of adaptations for living in the desert, including grooves in its skin that channel moisture to its mouth, and a false head to confuse predators.\nYou can find out more about this Australian reptile here: Thorny Devil Facts\nBack to animal index\nTurtle Frog / Tortoise Frog\nScientific name: Myobatrachus gouldii\nType of animal: Amphibian, member of the family Myobatrachidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe turtle frog (also known as a tortoise frog) is a small frog found in the southwestern corner of Western Australia. It lives in semi-arid areas, and has powerful limbs for burrowing in the sandy soil. The species gets its name from its turtle-like appearance. It has a round, flat body and resembles a turtle without a shell.\nThe turtle frog is unusual among frogs because it skips the tadpole stage of its development, instead hatching from its egg as a small frog.\nBack to animal index\nUlysses Butterfly / Blue Emperor\nScientific name: Papilio ulysses\nType of animal: Insect, member of the family Papilionidae\nConservation status: Unassessed\nUlysses butterflies inhabit the tropical rainforests of north-eastern Australia, New Guinea, the Moluccas, Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomon Islands. They are also seen in suburban gardens in Queensland.\nThe wingspan of the Ulysses butterfly is around 10 cm. Males have vibrant iridescent blue colour wings with black edges. The blue colouration of the female\u2019s wings is duller. The underside of the wings of both sexes is dark-brown, which provides camouflage when the insect is at rest.\nBoth males and females have the characteristic elongated tail streamers of butterflies in the swallowtail family, Papilionidae.\nThis striking butterfly species feeds on nectar, in particular that from flowers of the species Lantana camara.\nMales are strongly attracted to the colour blue and will approach man-made objects of this colour.\nBack to animal index\nWallaby\nType of animal: Mammal, marsupial\nFamily: Macropodidae\nWallabies, like kangaroos, are members of the family Macropodidae. Wallabies are the smallest members of the family, with the smallest species\u2013the dwarf wallaby\u2013reaching just 46 cm (18 in) in total length.\nWallabies are found not just in Australia, but also on New Guinea. These herbivorous marsupials are found in a variety of habitats, including forests and rocky terrain. Rock wallabies have specially adapted, rough-soled feet for gripping onto rocks.\nBack to animal index\nWhite-Lipped Tree Frog / Giant Tree Frog\nScientific name: Litoria infrafrenata\nType of animal: Amphibian, member of the family Hylidae\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe white-lipped tree frog is the world\u2019s largest tree frog species, reaching a maximum length of 14 cm (5.5 in.). Bright green in colour, the species has a distinctive white stripe running along its lower lip and extending to above each shoulder.\nThe species is not endemic to Australia, and is also present on New Guinea and nearby islands. It lives in a variety of habitats, including rainforests and urban areas. In Australia it is found along the coastal areas of the Cape York Peninsula and the tropics of north-eastern Queensland.\nDuring spring and summer males gather at breeding sites \u2013 typically bodies of still water \u2013 and emit a loud mating call, which sounds like a dog barking.\nYou can find out more about the white-lipped tree frog here: White-Lipped Tree Frog Facts\nBack to animal index\nWombat\nType of animal: Marsupials, family Vombatidae\nNumber of species found in Australia: 3\nWombats are dog-sized burrowing animals that are only found in Australia. There are three species of wombat: the common wombat (Vombatus ursinus), northern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus krefftii), and southern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons). They are the only members of the family Vombatidae.\nWombats build large burrow systems, digging through the soil with their teeth and their strong claws. They have backwards-facing pouches to prevent dirt from entering while they are digging.\nWombats are mostly nocturnal, but are occasionally active during the day in the winter or on cool, overcast days.\nThe northern hairy-nosed wombat is Critically Endangered. With only around 80 mature individuals left in the wild, it is one of the world\u2019s rarest mammals.\nYou can find out more about wombats here: Wombat Facts\nBack to animal index\nYabby (Common)\nScientific name: Cherax destructor\nType of animal: Crustacean in the family Parastacidae\nConservation status: Vulnerable\nThe final species in this Australian animals list is the common yabby (Cherax destructor). The yabby is a crayfish \u2013 a freshwater crustacean which resembles a small lobster. It is found in swamps, streams, lakes and rivers throughout much of east Australia.\nThe yabby has also been introduced to Western Australia, where it is an invasive species, and a potential threat to other native crayfish.\nThe yabby feeds on algae, plant material and animal remains. It is rated as Vulnerable by the IUCN.\nBack to animal index\nAustralian Animals List Conclusion\nWe hope that you have enjoyed reading this list of Australian animals.

We humans are waging what amounts to a war against them because they have something we want and cannot make on our own: ivory.\nThe West African country of Gabon holds most of Africa's remaining forest elephants. Their main stronghold, Minkebe National Park and its surrounding buffer zone, was home to an estimated 28,500 elephants in 2004. By 2012 the number had plummeted to about 7,000\u2014a loss of 20,000 or more elephants.\nPeople are shooting, poisoning, and spearing the animals at such a rate across the continent that some scientists already consider them \"ecologically extinct.\" There are now fewer than 500,000 wild African elephants\u2014maybe no more than half that number\u2014and barely 32,000 Asian elephants.\nThey cannot fight against us; they cannot win this battle.\nAnd the horror of what is happening to them is surely compounded in their minds by the empathy they feel for one another\u2014an emotion that scientists have at last been able to demonstrate experimentally in elephants.\nElephant Empathy: One Example After Another\nBut why did it take an experiment? Research on elephants is full of examples of the animals apparently behaving empathetically\u2014recognizing and responding to another elephant's pain or problem. Often, they even make heroic efforts to assist one another.\nIn Kenya, researchers have watched mother elephants and other adult females help baby elephants climb up muddy banks and out of holes, find a safe path into a swamp, or break through electrified fences.\nScientists have spotted elephants assisting others that are injured, plucking out tranquilizing darts from their fellows, and spraying dust on others' wounds.\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\nAnd on at least one occasion, researchers have watched an elephant struggle to help a dying friend, lifting her with her tusks and trunk, while calling out in distress.\nAren't such accounts sufficient for scientists to say unequivocally that elephants, like us, are empathetic beings?\nSadly, no. For various reasons\u2014some scientific, some philosophical, some religious, some economic\u2014we have set the bar exceedingly high for recognizing emotions (other than anger and fear) in other animals.\nSaying absolutely that elephants (or other animals) are empathetic requires an experiment, something that is difficult to do in the wild. Experiments mean that these are not chance observations\u2014the results are repeatable.\nTo show that elephants experience the same emotions another is feeling, scientists watched captive Asian elephants in a park in Thailand. They noted when one elephant was upset by something, such as by a snake in the grass, and they recorded her behaviors to see if there was a pattern.\nThere was. In response to a stressful event, an elephant flares out her ears, erects her tail, and sometimes makes a low rumble. Scientists watching elephants in the wild have reported the same behaviors. (See \"Surprise: Elephants Comfort Upset Friends.\")\nEmotional Contagion\nBoth in the wild and in this captive study, researchers have watched other, nearby elephants react to the other elephant's distress by acting in exactly the same way. Scientists call this emotional contagion.\nThe elephants also ran to stand beside their friend, touched her with their trunks to soothe her, and made soft chirping sounds. Sometimes one would even put her trunk inside the other's mouth, a behavior elephants find particularly comforting, the researchers say.\nWe do something very similar when watching a scary movie with a friend. When the main character is threatened, we feel his fear. Our hearts race, we may tremble, and for reassurance, we reach for our friend's hand.\nThe researchers also recorded what the elephants did when they were in the same locations with their same friends nearby, but nothing stressful occurred. In those moments, none of the elephants acted in an empathetic way.\nBy comparing the two types of events\u2014stressful versus nonstressful\u2014the scientists were able to say that \"emotional contagion\" occurs only when an elephant sees another in distress.\nSome scientists may still argue that this is not sufficient evidence for true empathy, that the experiment doesn't reveal what's going on in an elephant's mind when she rushes to aid a friend or worries over a dying companion.\nBut the fact that elephants make any effort at all on another elephant's behalf suggests that they are at the very least highly aware and emotional beings, concerned in some manner for each other.\nDo They Know We're Destroying Them?\nWe cannot know for certain if African elephants know that they're under attack, that we're wiping them out across the continent. There are few, if any, survivors from most poaching events, and those that do make it can't tell us of their trauma. We'll never know what elephants may have witnessed or heard in the forest while their friends and relatives in other families were being slaughtered.\nWe have some idea, though, because in South Africa in the late 20th century, wildlife officials authorized the killing of entire elephant families in some fenced parks, such as Kruger. The officials worried that if a fenced elephant population grew too large, the animals would consume all the vegetation\u2014so they culled the elephants.\nSomehow, other elephant families in the park knew this was happening. Perhaps it was the cries of terror as the animals were shot. Or perhaps those being killed were able to emit low rumbles that carried the news for miles.\nImmediately after a culling operation\u2014and even after rangers cleaned up the area, removing all the bodies\u2014other elephant families would come to the scene. They inspected the ground and smelled the earth, and then the visiting elephants left, never to return.\nObservers say that even when the area where a culling took place was good habitat for elephants, the animals chose not to live there.\nWhat happens now where poachers kill elephant families and herds? Do the animals, filled with empathy for what the others suffered, come to investigate the killing fields? Do they abandon those awful precincts forever?\nThose studies have yet to be made. But in the meantime, can we put our empathy to use in finding a way to help the elephants? Can we put an end at last to the poaching?\nVirginia Morell is a correspondent for Science and the author of four acclaimed books. Her newest, Animal Wise: The Thoughts and Emotions of Our Fellow Creatures, has received several honors, including a Notable Book for 2014 award from the American Library Association and a Best Book of the Year designation from Kirkus Reviews. She lives in Oregon with her husband and their working farm collie, Buckaroo.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this piece incorrectly stated that Gabon has lost more than half its elephants\u201411,000\u2014in the last ten years. It is known with a high degree of confidence that in a recent eight-year period, the loss in just one Gabon park approximated 20,000 elephants."}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "African Elephant Numbers Plummet 30 Percent, Great Elephant ... - Animals", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/wildlife-african-elephants-population-decrease-great-elephant-census", "text": "The much anticipated results of the largest ever continent-wide wildlife survey, the Great Elephant Census, will be released tomorrow at the World Conservation Congress in Hawaii. The worrying finding: Africa now has 352,271 savanna elephants left in 93 percent of the species\u2019 range.\nThe aerial survey covered 18 African countries. In 15 of those, where information on previous populations existed, 144,000 elephants were lost to ivory poaching and habitat destruction in less than a decade.\nThe current yearly loss\u2014overwhelmingly from poaching\u2014is estimated at 8 percent. That\u2019s about 27,000 elephants slaughtered year after year.\nForest elephants, which live in central and West Africa, were excluded from the census because they\u2019re nearly impossible to spot from the air. But a 2012 ground study indicates that these elephants too are highly threatened by poaching and habitat loss.\nThe census was funded by Microsoft founder Paul G. Allen and took just under three years to complete. Led by the nonprofit Elephants Without Borders, which is based in Botswana, the survey involved a team of 90 scientists, six NGOs, and two advisory partners: the Kenya-based conservation organization Save the Elephants and the African Elephant Specialist Group, made up of experts who focus on the conservation and management of African elephants.\nThe survey\u2019s results, published in the journal PeerJ, couldn\u2019t have come at a more important time.\nLater this month elephants will be high on the agenda at the triennial meeting in Johannesburg, South Africa, of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the body that regulates international trade in certain threatened animal species. With poaching at such dire levels, the conference may be pivotal in setting a new direction for elephants.\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\n\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in the power of data to help inform decisions,\u201d Paul Allen told National Geographic. \u201cWe have to make faster, smarter, better decisions about how and where we direct limited resources.\u201d Allen says he\u2019s already begun planning a ground-based survey of Africa\u2019s forest elephants.\nThe Great Elephant Census is the most advanced and thorough assessment of elephant numbers ever. It was carried out by spotters in low-flying planes who peered out of either side of their planes to count the elephants below. Crisscrossing vast swaths of sub-Saharan Africa, they racked up a combined flying distance of 285,000 miles\u2014the equivalent distance to the moon and a quarter of the way back.\n4:42\nPrevious pan-African elephant surveys have been fairly crude. In 1969 Iain Douglas-Hamilton, a veteran conservationist and founder of Save the Elephants, undertook the earliest attempt at a continent-wide census using aerial counts and questionnaires. That survey estimated 1.3 million elephants, a disputed figure in conservation circles. A decade later experts suggested that the figure was about 600,000, highlighting a poaching crisis. Since then the exact trajectory of elephant numbers has been in question.\n\u201cFor too long now, we\u2019ve said that we don\u2019t have precise, reliable estimates\u2014that they\u2019re speculative, they\u2019re guess work,\u201d says Mike Chase, the principal researcher for the census and the founder of Elephants Without Borders. The time for pleading ignorance about elephant numbers is over, he says. \u201cWe\u2019re now armed with the most robust and accurate scientific data in history to give these animals a second chance.\u201d\nPaula Kahumbu, a Kenyan elephant ecologist and CEO of WildlifeDirect, a Nairobi-based conservation organization, believes that by providing an independent and scientifically robust assessment of elephants, the census will carry huge weight at the CITES conference. \u201cProposals will be considered on the basis of scientific fact,\u201d Kahumbu says. \u201cIt\u2019s vital that we have accurate data to inform policy.\u201d\nCrisis by the Numbers\nWhile the overall elephant picture is bleak, it varies greatly from country to country and from ecosystem to ecosystem.\nThe countries with the greatest declines were Tanzania and Mozambique, with a combined loss of 73,000 elephants to poaching in just five years. Another shocking discovery was made in northern Cameroon, where survey teams could count no more than 148 elephants\u2014along with many carcasses\u2014revealing a tiny regional population in immediate danger of extinction.\nBy contrast South Africa, Uganda, parts of Malawi and Kenya, and the W-Arli-Pendjari conservation complex\u2014the only area in West Africa with significant numbers of savanna elephants\u2014were found to have stable or slightly growing herds.\nBotswana remains the continent\u2019s elephant stronghold, with 130,000 animals, concentrated along the Chobe and Savuti river systems in the north and in the vast wetland oasis of the Okavango Delta.\nZimbabwe showed the second highest number of elephants\u201483,000\u2014mostly along the Zambezi River and in Hwange National Park. Overall, Zimbabwe\u2019s population has dropped 10 percent since 2005.\nZambia recorded 20,839 elephants, an 11 percent decline during the past decade. But a regional population in the southwestern corner of the country has been terribly affected by poaching: The spotters tallied just 48 elephants in Sioma Ngwezi National Park, down from 900 in 2004. At the current poaching rate, this local population also faces imminent extirpation.\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\nAngola too gave a shock. Once hoped to be a refuge for elephants after decades of civil war, it now has one of the highest poaching rates on the continent\u2014leading to a 22 percent drop in elephant numbers since 2005.\nNamibia was the only country with a significant elephant population that opted not to participate in the census. Wide-ranging surveys conducted there in 2015 yielded an estimate of nearly 23,000 elephants.\nThe spotters weren\u2019t on the lookout only for live elephants. They also counted dead animals, because carcass numbers show the extent to which poaching and natural deaths contribute to declines.\nBy calculating carcass ratios\u2014the percentage of dead elephants versus live elephants observed during the survey\u2014the researchers could get a good idea of the health of a population. A ratio above 8 percent generally means a population is declining, and continent-wide the carcass ratio turned out to be nearly 12 percent.\nWhat\u2019s abundantly clear, Chase says, \u201cis that the elephant poaching crisis has moved from East and central Africa and is now on our doorstep in southern Africa. You just need to look at southwest Zambia and southeast Angola, which have the worst rates of elephant poaching on the entire continent. And when elephants are removed from those systems, poachers will look to the stronghold of northern Botswana.\u201d\nChase says the overall message of the survey is clear. Poaching is so intense \u201cthat in 10 years' time we could lose 50 percent of Africa\u2019s remaining elephants.\u201d\nIn the Hands of Governments\nFor more than a century, the ivory trade has been the fire that has fueled the killing of elephants. In 1989 CITES put in place a global ban on ivory trading that significantly stemmed poaching at first. But twice since then, in 1999 and 2008, some southern African countries were allowed to sell ivory from their stockpiles\u2014sales widely believed to have boosted ivory demand in Asia and spurred poaching and ivory smuggling.\nThis year, two countries\u2014Zimbabwe and Namibia\u2014have put forward proposals to CITES to begin a legal and regulated trade in ivory. In reaction, 26 African nations with elephant populations, supported by other countries and numerous NGOs, have submitted a proposal to halt any trade in elephants and their products.\n\u201cNo nation is an island,\u201d says Phyllis Lee, of the University of Stirling, one of the authors of the proposal. Elephants don\u2019t stick to political borders, she says, and some populations are shared by three or four countries at a time. Decisions made about elephants in one country can have huge repercussions on poaching in other countries.\nWhatever comes of the wildlife trade meeting in Johannesburg this month, for the first time CITES and African countries that have elephants will have concrete information to determine the future conservation and management of elephants.\nAs Chase puts it, \u201cWe now have the first baseline for assessing whether we\u2019re going to be successful, or if we\u2019re going to fail the African elephant.\u201d\nRead more stories about wildlife crime and exploitation on Wildlife Watch.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Jumbo - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumbo", "text": "Famous large elephant\nThis article is about the historic elephant. For other uses, see Jumbo (disambiguation)\n\"Jumbo the Elephant\" redirects here. For the concrete and reinforced steel statue by Canadian artist Winston Bronnum, see Jumbo the Elephant (Bronnum)\nJumbo (about December 25, 1860\u2013September 15, 1885), also known as Jumbo the Elephant and Jumbo the Circus Elephant, was a 19th-century male African bush elephant born in Sudan. Jumbo was exported to Jardin des Plantes, a zoo in Paris, and then transferred in 1865 to London Zoo in England. Despite public protest, Jumbo was sold to P. T. Barnum, who took him to the United States for exhibition in March 1882.\nThe giant elephant's name spawned the common word \"jumbo,\" meaning large in size. Examples of his lexical impact are phrases like \"jumbo jet\", \"jumbo shrimp,\" \"jumbo marshmallows,\" and \"jumbotron.\" Jumbo's shoulder height has been estimated to have been 3.23 metres (10 ft 7 in) at the time of his death, and was claimed to be about 4 m (13 ft 1 in) by Barnum.\nHistory [ edit ]\nJumbo was born around December 25, 1860 in Sudan, and after his mother was killed by hunters, the infant Jumbo was captured by Sudanese elephant hunter Taher Sheriff and German big-game hunter Johann Schmidt. The calf was sold to Lorenzo Casanova, an Italian animal dealer and explorer. Casanova transported the animals that he had bought from Sudan north to Suez, and then across the Mediterranean Sea to Trieste.\nThis collection was sold to Gottlieb Christian Kreutzberg's \"Menagerie Kreutzberg\" in Germany. Soon after, the elephant was imported to France and kept in the Paris zoo Jardin des Plantes. In 1865, he was transferred to the London Zoo and arrived on 26 June. In the following years, Jumbo became a crowd favorite due to his size, and would give rides to children on his back, including those of Queen Victoria.\nWhile in London, Jumbo broke both tusks, and when they regrew, he ground them down against the stonework of his enclosure. His keeper in London was Matthew Scott, whose 1885 autobiography details his life with Jumbo.\nThe Illustrated London News, 1 April 1882 Jumbo's Journey to the Docks,, 1 April 1882\nIn 1882, Abraham Bartlett, superintendent of the London zoo, sparked a national controversy with his decision to sell Jumbo to the American entertainer Phineas T. Barnum of the Barnum & Bailey Circus for \u00a32,000 (US$10,000). This decision came as a result of concern surrounding Jumbo's growing aggression and potential to cause a public disaster. The sale of Jumbo, however, sent the citizens of London into a panic, because they viewed the transaction as an enormous loss for the British empire. 100,000 school children wrote to Queen Victoria begging her not to sell the elephant.[a] John Ruskin, a fellow of the Zoological Society, wrote in The Morning Post in February 1882: \"I, for one of the said fellows, am not in the habit of selling my old pets or parting with my old servants because I find them subject occasionally, perhaps even \"periodically,\" to fits of ill temper; and I not only \"regret\" the proceedings of the council, but disclaim them utterly, as disgraceful to the city of London and dishonourable to common humanity.\" Despite a lawsuit against the Zoological Gardens alleging the sale was in violation of multiple zoo bylaws, and the zoo's attempt to renege on the sale, the court upheld the sale. Matthew Scott elected to go with Jumbo to the United States. The London-based newspaper The Daily Telegraph begged Barnum to lay down terms on which he would return Jumbo; however, no such terms existed in the eyes of Barnum.\nIn New York, Barnum exhibited Jumbo at Madison Square Garden, earning enough in three weeks from the enormous crowds to recoup the money he spent to buy the animal. In the 31-week season, the circus earned $1.75M, largely due to its star attraction. On May 17, 1884, Jumbo was one of Barnum's 21 elephants that crossed the Brooklyn Bridge to prove that it was safe after 12 people died during a stampede caused by mass panic over collapse fears a year earlier.\nDeath [ edit ]\nAn 1889 photograph of Jumbo at Barnum Hall, the taxidermy work of Carl Akeley\nPoster of Jumbo's skeleton\nSurviving fragments of Jumbo from the conflagration\nJumbo died at a railway classification yard in St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada, on September 15, 1885. In those days the circus crisscrossed North America by train. St. Thomas was the perfect location for a circus because many rail lines converged there. Jumbo and the other animals had finished their performances that night, and as they were being led to their box car, a train came down the track. Jumbo was hit and mortally wounded, dying within minutes.\nBarnum told the story that Tom Thumb, a young circus elephant, was walking on the railroad tracks and Jumbo was attempting to lead him to safety. Barnum claimed that the locomotive hit and killed Tom Thumb before it derailed and hit Jumbo, and other witnesses supported Barnum's account. According to newspapers, the freight train hit Jumbo directly, killing him, while Tom Thumb suffered a broken leg.\nMany metallic objects were found in the elephant's stomach, including English pennies, keys, rivets, and a police whistle.[b]\nEver the showman, Barnum had portions of his star attraction separated, to have multiple sites attracting curious spectators. After touring with Barnum's circus, the skeleton was donated to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where it remains. The elephant's heart was sold to Cornell University. Jumbo's hide was stuffed by William J. Critchley and Carl Akeley, both of Ward's Natural Science, who stretched it during the mounting process; the mounted specimen traveled with Barnum's circus for two years.\nBarnum eventually donated the stuffed Jumbo to Tufts University, where it was displayed at P.T. Barnum Hall there for many years. The hide was destroyed in a fire in April 1975. Ashes from that fire, which are believed to contain the elephant's remains, are kept in a 14-ounce Peter Pan Crunchy Peanut Butter jar in the office of the Tufts athletic director, while his taxidermied tail, removed during earlier renovations, resides in the holdings of the Tufts Digital Collections and Archives. Jumbo is the Tufts University mascot.\nLegacy [ edit ]\nRemaining in the United Kingdom are statues and other memorabilia of Jumbo. The elephant \u2013 or rather his statuette in the Natural History Museum \u2013 was made holotype of Richard Lydekker's proposed subspecies (Loxodonta africana rothschildi) for the large elephants of the eastern Sahel. Modern authorities do not recognize this (or any other subspecies of African bush elephants), considering its purportedly diagnostic large size and peculiarly shaped ears to be individual variation.\nWhile Jumbo's hide resided at Tufts' P.T. Barnum Hall, a superstition held that dropping a coin into a nostril of the trunk would bring good luck on an examination or sports event. Although the hide was destroyed by a major fire, Jumbo remains the mascot of Tufts, and representations of the elephant are featured prominently throughout the campus.\nJumbo statue in St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada\nA life-sized statue of the elephant was erected in 1985 in St. Thomas, Ontario, to commemorate the centennial of the elephant's death. It is located on Talbot Street on the west side of the city. In 2006 the Jumbo statue was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame in the category of \"Railway Art Forms & Events\" as having local significance. St. Thomas's Railway City Brewery sells an IPA beer named Dead Elephant.\nJumbo was the inspiration of the nickname of the 19th-century Jumbo Water Tower in the town of Colchester in Essex, England.\nJumbo is referenced by a plaque outside the old Liberal Hall, now a Wetherspoons pub, in Crediton, United Kingdom.\nLucy the Elephant, a six-story structure in Margate City, New Jersey, was modeled after Jumbo. Built by James V. Lafferty in 1881, Lucy is the oldest surviving roadside tourist attraction in America and a National Historic Landmark. Lafferty also made other Jumbo-shaped structures, including Elephantine Colossus, on Coney Island.\nJumbo has been lionized on a series of sheet-music covers from roughly 1882\u201383. The four-colour lithograph of Jumbo was created by Alfred Concanen of England, with the music title \"Why Part With Jumbo\",[c] a song by the lion comique of Victorian British music halls, G. H. MacDermott. It pictured children zoo visitors riding, somewhat precariously, on Jumbo's back. Multiple American lithographic music covers were done, including by J. H. Bufford's Sons.\nCanadian folk singer James Gordon wrote the song \"Jumbo's Last Ride\", which recounts the story of Jumbo's life and death. It is on his 1999 CD Pipe Street Dreams.\nCanadian professional ice hockey player Joe Thornton (b. 1979) from St. Thomas, Ontario is nicknamed Jumbo Joe as a homage to Jumbo.\nThe 1941 animated film Dumbo released by Walt Disney Animation Studios was inspired by the story of Jumbo and is regarded as one of the greatest animated films of all time. Despite the film being fictional, many people have speculated that Jumbo might have been the title character's father.\nExamination of Jumbo's skeleton [ edit ]\nA television program about Jumbo, Attenborough and the Giant Elephant, presented by the naturalist and broadcaster David Attenborough, was transmitted on BBC One in the United Kingdom on 10 December 2017. An international team of scientists examined the skeleton and found:\nJumbo's molar teeth were malformed and out of line as a result of a long-term soft diet that did not wear his molar teeth down enough, obstructing the forward eruptive movement of the next molar.\nJumbo's nightly rages were probably caused by toothache, rather than musth, as his keeper thought at the time.\nA post mortem photograph of Jumbo shows skin abrasions consistent with an illustration produced just after his death of the freight train hitting him on a hip from behind as he was being led across to his traveling carriage, and said that the likeliest cause of death was internal bleeding from his injuries.\nphotograph of Jumbo shows skin abrasions consistent with an illustration produced just after his death of the freight train hitting him on a hip from behind as he was being led across to his traveling carriage, and said that the likeliest cause of death was internal bleeding from his injuries. Examination of Jumbo's limb bones showed overgrown tendon attachment areas consistent with a long-term history of being overloaded at his work.\nJumbo was still growing at the time of his death, as is normal for African male elephants of his age, and might eventually have attained the size claimed by Barnum.\nSee also [ edit ]\nReferences [ edit ]\nAutobiography of Matthew Scott, Jumbo's Keeper; also Jumbo's Biography (1885) Cover of(1885)\nNotes [ edit ]\n^ The Elephant War (1960) by (1960) by Gillian Avery is a historical novel featuring the protest movement based in Oxford. ^  \"A postmortem revealed his stomach to contain 'a hat-full' of English pennies, gold and silver coins, stones, a bunch of keys, lead seals from railway trucks, trinkets of metal and glass, screws, rivets, pieces of wire and a police whistle.\" ^  Full title: \"Why Part With Jumbo, the Pet of the Zoo\"; by: George Barnham (composer); G.

This dramatic loss of habitat has led to the species becoming critically endangered in the wild.\nDespite being threatened with extinction in the wild, the axolotl is a popular pet and is also of interest to scientists due to its ability to regenerate not only lost limbs, but also parts of the eye, heart and brain.\nA member of the salamander order, Urodela, the axolotl differs from many amphibians in that it does not undergo metamorphosis. Even as an adult, the axolotl remains fully-aquatic, breathing with gills rather than with lungs.\nDiscover More with Active Wild\nYou can find out more about the axolotl on this page: Axolotl Facts\nDiscover more critically endangered species on this page: Critically Endangered Species List with Pictures & Facts\nGo back to page index\nAye-Aye\nScientific name: Daubentonia madagascariensis\nType of animal: Mammal\nFamily: Daubentoniidae\nWhere found: Africa (Madagascar)\nConservation status: Critically Endangered\nThe aye-aye is one of around 100 species of lemur.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Animals in Entertainment: Circuses, SeaWorld, and Beyond | PETA", "url": "https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/", "text": "Animals aren\u2019t actors, spectacles to imprison and gawk at, or circus clowns. Yet thousands of elephants, bears, apes, and others are forced to perform silly, difficult tricks under the threat of physical punishment; carted across the country in cramped, stuffy semi-truck trailers; kept chained or caged in barren, filthy enclosures; and regularly separated from their families and friends\u2014all for the sake of entertainment. Many of them are even forced to perform until the day they die.\nPETA is determined to get animals out of the entertainment business. Our dedicated staff members work full time exposing and ending animal abuse in the entertainment industry, and their work is paying off: Consider the demise of Ringling Bros. circus, for example. In addition to ending circus cruelty, these staff members work with officials to overhaul horseracing rules nationwide, spearhead hard-hitting undercover investigations and public campaigns that are crucial in turning public opinion against animal-exploiting attractions, persuade travel companies to stop selling tickets to SeaWorld and other cruel operations, persuade companies like Coca-Cola to stop sponsoring abusive forms of entertainment such as the deadly Iditarod, persuade entertainment executives not to use animals in movies or TV and to use motion-capture technology instead, chip away at abusive animal exhibitors like the Mobile Zoo, and facilitate the transfer of neglected animals from roadside zoos, traveling menageries, and other seedy facilities to reputable sanctuaries.\nPETA\u2019s Victories: Animals in Entertainment\nCircus acts featuring only willing human performers, TV shows and films using CGI animals, and interactive, virtual reality aquariums are captivating audiences. Meanwhile, archaic, cruel animal acts are on the decline. Thanks in part to PETA\u2019s work, public opposition to horseracing cruelty, marine parks, dog sledding, elephant rides, cockfighting, petting zoos, horse-drawn carriage rides, bullfighting, sport fishing, trophy hunting, rodeos, traveling animal acts, roadside zoos, and safari parks has never been stronger. Animal-free forms of entertainment teach audience members about conservation\u2014something places that imprison and enslave animals, such as SeaWorld, only pretend to do.\nWhat\u2019s Wrong With Circuses? And Is SeaWorld Really That Bad?\nAnimals don\u2019t like to put on shows\u2014they\u2019re used and abused for the sake of human entertainment. To force bears, elephants, tigers, and others in circuses to perform confusing and physically demanding tricks, trainers use bullhooks, whips, tight collars, muzzles, electric prods, and other painful tools of the trade. Frustrated by years of beatings and confinement, many of them snap\u2014countless animals, trainers, and members of the public have been injured and even killed.\nAnimals held captive at marine parks or in aquariums don\u2019t fare much better. In captivity, orcas and other dolphins swim in endless circles in tanks that, to them, are the equivalent of bathtubs, and they\u2019re denied the opportunity to engage in almost any natural behavior. Instead, some are forced to perform meaningless tricks. Most die far short of their natural life expectancy.\nThe dead bodies of tigers at pseudo-sanctuaries, bears confined to cages and pits, and bulls forced to buck and fight are stacking up, too.\nThere\u2019s only one acceptable thing to do with animals exploited for entertainment: Retire them to reputable sanctuaries or loving homes.\nPETA has helped facilitate such transfers, as in the case of Nosey the elephant\u2014we campaigned for her freedom from the circus for years, and now she\u2019s loving her sanctuary home in Tennessee. Charlie, a Thoroughbred horse on the brink of a fatal breakdown, was also rescued by PETA\u2014he now spends his days grazing on grass in a large pasture with his guardian, a longtime PETA supporter and friend. And then there was Tregembo Animal Park in North Carolina, which two local animal advocates represented by PETA\u2019s lawyers successfully sued, allowing us to transfer bears Ben and Bogey to a sprawling Colorado sanctuary. Between 2013 and 2018, PETA saved more than 70 bears from cramped pens and concrete hells, helping to transfer them to true sanctuaries where they can finally play, climb, have friends, and raise their families. Some of our rescues have even helped shut down roadside zoos."}

Endangered LC NT VU EN CR EW EX Least Concern Extinct Current Population Trend : Increasing\nWhat is the blue whale?\nBlue whales are the largest animals ever known to have lived on Earth. These magnificent marine mammals rule the oceans at up to 100 feet long and upwards of 200 tons. Their tongues alone can weigh as much as an elephant. Their hearts, as much as an automobile.\nDiet of krill\nBlue whales reach these mind-boggling dimensions on a diet composed nearly exclusively of tiny shrimplike animals called krill. During certain times of the year, a single adult blue whale consumes about 4 tons of krill a day.\nBlue whales are baleen whales, which means they have fringed plates of fingernail-like material, called baleen, attached to their upper jaws. The giant animals feed by first gulping an enormous mouthful of water, expanding the pleated skin on their throat and belly to take it in. Then the whale's massive tongue forces the water out through the thin, overlapping baleen plates. Thousands of krill are left behind\u2014and then swallowed.\nColoring and appearance\nBlue whales look true blue underwater, but on the surface their coloring is more a mottled blue-gray. Their underbellies take on a yellowish hue from the millions of microorganisms that take up residence in their skin. The blue whale has a broad, flat head and a long, tapered body that ends in wide, triangular flukes.\nVocalization and behavior\nBlue whales live in all the world's oceans, except the Arctic, occasionally swimming in small groups but usually alone or in pairs. They often spend summers feeding in polar waters and undertake lengthy migrations towards the Equator as winter arrives.\nThese graceful swimmers cruise the ocean at more than five miles an hour, but accelerate to more than 20 miles an hour when they are agitated. Blue whales are among the loudest animals on the planet. They emit a series of pulses, groans, and moans, and it\u2019s thought that, in good conditions, blue whales can hear each other up to 1,000 miles away. Scientists think they use these vocalizations not only to communicate, but, along with their excellent hearing, to sonar-navigate the lightless ocean depths.\nBlue whale calves\nCalves enter the world already ranking among the planet's largest creatures. After about a year inside its mother's womb, a baby blue whale emerges weighing up to 3 tons and stretching to 25 feet. It gorges on nothing but mother's milk and gains about 200 pounds every day for its first year.\nLongevity\nBlue whales are among Earth's longest-lived animals. Scientists have discovered that by counting the layers of a deceased whale's waxlike earplugs, they can get a close estimate of the animal's age. The oldest blue whale found using this method was determined to be around 110 years old. Average lifespan is estimated at around 80 to 90 years.\nConservation\nAggressive hunting in the 1900s by whalers seeking whale oil drove them to the brink of extinction. Between 1900 and the mid-1960s, some 360,000 blue whales were slaughtered. They finally came under protection with the 1966 International Whaling Commission, but they've managed only a minor recovery since then.\nBlue whales have few predators but are known to fall victim to attacks by sharks and killer whales, and many are injured or die each year from impacts with large ships."}

There are two main species \u2013 Asian and African.\nAsian elephants are smaller than their African cousins, and Intelligent and sociable, they live together in family groups and are usually led by the oldest female. Their most distinctive feature is of course their long trunks which can be very powerful, but also very delicate when needed to forage for food.\nThey need to eat a lot and can spend two thirds of a day feeding. They eat grasses, tree bark, roots, leaves and the like.\nTheir ivory tusks help with digging, stripping bark from trees and fighting. Not all male Asian elephants have tusks! But both males and females can have tushes, which are incisor teeth that grow to just below the bottom lip.\nAn elephant\u2019s ears are used to keep the animal cool as they radiate heat, and Asian elephants have smaller ears than African ones. Despite the fact that their trunks are sophisticated long noses, Asian elephants have a finger at the end enabling the elephant to handle small items. African elephants have two fingers at the end of their trunks.\nElephants spend almost 22 months pregnant with a calf. That\u2019s the longest amount of time for any mammal!

At 40 inches long and often over 70 pounds, they are the second largest marsupial with only the larger kangaroo species attaining greater adult size.\nWombats also have the largest brains of all the marsupials, and are notorious for cleverly digging alternate exits to their burrows when traditional traps are placed at the entrance.\nWombats do not climb like their closest relative the koala. They are entirely terrestrial and well-built for a fossorial lifestyle underground.\nThey use their powerful, well-clawed paws, and muscular forearms to dig large burrows that may reach as much as 150 feet in length.\nThey have stout, rounded, nearly tailless bodies which give them an adorable roly-poly look, however they are not fat.\nWombats are heavily muscled and can honestly claim to be \"big-boned\", having unusually thick bone diameter and exceptionally robust skeletal mass.\nThe wombat is a solitary creature that is largely nocturnal, grazing on grasses and foraging for roots, flowers and tendrils under cover of night.\nThey have tiny eyes and poor vision which is compensated for with excellent senses of hearing and smell.\nWith its meaty form and underground lifestyle the wombat is highly reminiscent of the badger, but the two species are not closely related.\nIn addition, while the badger is a very successful animal across numerous continents and urban as well as rural environments, the wombat is unable to adapt as its habitat is industrialized.\nMost native Australians have never seen a wombat in the wild, as they disappear quickly with urban development.\nThere are three species of wombat, two of which are endangered, and all of whom are experiencing rapid loss of habitat.\nIf the trend continues, wombat rescues and sanctuaries may soon be the only place one may observe these unique and precious animals. - Wombat Facts\nbare-nosed wombat and hairy-nosed wombat\nbare-nosed wombat\nhairy-nosed wombat\nThere are three species of wombat sporadically distributed along the coasts of Australia and Tasmania, with some isolated populations more inland and to the North.\nThe first and most populous is the common wombat, perhaps more correctly referred to as the bare-nosed wombat.\nHappily nick-named \"the bulldozer of the bush\" it is also known as the Coarse haired wombat, the Naked nosed wombat, the Forest wombat, the Island wombat, and the Tasmanian wombat.\nBare-nosed wombats have, in fact, a bare nose with downward facing nostrils which is very similar in appearance to its close relative the koala. They have rounder heads, smaller ears, more dexterous front paws, and longer bodies than the hairy-nosed wombats.\nAlthough some populations are threatened, the species as a whole is not endangered.\nThey are the most widespread of the wombat species, and what most people think of when they think \"wombat.\"\nThe Southern hairy-nosed wombats have a longer, almost sledge-shaped head with much longer and more thin-skinned ears.\nThe most obvious distinguishing feature is the nose, which is not just finely furred and heavily whiskered, but is an entirely different shape from the bare-nosed wombats.\nThe hairy-nosed wombats snout is blunt and pig-like. It is a large, oval-shaped flat plane with two large, evenly spaced round nostrils and a deep crease running vertically down the center.\nThe Southern hairy-nosed ranges intermittently along the Southern coast of Australia and is listed as an endangered species.\nLooking very similar to the Southern hairy-nosed wombat, the third species of wombat known as the Northern hairy-nosed, is nearly extinct in the wild.\nIt lives in a range of only 750 acres of Forest in east-central Queensland, Australia.\nAt last count there were a little over 100 individuals remaining. The Northern hairy-nosed wombat is considered the most critically endangered of the marsupials, and one of the most critically endangered large mammals in the world.\nwombat lifestyle and reproduction\nbare-nosed wombat mother and baby\nWombats are marsupials, like kangaroos and koala bears, which means that their babies start to develop in the womb, but then move to a pouch on the mothers abdomen to continue growing.\nThe wombat is generally a solitary animal that maintains a small territory, marking it routinely with urine sprays and droppings and avoiding other wombats when possible.\nThey dig several different burrows at different ends of their range, and will alternate resting spots.\nOccasionally wombats may share a den, but interaction is minimal.\nFemales appear to come into season once a year, and local males may get into skirmishes to establish dominance. The pair will stay together for a few days, but the male plays no part in the rearing of young.\nFemales are pregnant for about 22 days and give birth to one infant. The newborn is bright red, hairless, and blind. It is only about the size of a jellybean, and is called a neonate at this unformed stage of development..\nThe teenie neonate makes its way, unaided by its mother, to the pouch, pulling itself through a forest of belly hair by its front limbs.\nThe wombats pouch faces rearward and the baby wombats trip is much shorter than that of a kangaroo - only about 3 inches, compared to the marathon trek of up to 15 inches inches that a neonate kangaroo must make.\nOnce in the pouch, the neonate will immediately latch itself to one of the mothers two teats.\nThe teat fills with milk at this point, and the baby is virtually locked to it for the first several weeks in the pouch.\nThe baby wombat continues to develop in the protection of the pouch for an additional 4 months or so, but by 5 months the baby is out and about, exploring its world and grazing by its mothers side.\nDangers in the babies first year or two include predation by dingos, snakes, and birds of prey.\nBaby wombats begin to dig their own practice dens at about 8 months old, but will still continue to sleep in their mothers den for many months.\nThey stay with their mothers for 1 1/2 to 2 years, before heading off on their own. - Wombat Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Unlike some other impressive earth movers like badgers and anteaters, the wombats front claws are not unusually long. They are, however, very thick, and virtually unbreakable.\nWombats move dirt with all four limbs and their snout, and will dig both forwards and backwards.\nWhen walking around in their underground lairs they waddle from side to side, bumping the tunnel walls as they go.\nThey are extremely tough-skinned and seem somewhat impervious to pain. They have been known to walk straight through fences making no attempt to go around, under, and certainly not over.\nThey plow through shrubs and brush, head low, their big shoulders and forehead taking whatever impacts may come, and they have been dubbed the \"bulldozers of the bush\" by native Australians who admire the awesome Aussie-like ruggedness of the otherwise cuddly looking animal.\nThe bare-nosed wombat has fairly dexterous front paws that it may use to grasp things. It has even been observed to use its front paws to pull vegetation from the ground and move it to its mouth.\nHairy-nosed wombats have chubbier feet and can't grasp with their forepaws in this fashion.\nWombats have few natural enemies, with humans pretty much standing alone on the list. Dingoes will take wombats occasionally, but only when numbers are in their favor. A fully grown wombat can often outweigh and definitely out power a dingo one on one.\ndingo\nThe wombats teeth are designed for ripping grass and breaking down vegetable matter, and its defensive instincts don't usually involve biting.\nThe wombat will, instead, attempt to bluff an attacker with hissing sounds and charging behavior, and it may turn its back on an attacker and kick out double-barreled like a donkey with its sharp-clawed hind legs.\nIf the wombat can retreat to its burrow, it will dive in head first, tuck its rear legs under and present just its big round rump to the pursuer.\nThe wombats fur is thick and the skin, particularly over the back end, is very tough. With just a button of a tail, there is little to latch on to, and a dingo may depart in frustration.\nDingoes in pursuit of wombats have been known to follow them into their den which is a very poor lapse in judgment.\nAlthough certainly not a common occurrence, wombats have been observed removing the limp bodies of dingoes from their dens after having crushed them against the walls of the confined space.\nIf the dingo attempts to get on top of the wombat inside a tunnel, the wombat will extend its legs and suffocate or crush the offender against the walls or ceiling.\nImagine a 60 pound dingo, the largest carnivore in Australia, being squeezed to death against the ceiling of a wombat den by a solid 80 pound block of hissing muscle.\nGotta watch who you pick on. - Wombat Facts\na few more wombat facts\nnap time\nWhen the busy day catches up with them, wombats will nap lying flat on their backs.\nWombats are most closely related to koalas but have much larger brains.\nWombats are quite accurately nick-named \"the bulldozers of the bush\"\nA newborn wombat is the size of a jellybean!\nThe mothers wombats pouch is called a \"marsupium\", and is where the word \"marsupial\" comes from.\nWombats are at home on the beach\nThe wombats teeth never stop growing\nThe wombats pouch faces backward - not forward like a kangaroo\nA wombats den can be 150 feet long and have 5 different exits and entrances\nMale wombats are Jacks female wombats are Jills and baby wombats are Joeys\nA wombats droppings are in the shape of a cube.\nWombats snore...

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Working animal - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_animal", "text": "Domesticated animals for assisting people\nA working animal is an animal, usually domesticated, that is kept by humans and trained to perform tasks instead of being slaughtered to harvest animal products. Some are beasts of burden that provide transportation and aid in physical labor, while others are service animals trained to execute certain specialized tasks (such as guide dogs). They may also be used for milking or herding. Some, at the end of their working lives, may also be used for meat or other products such as leather.\nThe history of working animals may predate agriculture, with dogs used by our hunter-gatherer ancestors. Around the world, millions of animals work in relationship with their owners. Domesticated species are often bred for different uses and conditions, especially horses and working dogs. Working animals are usually raised on farms, though some are still captured from the wild, such as dolphins and some Asian elephants.\nTraditional farming methods using oxen\nPeople have found uses for a wide variety of abilities in animals, and even industrialised societies use many animals for work. People use the strength of horses, elephants, and oxen to pull carts and move loads. Police forces use dogs for finding illegal substances and assisting in apprehending wanted persons, others use dogs to find game or search for missing or trapped people. People use various animals\u2014camels, donkeys, horses, dogs, etc.\u2014for transport, either for riding or to pull wagons and sleds. Other animals, including dogs and monkeys, help disabled people.\nOn rare occasions, wild animals are not only tamed, but trained to perform work\u2014though often solely for novelty or entertainment, as such animals tend to lack the trustworthiness and mild temper of true domesticated working animals. Conversely, not all domesticated animals are working animals. For example, while cats may catch mice, it is an instinctive behaviour, not one that can be trained by human intervention. Other domesticated animals, such as sheep or rabbits, may have agricultural uses for meat, hides and wool, but are not suitable for work. Finally, small domestic pets, such as most small birds (other than certain types of pigeon) are generally incapable of performing work other than providing companionship.\nRoles and specializations [ edit ]\nTransportation [ edit ]\nSome animals are used due to sheer physical strength in tasks such as ploughing or logging. Such animals are grouped as a draught or draft animals. Others may be used as pack animals, for animal-powered transport, the movement of people and goods. Together, these are sometimes called beasts of burden. Some animals are ridden by people on their backs and are known as mounts. Alternatively, one or more animals in harness may be used to pull vehicles.\nRiding animals or mounts [ edit ]\nThey mainly include equines such as horses, donkeys, and mules; bovines such as cattle, water buffalo, and yak. In some places, elephants, llamas and camels are also used. Dromedary camels are in arid areas of Australia, North Africa and the Middle East; the less common Bactrian camel inhabits central and East Asia; both are used as working animals. On occasion, reindeer, though usually driven, may be ridden.\nCertain wild animals have been tamed and used for riding, usually for novelty purposes, including the zebra and the ostrich. Some mythical creatures are believed to act as divine mounts, such as garuda in Hinduism and the winged horse Pegasus in Greek mythology.\nPack animals [ edit ]\nPack animals may be of the same species as mounts or harness animals, though animals such as horses, mules, donkeys, reindeer and both types of camel may have individual bloodlines or breeds that have been selectively bred for packing. Additional species are only used to carry loads, including llamas in the Andes.\nDomesticated cattle and yaks are also used as pack animals. Other species used to carry cargo include dogs and pack goats.\nDraft animals [ edit ]\nDonkey used to pull a wheeled vehicle in Morocco\nCamel pulling a coach in Rajasthan\nAn intermediate use is as draft animals, harnessed singly or in teams, to pull sleds, wheeled vehicles or ploughs.\nAssorted wild animals have, on occasion, been tamed and trained to harness, including zebras and even moose.\nGuard animals [ edit ]\nAs some domesticated animals display extremely protective or territorial behaviour, certain breeds and species can be utilised to guard property, including dogs, geese and llamas.\nPowering fixed machinery [ edit ]\nWorking draught animals may power fixed machinery using a treadmill and have been used throughout history to power a winch to raise water from a well. Turnspit dogs were formerly used to power roasting jacks for roasting meat.\nTreatment animals [ edit ]\nWorking as a form of biological treatment for the environment. Animals such as Asian carps were imported to the U.S. in 1970s to control algae, weed, and parasite growth in aquatic farms, weeds in canal systems, and as one form of sewage treatment.\nSearching and retrieving [ edit ]\nHunting [ edit ]\nA dog working as a retriever\nAs predatory species are naturally equipped to catch prey, this is a further use for animals and birds. This can be done either for sustenance, sport, or to reduce the population of undesired animals that are considered harmful to crops, livestock or the environment.\nHounds and other dogs are used to kill and fetch prey. Certain breeds have been bred for this task such as pointers and setters.\nMousers (domestic cats used for hunting small rodents and birds) are one of the oldest working animals having protected food supplies from pests since the foundation of human agriculture.\nCaracals are sometimes used as hunting animals in some parts of the Middle East, although they are normally kept as pets.\nCheetahs that have been tamed but not domesticated have been used by humans for chasing down prey.\nFerrets prey on creatures living in burrows, such as rabbits.\nIn falconry, birds of prey are used as hunters in the air.\nAquatic birds, such as cormorants in China, can be used to catch fish.\nHumans [ edit ]\nSearch and rescue dogs, with their highly developed sense of smell, are used to locate humans, such as escaped prisoners, a thief or people lost in remote areas. They are used also to find people who are trapped, such as in avalanches or collapsed buildings.\nDogs can also be used to look for dead people.\nSearchers use horses in remote areas to cover large areas of rugged terrain. The horse's natural awareness of their surroundings often alerts human handlers to the presence of something unusual, including lost hikers or hunters. Like some dogs, some horses are trained to follow scent. The use of horses in search and rescue is known as Mounted search and rescue.\nAnimals can be used to detect the presence of pathogens and patients carrying infectious diseases. Dogs and bees have been trained to detect COVID-19 infections.\nFoods [ edit ]\nDogs and pigs, with a better sense of smell than humans, can assist with gathering by finding valuable products, such as truffles (a very expensive subterranean fungus). Frenchmen typically use truffle hogs, while Italians mainly use dogs. [ citation needed ]\nMonkeys are trained to pick coconuts from palm trees, a job many human workers consider as too dangerous.\nContraband [ edit ]\nInterfacing and organization [ edit ]\nAssistance animals [ edit ]\nThe best-known example is the guide dog or seeing eye dog for blind people. See also service dog. Miniature horses are also occasionally used for this purpose as well.\nTrained dogs and African, Asian, and American monkeys, such as capuchin monkeys have been taught to provide other functions for impaired people, such as opening mail and minor household tasks of the same like.\nHerding [ edit ]\nA very close working relationship exists between a stockman or shepherd, a herding dog, and the herd (or mob) of sheep or cattle. Cattle and sheep herders in other parts of the world also use various dog breeds.\nCertain breeds of horses also have an innate \"cow sense\" that allows them to effectively carry a rider to the right place at the right time to muster (gather or round up) livestock. See stock horse; cutting horse\nEmployers [ edit ]\nPolice and military [ edit ]\nThe defensive and offensive capabilities of animals (such as fangs and claws) can be used to protect or to attack humans.\nThe guard dog barks or attacks, to warn of an intruder\nWar elephants were trained for battle in ancient times and are still used for military transport today.\nMilitary uses of horses have changed over the millennia but still continue, including for police work.\nDolphins and sea lions carry markers to attach to mines as well as patrolling harbors.\nOn land, dogs can be trained to find landmines. Rats, which are lighter and less of a risk to set the mines off, have recently been used more frequently. Detection rats such as those trained by APOPO can also be taught to identify diseases, especially pulmonary tuberculosis.\nAPOPO HeroRAT getting food reward\nHoming pigeons transport material, usually messages on small pieces of paper, by air.\nLegal status [ edit ]\nIn some jurisdictions, certain working animals are afforded greater legal rights than other animals. One such common example is police dogs, which are often afforded additional protections and the same memorial services as human officers.\nIndia law have provision for the in loco parentis for implementing animal welfare laws. Under the India law the non-human entities such as animals, deities, trusts, charitable organizations, corporate, managing bodies, etc. and several other non-human entitles have been given the status of the \"legal person\" with legal rights and duties, such as to sue and be sued, to own and transfer the property, to pay taxes, etc. In court cases regarding animals, the animals have the status of \"legal person\" and humans have the legal duty to act as \"loco parentis\" towards animals welfare like a parent has towards the minor children. In a case of cow-smuggling, the Punjab and Haryana High Court mandated that \"entire animal kingdom including avian and aquatic\" species has a \"distinct legal persona with corresponding rights, duties, and liabilities of a living person\" and humans are \"loco parentis\" while laying out the norms for animal welfare, veterinary treatment, fodder and shelter, e.g. animal drawn carriages must not have more than four humans, and load carrying animals must not be loaded beyond the specified limits and those limits must be halved when animals have to carry the load up a slope. A court while deciding the \"Animal Welfare Board of India vs Nagaraja\" case in 2014 mandated that animals are also entitled to the fundamental right to freedom enshrined in the Article 21 of Constitution of India i.e. right to life, personal liberty and the right to die with dignity (passive euthanasia). In another case, a court in Uttarakhand state mandated that animals have the same rights as humans.\nSee also [ edit ]"}

They\u2019re not only one of the largest predators in the world, but they also hunt in large groups. We\u2019ve compiled a list of the most mind-blowing lion facts you can find. You\u2019ll discover everything from a lion that survived a plane crash to why lions can be louder than football stadiums. Let\u2019s get started with this list of 13 mind-blowing lion facts!\n1.) The largest lion ever recorded weighed 690 pounds!\nThe largest lion ever recorded weighed 690 pounds. It was shot in South Africa in 1936. For perspective, the largest wolf ever recorded weighed \u201cjust\u201d 175 pounds.\nAncient lions could reach even larger sizes. The American lion, which went extinct about 11,000 years ago could have reached up to 1,153 pounds!\nMale lions on the hunt! Blue Slate Films/Shutterstock.com\n2.) Lions sleep for more than 20 hours per day!\nYou might enjoy getting 8 or 9 hours of sleep per night, but a lion getting that amount of sleep wouldn\u2019t be able to function. Hunting prey is extremely energy intensive, so lions sleep large amounts of time to conserve energy between hunts.\nIn total, lions sleep about 20 to 21 hours per day! Species like lions that have few natural predators have the luxury of sleeping more. Herbivores generally sleep less, as species like elephants and giraffes sleep as little as two hours per day in the wild.\n3.) Lions, tigers, and bears can become best friends!\nFile this one under heart-warming.\nAfter police raided a house in Atlanta in 2001, they found the criminal kingpin was illegally keeping a lion, tiger, and bear cub that were all malnourished. The three cubs were taken to Noah\u2019s Ark Animal Sanctuary, where they recovered from their poor care.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s amazing: the three apex predators had bonded during the experience and became \u201cfriends\u201d for life. They lived in the same environment and maintained an incredible bond until the passing of Leo the lion and Shere Khan the tiger. Today, only Baloo the bear remains. He attended the funerals of both his friends and will be buried next to them so the trio can remain together for good.\n4.) A lion\u2019s roar can be heard for more than 5 miles!\nHere\u2019s a lion fact that\u2019s sure to impress, lion roars reach about 114 decibels! Big plays during football games average about 111.2 decibels, which makes a lion\u2019s roar even louder than a packed football stadium!\nNo other big cat can roar as loud as a lion, and their roars ring out for more than 5 miles.\na lion corned by hyenas Mark Sheridan-Johnson/Shutterstock.com\n5.) The world\u2019s most famous lion \u2013 the MGM lion \u2013 survived a plane crash!\nIf you\u2019ve ever seen a James Bond film, then you\u2019ve seen the distinctive MGM lion roaring at the beginning of the film. MGM trademarked the lion in 1916, and it has been an iconic feature at the beginning of their films since then.\nHowever, you might not know that the MGM lion once survived a plane crash! In 1927, MGM was flying their lion mascot across the country to raise publicity when tragedy struck. In a flight from San Diego to New York the flight carrying the lion crushed.\nAmazingly, the MGM lion survived the crash and survived for four days until rescued. During the time it fed on sandwiches and milk from the crashed plane. The lion became known as \u201cLeo the Lucky\u201d and survived a number of other mishaps including a sinking ship, an explosion in the MGM studio, and multiple train wrecks.\n6.) The price of admittance to the London Zoo may have been a cat or dog\u2026 That would be fed to the lions\nPersonally, I just prefer paying $20 to enter a zoo, but times were different back then!\nHundreds of years ago, if you lived in Europe there was simply no way to see \u201cexotic\u201d animals like lions aside from pictures that were often poor representations. For that reason, when royals captured rare animals from across the world, they were a significant attraction. The Royal Menagerie in London kept a variety of animals from across the world during its time.\nIn his book The Ark in the Park: The Zoo in the Nineteenth Century, author Wilfrid Blunt wrote:\nIn the eighteenth century the public was admitted to the Tower menagerie on the payment of three-halfpence or, alternatively, the provision of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions.\n7.) Lions have lost 94% of their habitat and more than 90% of their population\n5,000 years ago, lions roamed north of Greece into Eastern Europe, across Iran and into India, and across all of Africa.\nToday, lions have lost more than 94% of their historic range. They have just one small population left in a single national park in India. In Africa, they\u2019ve been largely wiped out from West and North Africa. Remaining lion populations live in pockets across South and East Africa.\nMore troubling is that their decline continues.\nBetween 1993 and 2014 the ICUN estimated that the global lion population decreased by 42%.\nIn the early 1960s, it was estimated 100,000 lions lived across Africa.\nIn the early 20th century, estimates placed the lion population at between 200,000 and one million lions.\nToday, the global lion population is estimated at about 20,000. This means the lion population has dropped anywhere from 90% to 98% since the beginning of the 20th century.\nGUDKOV ANDREY/Shutterstock.com\n8.) Lions are big hunters, but they have tiny hearts\nLions are one of the largest predators in the world, but they do have limitations. For example, their heart weight just 1,175 grams, which is small for their body size. Due to a smaller heart and lungs, lions aren\u2019t endurance hunters. Instead they rely on both stealth and teamwork to surprise their prey. Lions can run incredibly fast \u2013 up to 50 miles per hour \u2013 but only in short bursts. This means that lions need to get close to their prey before attacking or force prey into other lions waiting to pounce.\n9.) Lions are the only big cat to live in social groups\nLook among other big cats and you\u2019ll see solitary hunters. Tiger, jaguars, and leopards all hunt individually. Only lions live and hunt in social groups called prides.\nPrides are composed mostly of females. A typical pride may have up to a dozen females, no more than three males, and also lion cubs. Males without a pride can form coalitions that hunt and live together. Which brings us to our next lion fact\u2026\n10.) An alliance of male lions killed more than 100 rivals and ruled an area 7 times the size of Manhattan!\nAs just noted, male lions without a pride will often form coalitions that can rule over large swaths of land. In 2006 a coalition of male lions formed in the Sabi Sand region of Kruger National Park in South Africa.\nThe coalition \u2013 known as Mapogo Coalition \u2013 came to include 6 male lions which ruled over 170,000 acres. The lions were ruthless, and killed more than 100 rival lions and cubs and ruled over 8 separate prides. As you can imagine, alliances of male lions are tenuous and involve frequent clashes. The Mapogo coalition eventually split in 2010 into two groups. These smaller groups were picked off by rival alliances, with the final member of the group passing away in 2012.\nMale lion alliances can control vast amounts of territory The Len/Shutterstock.com\n11.) Young lions practice role playing\nOnce lions age, they tend to sleep all day and conserve their energy. However, young lions are much more playful. Youthful lions will role play with one another, which is more than just playing, but helps them develop their hunting techniques. Female lions will watching this role play and determine whether young lions are best suited to chase, corner, or catch and kill prey on future hunts.\n12.) Lions used to have the largest range of any mammal \u2013 outside of humans!\nScientists believe that 13,000-plus years ago, lions were the most widespread mammal outside of humans. That\u2019s because in addition to today\u2019s single remaining species of lion, there were two others:\nCave lions: Which lived across the European steppe across most of modern Europe, Russia, and into Alaska.\nAmerican lions: Lived across parts of Canada, most of the. modern United States, and into Mexico\nBoth these species went extinct between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago at the same time megafauna like mammoths and woolly rhinos went extinct. In addition to these now extinct species, many subpopulations of lions such as the Barbary lion and Cape lion occupied wider geographic ranges that extended far beyond where lions live today. Make sure to give our full guide on types of lions a read for the background on all types of lions, past and present.\n13.) Lions can gorge incredible amounts at meals\nMost humans eat about 2% of their body weight per day. Think about how full you\u2019d be eating a two pound steak in just one sitting!\nLions eat more infrequently than people, but when they do eat, they can gorge. Male lions can eat up to 70 pounds in a single meal. This amount of food can be about 10% to 20% of their body weight!"}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Think twice about wild animal tourism, visitors told | Wildlife ...", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/oct/04/wild-animal-tourism-think-twice", "text": "A leading animal charity is calling on tourists to think twice before they take part in wild animal experiences, as part of a campaign to expose the hidden suffering behind many attractions.\nThe campaign by World Animal Protection, which launches today in conjunction with World Animal Day, draws on research that found almost half of people pay for a wild animal experience because they love animals, but they remain unaware of the abuse that goes on behind the scenes.\nMike Baker, chief executive of World Animal Protection said: \u201cWhat we need to do is alert people to the wildlife suffering in this industry. We don\u2019t want that once in a lifetime experience to be a lifetime of misery for the animal.\u201d\nTargeting tourists before they book, the campaign focuses on the five worst examples of wild animal attractions, with an emphasis on elephant rides \u2013 one of the most popular forms of wildlife tourism.\nAn Asian elephant chained up. Photograph: World Animal Protection\nThe charity is also launching a guide to being animal friendly on holiday, which includes advice on what to ask a tour operator before booking and things to look out for when you are abroad. However Baker says tourists should also use their common sense.\n\u201cIf an animal is doing something it wouldn\u2019t do in the wild then it\u2019s probably not right and something has gone on to make them behave that way,\u201d he says. \u201cTake elephant rides \u2013 you couldn\u2019t just jump on a wild elephant\u2019s back, there\u2019s a process to get them there. They\u2019re chained up, beaten. And what we\u2019ve realised is most people don\u2019t want that.\u201d\nAnother form of wild animal tourism that has become particularly widespread in recent years are parks or \u201csanctuaries\u201d where visitors can pose for photos with tigers \u2013 popularised by the \u201ctiger selfie\u201d trend. This is similar to experiences in which tourists can walk with lions.\nA macaque performs tricks for tourists in Thailand. Photograph: World Animal Protection\nAccording to World Animal Protection, both these types of attraction involve removing cubs from their mothers at a young age, where they are beaten and punished to train them. In some cases the animals are drugged to make them more compliant.\nOther types of wild animal experiences the charity hopes to end are swimming with captive dolphins and dancing macaques shows.\n\u201cThis report is the first time we\u2019ve been able to confirm the reality of these practices and underpin it with research,\u201d says Baker. \u201cWe\u2019ve also realised the scale of it. There are around 16,000 elephants in capitvity \u2013 that\u2019s a quarter of the total number on the planet.\u201d\nAccording to Baker there has been a marked shift on this issue in the travel industry. Earlier this year, tour operator Intrepid Travel announced it would no longer offer elephant rides on any of its trips. In May STA Travel, which provides holidays for 2.5 million students and young people each year, stopped offering tours that include elephant rides or trips to the Tiger Temple in Thailand, as well as ending trips to SeaWorld Orlando and San Diego.\nTourists who want to experience animals while on holiday should be visiting the animals \u201ccarefully and ethically\u201d in their natural habitats, says Baker.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on whale watching trips and safaris and when you see a dolphin skipping in the sea, or a tiger in the wild it makes the entertainment side just seem a little grubby in comparison.\u201d\nWild animal tourism in numbers\n16,000\nNumber of elephants in captivity worldwide \u2013 a quarter of the total number on the planet\n75%\nof captive adult elephants used for tourism entertainment have been taken directly from the wild\n5,000\nNumber of captive tigers in the US alone. In the wild there are just 3,200\n1,600\nEstimated number of bottlenose dolphins being used for entertainment worldwide\n4 million\nNumber of visitors to SeaWorld San Diego in 2012\n8,000\nApproximate number of lions kept and bred in captivity in South Africa \u2013 double the number of those in the wild or natural reserves\nSource: World Animal Protection"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "African Elephant | Zoo Atlanta", "url": "https://zooatlanta.org/animal/african-elephant/", "text": "This is one of the most distinctive animals on the planet. African elephants are the largest of the three elephant species. Elephants have many unique characteristics, and the secrets of some of their adaptations are still being discovered to this day. Elephants live long and very social lives centered around a matriarch and her offspring. The illegal killing of elephants for ivory represents a serious and pressing threat to the future of this species.\nScientific name: Loxodonta africana\ndiet: Herbivore\nrange: Eastern Africa, Middle Africa, Western Africa [VIEW MAP]\nhabitat: Deserts, Forests, Grasslands, Woodlands\nViewing Hints:\nOur herd is now exploring their new outdoor environment in the all-new African Savanna. Get a behind-the-scenes look at the elephants\u2019 care in our special observation area at the new indoor Zambezi Elephant Center.\nPhotos and Videos\nGeneral Information:\nAfrican elephants are one of only three species of the mammalian Order Proboscidea, an order that survived the extinctions of the Pleistocene era. The trunk acts as a fifth appendage unlike anything else among vertebrates and has incredible strength and finesse. Elephants live in family groups headed up by a female matriarch who spends decades imparting knowledge of their region and the subtleties of elephant social norms to other herd members. These family groups communicate with one another over long distances with low-frequency sounds carried through the soil and detected by the front feet. Elephants travel long distances seeking food and water and following seasonal rain patterns. Their diet generally consists of woody vegetation and grasses that are relatively low in calories and nutrients. As a result, their daily intake of food can be hundreds of pounds per day. Their tusks are working tools to manipulate their environment, but are also a highly-valued human commodity for the illegal ivory trade.\nNew habitat on the new African Savanna\nThe new African Savanna, which opened in August 2019, introduces a new and significantly expanded African elephant habitat. The new elephant environment more than triples the size of the elephants\u2019 former habitat and is a dynamic living space featuring elements specifically designed for elephant well-being and enrichment. Elements include Abana Pond, the largest of the complex\u2019s three water features, a pond with 360-degree access and a gentle slope for ease of use by multiple elephants. Additional features include Chishimba Falls and Kalambo Falls, waterfalls named after falls in Africa, and a feeder enrichment activity wall.\nThe state-of-the-art indoor Zambezi Elephant Center also includes elements planned with elephant well-being in mind, including sand under the elephants\u2019 feet. The guest experience at the Zambezi Elephant Center allows visitors to get a behind-the-scenes look at the elephants\u2019 care.\nPhysical Features and Characteristics:\nMale African elephants can reach 14,000 pounds and 13 feet in height. Females are a bit smaller, reaching 10,000 pounds and 10 feet in height. The distinctive ears serve several functions, including their most obvious function \u2013 forming a large surface to intercept distant or faint sounds. This is the same concept as a radar dish: the larger the dish, the more sound waves it can intercept. The ears also contain many blood vessels that help regulate an elephant\u2019s body temperature in hot conditions. The ears also serve as a visual signal to other elephants.\nSound Detection\nElephants can detect sounds over great distances, detecting these sounds with their front feet. They have large fat pads inside the bottoms of their front feet, placing their feet in solid contact with the soil. At any given time, an elephant may be sensing low-frequency sounds which are airborne or carried in the soul. Elephant vocalizations also include very low frequencies, and like whales communicating in the ocean, can communicate across miles.\nTrunk\nAn elephant\u2019s trunk contains thousands of muscles, many of which attach to the skin of the trunk. A series of long muscles runs along the length of the trunk to raise, lower, or move it from side to side. Other, shorter muscles are perpendicular to the length of the trunk, while others are wrapped like a barber pole along the length of the trunk, producing the trunk\u2019s unique twisting abilities. Thanks to this system of muscles, an elephant\u2019s trunk is not only extremely powerful, but is also delicate enough to manipulate and pick up very small objects.\nThe nostrils at the end of an elephant\u2019s trunk are capable of suction strong enough to draw about 1.5 gallons of water, although elephants cannot drink through their trunks. Instead, they draw water with their trunks, squirt it into their mouths, and swallow.\nSense of Smell\nIn terms of their sense of smell, elephants appear to be superior to many other animals. Recent research suggests that African elephants have more than 2,000 genes dedicated to scent discrimination \u2013 that\u2019s twice as many as dogs have, and more than five times what humans have.\nTusks and Teeth\nAn elephant\u2019s tusks are actually two of its upper middle teeth. Young elephants have temporary tusks, much like human baby teeth, that fall out at around 3 years of age and are replaced by the adult tusks. The tusks grow throughout the elephant\u2019s adult life to counter the wear and tear these tools experience.\nAn elephant\u2019s only other teeth are its four massive molars, which also experience heavy wear as the animal chews abrasive woody plants and grasses. These are pushed forward as they wear down and are replaced by a new set of molars developing behind them. This can happen as many as six times in an elephant\u2019s life. The fossil record contains many of these cast-off molars from across all the continents where the elephant\u2019s extinct relatives, such as the mastodon, once roamed.\nLifestyle and Reproduction:\nAfrican elephants live longer than any other non-human land mammal, with a lifespan of 50 to 55 years. Females can begin to reproduce in their teens and in some cases may continue to reproduce into their 40s. Males typically don\u2019t breed before they are in their early 20s or even 30s, as competition for mating can be tough.\nThe gestation period is also the longest of non-human land mammals at approximately 22 months. After about two years a single calf is born, weighing in between 200 and 250 pounds. Twin births are extremely rare for African elephants. In the wild, mating takes place during the rainy season so that offspring are born just prior to the rains two years, later allowing for abundant resources to support a nursing mother. Infant elephants will nurse for six to 18 months, but some calves may try to nurse for well over five years.\nThe trunk of a newborn elephant doesn\u2019t have any muscle tone, so newborn elephants will nurse with their mouths and not their trunks. It takes several months to a year for a calf to gain full control over its trunk and be able to use it purposefully. Male elephants will leave their natal groups as they near sexual maturity and may become part of a more fluid all-male herd.\nSocial Behavior and Intelligence\nElephant families, or herds, comprise a few to over 100 individuals, some biologically related and some not. The herd is led by the oldest female, called a matriarch. Males typically leave the herd between the ages of 12-15 at which time they often form small bachelor groups with other males.\nAfrican elephants are very intelligent and have demonstrated advanced memory capabilities. This memory is what aids the matriarch in locating food and water each season, especially during the dry seasons when the herd may need to be led for longer distances to find abundant resources. With the additional conservation challenges of habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and climate change, water and food are harder to find and require memories of watering holes from long ago. When matriarchs are poached it becomes the responsibility of the next oldest to lead the group, and these younger females may not possess memories old enough to find important resources for group survival. In addition to the cognitive capacity for extensive memory, elephants also exhibit behaviors of grief or mourning, anger, and play.\nOur herd is now exploring their new outdoor environment in the all-new African Savanna. Get a behind-the-scenes look at the elephants\u2019 care in our special observation area at the new indoor Zambezi Elephant Center.\nRange:\nAfrican elephants once ranged across most of sub-Saharan Africa. Human developments and population sizes in the last century have now restricted elephants to populations that are socially and genetically isolated in game reserves and national parks, and they are now extinct in several countries where they once were common.\nHabitat:\nAcross sub-Saharan Africa, these elephants use a variety of seasonally dry savannas and sparse woodlands. They can be found in relatively dense thorn scrub habitat and even in deserts, but this species does not occur in rainforests. Seasonal migrations to flooded grasslands and deltas during the wet season is a crucial part of the annual cycle of some populations.\nDiet:\nElephants are non-ruminating herbivores. Unlike ruminant animals such as cows, which have several phases of digestion, elephants process their food in only a single-pass through, meaning that they must consume large quantities of food. An African elephant may eat 200 to 300 pounds of food a day, mostly in the form of grasses supplemented by bark, leaves, twigs, roots and some fruits, seeds and flowers. Elephants may also drink 20 to 30 gallons of water a day.\nAt Zoo Atlanta, the elephants are fed hay, grain and browse pruned from a variety of non-toxic trees and shrubs around the Zoo. They also receive fruit and vegetable treats such as apples, carrots, sweet potatoes and romaine lettuce.\nConservation:\nThe recent escalation of large-scale organized crime syndicates poaching elephants for ivory is changing the dynamic of the landscape in Africa, suddenly and dramatically introducing the possibility of a world without African elephants. This illegal trade functions on a global scale, and the U.S. remains one of the world\u2019s largest importers of ivory.\nMany elephant populations also exist in close proximity to human populations who rely on agriculture and natural resources for their livelihoods, making human-animal conflict another major threat for elephants when animals are persecuted by humans for exploiting crops.\nIn 2018, Zoo Atlanta announced a partnership with Conservation South Luangwa, a nonprofit organization based in Zambia, to protect African elephants and other wildlife impacted by illegal wildlife trade and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation South Luangwa works to identify and prevent illegal wildlife trade using anti-poaching patrols, aerial surveillance and detection dogs trained to find ivory, animal skins, ammunition and firearms, and certain species killed for bushmeat. More than half the people inhabiting this region of Zambia make a living from agriculture and natural resources, making human-animal conflict a major threat for African elephants and other wildlife when animals are persecuted by humans for exploiting crops. Conservation South Luangwa also has a strong focus on mitigating these conflicts by working directly with local people to safeguard their crops and livelihoods while engaging them as advocates for conservation.\nZoo Atlanta is also a proud partner of the Wildlife Conservation Society\u2019s 96 Elephants campaign and has supported Elephants for Africa through the Quarters for Conservation program.\nZoo Atlanta Conservation Efforts:\nZoo Atlanta is also part of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums\u2019 (AZA) Elephant Species Survival Plan\u00ae (SSP), which seeks to maintain a self-sustaining, genetically diverse population of elephants within accredited North American zoos.\nZoo Atlanta Research:\nOur research staff are involved in a variety of non-invasive behavioral studies to discover even more about the fascinating lives of African elephants."}

For other uses, see Animalia (disambiguation)\nKingdom of living things\nAnimals (also called Metazoa) are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and go through an ontogenetic stage in which their body consists of a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described\u2014of which around 1 million are insects\u2014but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology.\nMost living animal species are in Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The Bilateria include the protostomes, containing invertebrates such as nematodes, arthropods, and molluscs, and the deuterostomes, containing the echinoderms and the chordates, the latter including the vertebrates. Life forms interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian. Many modern animal phyla became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, which began around 539 million years ago. 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago.\nHistorically, Aristotle divided animals into those with blood and those without. Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical biological classification for animals in 1758 with his Systema Naturae, which Jean-Baptiste Lamarck expanded into 14 phyla by 1809. In 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into the multicellular Metazoa (now synonymous for Animalia) and the Protozoa, single-celled organisms no longer considered animals. In modern times, the biological classification of animals relies on advanced techniques, such as molecular phylogenetics, which are effective at demonstrating the evolutionary relationships between taxa.\nHumans make use of many animal species, such as for food (including meat, milk, and eggs), for materials (such as leather and wool), as pets, and as working animals including for transport. Dogs have been used in hunting, as have birds of prey, while many terrestrial and aquatic animals were hunted for sports. Nonhuman animals have appeared in art from the earliest times and are featured in mythology and religion.\nEtymology\nThe word animal comes from the Latin animalis, meaning 'having breath', 'having soul' or 'living being'. The biological definition includes all members of the kingdom Animalia. In colloquial usage, the term animal is often used to refer only to nonhuman animals.\nCharacteristics\nAnimals are unique in having the ball of cells of the early embryo (1) develop into a hollow ball or blastula (2).\nAnimals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and multicellular. Unlike plants and algae, which produce their own nutrients, animals are heterotrophic, feeding on organic material and digesting it internally. With very few exceptions, (example; Henneguya zschokkei) animals respire aerobically. All animals are motile (able to spontaneously move their bodies) during at least part of their life cycle, but some animals, such as sponges, corals, mussels, and barnacles, later become sessile. The blastula is a stage in embryonic development that is unique to animals, (though it has been lost in some) allowing cells to be differentiated into specialised tissues and organs.\nStructure\nAll animals are composed of cells, surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins. During development, the animal extracellular matrix forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganised, making the formation of complex structures possible. This may be calcified, forming structures such as shells, bones, and spicules. In contrast, the cells of other multicellular organisms (primarily algae, plants, and fungi) are held in place by cell walls, and so develop by progressive growth. Animal cells uniquely possess the cell junctions called tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes.\nWith few exceptions\u2014in particular, the sponges and placozoans\u2014animal bodies are differentiated into tissues. These include muscles, which enable locomotion, and nerve tissues, which transmit signals and coordinate the body. Typically, there is also an internal digestive chamber with either one opening (in Ctenophora, Cnidaria, and flatworms) or two openings (in most bilaterians).\nReproduction and development\nNearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction. They produce haploid gametes by meiosis; the smaller, motile gametes are spermatozoa and the larger, non-motile gametes are ova. These fuse to form zygotes, which develop via mitosis into a hollow sphere, called a blastula. In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location, attach to the seabed, and develop into a new sponge. In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement. It first invaginates to form a gastrula with a digestive chamber and two separate germ layers, an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm. In most cases, a third germ layer, the mesoderm, also develops between them. These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs.\nRepeated instances of mating with a close relative during sexual reproduction generally leads to inbreeding depression within a population due to the increased prevalence of harmful recessive traits. Animals have evolved numerous mechanisms for avoiding close inbreeding.\nSome animals are capable of asexual reproduction, which often results in a genetic clone of the parent. This may take place through fragmentation; budding, such as in Hydra and other cnidarians; or parthenogenesis, where fertile eggs are produced without mating, such as in aphids.\nEcology\nAnimals are categorised into ecological groups depending on how they obtain or consume organic material, including carnivores, herbivores, omnivores, detritivores, and parasites. Interactions between animals form complex food webs. In carnivorous or omnivorous species, predation is a consumer\u2013resource interaction where a predator feeds on another organism (called its prey). Selective pressures imposed on one another lead to an evolutionary arms race between predator and prey, resulting in various anti-predator adaptations. Almost all multicellular predators are animals. Some consumers use multiple methods; for example, in parasitoid wasps, the larvae feed on the hosts' living tissues, killing them in the process, but the adults primarily consume nectar from flowers. Other animals may have very specific feeding behaviours, such as hawksbill sea turtles primarily eating sponges.\nMost animals rely on the biomass and energy produced by plants through photosynthesis. Herbivores eat plant material directly, while carnivores, and other animals on higher trophic levels typically acquire it indirectly by eating other animals. Animals oxidize carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and other biomolecules to unlock the chemical energy of molecular oxygen, which allows the animal to grow and to sustain biological processes such as locomotion. Animals living close to hydrothermal vents and cold seeps on the dark sea floor consume organic matter of archaea and bacteria produced in these locations through chemosynthesis (by oxidizing inorganic compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide).\nAnimals originally evolved in the sea. Lineages of arthropods colonised land around the same time as land plants, probably between 510 and 471 million years ago during the Late Cambrian or Early Ordovician. Vertebrates such as the lobe-finned fish Tiktaalik started to move on to land in the late Devonian, about 375 million years ago. Animals occupy virtually all of earth's habitats and microhabitats, including salt water, hydrothermal vents, fresh water, hot springs, swamps, forests, pastures, deserts, air, and the interiors of animals, plants, fungi and rocks. Animals are however not particularly heat tolerant; very few of them can survive at constant temperatures above 50 \u00b0C (122 \u00b0F). Only very few species of animals (mostly nematodes) inhabit the most extreme cold deserts of continental Antarctica.\nDiversity\nThe blue whale is the largest animal that has ever lived.\nSize\nThe blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is the largest animal that has ever lived, weighing up to 190 tonnes and measuring up to 33.6 metres (110 ft) long. The largest extant terrestrial animal is the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana), weighing up to 12.25 tonnes and measuring up to 10.67 metres (35.0 ft) long. The largest terrestrial animals that ever lived were titanosaur sauropod dinosaurs such as Argentinosaurus, which may have weighed as much as 73 tonnes. Several animals are microscopic; some Myxozoa (obligate parasites within the Cnidaria) never grow larger than 20 \u00b5m, and one of the smallest species (Myxobolus shekel) is no more than 8.5 \u00b5m when fully grown.\nNumbers and habitats\nThe following table lists estimated numbers of described extant species for the animal groups with the largest numbers of species, along with their principal habitats (terrestrial, fresh water, and marine), and free-living or parasitic ways of life. Species estimates shown here are based on numbers described scientifically; much larger estimates have been calculated based on various means of prediction, and these can vary wildly. For instance, around 25,000\u201327,000 species of nematodes have been described, while published estimates of the total number of nematode species include 10,000\u201320,000; 500,000; 10 million; and 100 million. Using patterns within the taxonomic hierarchy, the total number of animal species\u2014including those not yet described\u2014was calculated to be about 7.77 million in 2011.[a]\nEvolutionary origin\nThe first fossils that might represent animals appear in the 665-million-year-old rocks of the Trezona Formation of South Australia. These fossils are interpreted as most probably being early sponges.\nAnimals are found as long ago as the Ediacaran biota, towards the end of the Precambrian, and possibly somewhat earlier. It had long been doubted whether these life-forms included animals, but the discovery of the animal lipid cholesterol in fossils of Dickinsonia establishes their nature. Animals are thought to have originated under low-oxygen conditions, suggesting that they were capable of living entirely by anaerobic respiration, but as they became specialized for aerobic metabolism they became fully dependent on oxygen in their environments.\nAnomalocaris canadensis is one of the many animal species that emerged in the is one of the many animal species that emerged in the Cambrian explosion , starting some 539 million years ago, and found in the fossil beds of the Burgess shale\nMany animal phyla first appear in the fossil record during the Cambrian explosion, starting about 539 million years ago, in beds such as the Burgess shale. Extant phyla in these rocks include molluscs, brachiopods, onychophorans, tardigrades, arthropods, echinoderms and hemichordates, along with numerous now-extinct forms such as the predatory Anomalocaris. The apparent suddenness of the event may however be an artefact of the fossil record, rather than showing that all these animals appeared simultaneously.\nSome palaeontologists have suggested that animals appeared much earlier than the Cambrian explosion, possibly as early as 1 billion years ago. Trace fossils such as tracks and burrows found in the Tonian period may indicate the presence of triploblastic worm-like animals, roughly as large (about 5 mm wide) and complex as earthworms. However, similar tracks are produced today by the giant single-celled protist Gromia sphaerica, so the Tonian trace fossils may not indicate early animal evolution. Around the same time, the layered mats of microorganisms called stromatolites decreased in diversity, perhaps due to grazing by newly evolved animals.\nPhylogeny\nAnimals are monophyletic, meaning they are derived from a common ancestor. Animals are sister to the Choanoflagellata, with which they form the Choanozoa. The most basal animals, the Porifera, Ctenophora, Cnidaria, and Placozoa, have body plans that lack bilateral symmetry. Their relationships are still disputed; the sister group to all other animals could be the Porifera or the Ctenophora, both of which lack hox genes, important in body plan development.\nThese genes are found in the Placozoa and the higher animals, the Bilateria. 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have arisen from a single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago in the Precambrian. 25 of these are novel core gene groups, found only in animals; of those, 8 are for essential components of the Wnt and TGF-beta signalling pathways which may have enabled animals to become multicellular by providing a pattern for the body's system of axes (in three dimensions), and another 7 are for transcription factors including homeodomain proteins involved in the control of development.\nThe phylogenetic tree (of major lineages only) indicates approximately how many millions of years ago (mya) the lineages split.\nChoanozoa Choanoflagellata Animalia Parazoa (Porifera) Eumetazoa Ctenophora ParaHoxozoa Placozoa Cnidaria Bilateria Xenacoelomorpha Nephrozoa Deuterostomia Chordata Ambulacraria Protostomia Ecdysozoa Scalidophora Panarthropoda Nematoida >529 mya Spiralia Gnathifera Rotifera and allies Chaetognatha Platytrochozoa Platyhelminthes and allies Lophotrochozoa Mollusca and allies Annelida and allies 550 mya 580 mya 610 mya 650 mya Triploblasts 680 mya 760 mya 950 mya\nNon-bilateria\nNon-bilaterians include sponges (centre) and corals (background).\nSeveral animal phyla lack bilateral symmetry. Among these, the sponges (Porifera) probably diverged first, representing the oldest animal phylum. Sponges lack the complex organization found in most other animal phyla; their cells are differentiated, but in most cases not organised into distinct tissues. They typically feed by drawing in water through pores.\nThe Ctenophora (comb jellies) and Cnidaria (which includes jellyfish, sea anemones, and corals) are radially symmetric and have digestive chambers with a single opening, which serves as both mouth and anus. Animals in both phyla have distinct tissues, but these are not organised into organs. They are diploblastic, having only two main germ layers, ectoderm and endoderm. The tiny placozoans are similar, but they do not have a permanent digestive chamber.\nBilateria\n[c] With an elongated body and a direction of movement the animal has head and tail ends. Sense organs and mouth form the Idealised bilaterian body plan.With an elongated body and a direction of movement the animal has head and tail ends. Sense organs and mouth form the basis of the head . Opposed circular and longitudinal muscles enable peristaltic motion\nThe remaining animals, the great majority\u2014comprising some 29 phyla and over a million species\u2014form a clade, the Bilateria. The body is triploblastic, with three well-developed germ layers, and their tissues form distinct organs. The digestive chamber has two openings, a mouth and an anus, and there is an internal body cavity, a coelom or pseudocoelom. Animals with this bilaterally symmetric body plan and a tendency to move in one direction have a head end (anterior) and a tail end (posterior) as well as a back (dorsal) and a belly (ventral); therefore they also have a left side and a right side.\nHaving a front end means that this part of the body encounters stimuli, such as food, favouring cephalisation, the development of a head with sense organs and a mouth. Many bilaterians have a combination of circular muscles that constrict the body, making it longer, and an opposing set of longitudinal muscles, that shorten the body; these enable soft-bodied animals with a hydrostatic skeleton to move by peristalsis. They also have a gut that extends through the basically cylindrical body from mouth to anus. Many bilaterian phyla have primary larvae which swim with cilia and have an apical organ containing sensory cells. However, there are exceptions to each of these characteristics; for example, adult echinoderms are radially symmetric (unlike their larvae), while some parasitic worms have extremely simplified body structures.\nGenetic studies have considerably changed zoologists' understanding of the relationships within the Bilateria. Most appear to belong to two major lineages, the protostomes and the deuterostomes. The basalmost bilaterians are the Xenacoelomorpha.\nProtostomes and deuterostomes\nThe bilaterian gut develops in two ways. In many protostomes , the blastopore develops into the mouth, while in deuterostomes it becomes the anus.\nProtostomes and deuterostomes differ in several ways. Early in development, deuterostome embryos undergo radial cleavage during cell division, while many protostomes (the Spiralia) undergo spiral cleavage. Animals from both groups possess a complete digestive tract, but in protostomes the first opening of the embryonic gut develops into the mouth, and the anus forms secondarily. In deuterostomes, the anus forms first while the mouth develops secondarily. Most protostomes have schizocoelous development, where cells simply fill in the interior of the gastrula to form the mesoderm. In deuterostomes, the mesoderm forms by enterocoelic pouching, through invagination of the endoderm.\nThe main deuterostome phyla are the Echinodermata and the Chordata. Echinoderms are exclusively marine and include starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers. The chordates are dominated by the vertebrates (animals with backbones), which consist of fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. The deuterostomes also include the Hemichordata (acorn worms).\nEcdysozoa\nThe Ecdysozoa are protostomes, named after their shared trait of ecdysis, growth by moulting. They include the largest animal phylum, the Arthropoda, which contains insects, spiders, crabs, and their kin. All of these have a body divided into repeating segments, typically with paired appendages. Two smaller phyla, the Onychophora and Tardigrada, are close relatives of the arthropods and share these traits. The ecdysozoans also include the Nematoda or roundworms, perhaps the second largest animal phylum. Roundworms are typically microscopic, and occur in nearly every environment where there is water; some are important parasites. Smaller phyla related to them are the Nematomorpha or horsehair worms, and the Kinorhyncha, Priapulida, and Loricifera. These groups have a reduced coelom, called a pseudocoelom.\nSpiralia\nThe Spiralia are a large group of protostomes that develop by spiral cleavage in the early embryo. The Spiralia's phylogeny has been disputed, but it contains a large clade, the superphylum Lophotrochozoa, and smaller groups of phyla such as the Rouphozoa which includes the gastrotrichs and the flatworms. All of these are grouped as the Platytrochozoa, which has a sister group, the Gnathifera, which includes the rotifers.\nThe Lophotrochozoa includes the molluscs, annelids, brachiopods, nemerteans, bryozoa and entoprocts. The molluscs, the second-largest animal phylum by number of described species, includes snails, clams, and squids, while the annelids are the segmented worms, such as earthworms, lugworms, and leeches. These two groups have long been considered close relatives because they share trochophore larvae.\nHistory of classification\nIn the classical era, Aristotle divided animals,[d] based on his own observations, into those with blood (roughly, the vertebrates) and those without. The animals were then arranged on a scale from man (with blood, 2 legs, rational soul) down through the live-bearing tetrapods (with blood, 4 legs, sensitive soul) and other groups such as crustaceans (no blood, many legs, sensitive soul) down to spontaneously generating creatures like sponges (no blood, no legs, vegetable soul). Aristotle was uncertain whether sponges were animals, which in his system ought to have sensation, appetite, and locomotion, or plants, which did not: he knew that sponges could sense touch, and would contract if about to be pulled off their rocks, but that they were rooted like plants and never moved about.\nIn 1758, Carl Linnaeus created the first hierarchical classification in his Systema Naturae. In his original scheme, the animals were one of three kingdoms, divided into the classes of Vermes, Insecta, Pisces, Amphibia, Aves, and Mammalia. Since then the last four have all been subsumed into a single phylum, the Chordata, while his Insecta (which included the crustaceans and arachnids) and Vermes have been renamed or broken up. The process was begun in 1793 by Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck, who called the Vermes une esp\u00e8ce de chaos (a chaotic mess)[e] and split the group into three new phyla, worms, echinoderms, and polyps (which contained corals and jellyfish). By 1809, in his Philosophie Zoologique, Lamarck had created 9 phyla apart from vertebrates (where he still had 4 phyla: mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish) and molluscs, namely cirripedes, annelids, crustaceans, arachnids, insects, worms, radiates, polyps, and infusorians.\nIn his 1817 Le R\u00e8gne Animal, Georges Cuvier used comparative anatomy to group the animals into four embranchements (\"branches\" with different body plans, roughly corresponding to phyla), namely vertebrates, molluscs, articulated animals (arthropods and annelids), and zoophytes (radiata) (echinoderms, cnidaria and other forms). This division into four was followed by the embryologist Karl Ernst von Baer in 1828, the zoologist Louis Agassiz in 1857, and the comparative anatomist Richard Owen in 1860.\nIn 1874, Ernst Haeckel divided the animal kingdom into two subkingdoms: Metazoa (multicellular animals, with five phyla: coelenterates, echinoderms, articulates, molluscs, and vertebrates) and Protozoa (single-celled animals), including a sixth animal phylum, sponges. The protozoa were later moved to the former kingdom Protista, leaving only the Metazoa as a synonym of Animalia.\nIn human culture\nPractical uses\nThe human population exploits a large number of other animal species for food, both of domesticated livestock species in animal husbandry and, mainly at sea, by hunting wild species. Marine fish of many species are caught commercially for food. A smaller number of species are farmed commercially. Humans and their livestock make up more than 90% of the biomass of all terrestrial vertebrates, and almost as much as all insects combined.\nInvertebrates including cephalopods, crustaceans, and bivalve or gastropod molluscs are hunted or farmed for food. Chickens, cattle, sheep, pigs, and other animals are raised as livestock for meat across the world. Animal fibres such as wool are used to make textiles, while animal sinews have been used as lashings and bindings, and leather is widely used to make shoes and other items. Animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur to make items such as coats and hats. Dyestuffs including carmine (cochineal), shellac, and kermes have been made from the bodies of insects. Working animals including cattle and horses have been used for work and transport from the first days of agriculture.\nAnimals such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster serve a major role in science as experimental models. Animals have been used to create vaccines since their discovery in the 18th century. Some medicines such as the cancer drug Yondelis are based on toxins or other molecules of animal origin.\nPeople have used hunting dogs to help chase down and retrieve animals, and birds of prey to catch birds and mammals, while tethered cormorants have been used to catch fish. Poison dart frogs have been used to poison the tips of blowpipe darts. A wide variety of animals are kept as pets, from invertebrates such as tarantulas and octopuses, insects including praying mantises, reptiles such as snakes and chameleons, and birds including canaries, parakeets, and parrots all finding a place. However, the most kept pet species are mammals, namely dogs, cats, and rabbits. There is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans, and their existence as individuals with rights of their own. A wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic animals are hunted for sport.\nSymbolic uses\nAnimals have been the subjects of art from the earliest times, both historical, as in Ancient Egypt, and prehistoric, as in the cave paintings at Lascaux. Major animal paintings include Albrecht D\u00fcrer's 1515 The Rhinoceros, and George Stubbs's c. 1762 horse portrait Whistlejacket. Insects, birds and mammals play roles in literature and film, such as in giant bug movies.\nAnimals including insects and mammals feature in mythology and religion. In both Japan and Europe, a butterfly was seen as the personification of a person's soul, while the scarab beetle was sacred in ancient Egypt. Among the mammals, cattle, deer, horses, lions, bats, bears, and wolves are the subjects of myths and worship. The signs of the Western and Chinese zodiacs are based on animals.\nSee also\nNotes"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Southern elephant seal - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_elephant_seal", "text": "Species of mammal\nThe southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) is one of two species of elephant seals. It is the largest member of the clade Pinnipedia and the order Carnivora, as well as the largest extant marine mammal that is not a cetacean. It gets its name from its massive size and the large proboscis of the adult male, which is used to produce very loud roars, especially during the breeding season. A bull southern elephant seal is about 40% heavier than a male northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris), twice as heavy as a male walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), and 6\u20137 times heavier than the largest living mostly-terrestrial carnivoran, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) and the Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi),.\nTaxonomy [ edit ]\nThe southern elephant seal was one of the many species originally described by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae, where it was given the binomial name of Phoca leonina. John Edward Gray established the genus Mirounga in 1827.\nIn the nineteenth century the species was often called \"bottle-nosed seal\".\nDescription [ edit ]\nSkeleton of a southern elephant seal\nThe southern elephant seal is distinguished from the northern elephant seal (which does not overlap in range with this species) by its greater body mass and a shorter proboscis. The southern males also appear taller when fighting, due to their tendency to bend their backs more strongly than the northern species. This species may also exhibit the greatest sexual dimorphism of any mammal in terms of mass ratio, with males typically five to six times heavier than females. On average female southern elephant seals weigh 400 to 900 kg (880 to 1,980 lb) and measure 2.6 to 3 m (8.5 to 9.8 ft) long, whereas bulls can range from 2,200 to 4,000 kg (4,900 to 8,800 lb) and grow to 4.2 to 5.8 m (14 to 19 ft) in length. For comparison, among the northern elephant seal and the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus)\u2014two other large marine mammals that are highly sexual dimorphic by size\u2014males typically outweigh females by a factor of three to four.\nSouthern elephant seal size also varies regionally. Studies have indicated elephant seals from South Georgia are around 30% heavier and 10% longer on average than those from Macquarie Island. The record-sized bull, shot in Possession Bay, South Georgia, on 28 February 1913, measured 6.85 m (22.5 ft) long and was estimated to weigh 5,000 kg (11,000 lb), although it was only partially weighed piecemeal. The maximum size of a female is 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) and 3.7 m (12 ft).\nA southern elephant seal's eyes are large, round, and black. The width of the eyes, and a high concentration of low-light pigments, suggest sight plays an important role in the capture of prey. Like all seals, elephant seals have hind limbs whose ends form the tail and tail fin. Each of the \"feet\" can deploy five long, webbed fingers. This agile dual palm is used to propel water. The pectoral fins are used little while swimming. While their hind limbs are unfit for locomotion on land, elephant seals use their fins as support to propel their bodies. They are able to propel themselves quickly (as fast as 8 km/h (5.0 mph)) in this way for short-distance travel, to return to water, to catch up with a female, or to chase an intruder.\nPups are born with fur and are completely black. Their coats are unsuited to water, but protect infants by insulating them from the cold air. The first moulting accompanies weaning. After moulting, the coats may turn grey and brown, depending on the thickness and moisture of hair. Among older males, the skin takes the form of a thick leather which is often scarred.\nLike other seals, the vascular system of elephant seals is adapted to the cold; a mixture of small veins surround arteries, capturing heat from them. This structure is present in extremities such as the hind legs.\nRange and population [ edit ]\nThe world population was estimated at 650,000 animals in the mid-1990s, and was estimated in 2005 at between 664,000 and 740,000 animals. Studies have shown the existence of three geographic subpopulations, one in each of the three oceans.\nTracking studies have indicated the routes traveled by elephant seals, demonstrating their main feeding area is at the edge of the Antarctic continent. While elephant seals may come ashore in Antarctica occasionally to rest or to mate, they gather to breed in subantarctic locations.\nSouthern elephant seal harem on a beach on the Kerguelen Islands\nThe largest subpopulation is in the South Atlantic, with more than 400,000 individuals, including about 113,000 breeding females on South Georgia; the other breeding colonies of the Atlantic subpopulation are located on the Falkland Islands and Valdes Peninsula in Argentina (the only continental breeding population).\nThe second subpopulation, in the south Indian Ocean, consists of up to 200,000 individuals, three-quarters of which breed in the Kerguelen Islands and the rest in the Crozet Islands, Marion and Prince Edward Islands, and Heard Island. Some individuals also breed on Amsterdam Island.\nThe third subpopulation of about 75,000 seals is found in the subantarctic islands of the Pacific Ocean south of Tasmania and New Zealand, mainly Macquarie Island.\nColonies once existed in Tasmania, Saint Helena, and the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands off the coast of Chile. Some individuals at the time of moulting have been found in South Africa, Australia or Uruguay. Lost animals have also been reported from time to time on the shores of Mauritius, with two reports from the R\u00edo Guayas estuary area in Ecuador and a beach in Lima, Peru. Reality of the creature so called Manatee of Helena had been pointed out as possible misidentification of elephant seals historically present on Saint Helena.\nAfter the end of large-scale seal hunting in the 19th century, the southern elephant seal recovered to a sizable population in the 1950s; since then, an unexplained decline in the subpopulations of the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean has occurred. The population now seems to be stable; the reasons for the fluctuation are unknown. Suggested explanations include a phenomenon of depression following a rapid demographic rebound that depletes vital resources, a change in climate, competition with other species whose numbers also varied, or even an adverse influence of scientific monitoring techniques.\nBehavior [ edit ]\nSocial behavior and reproduction [ edit ]\nBull elephant seals fighting\nElephant seals are among the seals that can stay on land for the longest periods of time, as they can stay dry for several consecutive weeks each year. Males arrive in the colonies earlier than the females and fight for control of harems when they arrive. Large body size confers advantages in fighting, and the agonistic relationships of the bulls gives rise to a dominance hierarchy, with access to harems and activity within harems being determined by rank. The dominant bulls (\u201charem masters\u201d) establish harems of several dozen females. The least successful males have no harems, but they may try to copulate with a harem male's females when the male is not looking. The majority of primiparous females and a significant proportion of multiparous females mate at sea with roaming males away from harems.\nAn elephant seal must stay in his territory to defend it, which could mean months without eating, having to live on his blubber storage. Two fighting males use their weight and canine teeth against each other. The outcome is rarely fatal, and the defeated bull will flee; however, bulls can suffer severe tears and cuts. Some males can stay ashore for more than three months without food. Males commonly vocalize with a coughing roar that serves in both individual recognition and size assessment. Conflicts between high-ranking males are more often resolved with posturing and vocalizing than with physical contact.\nFemales (one giving birth)\nGenerally, pups are born rather quickly in the breeding season. After being born, a newborn will bark or yap and its mother will respond with a high-pitched moan. The newborn begins to suckle immediately. Lactation lasts an average of 23 days. Throughout this period, the female fasts. Newborns weigh about 40 kg (88 lb) at birth, and reach 120 to 130 kg (260 to 290 lb) by the time they are weaned. The mother loses significant weight during this time. Young weaned seals gather in nurseries until they lose their birth coats. They enter the water to practice swimming, generally starting their apprenticeship in estuaries or ponds. In summer, the elephant seals come ashore to moult. This sometimes happens directly after reproduction.\nFeeding and diving [ edit ]\nSouthern elephant seal (just weaned pup): first bath\nSatellite tracking revealed the seals spend very little time on the surface, usually a few minutes for breathing. They dive repeatedly, each time for more than 20 minutes, to hunt their prey\u2014squid and fish\u2014at depths of 400 to 1,000 m (1,300 to 3,300 ft). They are the deepest diving air-breathing non-cetaceans and have been recorded at a maximum of 2,388 m (7,835 ft) in depth.\nSouthern elephant seal (young males): collective mudbath during moulting\nAs for the duration, depth and sequence of dives, the southern elephant seal is the best performing seal. In many regards, they exceed even most cetaceans. These capabilities result from nonstandard physiological adaptations, common to marine mammals, but particularly developed in elephant seals. The coping strategy is based on increased oxygen storage and reduced oxygen consumption.\nIn the ocean, the seals apparently live alone. Most females dive in pelagic zones for foraging, while males dive in both pelagic and benthic zones. Individuals will return annually to the same hunting areas. Due to the inaccessibility of their deep-water foraging areas, no comprehensive information has been obtained about their dietary preferences, although some observation of hunting behavior and prey selection has occurred.\nWhile hunting in the dark depths, elephant seals seem to locate their prey, at least in part, using vision; the bioluminescence of some prey animals can facilitate their capture. Elephant seals do not have a developed system of echolocation in the manner of cetaceans, but their vibrissae (facial whiskers), which are sensitive to vibrations, are assumed to play a role in search of food. When at the subantarctic or Antarctic coasts, the seals forage largely on deep-sea cephalopod species such as Psychroteuthis glacialis, Alluroteuthis antarcticus, Histeoteuthis eltaninae, Onykia ingens, Gonatus antarcticus. Martialia hyadesi and other molluscs, various fish species, including lanternfish (i.e. Electrona spp. and Gymnoscopelus spp.), nothothens (i.e. Genera Lepidonotothen, Pleuragramma, Trematomus, Pagothenia,), Channichthyidsae spp., Bathylagidae spp., krill (mostly Euphausia spp.) and other crustaceans, and even algae.\nPredation [ edit ]\nWeaned pups and juveniles may fall prey to orcas. Cases where weaned pups have been attacked and killed by leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) and New Zealand sea lions (Phocarctos hookeri), exclusively small pups in the latter case, have been recorded. Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) have hunted elephant seals near Campbell Island, while bite marks from a southern sleeper shark (Somniosus antarcticus) have been found on surviving elephant seals in the Macquarie Islands.\nConservation [ edit ]\nPlay fight\nAfter their near extinction due to hunting in the 19th century, the total population was estimated at between 664,000 and 740,000 animals in 2005, but as of 2002, two of the three major populations were declining. The reasons for this are unclear, but are thought to be related to the distribution and declining levels of the seals' primary food sources. Most of their important breeding sites are now protected by international treaty, as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, or by national legislation.\nClimate change [ edit ]\nClimate change likely has a wide-ranging and diverse impact on marine species such as southern elephant seals. As top predators in the Southern Ocean, southern elephant seals inhabit one of the most sensitive and vulnerable regions to rapid climate change. Global efforts such as the Southern elephant seals as oceanographic samplers and the Marine Mammals Exploring the Oceans Pole to Pole projects have led to the collection of a large suite of long-term coupled behavioural-oceanographic data. As part of these projects, satellite-relay data loggers were attached to southern elephant seals to collect physical and biological data. This simultaneous collection of behavioural and environmental data, spanning more than ten years, has enabled researchers to study the impact of climate change on southern elephant seals and the Antarctic ecosystem. This data provides information on how the Southern Ocean is changing in relation to climate change as well as how these species respond to changes.\nThese projects focused on southern elephant seals because they are deep divers as well as a major predator in the Southern Ocean in terms of their population size and food consumption. As predators of the upper levels of the food-web, their foraging success and population dynamics impart valuable information about productivity at different trophic levels. The well-being of southern elephant seals therefore mirrors that of the whole Antarctic ecosystem.\nSouthern elephant seals from different colonies frequent specific oceanographic regions to forage. They feed most successfully in areas with specific hydrographic properties, e.g. the upwelling regions of Circumpolar Deep Water within the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. In the Southern Ocean, southern elephant seals associate more frequently with southerly, higher\u2010latitude fronts and frontal zones. However, the foraging success in association with these regions varies strongly according to year, season and sex. Some of the seasonal and interannual variations in foraging success can be linked to climatic changes such as positional shifts in fronts and variability associated with frontal positions. Generally, southern elephant seals appear to be resilient against the apparent variability in the location and productivity of frontal systems.\nReferences [ edit ]"}

Vulnerable LC NT VU EN CR EW EX Least Concern Extinct Current Population Trend : Decreasing\nGiraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humans\u2014about 6 feet . These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances.\nBehavior\nTypically, these fascinating animals roam the open grasslands in small groups of about half a dozen.\nBulls sometimes battle one another by butting their long necks and heads. Such contests aren't usually dangerous and end when one animal submits and walks away.\nHeight and Size\nGiraffes use their height to good advantage and browse on leaves and buds in treetops that few other animals can reach (acacias are a favorite). Even the giraffe's tongue is long! The 21-inch tongue helps them pluck tasty morsels from branches. Giraffes eat most of the time and, like cows, regurgitate food and chew it as cud. A giraffe eats hundreds of pounds of leaves each week and must travel miles to find enough food.\nThe giraffe's height also helps it to keep a sharp lookout for predators across the wide expanse of the African savanna.\nThe giraffe's stature can be a disadvantage as well\u2014it is difficult and dangerous for a giraffe to drink at a water hole. To do so they must spread their legs and bend down in an awkward position that makes them vulnerable to predators like Africa's big cats. Giraffes only need to drink once every several days; they get most of their water from the luscious plants they eat.\nFemale giraffes give birth standing up. Their young endure a rather rude welcome into the world by falling more than 5 feet to the ground at birth. These infants can stand in half an hour and run with their mothers an incredible ten hours after birth.\nPopulation\nGiraffes have beautiful spotted coats. While no two individuals have exactly the same pattern, giraffes from the same area appear similar.\nUp until recently, the consensus has been there is only one species of giraffe with multiple subspecies. In 2016, some scientists released a study that claims genetic differences among giraffe populations indicate the existence of four distinct giraffe species.\n8:30"}

Highly prized by big game hunters, these incredible creatures are members of \"Africa's Big Five\" - the five most difficult African animals to hunt on foot.\nThe African lion, the leopard, the African elephant and the rhinoceros (either white or black), are the other four members, but the cape buffalo actually kills more big game hunters than the other four animals combined.\nThere are 4 subspecies of African buffalo, which is Africa's only cow-like animal. The largest of these is the Cape buffalo, which is the only subspecies recognized as a \"Big Five\" member. In other words, just like all Pit Bulls are dogs but not all dogs are Pit Bulls, all Cape buffalo are African buffalo, but not all African buffalo are Cape buffalo.\nIt is also incorrectly referred to as the water buffalo, which is a significantly different animal found in Asia. Water buffalo are taller than cape buffalo, but are actually domesticated animals, with mild personalities compared to their hot tempered cousin.\nThe cape buffalo is a herbivorous bovine, effectively a plant-eating cow, but they are extremely aggressive and downright vengeful. Displaying perhaps a little more smarts than a typical bovine, there are numerous accounts of them using their legendary memories and extreme persistence to enact revenge upon hunters who shoot at or injure them. Cape buffalo have stalked hunting parties, hiding in wait, and ambushing their attackers.\nThey reportedly charge thousands of people a year, and gore over 200. They can attack and cause serious injury with the tips of their huge, curved horns, or by head butting with their \"boss\" which is the solid shield of horn that covers the skull where the horns emerge.\nBoth males and females have horns, but the males horns grow larger and can measure close to 4 feet across. Males also develop a thicker neck, a larger hump over the shoulders, and a fringe of long hairs around the throat that looks a bit like a beard, but is called a \"dewlap\". The largest males approach 2,000 pounds and 6 feet at the shoulder and take nearly 10 years of growing to reach full size.\nFull grown individuals are rarely targeted by large predators, but weakened adults and calves are hunted by lions. Even for a large pride of lions however, attacking any member of a Cape buffalo herd is extremely perilous. Herd members will come rushing to eachothers aid, and many a full grown lion has been gored to death by the Cape buffalo's incredible horns.\ncape buffalo lifestyle\nCape buffalo are extremely gregarious herd animals that will gather in groups of thousands when grazing is good. In the dry season they break up into smaller groups of 30 to 200 or so to find food. Within these herds are several smaller sub-herds that stick together and travel together.\nCows and their offspring, including young bulls up to 3 years old, will form family type units of 10 to 30, generally lead by a few matriarchal females. Groups of young bachelors stay together, and mature bulls may stay in small groups of 4 or 5 grizzled veterans sometimes called \"gangs\". Bulls passed their prime are called \ufeff\"dagga boys\", and will stay on the perimeter of the herd. The movements of these herds is driven generally in the same direction, following food sources and green pastures as they emerge.\nCape buffalo cannot go long without drinking, and are rarely more than 10 miles from a water source. They travel close to rivers and waterways, and will joyfully wallow in mud if available. They cover themselves and roll around in muddy pools to keep cool in hotter months. The mud can prevent insect bites and may smother some insects as well.\nCape buffalo, although notorious for their aggression, particularly towards hunters, are highly social. They engage in mutual grooming, will rest or lie down in close proximity, resting their chins on eachothers backs and shoulders, and engage in affectionate nuzzling and playful ear chewing.\nThey are extraordinarily protective of eachother, and weak, injured or older herd members have been observed enjoying the support of the herd. When in unfamiliar territory or under attack, herds will often surround calves or weak members all facing outward in a circle, ready to fight all comers.\nThere have been numerous accounts over the years of buffalo coming to aid one of their own against a lion attack, mobbing lion prides with a community effort. A tendency to charge en masse Sometimes the buffalo are the aggressors, particularly if a solitary lion, hyena or wild dog wanders into the path of the herd. Older bulls and sometimes fearless matriarchs will chase and sometimes kill lone predators, and some even make sport of it.\ngorgeous Cape buffalo\ncape buffalo reproduction\nAfrican buffalo adults protecting calf\nDuring mating season mature bulls will drive off younger males and old bulls, while attempting to keep cows close. Males may engage in sparring, pushing eachother with their bosses, but goring is rare, and joists tend to be tests of strength, with the less robust party leaving the scene before any damage is done. Strong, healthy bulls in the 8 to 14 year range are most successful at attracting a herd of cows, and just a few males will actually breed with most of the females. Gradually, however, they lose their ability to defend their herd. Eventually, very old males will stop attempting to rejoin the herd and will stay on the outskirts in small groups, or sometimes alone. As cape buffalo age the hair on their rumps tends to bald, and older males can be identified by their bare behinds. With patches of bare skin exposed, mud wallowing is a requirement to prevent sunburn, and these older bulls spend lots of time by the mud holes. They are called \"dagga boys\" by the Zulu people, dagga being the Zulu word for mud. Dagga boys tend to be cantankerous, frustrated, and exceptionally dangerous, probably accounting for the majority of attacks on people. Cows are pregnant for about 340 days, and breeding is timed so that calving takes place at the beginning of the rainy season. The calf is born quite precocious, fully furred, eyes open and able to stand within minutes. Calves have no horns when newborn, but there are two horny circles on the head called \"buttons\" from which the horns will soon start to grow. It takes about 10 years for horns to reach full size, and for the boss to fully harden. Young calves are raised by their mother, but all members of the herd look out for them and may come to their aid. The herd will also form a circle around calves when danger is near. If a pride of lions or other threat approaches herd members will stand in a circle around the calves facing out, ready to defend the little ones.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

There are 2 species of oxpeckers, both very similar in appearance, one red-billed and the other yellow-billed.\nThey are both quite happy to roost on not just Cape buffalo, but also elephants, antelope, and especially rhinos. They feed on the insect parasites that infest their large hosts. Ticks, lice, flies, and fleas colonize on Cape buffalo and are eaten by these birds.\nThe oxpecker will remove embedded ticks from all areas of the hosts body, entering ears and nostrils, and excavating around delicate nether regions. This has always been thought of as a symbiotic relationship, with both creatures benefiting relatively equally, but recent observations suggest that the buffalo doesn't benefit nearly as much as the oxpecker.\nOnce thought to keep buffaloes wounds clean by removing dead tissue, it is now thought that the oxpeckers actually interfere with and delay proper healing.\nIt is also questionable how beneficial their control of ticks may be, since they tend to prefer blood-engorged ticks that have already fed off the buffalo, allowing the ticks that have just arrived to attach and settle in for a meal.\nBy doing this the birds are, in a way, actually consuming buffalo blood with each engorged tick they eat. So the pendulum is swinging towards the idea that oxpeckers, once thought to be little helpers, are actually just as parasitic as the parasites they feed on.\na few more cape buffalo facts\nCape buffalo are so powerful they have been know to tip over cars\nThe \"boss\" is the solid shield of horn that covers the top of the buffalo's head\nThe Cape buffalo is also called the African buffalo\nThere are 4 subspecies of Cape or African buffalo\nBaby Cape buffalo can run with the herd just an hour after being born\nNew born Cape buffalo have spots on their heads called \"buttons\" where the horns will grow\nCape buffalo have a top speed of 35 miles an hour\nCape buffalo are so dangerous they are known as \"the Black Death\"\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Artiodactyla\nFamily Bovidae\nGenus Syncerus\nSpecies caffer\nCape Buffalo - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT bull cow calf herd GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD herd, gang Africa savanna grass TOPSPEED ENDANGERED AVG WEIGHT AVG HEIGHT 35 mph no 1300 pounds 50-70 inches ESTRUS GESTATION BIRTH WEIGHT BIRTHHEIGHT 1 x year 340 days 90-120 pounds 20-26 inches RAISED BY # OF YOUNG AT BIRTH STANDS mother 1 eyes open 1/2 hour WEANED INDEPENDENT MATURITY LIFESPAN 6 months 1 year 2 - 3 years 15-25 years"}

However, in proportion to the size of the body, the elephant brain is smaller than the human brain. Despite this, the elephant is one of the only animals along with all apes (including ourselves), sperm whales and a few other creatures who has a large brain relative to body size. \"Brain size gives a rough measure of mental flexibility--some say intelligence--and large mammalian brains are associated with complex sociality\" Katy Payne In Silent Thunder Remarkably, the size of the bull African elephant can weigh 4.2-5.4 kg and the cow's as 3.6-4.3 kg. However, this difference in brain size between the sexes is not related to intelligence. Behavioural studies of elephants illustrate very intelligent actions from female elephants, that are equal or surpassing those of the male elephants. Remember, brain size without relation to body size is not generally that helpful. Given the fact that cows are generally smaller to bulls, the overall difference in mass in inconsequential. Also, the brain and consciousness of the cow is much different than that of a bull; they are reared and interact with their mothers in very different ways right from birth and while the females form a very close knit bond with each other which is constantly maintained, the males are more nomadic. Interestingly, the growth and development of the elephant's brain is similar to that of mans. Both the elephant and man are born with small brain masses. The mass of the new-born elephant's brain is 35% of that of the adult, while Mans is 26%. Thus, there is considerable growth and development as the calf grows up. As the mass of the brain increases, so does the learning ability of young elephants. Not surprisingly, evidence gathered from both anatomical details, as well as from behavioural studies, suggest that the elephant is a very intelligent animal. :)"}

Human fascination with animal behaviour probably extends back millions of years, perhaps even to times before the ancestors of the species became human in the modern sense. Initially, animals were probably observed for practical reasons because early human survival depended on knowledge of animal behaviour. Whether hunting wild game, keeping domesticated animals, or escaping an attacking predator, success required intimate knowledge of an animal\u2019s habits. Even today, information about animal behaviour is of considerable importance. For example, in Britain, studies on the social organization and the ranging patterns of badgers (Meles meles) have helped reduce the spread of tuberculosis among cattle, and studies of sociality in foxes (Vulpes vulpes) assist in the development of models that predict how quickly rabies would spread should it ever cross the English Channel. Likewise in Sweden, where collisions involving moose (Alces alces) are among the most common traffic accidents in rural areas, research on moose behaviour has yielded ways of keeping them off roads and verges. In addition, investigations of the foraging of insect pollinators, such as honeybees, have led to impressive increases in agricultural crop yields throughout the world.\nEven if there were no practical benefits to be gained from learning about animal behaviour, the subject would still merit exploration. Humans (Homo sapiens) are animals themselves, and most humans are deeply interested in the lives and minds of their fellow humans, their pets, and other creatures. British ethologist Jane Goodall and American field biologist George Schaller, as well as British broadcaster David Attenborough and Australian wildlife conservationist Steve Irwin, have brought the wonders of animal behaviour to the attention and appreciation of the general public. Books, television programs, and movies on the subject of animal behaviour abound."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Lion images!\nThe lion is Africa\u2019s apex predator\nThe lion is one of the largest, strongest, and most powerful felines in the world, second only in size to the Siberian Tiger. They are the largest cats on the African continent. While most big cats are solitary hunters, lions are incredibly sociable animals that live together in family groups called pride. They are some of the world\u2019s most popular animals.\nIncredible Lion Facts!\nBetween 1993-2014, the IUCN estimated the population of lions decreased by 42%. Due to poaching and habitat loss, its estimated there may be fewer than 20,000 lions left today.\nWhile lions are generally social animals, prides generally consist of 80% females. For this reason, only about one in eight male lions survive to adulthood. Groups of male lions sometimes band together, controlling vast swaths of territory. One famous band of male lions in South Africa\u2019s Kruger National Park controlled over 170,000 acres and was estimated to kill more than 100 rival lions and cubs.\nLions are animals that have long been kept in zoos and in captivity. In 18th century England, the price of admission to the Tower Menagerie (the pre-cursor to the London Zoo) was three pence, or a cat or dog to be fed to the lions!\nThe largest lion ever recorded weighed 690 pounds and was shot in South Africa in 1936. Ancient lions were even larger than today\u2019s largest lions, and reached up to 1,153 pounds!\nThe lion is considered one of the \u201cAfrican Big Five.\u201d\nFor our full list of incredible lion facts, see our 13 mind-blowing lion facts page.\nLion Scientific Name and Classification\nThe scientific name for lions is Panthera leo. The genus Panthera is of Greek origin and comprises big cat species such as tigers, lions, jaguars, and leopards that have the ability to roar. Leo is the Latin word for lion.\nThere are two types of lion subspecies. One is named Panthera leo melanochaita and lives across South and East Africa. The second lion subspecies has the scientific name Panther leo leo and lives in West Africa, Central Africa, and Asia. You may see references to African and Asiatic lions. Up until 2017, there were two recognized subspecies, the African and Asiatic lions, but scientists reclassified lions that year. For more information on the types of lions see our full lion classification guide.\nLion Anatomy and Appearance\nLions have a short coat of tawny or golden fur with a long tail that has a tuft of longer fur at the end. The markings on their coats are much fainter than the bold stripes and spots displayed on other felines which helps these large carnivores in going unseen when stalking prey in the long grasses. Lions have strong and powerful jaws that contain 30 teeth in total which includes four fang-like canines and four carnassial teeth that are perfectly designed for slicing through flesh.\nLion Mane\nThe lion is one of the largest cats in the world with males being taller and heavier than females and displaying a mane of long hair around their faces (in fact, it is the only case in the feline world where males and females actually look different). Thought to be connected with testosterone levels, the mane of the male lion ranges from blonde to red, brown, and black in color and covers their head, neck, and chest.\nWhite Lions\nSeveral big cat species have been observed in the wild with color mutations, such as the white tiger or black panther. Likewise, there is an uncommon color mutation of lions that leaves their coat extremely pale.\nUnlike white tigers which are albino \u2013 that is, lacking in color pigments in their coat \u2013 the coat of white lions is caused by recessive traits. The uncommon nature of white lions led to them being captured and moved into captivity in the second half of the 20th century.\nToday, white lions are bred across many zoos and wildlife parks. For example, in North America, six white lions are located at Parc Safari near Montreal, Quebec as of 2020. However, they\u2019re now being reintroduced back into environments in South Africa and are successfully breeding and hunting in their native environments.\nLion Distribution and Habitat\nHistorically, Lions would have been found throughout much of Africa and even in parts of Europe and Asia as well. Today, however, they have been pushed into more isolated pockets of their once vast natural range with the remaining African Lion population now only found in countries in sub-Saharan Africa. There is also still a small population of Asiatic Lions found inhabiting a remote part of the Gir Forest in India.\nDespite their dwindling numbers, Lions are actually incredibly adaptable animals that can and will inhabit very dry climates as they get most of the moisture they need from their food. They prefer areas of open woodland, scrub, and long grasslands where there is not only plenty over cover but also a wide variety of prey. They are only not found in areas of rainforest or far into deserts.\nLion Population \u2014 How Many White Lions Are Left?\nLike other big cat species, the lion is under threat from habitat loss and hunting. Between 1993 and 2014, the population of lions decreased by 42%. The IUCN\u2019s last assessment places the adult population between 23,000 to 39,000 mature individuals. Today, lions as a species are listed as \u201cVulnerable,\u201d a step above being declared \u201cEndangered.\u201d\nWhile the Africa lion\u2019s population likely numbers over 20,000, Asiatic lion populations are estimated to number just 600 individuals. Asiatic lions are limited to just a single wildlife sanctuary in India that measures just 545 square miles (1,400 sq. km). Further growth in the population of Asiatic lions will rely on reintroduction into new habitats in India.\nExtinct lion species and subpopulations\nScientists believe that 10,000 years ago lions were the most widespread mammal outside of humans. However, today their range is a fraction of its historical size. This comes from the extinction of two unique lion species near the end of the last ice age and habitat loss that has reduced the range of lions\nBarbary lion\nThe Barbary lion used to live across the North Coast of Africa, with a range that stretched from Egypt to Morocco. Until recently, it was believed to be a distinct subspecies of lion, but research now shows it\u2019s genetically similar to Asiatic lions.\nThe Barbary lion was largely hunted to extinction in the 19th century. The last documented sighting was in Algeria\u2019s Atlas Mountains in 1942 (although, skins were found on illegal markets into the 1980s, suggesting the Barbary lions may have survived longer), leaving the lion regionally extinct in North Africa. Today, Barbary lions aren\u2019t recognized as unique subspecies, but for much of the 20th century, they were believed to be.\nCape lion\nThe Cape lion used to live in South Africa and was defined by a darker mane than many other lion populations. Today, the Cape Lion is recognized as a subpopulation rather than a different species or subspecies. There have been no lions found in the Cape lion\u2019s range since 1858.\nCave lion (Panthera leo spelaea)\nThe Cave lion was a species of lion that stretched across Eurasia and into Alaska and went extinct with the collapse of the mammoth steppe about 12,000 years ago. The species lived across all of continental Europe and many archeological drawings of lions from that area depict cave lions. The species was larger than today\u2019s surviving lions. In recent years, a number of frozen cave lion cubs have been discovered in Russia\u2019s permafrost.\nAmerican lion (Panthera leo atrox)\nAnother lion species that disappeared roughly 12,000 years ago during a period of global climate change, the America lion\u2019s ranged stretched across most of the modern-day United States and Mexico. The American lion is notable for being the largest lion species. Its habitat was similar to today\u2019s African lion, with it hunting across large grasslands on large mammals like bison, deer, and even mammoths.\nLion Behaviour and Lifestyle\nLions are unique among cats as they live together in strong social groups. A pride is made up of 5-15 related females and their cubs along with a generally single male (small groups of 2 or 3 though are not uncommon). Male Lions patrol a territory of around 100m\u00b2 marking trees and rocks with urine and roaring to warn off intruders. Although male Lions can defend their pride to great effect, their position in the pride is constantly under threat from other males who try to take over their patch and if successful, they will kill any cubs that were sired by the previous male. Despite their enormous size, male Lions actually do hardly any of the hunting as they are often slower and more easily seen than their female counterparts. The Lionesses in the pride hunt together meaning that they are not only more successful on their trips, but they are also able to catch and kill animals that are both faster than them and much bigger.\nLion Roar\nLion roars can be extremely loud, reaching about 114 decibels in volume. Their roar is loud enough to breach the pain threshold of human hearing! Lion roars are louder than any big cat, and can be heard from a distance of about 5 miles away (8 km). The ability to roar at such a high volume is due to unique adaptations in the lion\u2019s vocal folds. Lions generally roar as a warning and to defend their territories. Beyond warning off males, lion roars also allow members of the pride to find one another as its sound can travel such long distances.\nLion Reproduction, Cubs, and Lifespan\nBoth male and female lions are able to reproduce between the ages of two and three but despite this, they will often not breed until the pride has been firmly established. After a gestation period that lasts for nearly four months, female lions give birth to between one and six cubs that are born blind and are incredibly vulnerable in their new surroundings. The fur of lion cubs is covered in darker spots that help to camouflage them into their den to protect them whilst the adults have gone out to hunt.\nSadly, however, less than half of cubs make it to be a year old and four out of five have died by the time they are two, generally either from animal attacks or starvation. Remarkably though, the female lions in the pride will have their cubs at around the same time and will help to suckle and care for the cubs of other females. Lion cubs suckle on milk until they are about six months old and although they won\u2019t begin actively hunting until they are about a year old, lion cubs start to eat meat after 12 weeks or so.\nLike most big cats, lions live about 10 to 15 years. In captivity, lions have lived quite a bit longer than in the wild. In 2016, the Philadelphia Zoo was had to euthanize a 25-year old female lion after it began suffering from limited mobility.\nLion Diet and Prey\nThe Lion is a large and carnivorous animal that survives only by eating other animals in order to sustain itself. Lions eat a diet that consists of buffalo, wildebeests, and even giraffes. Depending on the abundance and variety of prey species within their territory, Lions primarily catch gazelle, zebra, and warthog along with a number of antelope species by following the herds across the open grasslands. They will not turn their noses up though at hunting alone should the situation arise and will happily steal the kill of another animal. Once the animal has been caught though, circumstances change as the females will allow the male Lion to eat first before indulging themselves. The cubs however are at the bottom of the pile and have to be content with what remains once the adults have finished.\nUnlike other felines, lions are not solitary hunters but instead, the lionesses work together in order to chase down and catch their prey with each female having a different strategic role. This strategy allows them to kill animals that are both faster and much larger than they are. A study of 1,300 lion hunts found that when hunting individually, their success rate on hunts was 17-19%. However, when hunting in groups, success rates jumped to 30%.\nOn average, lions eat about 17 to 20 lbs (8 to 9 kg) of meat per day. Males can about 100 pounds in a day (43 kg), while females can eat 55 pounds (25 kg).\nFor a complete analysis of the diet of lions, make sure to read \u2018What Do Lions Eat? 15 Foods They Hunt.\u2018\nLion Predators and Threats\nThe lion is the most dominant predator within its environment meaning that other animals pose little or no threat to them, with the exception of hyena packs that can cause fatal damages to lions particularly when they are on their own and food is about. Lions are seen as a great threat by many other species including both giraffes and elephants which are easily capable of fatally injuring a lion to try and warn it off.\nMore than other species, the significant threat to lions is other lions. In South Africa\u2019s Sabi Sands a group of male lions formed a coalition that\u2019s believed to have killed more than 100 lions across a territory that eventually ranged across 170,000 acres. Male lions will often kill one another while attempting to seize control of prides, and then will also kill cubs of prides to ensure a gene pool that\u2019s not theirs is passed on.\nLion numbers have also been severely affected by diseases passed through hyenas from wild dogs, with more than 1,000 lions having died from canine distemper between 1993 and 1997.\nLion Relationship with Humans\nHowever, the biggest threat to Lions is people who not only kill them out of fear (and historically as trophies) and the encroachment of agriculture and cities. Lions have been admired and feared by people for centuries, but due to both hunting and growing human settlements, lions have been wiped out from a vast portion of their historical natural range.\nAlthough they do not naturally see people as prey, African Lions have been known to sneak into villages (sometimes of great size) to find food, and are known to attack up to 700 people every year, with Lions being responsible for 100 human fatalities annually in Tanzania alone. In 1898, two Lions in Kenya (known as Tsavo lions \u2013 a pair of mane-less Lion) became famous for killing and eating over 130 rail-road workers over a period of around 9 months.\n3 more lion facts\nRemember to read our full lion facts page to get a full list of the most incredible facts on this remarkable species. You\u2019ll find facts like:\nYoung lions practice role playing!\nYoung Lion cubs spend a great deal of time playing together which actually helps them to develop their hunting techniques. This method of role-playing in cubs also helps females to determine whether or not they would be suited better to chasing and cornering prey, or catching and killing it.\nLions have small hearts and lungs and must rely on stealth and teamwork\nThe Lion has large paws with soft pads underneath and sharp retractable claws on the end of each toe which aid them in running, climbing and catching their prey along with also being good defense mechanisms. The structure of their feet and legs means that they are also able to jump distances over 10 meters. Lion hearts weigh about 1,175 grams, which in relation to their body size is significantly smaller than many of the herbivores they hunt. Their heart and lung size means lions can only exert themselves for small distances and must rely on teamwork and sneaking up close to prey before beginning their hunt.\nThe world\u2019s most famous lion survived a plane crash\nOne of the most famous depictions of a lion is the roaring lion at the start of film\u2019s from MGM studios. To raise publicity for this lion, in 1927 MGM flew their mascot across the country, but in a flight from San Diego to New York the plane crashed. The original MGM lion survived the plane crash and survived four days on a diet of sandwiches and milk!\nView all 55 animals that start with L"}

Aardvarks have long, sticky tongues, which can be up to 12 inches (30 centimeters) long. Each night, they are able to dig up termite mounds and ant nests and slurp up and swallow tens of thousands of insects.\nAardvarks are most active at night and tend to live alone. During the day, they sleep curled up in a ball in their burrows. As night falls, aardvarks will emerge cautiously from their dens, jumping around on the lookout for predators. They are able to see at night, but otherwise have poor vision and are color-blind. They rely on their senses of sound and smell, using their long ears and snouts to get around and find insects.\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\nFemale aardvarks give birth in their burrow usually to one baby at a time. A baby aardvark stays in the burrow for two weeks and then begins to venture out to forage at night with its mom. Babies begin digging for their own meals when they reach six months and they grow to full size in about one year.\nThe aardvark\u2019s fast digging skill also helps protect it from predators, such as hyenas and lions. When threatened, an aardvark can dig a hole and cover itself up in about ten minutes. Its large claws are another layer of defense.\nThough aardvarks remain widespread, humans are the aardvark\u2019s biggest threat. Some landowners don\u2019t like the holes that aardvarks leave behind and kill the aardvarks. The use of pesticides to grow crops on land inhabited by aardvarks has also reduced the number of insects available for aardvarks to eat."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Walrus images!\nWalrus Classification and Evolution\nThe Walrus is a large marine animal that is found inhabiting the freezing cold and icy waters of the Arctic Circle. Thought to be most closely related to Fur Seals, Walruses are the second largest ocean-dwelling mammals that come ashore to breed after Elephant Seals and are highly distinctive amongst pinnipeds due to their sensitive whiskers and long tusks. There are two different species of Walrus that vary slightly in appearance but mainly in geographic location which are the Atlantic Walrus and the Pacific Walrus. However, it is widely debated as to whether or not there is actually a third species known as the Laptev Walrus that is found in the Laptev Sea, which many believe to simply be a population of Pacific Walruses that specifically inhabit the area. The Walrus is considered to be an increasingly vulnerable animal species although gathering data on these elusive creatures can be difficult so it is hard to determine exactly the current status of Walrus populations in the wild.\nWalrus Anatomy and Appearance\nWalruses are animals with large and elongated bodies that are wider at the head and neck and taper towards their tail which is embedded in a web of skin. Their tough and wrinkled skin is covered by a layer of sparse, coarse hairs and is generally grey or brown in colour. However, whilst sunbathing out of the water, the skin of the Walrus (which can be up to 4cm thick) develops a pink-red colouration. Walruses have two pairs of flippers that are used to help to propel these large animals with great agility through the water, with their bodies powered by their back flippers while the front flippers are used to steer them in the right direction. On land, they move about awkwardly on all fours, curling their back flippers underneath them at right angles to give them more support. The skin on the bottom of their flippers is rough and knobbly which helps to prevent these enormous animals from slipping on the ice. Walruses have long tusks (extra-long upper canine teeth) that are used for both fighting and to dig into the ice when they are pulling their heavy bodies out of the water.\nWalrus Distribution and Habitat\nWalruses are animals that are found throughout the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans where they inhabit ice floes and rocky coastlines, along with spending a great deal of time in the freezing cold water. During the winter months when the ice is at its thickest, Walruses tend to prefer areas of thinner ice that they can easily break through to the surface from the water underneath. In the warmer summer months when the ice recedes, Walruses can be found more commonly on remote areas of rocky coastline. Despite being well suited to the freezing conditions in the far north, Walruses have on occasion been known to venture further south in areas of Central Canada, around the United Kingdom and even as far as the waters close to the Spanish coast. They do however, spend most of their time in and around the Arctic Circle where they are becoming increasingly under-threat from global warming which is rapidly depleting the ice that these animals have learnt to rely on.\nWalrus Behaviour and Lifestyle\nWalruses are incredibly sociable animals that live in large herds on the ice floes that can contain up to thousands of individuals and consist mainly on females (cows) with their young, along with a number of dominant males (bulls). When they retreat into the water to feed, these enormous herds break up into smaller bands numbering as few as ten individuals so there is less competition for food. Male Walruses are almost double the weight of their female counterparts and have much longer tusks which can grow up to a meter in length and are used primarily for fighting with competitors for the most favoured breeding sites and the females that reside there. They are known to make a variety of vocal sounds including loud bellows during the mating season that are easily and loudly produced thanks to the two pouches of air in their necks.\nWalrus Reproduction and Life Cycles\nWalruses most commonly breed in the middle of winter between the months of January and March. After a gestation period that lasts for around 15 months, a single pup is born on the ice measuring up to 1.2 meters long and weighing up 75kg. Walrus pups have short and soft hair covering their bodies, pale grey flippers and a thick, white moustache with no visible teeth. They suckle only on their mother\u2019s milk for their first six months when they begin to eat more solid foods. After their first year, Walrus pups are almost triple the size they were at birth and begin to become more and more independent, although tend to remain very close to their incredibly protective mothers until they are two or three years old. Young females will often remain close to their mother but males begin to venture away from the herd to join all-male bachelor groups. Female Walruses are able to reproduce at around 6 or 7 years of age but males are not mature until they are at least 10 years old but will often not successfully reproduce until they can prove their dominance around 5 years later.\nWalrus Diet and Prey\nWalruses are carnivorous animals that only hunt and eat other animals in order to survive. They have a thick moustache containing roughly 450 very sensitive whiskers that help them to find food in the dark and murky waters at depths of around 100 meters below the surface. Walruses find almost all of their prey on the ocean floor and are known to expel streams of both air and water into the sediment to reveal food hidden under the sand. They feed primarily by sucking food into their mouths rather than using their teeth to chew on it and are even known to grip shellfish between their lips and suck the soft creature out from inside the shell, before spitting the shell out into the water. Walruses feed on a variety of different prey species including clams, snails, worms, squid, octopuses and even some species of slow-moving fish. Some Walrus populations are also known to hunt seals.\nWalrus Predators and Threats\nDue to the large size and aggressive nature of these marine mammals, Walruses have few predators in their natural environments with the exception of pods of Killer Whales and the occasional brave Polar Bear, as they can easily defend themselves with their enormous tusks. Humans are the most common predators of the Walrus as they are hunted for the meat, skin and oil by local populations (along with the less desirable hunting of them for their ivory from non-native people). They are also threatened in certain areas by water pollution including oil contamination that affects them directly but also through their prey, along with large fishing vessels that harvest the animals that the Walruses prey on and not only leave them with less food, but also cause severe noise pollution in the normally quiet and remote waters.\nWalrus Interesting Facts and Features\nWalruses are incredibly well adapted to living in some of the coldest regions in the world with thick skin that covers a thick layer of blubber (fat) that helps to keep them warm. Their enormous tusks were originally thought to aid them when feeding but are know known to be more do with social status and even help with mobility. Walruses dig their tusks into ice floes to help them haul their enormous bodies out of the water but also anchor their tusks into the ice so they are able to sleep whilst their bodies remain submerged beneath the waves. Walruses are also known to use their long and powerful tusks like a pick-axe to carve their way through the thick ice. Walruses feed in the darkness of the ocean floor and are known to commonly dive to depths of between 80m and 100m for nearly half an hour at a time. However, recent studies show that depending on the availability of prey, Walruses have been known to reach much deeper depths of up to 180 meters below the surface of the water.\nWalrus Relationship with Humans\nFor thousands of years, local people have thought of Walruses as being very similar to humans as they are known to display qualities of intelligence, are slow to reproduce and take long and very good care of their more vulnerable young. Walruses have also been hunted by people in their native countries for thousands of years as a good source of food but in more recent years they have also been increasingly hunted for the ivory in their tusks, which is considered to be second in both size and quality only to those of elephants. Large scale hunting has decimated Walrus populations, particularly in certain areas but it is also increasing amounts of pollution that is having a devastating effect on wild populations.\nWalrus Conservation Status and Life Today\nToday, the Walrus is considered to be species that is Near Threatened in its natural environment although data is hard to gather on these bottom-feeding mammals. They have been declining in number since the 18th century with increasing levels of hunting and human activity and more recently are becoming increasingly threatened by the lessening amount of ice due to global warming. Although the exact population size is unknown, there are estimated to be between 200,000 and 250,000 individuals remaining in the freezing waters of the Arctic Circle.\nView all 72 animals that start with W"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Hippo Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Hippo-facts.html", "text": "hippo Facts\nPortrait of a Hippo\nThe hippopotamus, commonly referred to as the hippo, is a round, bald, cantankerous herbivore with a semi-aquatic lifestyle and a fearsome reputation. At 14 to 16 feet, and 4,000 pounds, they are about as long and heavy as a Ford Fusion. The 3 foot skull houses huge, protruding canines, called tusks, contained in a broad, cavernous mouth, that can be opened to a gape of 150 degrees - 3 times wider than the human jaw.\nThe hippos bulbous body is supported by oddly slender legs, but these legs have osteosclerotic bones, meaning they are extremely dense, with little of the porous material that is present in most mammalian leg bones. This skeletal adaption allows the enormous hippo to sink to the bottom of the river, and walk on the riverbed floor.\nAlthough they spend nearly 16 hours a day wallowing in rivers and streams, hippos don't actually swim. When not strolling along the bottom, they propel themselves by pushing off the riverbed, or rocks, driftwood, or other hippos, and gliding along for a distance, before pushing off again.\nThe hippo is the third largest land animal, falling in line behind the elephant and the white rhino. The black rhino averages about the same size as most hippos, and other rhinoceros species are smaller.\nHippos are amphibious, and live in swamps, rivers and lakes throughout the southern two-thirds of Africa. Their skin is mostly bare, with extremely fine, sparse hair over the body, and some whiskers across the muzzle. The inner layers of skin are thick, and there is, of course, also a layer of blubber, similar to that of their closest relatives, the whales. But the epidermis, or outer layer of skin, is very thin and delicate, and will dehydrate and crack without a water source to bathe in.\nThe skin also secretes an oily substance called \"blood sweat\". This secretion is completely unique to hippos, and is neither blood, nor sweat. It has a reddish or pink hue, and not only protects the skin from sunburn and dehydration, but is also believed to have antibiotic properties, which help prevent infection in the event that the skin does crack.\nHippopotamus!\nHippos live in loose groups of ten to thirty individuals, that may swell to hundreds depending on the season. During drought, limited waterways are packed with writhing hippos trying to stay moisturized, and competition and aggression can lead to many squabbles, battles, and violent confrontations.\nThese tendencies are not preserved for their own kind, however. Ask any game warden, big game hunter or native of the African wilds, and they will tell you that hippos are not just huge and fearless, but also often so ruthlessly aggressive that they have been known to capsize small boats just to get a mouthful of hapless occupants.\nThe portly hippo is just as dangerous on land. Capable of running in excess of 20 miles per hour, there have been reports of hippos chasing human beings on foot, and snatching them with massive jaws that are wider than a pizza delivery box!\nIn fact, the hippopotamus is responsible for over 2,900 human fatalities a year! That's more than lions and leopards combined. An amazing statistic for the vegetarian hippo.\nChubby and balding, yes. But don't tell him that to his face!\nhippo lifestyle\nherd of hippos\nhippopotamus underwater\nHippopotamuses are very gregarious animals, living, virtually on top of each other at times, in groups of up to 150 individuals. But despite their crowded existence, they are actually not particularly social. The only real family unit is a mother with her offspring.\nAdults do not form strong bonds, and spend very little time interacting in ways that we might recognize as friendship. There aren't any little cliques, or close buddies, no mutual grooming, and nothing much in the form of play.\nIt might be added that hippos don't have very large brains for their enormous size, and so tend to be remarkably simple animals.\nThese are creatures of habit, for sure, spending the daytime hours lounging in the water, and rolling in mud. They may bask in the sun, as long as they are only steps from the river or lake where they can dive back in if they get too hot or dry. At dusk, as the day cools and the sun sets, the herd leaves the water and heads down well traveled paths where they branch off to graze.\nWith several species of tender grasses making up the bulk of their diet, the hippo spends about 6 hours a night feeding. Large adults can consume about 80 pounds of grass in a singles evening. They generally graze in solitary, wandering 3 to 5 miles as they dine, and sometimes napping in sandy areas.\nThere is little aggression displayed on land, and no clear territories delineated or defended.\nBefore returning to the river, they will defecate in communal \"dung middens\".\nBack in the water during the day is when adult males spend allot of time establishing territories. Dominant males will secure areas of riverfront, chase other dominant males out, and attempt to mate with the females who live in their territory. Subordinate males who show the appropriate respect are allowed to stay.\nMales display their dominance with yawning displays, and bulls will battle for superiority by facing eachother with massive jaws agape, pushing and bludgeoning each other with their tusks. Injuries are common, and most old bulls have many scars.\nHippos are very vocal and incredibly loud. Their snorts and bellows, particualarly while wading together in crowded pools, can be heard for long d- Hippo Facts\nHippo life\nhippo reproduction\nbaby hippo kisses mommy\nhappy hippo mother and baby\nOnly the largest and most aggressive male hippos, perhaps only 1 in 10, will ever establish their own territory, attract willing females, and successfully reproduce. The rest will spend their lives in loosely formed bachelor herds and never breed.\nDominant males establish themselves by staking claim to a section of real estate, marking it with copious amounts of dung and urine, and battling any males that are not completely submissive.\nA male who has secured his own territory will mark it by releasing a combination of feces and urine while he spins his tail around like a propeller blade. The dung spray is tossed in all directions by the hippos spinning tail, coating sand, shrubs and rocks. He will even spray females in his territory.\nAs the dry season brings more hippos together in one area, most mating occurs during the drought. The timing insures that youngsters will be born during the wet season, when mothers are less crowded and have more resources.\nHippos usually mate in the water, which probably makes things a bit easier given the size of the participants. The pregnancy is only 8 months long, but yields an enormous calf, often 100 pounds at birth. The mother will go off alone when she is ready, and may deliver the baby on land or in the water. If it is an underwater birth, the mother must nose the baby to the surface to get its first gasp of air.\nA mother hippo is highly protective and she will wait several days before bringing her calf around the herd. She will spend most of her time in the water with her youngster, who nurses underwater and will rest and sleep on its mothers back as she wades. She will not leave to graze for several days until the baby is strong enough to accompany her. Some hippo mothers leave their babies alone in the water while they go to feed, but return quickly.\nCrocodiles and lions are a danger for baby hippos, but another cause of fatality among hippo babies is being crushed by other adult hippos, particularly if a scuffle breaks out.\nBaby hippos nurse for about 18 months, but are sampling grasses within a few weeks of birth. Mothers will often park youngsters together to make babysitting easier. Young hippos will stay with their mothers until they are mature, about 8 years. A mother hippo may live together with as many as five of her offspring, and sometimes grandkids.\n- Hippo Facts\nhippopotamus babies\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

They look more like pigs than perhaps any other animal, but pigs and hippos are not closely related at all. They are called \"water horses\" but are far from equine. In fact, the closest relative of the hippos are the whales.\nIt is theorized that whales and dolphins were actually land animals at one point, that migrated back to the sea. And it is thought that they once looked very much like hippos!\nThe hippopotamus has specialized sensory organs that are all placed at the roof of the head. Nostrils, eyes and ears are positioned so that the hippo may be almost completely submerged, and nearly invisible from land, yet still see, hear and smell what's going on. And while their jaw is submerged, they can receive vibrations through it that register as sounds, and let the hippo know what's happening underwater as well.\nHippos are extremely vocal underwater, and actually create sounds that are similar to whales. It is theorized that they may even use a form of echolocation as they navigate through muddy rivers and lakes, since they produce dolphin-like clicking noises only when they are under water, never on land.\nWhen it's time to submerge, the nostrils and ears close, and the eyes have a clear membrane that protects them like goggles. The bones of the limbs are exceptionally dense to allow the hippo to sink to the bottom, while the blubber-wrapped body keeps the torso more elevated. A push from the webbed toes provides the boost, and the smooth, buoyant hippo glides gracefully through the depths.\nThe hippo has amazing canine teeth as well, which continue to grow throughout their lives, and in males can get to be almost 2 feet long. These tusks are damaging instruments of battle, but are also used to rut around with and sometimes even scratch an itch.\npygmy hippo facts\npygmy hippos\nThe only other living hippo species is the pygmy hippopotamus. Less than one-sixth the size of the common hippo, pygmy hippos are only about 5 feet long, 3 feet tall, and 500 to 600 pounds.\nThe pygmy hippo is a solitary creature living in the swamps and dense forests of Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Ivory Coast. They have proportionately smaller, less dramatically shaped heads, with lower set ears, eyes and nostrils, indicating their less aquatic lifestyle.\nTheir skin is like that of the common hippo, with a thin epidermis, and the same \"blood sweat\" secretion. They also have tusk-like teeth, but they spend much more time on land, and much less time squabbling with neighbors.\nPygmy hippos are not very territorial and have few confrontations.

It had smaller ears and shorter tail than elephants to prevent heat loss and frostbites.\nWoolly mammoth had large, curved and asymmetrical tusks that were 10 to 15 feet long. Tusks were used for fight with other males and for the protection against predators such as wolves, wild cats and cave hyenas.\nTusks of woolly mammoth can be used to determine the age (number of rings on the cross section), health condition (thinness or thickness of the ring), and time of the year when animal died (dark rings were characteristic for the summer).\nDiet of woolly mammoth was based on the leaves, fruits, berries, nuts, and twigs.\nWoolly mammoth had lived and traveled in large family groups led by the oldest female.\nAn average lifespan of woolly mammoth was 60 years.\nFirst complete skeleton of woolly mammoth was found in 1799. German naturalist Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius von Tilenau successfully assembled all the bones except the tusks (tips of the tusks were positioned outwards).\nWoolly mammoths trapped in the large pieces of ice managed to \"survive\" till modern days with intact muscles and blood tissue.\nTusks of woolly mammoth are the only type of ivory that can be legally sold today (unlike elephant ivory). Thanks to the price of 400 dollars per pound, tusks of woolly mammoth are very popular among tusks-hunters.\nFrench adventurers have used well-preserved carcasses of mammoth as a source of food during the expeditions to the North Pole in the 19th century.\nWoolly mammoths were very popular among neolithic artists. Only Rouffignac cave in France is home of 158 pictures of woolly mammoth."}

Spanning hundreds of millions of years, the Earth has played host to over nine million species of animal in every conceivable habitat. Today, over 1,5 million living animals have been identified and described, with new ones being added every day, while some sadly fall into extinction.\nBelonging to the biological kingdom of Animalia, animals can be defined as multicellular eukaryotic organisms (more than one cell, with each cell containing a nucleus within a membrane) that breathe oxygen, consume organic material, are able to move, and reproduce sexually. As you can imagine, with all the different sizes and shapes; ways to breathe like gills or lungs; diet like plants or meat; ways to move like swimming, slithering, flying, crawling, running and hopping; body coverings like scales, feathers, fur, shells and skin; laying eggs or giving birth to live young; creatures being warm-blooded or cold, the animal kingdom is not only huge, but massively varied.\nNo matter where you find an animal \u2013 whether that\u2019s the freezing cold of the Antarctic, the blistering Sahara desert, the sweltering tropics of the Amazon, the vast African savannah, to the darkest caves and deepest oceans, animals have evolved to be uniquely adapted to their environment, with each species having complex interactions with one another and playing an important role in the ecosystem and food chain they find themselves in.\nThrough zoology, the study of animals, we\u2019ve come to learn about the smallest insects, smaller than a millimetre, to the largest blue whales at over 100 feet long. With so many animals to study, we\u2019re still learning about many, which also means undoing human damage as a result of fear and misunderstanding. Today, we know that wolves and sharks are intelligent animals with complex social hierarchies and, while dangerous, are not monsters to be killed.\nBy learning about animals, we're able to enhance our own lives. Termites have taught us about architecture, horseshoe crabs may hold the secret to never being sick, gorillas and orangutans can help us understand our early origins, livestock like horses, cattle and sheep have provided us with textiles to keep warm, transport and food, fish have taught us about streamlined shapes, while birds and whales served as inspiration for mastering the skies and seas.\nIn every culture in the world, animals can be found at their heart as symbols of strength, fertility, power and even gods incarnate. It\u2019s easy to forget that we people are animals too, but it\u2019s important to remember that we\u2019re part of the intricate web of life on Earth and it\u2019s our responsibility to look after every single creature that inhabits it.\nLearn more about fascinating animals from vertebrates to invertebrates, marine and land animals, mammals and reptiles in this section."}

Photographing elephants, because of the animals' size, can be less demanding than photographing other wild animals as you don't need to be as close to fill your camera's frame. It's nevertheless still a challenge to produce images that adequately portray the immense power, dexterity, and strong family bonds of Africa's largest mammal.\nElephant Bull, Close-up Elephant Bull, Close-up Click on any picture to enlarge\nAfrica's Big 5 Magic of Africa T-shirt\nLove Elephants T-shirt Harsh Light a Problem for Elephant Pictures\nElephants enjoy wading in water, whether in rivers or muddy waterholes. There's no better way of cooling down those huge bodies in the heat of the day. But it's also the time when the sun is high in the sky, casting intense, contrasty shadows. Your camera's light meter is also likely to be fooled by the reflections from the water, exposing for the glare of the water and so under-exposing your subject, leaving you with an elephant silhouette. It's a problem one has to live with when photographing elephants and other African wildlife - potentially excellent subjects are often found in the worst light. That's why it's best to haul out your camera gear in the early morning and late afternoon, when the light is softer and casts a warm glow. Of course, when it's cloudy and overcast, the opposite applies and it's better to take your pictures later in the day, once the light gets brighter. Elephant Photography Tips\nElephants are a dull, uniform color, usually ranging from gray to shades of brown (depending on whether they've been wallowing in mud or had a dust bath). This makes it difficult to use color to create an eye-catching image. Elephants also have unexpressive faces, unlike cats and many other mammals, with small, sunken eyes, making it difficult to use facial expressions and/or eye contact to add interest and a focal point to your image. You therefore have to focus on shape and outlines (like trunk raised, ears flapping), behavior (dust showering, using trunks to suck up water), and close-ups (wrinkled skin, trunks, and tusks) to create an interesting picture.

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Scorpion images!\nScorpions are a predatory species of arachnid with eight legs and a long tail with a stinger at the end.\nTwo of the scorpion\u2019s eight legs are in the form of pincers that look a bit like lobster claws. Scorpions are well-distributed all over the world, and they live on every continent except for Antarctica. There are over 2,600 species of scorpion.\n6 Incredible Scorpion Facts!\nMost species of scorpion are not a serious threat to humans.\nTheir exoskeletons have fluorescent chemicals that glow in ultraviolet light.\nPeople in places of Africa and East Asia often consume them as food.\nAbout 25 species of scorpion have venom deadly enough to kill a human.\nSome scorpions can squirt venom to ward off predators.\nThe largest scorpion in the world is the giant forest scorpion. It can grow to more than 9 inches in length!\nScorpion Species, Types, and Scientific Name\nScorpions are predatory arthropods belonging to the Arachnida class and the order Scorpiones. There are several families that fall under this order, including the following:\nChaerilidae\nPseudochactidae\nButhoidea\nIuridae\nBothriuridae\nChactidae\nScorpionidae\nThere are over 2,650 described species, and the vast majority are found in subtropical areas and deserts. The scientific name varies by species. For example, the scientific name of the giant forest scorpion is Heterometrus swammerdami, and it belongs to the Scorpiondae family.\nThe classification of scorpions commonly accepts that there are around 1,004 known species. However, the number may be greater than this, and some classifications are disputed. The full classification is Kingdom Animalia, Phylum Arthropoda, Subphylum Chelicerata, Class Arachnida, and Order Scorpiones.\nAppearance: How To Identify Scorpions\nCompared to other pest bugs or animals, scorpions are very easy to identify. The front pincers and the tail with a stinger are the main ways to identify them.\nThe largest species is the giant forest scorpion, which has the world record for size at nine inches long and a weight of two ounces. In general, the emperor scorpion is one of the largest species with an average length of nearly eight inches. The emperor scorpion also has the distinction of having the largest pincers, which are very similar to a lobster. Due to its large pincer size, the emperor scorpion has relatively weak venom. The smallest scorpion is a species found in Texas that measures only 23 millimeters. Most of these animals are around two inches in size.\nTheir coloring can vary based on where they live. They often blend into rocks, bark, and sand. Yellow and black are the most common colors of scorpions, but they can also be brown, red, or orange. Desert scorpions tend to be lighter colors while forest scorpions are typically black. When under ultraviolet light, all of them will appear blue or blue-green.\nThey are largely solitary compared to bug pests like ants or bees. They tend to stay in holes or burrows by themselves. If they are found in groups, it\u2019s likely due to recently born young scorpions.\nA scorpion mother (Hottentotta hottentotta) is holding her babies on her back. I Wayan Sumatika/Shutterstock.com\nHabitat: Where to Find Scorpions\nThese animals typically prefer warm areas and are most often found in subtropical or arid to semi-arid regions. Every continent except Antarctica can claim some species of them. They often hide under rocks, logs, leaves, debris, or clutter. It\u2019s also common for them to dig burrows where they hide during the day. Some of them even use their burrows to ambush prey. If daytime temperatures are cool and moist, the animal might be more active. Otherwise, they typically only come out at night.\nWhen it comes to finding these animals in human homes, it\u2019s important to consider what they like in the wild. They can get into houses through gaps around doors and windows. Since they like to hide under things in the wild, they will often hide behind and beneath things inside a house. Another place scorpions like to hide is in shoes. These animals can climb quite well and may also climb into hanging clothes.\nThey can\u2019t climb on smooth glass. Placing wide-mouth jars beneath table and crib legs can keep them from climbing in these areas. Another deterrent is covering the legs with petroleum jelly.\nDiet: What Do Scorpions Eat?\nThese animals prey mainly on bugs such as grasshoppers, termites, beetles, and wasps. They may also eat other arachnids, including other scorpions. Large species sometimes prey on animals such as small reptiles and mammals. Different types hunt and kill prey in different ways. For example, species with large powerful pincers will use their pincers to crush prey. Scorpions with smaller pincers but stronger venom will sting their prey. Some of them chase or ambush prey while others wait in burrows.\nThese animals can survive a long time without food due to their slow metabolic rate, general inactivity and efficient biological method of food storage. Some of them can survive six months to a year without food.\nWhat eats scorpions?\nMany animals actively prey on and eat them. Main predators include lizards, birds, snakes, frogs, rodents, and bats. Some mammals like meerkats and long-eared bats are immune to their venom. They also eat other scorpions, and large spiders will prey on smaller scorpions as well.\nWhat do scorpions eat?\nThese animals eat all manner of insects as well as other arachnids. Very large species may also prey on small reptiles and rodents.\nPrevention: How to Get Rid of Scorpions\nIf you live in an area with these animals, it\u2019s best to prevent them from entering your house by plugging up gaps around doors, windows, wires, and pipes. Keep organic litter away from your house as it\u2019s a place where scorpions like to hide. Expose the trunk and ground around shrubs and trees by pruning. Piles of rocks or firewood are also places where they like to hide. Use tight-fitting screens on all windows and doors and make sure that your air conditioner doesn\u2019t leak.\nAvoiding stings inside means not walking around at night with bare feet. Use an ultraviolet flashlight to shine in dark corners. Always check shoes and clothing before wearing them as these are favorite spots for them to hide. If you find one of them on your body, don\u2019t swat at them but brush them off.\nInsecticides can be used against these animals as well. This should be sprayed around the house perimeter as well as near entry points, inside around baseboards, inside closets, around plumbing, and in the garage and/or basement.\nView all 180 animals that start with S"}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elk Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Elk-facts.html", "text": "elk Facts\nPortrait of an Elk\nOne of the most fascinating elk facts, is that their ancestors had 8-inch long tusks, just like a walrus! The elk is the second largest member of the deer family. They are smaller than the moose overall, but their incredible, branch-like antlers are longer than those of the moose, and when measured from the ground to the top of their antler rack, many elk are quite a bit taller than moose.\nA mature male elk may stand over 5 and a half feet at the shoulder, and the largest will top nearly 1100 pounds. The elk is reddish brown in color, with a beautiful wedge-shaped head, and large, expressive eyes and ears. Males grow a huge pair of antlers, and have a mantle of dark fur around the neck. Females and even youngsters of some northern subspecies may also have manes.\nElk also have two large teeth in the upper jaw called ivories, whistlers or buglers. Scientists believe these teeth were once 8 inch long tusks, similar in appearance and direction to those of a walrus. There are small deer species in existence today who still have long tusks, but they don't have antlers. It is thought that when the elk developed antlers as a weapon, it no longer had a need for the tusks.\nElk are adaptable, tenacious, herbivores that eat a large variety of plants, and can exist in many habitats from deep forest to arid, near-desert conditions. They are ruminants, just like cows, and have a four-chambered stomach that allows them to digest lots of vegetation that has little nutritional value.\nDuring winter months, they may strip the bark from trees, and eat moss, twigs and acorns. When food is initially swallowed, it is stored for a few hours in the first stomach chamber, called the rumen. After the food has mellowed, the rumen sends balls of partially digested food back up to the mouth, where the elk will continue to chew it, before finally swallowing it again. This is called \"chewing cud\", and it helps large animals to survive on meager rations.\nThe adaptable elk also grow double coats for winter time that are lighter in color than their summertime garb, to help them blend in. In the spring, they tend to look a little shabby as the fur falls out and is replaced by their rich, single-layered coppery colored summer coat.\nElk are social animals who live in same-sex herds of 10 to 20 individuals, that are loosely structured, and may come together in much larger groups, particularly as they migrate to higher ground. The springtime migration of elk may bring together thousands of animals into one massive herd as they seek out green pastures.\nElk range across much of North America, where they once numbered nearly ten million individuals. The North American elk is also called a wapiti, which means \"white rear\" in the language of the Shawnee Indians, and refers to the distinctive, beige area of fur surrounding the elks tail. They were a vital part of the lives of native Americans, who fashioned elk bones and elk antlers into various tools, weapons and decorations, made clothing and tents from elk hides, and consumed or cured elk meat to survive.\nThe Lakota Sioux also treasured the elk, and male babies were awarded elk ivories to bring long life and prosperity. The Lakota people believed the spirit of the elk brought wisdom and courage to them, and was a symbol of potency.\nAfter European settlers arrived, and with the increase in farming, the elk population dwindled, and by the early 1900's, only about 90,000 elk remained. Today, however, elk populations are healthy, and number close to one million animals across Canada and the United States.\nelk lifestyle\nElk are generally peaceful, social creatures that live together in large herds and cooperate to protect themselves from predators. In late winter and spring, herds of elk, called gangs, are divided by sex.\nFemales may congregate in huge gangs with several hundred members. These include their youngsters from the year before, and are usually guided by a few older members who decide where to graze, when to rest, and when to start migrations.\nMigrating is an important tool in the elks survival, and timing is critical.\nIn the winter months, elk must be near forested areas with many trees for cover, and also to strip the bark.\nWhen spring is near, the females in charge begin to head towards valleys where seasonal grasses will soon emerge. Feasting on freshly sprouted greenery is key to the elk replenishing itself after the harsh winter, during which they may loose up to 250 pounds.\nMale elk may stay alone for awhile after the rut, as long as their antlers stay. The antlers allow them to protect themselves from predators, but weakened bulls will join up early, before their antlers fall, and enjoy the safety of a group.\nMale herds, because they don't include offspring, are generally smaller and more fluid, with members coming and going. Both sexes, however, may meet up and move together in massive herds during the migration, which, in places like Yellowstone national park, may number in the thousands.\nelk facts on reproduction\nBreeding season for elk is late August through early October, and is referred to as the rut. The decrease in daylight brought on by shortening days, triggers a surge in hormones, and while female elk enter estrus at this time, bull elk go through some physical changes as well.\nAs testosterone and melatonin levels increase, the antlers of the male elk calcify beneath the velvet, and he scrapes the soft covering off against trees and stones, revealing a sharp, fresh rack of points. To prepare for jousting, the male elks neck actually gains muscle mass, his mane grows fuller, and the voice box thickens, creating the correct tone for effective bugling. Then males compete for territory and ranking, jousting with eachother, as well as shrubs, tree stumps and sometimes cars and mailboxes.\nThe males size each other up by walking in parallel lines, then turning their racks in, lowering their heads and testing their rivals strength. A few swishes back and forth, knocking antlers together, and then they brace against eachother and drive forward with straining legs, attempting to push straight through the enemy.\nInjuries don't usually occur and the contests last only a few minutes. Exhausted, one or the other flees the scene, chased mercilessly out of the area, often receiving a few jabs in the rump as they go.\nMales will try to attract more than one female, and particularly dominant males in their prime of 6 to 8 years old, may have a harem of 20 or even 40 cows.\nThe elk rut can be several weeks long, and bulls are so excited they forget to eat. A bull at the end of rut may have lost as much as 30% body weight, and are vulnerable to predation at this time.\nFemales are pregnant for 240 -250 days and deliver one baby in the spring. Newborn elk are very well developed, and stand within about 30 minutes of birth. But during the first week of life, they spend most of their time lying quietly in tall grass or woods. They are light red in color with white spots sprinkled across their coats to help them hide.\nBaby elk will lay still in the woods while their mother feeds, and their spotted coats echo the dappling of the sun through the trees. They are instinctively quiet, and perfectly still when approached by anyone other than their mother. The newborn has no scent, and can't be detected by predators, so the mother actually stays a few yards away, coming close to nurse, but generally observing from a distance, for the first week or so.\nBy two weeks old, the mother returns to the herd with her new calf. The elk calf will be weaned in two months, and loses its spots in about six months.\nThe herd is mostly mothers with new babies, yearlings, and older females that did not breed. They will maintain the calves in little nursery groups, where all adults keep an eye on the youngsters. They are vocal in these groups, communicating with eachother with grunts and squeaks, and they will join together and take on predators, including wolves and grizzlies, if calves are threatened.\nThe herd will surround the babies, and will strike out with their forelimbs at anything that poses a threat. One well-placed kick can kill a full grown wolf, and if the herd is truly brave and vigilant, they may drive off even the most fearsome threat.\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

Antlers are sometimes mistakenly called \"horns\", but antlers are structurally completely different from horns.\nCows and antelopes grow horns, which are made of keratin, the same stuff as hair and nails. Horns don't fall off, they continue to grow throughout the life of the animal, and in most cases, both males and females grow them.\nAntlers are actually made of bone, fall off and are regrown each year, and are usually only found on the males of the species.\nAntlers grow from two round surfaces of bone called pedecils, that are part of the skull. Hormones triggered by seasonal changes start growing in the spring. They begin when the male has low, not high, levels of testosterone, presumably to focus energy on their growth, and insure that the animals are calm and not combative.\nWhile the antlers are growing they are soft and spongy and can be easily damaged, so males are careful with their movements. Antlers are the fastest growing tissue known in mammals, and each spine of the antler may grow at a rate of half an inch a day. The growing antler is a pulpy tissue filled with nerves and blood vessels. It is covered with blood-filled, hairy skin called velvet.\nWeirdest of all elk facts is that while the antler tissue is growing, it can actually be grafted to any part of the elks body, and it would continue to grow. The entire body is dedicated to this remarkable process.\nBy late summer the testosterone level begins to rise, the antler calcifies into solid bone, the velvet dries up and falls off, and the full, pointed rack appears, ready for some jousting action.\nAn intriguing feature of elk antlers, is how much they look like tree limbs...check it out...\na few more elk facts\nMale elk lose their antlers in late winter, and grow a new pair in the spring\nElk have teeth called \"ivories\" that were once 8-inch long tusks like a walrus\nElk antlers may weigh 40 pounds\nElk are ruminants and \"chew their cud\" just like a cow\nA well-organized elk herd can deter a wolf pack attack\nElk are also known by the Shawnee Indian name \"wapiti\"\nElk ivories are used in jewelry\nThe elk antler has properties that can fight cancer and other diseases\nElk are raised on farms where their antlers can be safely harvested without harming the elk\nScientific Classification: Kingdom\nAnimalia\nPhylum Chordata\nClass Mammalia\nOrder Artiodactyla\nFamily Cervidae\nSubfamily Cervinae\nGenus Cervus\nSpecies canadensis\nElk - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT bull cow calf herd GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD gang North America,\nEurope,Asia woodland grass, twigs TOPSPEED ENDANGERED AVG WEIGHT AVG HEIGHT 45 mph no 400-900 pnds 4.5-5.5 feet\nat shoulder ESTRUS GESTATION BIRTH HEIGHT BIRTHWEIGHT 1 x year 245-250 days 24-26 inches 35 pounds RAISED BY # OF YOUNG AT BIRTH STANDS UP mother 1\ntwins rare eyes open,\nfully furred 20-30 minures WEANED INDEPENDENT MATURITY LIFESPAN 2 months 9-11 months 3-5 years 12-18 years"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "African Bush Elephant | Speed of Animals", "url": "http://www.speedofanimals.com/animals/elephant", "text": "Elephants swim well, but cannot trot, jump, or gallop. They do have two gaits: a walk; and a faster gait that is similar to running. In walking, the legs act as pendulums, with the hips and shoulders rising and falling while the foot is planted on the ground. With no \u201caerial phase\u201d, the faster gait does not meet all the criteria of running, as elephants always have at least one foot on the ground.\nHowever, an elephant moving fast uses its legs much like a running animal, with the hips and shoulders falling and then rising while the feet are on the ground. In this gait, an elephant will have three feet off the ground at one time. As both of the hind feet and both of the front feet are off the ground at the same time, this gait has been likened to the hind legs and the front legs taking turns running. Although they start this \u201crun\u201d at only 8 km/h, elephants can reach speeds up to 40 km/h (25 mph), all the while using the same gait.

While it looks like a slightly more robust version of a guinea pig, it's no rodent. These squat, furry animals are found across Africa and the middle East, where they like to hang out in rock formations and the seemingly inhospitable nooks on sheer cliff faces. Rock hyraxes are gregarious, living in colonies of up to 80 individuals. They grow up to two feet in length and about 10 pounds in weight.\nSo if they're not rodents, what are they related to? Read on for the surprising truth about rock hyraxes.\n1. Rock Hyraxes spend a lot of time sun-bathing. The rock hyrax spends about 95 percent of its time resting. This can involve heaping, in which animals pile on top of each other inside a den, or basking in the sun. Both behaviors are compensations for the hyrax's poorly developed thermoregulation. They tend to stay in their burrows until the sun is high in the morning and may not leave their dens at all on cold, rainy days.\n2. They have multi-chambered stomachs. Although they are not ruminants, hyraxes have three-chambered stomachs filled with symbiotic bacteria that help break down the plants they eat. Baby hyraxes are not born with the bacteria they will need to digest plant matter, so to obtain it they eat the poop of adult hyraxes.\nPhoto: Ltshears, via Wikimedia Commons . Distributed under a CC-BY-SA-3.0 license.\n3. They have tusks. The rock hyrax has a pair of long, pointed tusk-like incisors. Males have larger and sharper tusks than females.\n4. They're related to elephants and manatees. Modern hyraxes are members of the Procaviidae family, the only living family within the Hyracoidea. During the Eocene era, hyraxes of all sizes filled the plains of Africa: from a mouse-sized species to one the size of a small horse. Competition from bovids during the Miocene displaced these ancient hyraxes. While some evolved into the hyraxes we know today, others appear to have given rise to the elephant and sirenian (manatees and dugongs) families."}

The second-largest continent after Asia, it is home to many beautiful and dangerous animals of various sizes, both diurnal and nocturnal.\nThese include mammals, reptiles, birds, and insects, with many being unique to Africa. Because of its biodiversity, it is a popular location for animal researchers as well as safari enthusiasts. It contains over 1,100 different mammal species, plus over 60 carnivore species, 100,000 insect species, 3,000 freshwater fish species, and over 2,600 bird species. Its populations of insects comprise 15-20% of all insects in the world.\nThe Official National Animals of Africa\nSince Africa is made up of several countries containing their own culture and languages, as well as different types of habitats, there aren\u2019t official African animals that represent the entire continent. Hence, each country has its own official national animal, with some countries having more than one national animal or sharing the same national animal as that of other countries.\nThe Oryx is the National Animal of Namibia\nNational animals are often categorized according to type, especially if a country has more than one. For example, the Leopard is the official national animal (land mammal) of both Rwanda and Somalia, while the American Fish Eagle is the national bird of Namibia and Zambia, and the Oryx is the national animal of Namibia. South Africa\u2019s official national animal is the Springbok, its national bird is the Blue Crane, and its national fish the Galjoen.\nThe Top African Wildlife\nThe top wild animals in Africa are those that people most often seek out in safaris, with many being animals native to Africa. These safari animals are housed in national parks, game reserves, and other sanctuaries for both human safety as well as to avoid their becoming part of the extinct animals in Africa. Among the best-known African animals are the \u201cBig Five\u201d which are the Lion, Leopard, Elephant, Rhinoceros, and Buffalo. All of them can be seen in South Africa and are native animals: Rhinos are one of the \u201cBig Five\u201d African Land Animals Henk Bogaard/Shutterstock.com\nFinding Top Wild African Animals:\nZebras are found in the Serengeti or Masai Mara region\nThe Most Dangerous African Animals Today\nLand animals in Africa are popular attractions for safari enthusiasts, although they are not always treated with caution and respect. Many dangerous African animals are among the most dangerous in the world after human beings, whether hostile or poisonous. Fortunately, most dangerous African animals can be safely seen in national parks and game reserves. The top 10 most dangerous animals native to Africa and their estimated number of human deaths per year are:\nHippos are highly aggressive and unpredictable, and often charge other animals or even humans.\nMosquito: Causes diseases including Malaria, Yellow Fever, Zeka Virus, West Nile Virus, and Dengue Fever; 1,000,000 deaths.\nHippopotamus: Territorial and weighs up to 1,500kg, making it the third-largest animal after the elephant and rhino; 3,000 deaths.\nAfrican Elephant: Largest land animal; weighs up to 7,000kg and is unpredictable; tramples victims; 500 deaths.\nNile Crocodile: Aggressive, fatal attacks; 300 deaths.\nLion: Apex predator; kills locals during their daily lives or on the fringes of game reserves; 200 deaths.\nCape Buffalo: Nicknamed \u201cwidowmaker\u201d and \u201cblack death\u201d; fearless, aggressive, and unpredictable; will stalk and kill humans if alone; tramples and gores victims to death; weighs up to 1,000kg; 200 deaths.\nGreat White Shark: Most aggressive shark towards humans; charges at prey up to 40km an hour before taking a large bite; humans die from blood loss in 20 percent of cases; 2 deaths.\nRhinoceros: Weighs up to 2,800kg and second largest animal after the elephant; irritable, and charges with long, sharp horns up to 64km an hour when threatened; unknown.\nPuff Adder: Not the most venomous snake but causes the most fatalities due to its wide habitat range, camoflauge colors and aggressiveness; 20 percent fatality rate from untreated bites; unknown.\nBlack Mamba: Largest venomous snake in Africa, growing up to 2.5m; one of the world\u2019s fastest snakes, moving at 20km an hour; highly aggressive; one of the most venomous snakes in the world with a 100% fatality for untreated bites; unknown.\nEndangered Animals In Africa\nAn African Wild Dog at Savuti, Chobe National Park, Botswana. Derek Keats / Flickr\nSeveral species are endangered or vulnerable due to hunting and poaching, particularly large and dangerous animals which are prized as trophies. Endangered animals in Africa include the Black Rhino, White Rhino, Rothschild\u2019s Giraffe, Gr\u00e9vy\u2019s Zebra, (African) Wild Dog, Grey Crowned Crane and Okapi. Additionally, the Lion, Leopard, Cheetah and African Forest Elephant are vulnerable species.\nBirds in Africa\nThere are many different types of birds in Africa. In fact, there are 2,341 species of native African birds, 25 of those species are endemic, meaning you can\u2019t find them anywhere else. You can find birds all over the continent. A few iconic species include:\nShoebill: These massive birds are found in swamps and wetlands of Central and East Africa. Shoebills don\u2019t migrate and spend their days hunting in papyrus swamps. You can find them in the Bangweulu Wetlands in north-eastern Zambia.\nGuinea fowl: There are 6 species of guinea fowl in Africa. They are found across the continent in a variety of habitats.\nSecretary bird: Found in sub-Saharan Africa, these birds of prey prefer to hunt on the ground. It is common to see them in Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park.\nTransfrontier Park. Common Ostrich: Perhaps Africa\u2019s most well-known bird species. Breeding season is the best time to see large flocks of Ostriches, from March to September. They are found in the savannas, woodlands, and deserts of Southern Africa and across Western Africa to the horn of Africa. They can be seen in many African parks and games reserves, including Kruger National Park and Chobe National Park.\nAfrican Penguins: You can see African penguins along the southestern coast of Africa and surrounding islands. The best time to see them is from November to August. They are most active at dusk and dawn. A popular viewing destination for African pengiuns is Boulders Beach in Simons Town, South Africa.\nHornbills: There are 24 species of hornbill found in Africa. You can see arboreal and terrestrial species in African savannas, rainforests, and woodlands. Find Southern Ground Hornbills in Mapungubwe or Kruger National Park.\nTypes of African Fish\nAfrica is home to an abundance of freshwater and marine fish. There are hundreds of freshwater lakes and rivers in Africa. Some of the most notable are the African Great Lakes, a system of 7 lakes in East, South, and Central Africa. These lakes are known for their cichlid populations. One of the great lakes, Lake Malawi is an especially popular fishing destination, with over 1,000 species of fish. Fishing in Lake Malawi is best between September and April, but underwater viewing is best between May and October.\nWith Western Africa bordering the Atlantic Ocean, and Eastern Africa the Indian Ocean, you will easily find thousands of marine fish species. Kenya, Tanzania, and Zanzibar are popular fishing destinations where you can catch several species of tuna, sharks, mackerel, marlin, barracuda, and more. The best time for deep-sea fishing off these coasts is between October and April. If you\u2019re interested in viewing marine wildlife, Mozambique has a marine conservation area where you can enjoy manta rays, sharks, eels, and a variety of reef fish. October to March is the best time for snorkeling in Mozambique.\nSnakes in Africa\nA wide variety of snakes call Africa home. There are snakes in every type of habitat, from tropical, to desert, and aquatic. You\u2019ll find both venomous and non-venomous snakes in Africa. Venomous snakes in Africa have three different types of venom- Cytotoxic, neurotoxic, and haemotoxic. Cytotoxins kill cells. They destroy the cells in soft tissue and internal organs. Neurotoxins affect neural pathways and can cause paralysis. Haemotixins destroy red blood cells and prevent blood from clotting.\nSome of the deadliest snakes in Africa include:\nBlack Mamba: Africa\u2019s longest snake, and one of the fastest snakes in the world. Black mambas are found in Southern and Eastern Africa. They live in savannahs and rocky hills.\nBoomslang: One of the most venomous snakes in the world. Native to the savannahs of sub-Saharan Africa.\nBush Viper: Arboreal snakes found in the tropical rainforests of Western and Central Africa.\nCape Cobra: Only found in Southern Africa. They live in a varitey of habitats, like grasslands, savannahs, and deserts.\nWest African Carpet Viper: Endemic to the dry savannahs of West Africa. It is the most dangerous snake in Africa.\nEastern Green Mamba: Arboreal snakes native to the coastal regions of Southern and East Africa. They can be found in the dense vegetation of tropical rainforests.\nPuff Adder: Found throughout sub-Saharan Africa, typically in open forests, grasslands, and rocky savannahs.\nA few nonvenomous snakes native to Africa:\nBall Python: Live north of the equator in Western and Central Africa. They are found near water in grasslands and forests.\nBrown House Snake: Distributed throughout Southern Africa. These snakes are popular as pets.\nSpotted Bush Snake: Found in a variety of habitats close to water sources. They have a large range, from Southern Africa northward into Central Africa, from east to west coasts.\nAfrican Rock Python: The largest snake in Africa. Native to sub-Saharan Africa, in a range of habitats near permanent bodies of water.\nRivers in Africa\nThere are numerous massive rivers in Africa that are home to a variety of wildlife. African rivers range from the Nile River, which stretches more than 4,000 miles in length and is a haven of wildlife in the harshness of the Sahara Desert to the Okavango River, which has an inland delta that covers 600,000 acres in swamps and floods during dry seasons to create a gathering ground for thousands of animals. Some notable African rivers include:\nOrange River: Flows 1,300 miles across South Africa and forms the boundary with Namibia. The Orange River is home to a number of endemic fish including the Numaquab barb, Maluti redfin, and Orange River mudfish.\nZambezi River: A massive 2,200 miles river that is home to Victoria Falls, one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World. The Zambezi is home to a wide variety of wildlife including bull sharks and many bird species.\nAfrican Countries Animals Lists\nClick any of the countries below to see a detailed list of animals located in that country!\nAfrican Animals\nAfrican Animals List"}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Elephant Festival - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_Festival", "text": "The Elephant Festival is a festival celebrated in the city of Jaipur in Rajasthan state in India. . The Elephant Festival begins with a beautiful procession of bedecked elephants, camels, horses and folk dancers. The owners proudly embellish their elephants with vibrant colours, jhool (saddle cloth) and heavy jewellery. Female elephants wear anklets which tinkle as they walk. People perched on top of elephants sprinkle gulaal (coloured powder). The most beautifully decorated elephant is awarded. Elephant polo, elephant racing, and a game of tug-of-war between elephants and 19 men and women are the featured events of the festival. The elephants are also outfitted with ear danglers and brocade scarves to embellish their ears and necks. The Mahouts, who are known as the caretakers of the elephants, decorate the foreheads of the animals with head-plates as well as garnish their tusks with gold, silver bracelets and rings. Other events that take place during the festival include a polo match and a tug of war contest, where the strongest elephant is chosen to compete against a group of ten people.\nAlthough the festival is primarily based on elephants, other animals such as camels and horses also participate.\nHistory [ edit ]\nThe Elephant Festival is considered one of the most popular and celebrated events in the city of Jaipur. Since the festival was introduced, the ceremony has managed to attract a variety of outsiders to the festive event. Elephants symbolize royalty according to the traditions of Rajasthan. The elephant is also believed to be associated with Buddhism and Jainism. In fact, the elephant itself has a historical significance in Indian traditions. According to Indian mythology, gods and the demons stirred the ocean, in the hopes that they would become eternal. Suddenly, nine jewels also known as the navratnas surfaced from the ocean. Of the nine jewels that reappeared, one of them was an elephant. Since then, the elephant has been regarded as a precious animal.[citation needed]\nThe state of Rajasthan was a popular destination for many royal figures as the kings and princes of those times would take elephant rides to the Amber Palace of Rajasthan. During the monarchy, India\u2019s royalty would hold events where the strongest elephants would fight each other to entertain the royal guests. Nowadays, the festival is organized every year by the Rajasthan tourism group in the Chaugan Stadium. The venue was relocated to the Jaipur Polo Group grounds due to the festival\u2019s increasing popularity. The elephants are sacred and are believed to have good luck.[citation needed]\nControversy [ edit ]\nFor the first time in many years, the Elephant Festival was cancelled for two consecutive years, 2012 and 2014, due to protest from the Animal Welfare Board. The animal activists were concerned about the chemical-laced colour being poured on the elephants and feared that the elephants would be harmed in the process. The Rajasthan tourism group, which hosts the festival every year failed to sign up the elephants with the Animal Welfare Board and provide appropriate documents. As a result of this, the organizers decided to rename the event the Holi Festival. The Tourism Department\u2019s decision to cancel came in the wake of protests by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)."}

In a long cardboard box, nestled down in a bed of acid-free tissue, are the only fleshy remains of a truly monumental elephant. This is Jumbo\u2019s tail.\nJumbo\u2019s story began in 1862, somewhere near the border between Ethiopia and Sudan. There, in a wooden pen, held at the mercy of a party of native hunters, was a baby elephant, still only in his second year. This creature, which had witnessed his mother being slaughtered only months before, was destined for a life of tragic greatness. He was heading to Europe, then America and would take animal celebrity to a level that has rarely, if ever, been surpassed.\nIn the Sudanese city of Kassala, the baby elephant and a veritable menagerie of other exotic creatures passed into the entrepreneurial hands of a ballsy Italian by the name of Lorenzo Casanova. In March 1862, Casanova and a massive posse of men set out on a punishing 500-km trek across the desert towards the Red Sea port of Suakin. With scores of camels transporting caged porcupines, civets, jackals, caracals, monkeys, cheetah, birds and the larger creatures \u2013 including the elephant \u2013 trotting along behind, it was slow going. Traveling at night to avoid the withering Saharan heat, it was six weeks before they reached the coast. From Suakin, Casanova\u2019s creatures took a 1300-km boat trip up the Red Sea to Suez, a train journey to Alexandria (the canal was still under construction), a trans-Mediterranean cruise to Trieste and another train ride to Casanova\u2019s HQ in Dresden. Most of the animals ended up touring Germany as part of Gottlieb Kreutzberg\u2019s Gro\u03b2e Menagerie, but the Jardin des Plantes in Paris was quick to add what was first African elephant in Europe to its considerable collection of living animals.\nThe news of this acquisition rankled with the Superintendent of London Zoo Abraham Bartlett, a man on his own mission to obtain an African elephant. Now his only chance of getting one \u2013 at least for the foreseeable future \u2013 was to haggle with the French. After lengthy negotiations, Bartlett got his elephant. It came at a price, specifically one rhino, a jackal, two eagles, a pair of dingoes, a possum and a kangaroo. There was a strong sense that the French had got the best of the deal, a feeling that intensified when the elephant exchanged hands. \u201cA more deplorable, diseased and rotten creature never walked God\u2019s earth,\u201d wrote assistant keeper Matthew Scott in account of life with Jumbo. \u201cThe poor thing was full of disease, which had worked its way through the animal\u2019s hide, and had almost eaten out its eyes.\u201d Rather than giving up on what appeared to be a hopeless case, Scott \u201cundertook to be his doctor, his nurse, and general servant\u201d and brought the young elephant back to health.\nThe first portrait of Jumbo, shortly after his arrival at London Zoo. Photograph: Illustrated London News, 15 July 1865. Photograph: Illustrated London News, 15 July 1865.\nWhen stories of London\u2019s latest animal acquisition began to appear in July 1865, there was a sense of excitement. The African elephant, it was noted, was an altogether different beast to the Indian elephant with which the British public was then more familiar and promised to grow to a far larger size. Although there was no mention of the elephant\u2019s name at this stage, his anonymity did not last for long. It remains unclear who decided that the pachyderm should be called Jumbo \u2013 and why \u2013 but it\u2019s a rather good name and it stuck.\nThere was another burst of excitement a couple of weeks later when it emerged that Bartlett had managed to acquire a partner for Jumbo, a female African elephant called either Alice or \u201cJumbo\u2019s wife\u201d. Within a year, Scott began to prepare Jumbo to give rides to the public, a job the elephant \u2013 and the British masses \u2013 grew to love. \u201cHis docility and good temper rendered him the pet of thousands,\u201d wrote Bartlett years later. Paul Chambers, author of a delightful biography of Jumbo, writes that in the course of a year \u201cthousands of children experienced the thrill of a ride on Jumbo, and a visit to the Zoo was considered incomplete without it.\u201d\nMichael Scott and Jumbo. Photograph: Digital Collections and Archives, Tufts University. Photograph: Digital Collections and Archives, Tufts University.\nAs the patron of the Zoological Society of London, Queen Victoria paid several trips to the zoo during her reign. During her last visit, on 14 March 1877, she described seeing four Indian elephants. \u201cThey are quite tame,\u201d she wrote in her diary. \u201cThere were 2 quite little ones, who salaamed & were ridden about at an immense pace.\u201d With Jumbo approaching adulthood and standing more than 3 metres tall, it seems likely that she would have seen him too. It\u2019s also rumoured that the young Winston Churchill may have been one of the many youngsters to have ridden on Jumbo\u2019s back.\nBut as Jumbo entered adolescence and adulthood beckoned, he began to cause considerable problems for his custodians. \u201cHe is amazingly intelligent, good-tempered, and tractable; at the same time he has given me, and every one else who has had anything to do with him, constant and increasing trouble and anxiety,\u201d wrote Bartlett. Jumbo\u2019s enormous strength and dislike of being locked up at night \u201ckept us day after day constantly employed altering, repairing, and making his house strong enough to keep him in it.\u201d\nIn a report to the Zoological Society\u2019s Council (relayed in The Times on 9 March 1882), Bartlett expressed his anxiety about what to do \u201cin the event of illness or accident\u201d to Matthew Scott, the only keeper that Jumbo would respond to. \u201cIn conclusion, I may ask that I should be provided with, and have at hand, the means of killing this animal, should such a necessity arise.\u201d\nAs things turned out, Bartlett never had to take such drastic action. For within a matter of weeks he had received a telegram from the American showman Phineas T. Barnum and his circus associates asking if he might be prepared to part with Jumbo. Only too happy, Bartlett cabled back immediately \u2013 \u201cWill sell him for \u00a32,000\u201d. But when the British public got wind of the sale of their elephantine talisman, there was an outcry. \u201cEngland is not in the habit of parting with her pets,\u201d wrote outspoken critic John Ruskin in a widely published open letter. \u201cIf stone walls and chains are necessary to confine Jumbo, England has the stone and iron, and need not go to America for them.\u201d\nThe weekly magazine Fun suggested that \u201con account of the national interest manifest in \u201cJumbo\u201d that\u2026the \u201cBritish Lion\u201d is for the time forgotten\u201d and replaced by an elephant. Photograph: The Life of P.T. Barnum. Photograph: The Life of P.T. Barnum.\nOn 27 February 1882, the turnstiles saw 8,571 visitors enter the zoo, more than an order of magnitude greater than the gate receipts on the same day the year before. In March, the zoo was the unwilling recipient of farewell presents for the great elephant: cakes, pastries, buns, bottles of ale, wine, spirits, a dozen oysters and a pumpkin. Over the next few days, Jumbo refused to enter the crate the circus folks had constructed for him; the public turned out in their thousands to gloat. The tension mounted still higher when some members of the Zoological Society took out a lawsuit against their own Council in an attempt to reverse the deal. Eventually, however, after reams of newspaper had been filled with nationalistic elephant-loving comment, the judge wrapped up the proceedings in favour of the Council and Barnum.\nOn 22 March 1882, crowds lined the streets as a carriage drawn by ten horses carted Jumbo from Regents\u2019 Park to the River Thames, where he boarded the steamship the Assyrian Monarch. It had been some 16 years since he\u2019d been at sea. It was the end of an era for Jumbo, but this steamship, bound for New York, was to bear him towards a new, even more adoring audience than in Britain and account for the presence of his tail in a university archive near Boston.\nTO BE CONTINUED\u2026\n(I had originally intended this to be a single post, but fittingly for an elephant this large, I have decided to divide his story into three separate parts. Look out for the second and third installments).\nTale ends\nThe act of researching Jumbo\u2019s story has raised several questions I have not been able to answer. If you can help solve any of these outstanding mysteries, please leave a comment or send me a message on Twitter @WayOfThePanda.\n1. Does anyone know of a pamphlet from Gottlieb Kreutzberg\u2019s Gro\u03b2e Menagerie in which Jumbo appears before he was sold on to Paris?\n2. Was there any news coverage of Jumbo during his stint at the Jardin des Plantes in Paris?\n3. Who gave Jumbo his name? In Paul Chambers\u2019 book, he suggests that someone may have seen a likeness between the scrawny Jumbo the disheveled West African bogyman \u201cMumbo Jumbo\u201d. Or, more likely as Wikipedia suggests, his name is a conflation of the Swahili words jambo (meaning \u201chello\u201d) and jumbe (\u201cchief\u201d).\n4. It\u2019s always said that Queen Victoria was fond of Jumbo. It\u2019s true she visited London Zoo in 1874, 1875 and 1877. But did she meet the elephant and if she did, do we really know what she made of him?\nIf there is a zoological specimen with a great story that you would like to see profiled, please contact Henry Nicholls @WayOfThePanda."}

Although not the most agile flyer, its remarkable speed in the air certainly belies its enormous size relative to other birds. Most species are well-protected by governments, conservation organizations, and international acts around the world, but a few of the more obscure species are in danger of extinction.\n6 Incredible Eagle Facts!\nEagles probably first evolved from kites some 36 million years ago.\nThe eagle has served as a very common symbol of strength and power in many human cultures. They have adorned the national emblems of Rome/Byzantium, Russia, and many Germanic states. The unusual-looking double-headed eagle is a common historical motif that may stretch back to the time of ancient Mesopotamia.\nThe grip of the bald eagle is actually 10 times stronger than a human.\nDespite their much smaller bodyweight, the eye of an eagle is about the same size as a human eye.\nEagles undergo a process called molting in which they gradually lose their feathers one at a time and grow completely new ones about every year. Some species will lose feathers equally on both sides to maintain proper balance.\nEagles can carry up to four times their own body weight, making it one of the strongest birds in the world. Learn about the strongest animals in the world here.\nEagle Scientific Name\nAn eagle is a group of particularly large birds that belong to the family of Accipitridae (this scientific name is derived from the Latin word accipiter, which means hawk). Many different types of birds belong to this family, including vultures, kites, and hawks. What distinguishes the eagle is its larger size and massive beak.\nThere are some 60 species of eagles still living in the world today. They can be divided into several main groups: the fish or sea eagles, serpent eagles, forest eagles, and booted eagles. These are informal groups and not necessarily taxonomical ones. What many Americans may not know is that the bald eagle (scientific name Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is actually a type of sea eagle.\nCommon Types of Eagles\nBald Eagle \u2013 The bald eagle is the national bird of the United States. These birds have white heads and tails with brown bodies and are found near open bodies of water with old growth trees that they use for nesting.\n\u2013 The bald eagle is the national bird of the United States.

These birds can be identified by their dark bodies, white shoulders, foreheads, tails, and thighs, and bright yellow bills. White-Tailed Eagle \u2013 White-tailed eagles breed in Northern Europe and northern Asia and generally live near open bodies of water. They have brown body feathers and pale heads and necks with white tail feathers.\nEagle Appearance\nThe eagle is among the largest of all birds; only some condors and vultures can rival it in sheer size. The largest species of eagles, such as the harpy eagle and Steller\u2019s sea eagle, weigh up to 20 pounds and display a wingspan of around 7 or 8 feet from tip to tip. Females actually tend to be larger than males on average, but it\u2019s not entirely clear why; perhaps it\u2019s to protect the chicks from danger while the male is away. In addition to their size, the eagles are further distinguished by their sharp, heavy beaks (which end in a downward-sloping point) and four big talons on each foot. They also have small projections on the bottom of their feet called \u201cspicules\u201d to grasp prey. Unlike the scavenging vulture, eagles also have a fully-feathered head, sometimes capped off in a luxurious-looking crest.\nEagle vs. Hawk\nEagles and hawks are very similar in their behavior and physical characteristics. Some 15 species are even called hawk-eagles due to their mixed intermediary features. But in general, hawks are much smaller in size; their wingspan rarely exceeds more than 5 feet.\nEagle Behavior\nThese birds have exceptional vision that ranks among the best in the animal kingdom. Translated into human terms, it would have 20/5 or even 20/4 eyesight. There are a few reasons for this: the enormous size of the pupils, the density of light-detecting cells in the retina, and the shape of the fovea (a small pit in the back of the eye which is responsible for an animal\u2019s sharp central vision). This confers enormous visual advantages. First, an eagle can see four to eight times farther than the average human, allowing it to spot small prey from up to two miles away, even while in flight. Second, it can also see in a wider range of colors, including ultraviolet. Finally, it can shift focus quickly to zoom in on prey. But in order to focus on a specific spot, the eagle usually has to turn its entire head in that direction. Fortunately, the eagle also has 14 vertebrae in its neck compared to only seven for humans, enabling it to a greater degree of rotation.\nWhen the bird finally spots prey, it usually swoops down and snatches up its unsuspecting victim in its feet and talons. In this action, it acts with remarkable speed. The common golden eagle can dive down at speeds of around 150 to 200 miles per hour, which is nearly the equal of the peregrine falcon, the fastest animal in the world. In flight, the golden eagle can only maintain speeds of around 28 to 32 miles per hour, which still allows it to cover much of its hunting ground quickly in a day. Most of these birds are sedentary (which means they maintain a strict territory all-year-round), but a few species and subspecies may undertake a partial or full migration for the cold winter months.\nWhen several eagles gather together in groups, it is called a convocation, congregation, or aerie. But these birds are not really one for large social gatherings. Instead, it tends to maintain a very narrow family life with a single mate and their chicks. It has little other social contacts besides that. Except for the breeding season, many eagles don\u2019t actually make many sounds. The bald eagle is one exception. It emits a harsh call to communicate with each other or warn away intruders.\nEagle Habitat\nThese birds are found all over the world in almost every single type of habitat, from the far northern tundra to tropical rainforests and deserts. Only two species, the bald eagle and golden eagle are common to North America, while nine species are endemic to Central and South America. The Eastern Hemisphere contains the greatest concentration of them, particularly in Africa. Many of the islands dotted throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans even have their own distinct species as well.\nEagle Diet\nThese birds are apex predators in every ecosystem where it\u2019s found. This is specifically reflected in its anatomy: thee birds have a sharp beak and talons are specifically adapted for ripping and tearing flesh. It is also not shy about scavenging for food left behind or killed by other animals. In fact, the bald eagle\u2019s tendency to steal the kills of other birds once prompted Benjamin Franklin to say that it was a bird of \u201cbad moral character\u201d (though despite common belief, he did not propose that the turkey should be the national symbol of the United States instead). These birds are also a feast or famine type of bird since it can sometimes go several weeks in between meals. For a complete list of the food eagles eat, check out our \u201cWhat Do Eagles Eat\u201d page.\nWhat does the eagle eat?\nThese birds\u2019 preferred diet depends mostly on where it lives and what it\u2019s adapted for. The most common prey includes fish, crabs, snakes, amphibians, small birds, rodents, and other mammals, sometimes as large as a deer or pig. However, these birds rarely just stick to a single type of food. Although they may have a single preference (fish eagles obviously consume fish), they will also eat a wide selection of other foods based on what\u2019s available at the time. If the meal is too large to carry in its talons, then the bird will eat it directly where the animal was killed.\nEagle Predators and Threats\nUp until the 19th and 20th centuries, these birds have historically faced few threats in the wild. But the combined effect of overhunting, habitat loss, and pesticide use (which seeped into the environment and water) threatened many species with extinction. In places where hunting and pesticide use are tightly regulated, eagle numbers are quickly recovering.\nWhat eats the eagle?\nAn adult has no other natural predators in the wild. But eggs and chicks may be preyed upon by hawks, owls, raccoons, bobcats, and other carnivorous animals.\nEagle Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nFollowing a brief courtship display, which can include an impressive aerial performance and synchronized behavior, these birds form exceptionally strong bond pairs that mate for life. This allows them to create and keep building upon the same nest year after year, usually in a high and inaccessible cliff or tree. These nests, which also go by the name of eyries, are usually composed out of sticks, moss, lichens, and other plant material. However, most of these birds only use the nest when they are actually raising their young and abandon it temporarily for the rest of the year.\nOnce the female lays her eggs, she incubates them for a month or two, while the father hunts and provides most of the food. These birds can produce anywhere between one and four eggs, but the larger, dominant chick may end up killing or out-competing the smaller one. While this may seem cruel, it is an effective strategy for ensuring that one chick almost always survives, especially since mortality rates are already quite high among the young.\nThey will usually grow their flight feathers after a few months, but since they have such long maturation periods, it may take up to three or four years before they become adults. The life expectancy of the typical species is around 20 to 30 years in the wild. As it ages, the bird begins to lose some of its hunting edge. In captivity, where it always has a guaranteed meal, these birds can sometimes live around 50 years of age.\nEagle Population\nMost but not all species around the world appear to be in excellent health. The bald eagle is considered to be species of least concern by the IUCN Red List with perhaps more than 100,000 individuals remaining. This is a remarkable bounce back from the 1980s and 1990s when it was still on the endangered species list. The golden eagle is likewise a species of least concern with more than 100,000 individuals left. By contrast, the harpy eagle of Central and South America is near threatened and in decline. The steppe eagle of Central Asia is likewise in decline. Although there are some 50,000 to 75,000 adults remaining, it is listed by the IUCN Red List as an endangered species.\nEagles in the Zoo\nThe bald eagle is one of the most popular exhibits in American zoos. It can be found at the San Diego Zoo, Saint Louis Zoo, Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo, Lincoln Park Zoo, Detroit Zoo, Oregon Zoo, Louisville Zoo, Minnesota Zoo, Denver Zoo, Tulsa Zoo, Cincinnati Zoo, Houston Zoo, San Francisco Zoo, and so much more. The San Diego Zoo, along with many other zoos, also has a golden eagle, a crowned eagle, Steller\u2019s sea eagle, and a harpy eagle.\nView all 68 animals that start with E"}

In the wild, lions usually live no more than 8 to 10 years because of attacks by humans or other lions, or the effects of goring or kicks from intended prey. In captivity, they may live over 25 years. Where do lions live? Lions live in a variety of habitats but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open woodland. Historically, they lived across much of Europe, Asia, and Africa, but now they are mainly found in parts of Africa south of the Sahara. What is a pride of lions? A pride is a group of lions that live together. The members of a pride spend days in several scattered groups that meet to hunt or share a meal. Each pride has its own territory that it defends, ranging from 20 square km (8 square miles) if food is abundant to 400 square km (around 150 square miles) if food is sparse. What is the purpose of a lion\u2019s mane? Manes make male lions look larger than they really are, which may function to intimidate rivals and impress prospective mates. Manes vary from one lion to another and may be entirely absent. What do lions eat? Lions usually hunt and eat medium-sized to large hoofed animals like wildebeests, zebras, and antelopes. They occasionally also prey on larger animals, especially sick or injured ones, and eat found meat such as carrion.\nSummary\nRead a brief summary of this topic\nlion, (Panthera leo), large, powerfully built cat (family Felidae) that is second in size only to the tiger. The proverbial \u201cking of beasts,\u201d the lion has been one of the best-known wild animals since earliest times. Lions are most active at night and live in a variety of habitats but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open woodland. Historically, they ranged across much of Europe, Asia, and Africa, but now they are found mainly in parts of Africa south of the Sahara. An isolated population of about 650 Asiatic lions constitute a slightly smaller race that lives under strict protection in India\u2019s Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary.\nGeneral characteristics The lion is a well-muscled cat with a long body, large head, and short legs. Size and appearance vary considerably between the sexes. The male\u2019s outstanding characteristic is his mane, which varies between different individuals and populations. It may be entirely lacking; it may fringe the face; or it may be full and shaggy, covering the back of the head, neck, and shoulders and continuing onto the throat and chest to join a fringe along the belly. In some lions the mane and fringe are very dark, almost black, giving the cat a majestic appearance. Manes make males look larger and may serve to intimidate rivals or impress prospective mates. A full-grown male is about 1.8\u20132.1 metres (6\u20137 feet) long, excluding the 1-metre tail; he stands about 1.2 metres high at the shoulder and weighs 170\u2013230 kg (370\u2013500 pounds). The female, or lioness, is smaller, with a body length of 1.5 metres, a shoulder height of 0.9\u20131.1 metres, and a weight of 120\u2013180 kg. The lion\u2019s coat is short and varies in colour from buff yellow, orange-brown, or silvery gray to dark brown, with a tuft on the tail tip that is usually darker than the rest of the coat.

Test your knowledge with this quiz.\nPrides Lions are unique among cats in that they live in a group, or pride. The members of a pride typically spend the day in several scattered groups that may unite to hunt or share a meal. A pride consists of several generations of lionesses, some of which are related, a smaller number of breeding males, and their cubs. The group may consist of as few as 4 or as many as 37 members, but about 15 is the average size. Each pride has a well-defined territory consisting of a core area that is strictly defended against intruding lions and a fringe area where some overlap is tolerated. Where prey is abundant, a territory area may be as small as 20 square km (8 square miles), but if game is sparse, it may cover up to 400 square km. Some prides have been known to use the same territory for decades, passing the area on between females. Lions proclaim their territory by roaring and by scent marking. Their distinctive roar is generally delivered in the evening before a night\u2019s hunting and again before getting up at dawn. Males also proclaim their presence by urinating on bushes, trees, or simply on the ground, leaving a pungent scent behind. Defecation and rubbing against bushes leave different scent markings. Pride of lions (Panthera leo). \u00a9 Guido Amrein/Dreamstime.com There are a number of competing evolutionary explanations for why lions form groups. Large body size and high density of their main prey probably make group life more efficient for females in terms of energy expenditure. Groups of females, for example, hunt more effectively and are better able to defend cubs against infanticidal males and their hunting territory against other females. The relative importance of these factors is debated, and it is not clear which was responsible for the establishment of group life and which are secondary benefits."}

Unauthorized use is prohibited.\nCommon Name : Cheetahs Scientific Name : Acinonyx jubatus Type : Mammals Diet : Carnivore Average Life Span In The Wild : Up to 14 years Average Life Span In Captivity : Up to 20 years Size : Body: 3.7 to 4.6 feet; tail: two to 2.7 feet Weight : 77 to 143 pounds IUCN Red List Status : ? Vulnerable LC NT VU EN CR EW EX Least Concern Extinct Current Population Trend : Decreasing\nWhat is the cheetah?\nThe cheetah is the world's fastest land mammal. With acceleration that would leave most automobiles in the dust, a cheetah can go from zero to 60 miles an hour in only three seconds. Wild cheetahs are thought to be able to reach speeds of nearly 70 miles an hour\u2014although they can only sustain that speed for about 30 seconds. These cats are nimble at high speeds, able to make quick and sudden turns in pursuit of prey.\nThere\u2019s some debate over whether cheetahs are \u201cbig cats.\u201d Some scientists argue that the term only refers to cats that are capable of roaring: lions, tigers, jaguars, and leopards. Cheetahs can\u2019t roar, though they can they purr. Still, conservation groups tend to embrace the wider definition of \u201cbig cats\u201d that also includes snow leopards and cougars.\nEven though their speed makes them fearsome hunters, cheetahs are the most vulnerable of the world\u2019s big cats. The International Union for Conservation of Nature currently lists the cheetah as vulnerable to extinction. However, in recent years, scientists have argued that cheetahs should be considered endangered instead, pointing to sizable losses in cheetah populations. There are fewer than 7,000 adult cheetahs remaining in the wild.\nAppearance and habitat\nCheetahs are famous for their tawny coats covered in black spots, each arranged in a unique pattern to help the animals identify one another. Bold black stripes streak like tears from the inner corners of their eyes down to both sides of their mouths, and the ends of their bushy tails are encircled by black rings. As the only big cat with a semi-retractable claw\u2014rather than the fully retractable claws that help lions tear flesh and climb trees\u2014cheetahs are the sole member of the genus Acinonyx.\nCheetahs\u2019 coats can vary depending on their habitat. Although they typically prefer open grasslands, cheetahs live in a range of habitats across eastern and southern Africa. One subspecies, the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah, can only be found in Iran, and only a few hundred are believed to be left.\nCheetahs in desert regions are sometimes smaller with paler coats, while some cheetahs in southern Africa have a genetic mutation that gives them larger spots and even stripes. There have also been rare sightings of spotless cheetahs in Kenya.\nSpeed and hunting\nCheetahs\u2019 bodies are uniquely adapted to help them reach top speeds, from their long, slender limbs and hard foot pads to the flexible spine that gives them their long stride. The cat\u2019s light tail acts like a rudder, and its semi-retractable claws act like the spikes on a sprinter\u2019s shoe to offer stability during the chase. Cheetahs also have large nasal cavities that help them gulp in oxygen, while the shape of their inner ears allows them to maintain balance and keep their heads still as they run. (Explore the mesmerizing physics of animal locomotion.)\nBefore unleashing their speed, cheetahs use their exceptionally keen eyesight to scan the grassland for signs of prey\u2014especially antelopes and warthogs, although cheetahs also prey on smaller animals such as hares and birds. The cheetah is a daylight hunter that benefits from stealthy movement and a spotted coat that allows it to blend easily into high, dry grasses.\nCheetahs begin a hunt by stalking their prey. When the moment is right, a cheetah will sprint after its quarry and attempt to knock it down. Such chases cost the hunter a tremendous amount of energy and are usually over in less than a minute. If successful, the cheetah begins eating its kill quickly to prevent opportunistic animals like lions and hyenas from getting in the way. Cheetahs rarely scavenge for food and stay hydrated by drinking the blood or urine of their prey.\nSocial structure and reproduction\nUnlike lions, cheetahs don\u2019t live in groups. Female cheetahs live on their own, each with a large home range. Females in areas such as the Serengeti, where the prey is migratory, typically follow the herds. Meanwhile, males are either solitary or form small coalitions with one or two other males, typically their littermates. Some males establish small territories in areas where they are likely to find mates.\nBoth male and female cheetahs mate with several partners, and studies show that cubs of the same litter can have different fathers. Female cheetahs typically have a litter of three cubs that live with them for about a year and a half. Young cubs spend that time learning from their mother and practicing hunting techniques with playful games. After leaving their mother, littermates stick together for another six months before the females strike out on their own.\nThreats to survival\nCheetah populations are under pressure as the open grasslands they favor are disappearing to human occupation and development. Given their solitary lives and the size of their home ranges, cheetahs need large areas of connected habitat\u2014likely upwards of 3,800 square miles\u2014to find mates and ultimately survive as a species. However, human settlements have fragmented their habitat, and most protected areas are not large enough to sustain cheetah populations.\nConflict with humans, who they\u2019re increasingly sharing space with, is another significant threat. If a cheetah kills a goat or sheep, the livestock owner may kill the cheetah in retaliation.\nCheetahs also face threats from hunting and the illegal wildlife trade, where they\u2019re sold for their skins and as pets. No one knows how many cubs are taken from the wild for the pet trade each year, but some estimates say it may be several hundred.\nCheetahs also face fierce competition for prey, and their cubs are particularly vulnerable to predation from lions.\nCompounding all these problems, cheetahs have an extremely low level of genetic variation, which is essential for a species to evolve in the face of environmental changes and disease. This lack of genetic variation is thought to have nearly caused their extinction at the end of the last ice age\u2014and scientists fear it leaves them vulnerable to extinction today.\nConservation\nCheetah conservation is particularly difficult given their wide geographic range\u2014it requires large-scale, regional collaboration across countries. Hunting cheetahs is illegal in most of the countries where they can be found, as is owning them as pets. They\u2019ve been protected from international commercial trade since 1975, under the Convention on Trade in International Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).\nIn Africa, almost all of the countries in the cat\u2019s range participate in regional conservation efforts that aim to address habitat loss by improving land planning, raising awareness of the need to save cheetahs, and promoting the peaceful coexistence of cheetahs and humans."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Aardvark images!\nAardvark Classification and Evolution\nAardvarks are small pig-like mammals that are found inhabiting a wide range of different habitats throughout Africa, south of the Sahara. They are mostly solitary and spend their days sleeping in underground burrows to protect them from the heat of the African sun, emerging in the cooler evening to search for food. Their name originates from the Afrikaans language in South Africa and means Earth Pig, due to their long snout and pig-like body. Aardvarks are unique among animals as they are the only surviving species in their animal family. Until recently it was widely believed that they were most closely related to other insectivores such as armadillos and pangolins but this is not the case with their closest living relatives actually thought to be elephants.\nAardvark Anatomy and Appearance\nAardvarks have a unique appearance amongst mammals (and indeed all animals) as they display physical characteristics of a number of different animal species. They have medium-sized, almost hairless bodies and long snouts that make them look distinctly pig-like at first, with thick skin that both protects them from the hot sun and also from being harmed by insect bites. They are able to close their nostrils to stop dust and insects from entering their nose. They have tubular, rabbit-like ears that can stand on end but can also be folded flat to prevent dirt from entering them when they are underground. Aardvarks have strong, claws on each of their spade-like feet that along with the fact that their hind legs are longer than their front legs, makes them strong and capable diggers able to excavate vast amounts of earth at an alarming rate. Due to the fact that they spend most of their lives underground or out hunting in the dark at night, they have poor eyesight but are able to easily navigate their surrounding using their excellent sense of smell to both find prey and to sense potential danger.\nAardvark Distribution and Habitat\nAardvarks are found in a wide variety of different habitats throughout sub-Saharan Africa from dry deserts to the moist rainforest regions. The only stipulation (other than having good access to plenty of food and water) is to have good soil in which they can dig their extensive burrows. Despite being highly skilled at digging in sandy or clay soil types, rockier regions prove more of a challenge to create their underground homes so the aardvark will move to another area where soil conditions are better suited to digging. Their burrows can be up to 10 meters (33 ft) long in a home range that can be anywhere from 2 to 5 kilometres square. Their burrows often having multiple entrances and are always left head first so they are able to identify potential predators easily using their keen sense of smell.\nAardvark Behaviour and Lifestyle\nAardvarks are mainly solitary animals that come together only to mate and are never found in large groups. They live in underground burrows to protect them both from the hot daytime sun and from predators. Aardvarks are nocturnal mammals, only leaving the safety of the burrow under the cover of night when they go in search of food and water, often travelling several miles in order to find the biggest termite mounds guided by their excellent hearing and sense of smell. Despite often having a large burrow comprised of an extensive network of tunnels, aardvarks are also known to be able to quickly excavate small temporary burrows where they can protect themselves quickly rather than having to return to their original dwelling.\nAardvark Reproduction and Life Cycles\nAardvarks have specific mating seasons that occur every year. Depending on the region in which the aardvark lives young can be born either in October to November, or May to June in other areas. Known to have babies most years, female aardvarks give birth to a single offspring after a gestation period that usually lasts for around 7 months. Newborn aardvarks often weigh as little as 2kg and are born with hairless, pink skin in the safety of their mother\u2019s burrow. Baby aardvarks spend the first two weeks of their lives in the safety of the underground burrow before beginning to venture out with their mother under the cover of night. However, despite accompanying their mother in search of food they aren\u2019t weaned until they are around three months old. Young aardvarks live with their mother in her burrow until they are around six months old when they move out to dig a burrow of their own. Although their lifespan in the wild is not entirely clear, aardvarks tend to live for more than 20 years in captivity.\nAardvark Diet and Prey\nThe diet of aardvarks is mainly comprised of ants and termites, with termites being their preferred food source. Despite this though, they are known to also eat other insects such as beetles and insect larvae. Aardvarks are built to be insectivores, with strong limbs and claws that are capable of breaking into the harder outer shell of termite mounds very efficiently. Once they have broken into the mound they then use their long, sticky tongue to harvest the insects inside and eat them whole without chewing as they are then ground down in their muscular stomachs. One of the aardvarks most distinctive features is the fact that they have columnar cheek-teeth that serve no functional purpose at all. With some larger ant species that need to be chewed they use the incisors that are located towards the back of their mouths. Aardvarks are also able to use the same techniques to break into underground ant nests.\nAardvark Predators and Threats\nDespite the fact that aardvarks are nocturnal animals that live in the safety of underground burrows, they are threatened by a number of different predators throughout their natural environment. Lions, leopards, hyenas and large snakes (most notably pythons) are the main predators of aardvarks but this does vary depending on where the aardvark lives. Their main form of defence is to escape very quickly underground however, they are also known to be quite aggressive when threatened by these larger animals. Aardvarks use their strong, sharp claws to try and injure their attacker along with kicking the threatening animal with their powerful back legs. Aardvarks are also threatened by humans who hunt them and destroy their natural habitats.\nAardvark Interesting Facts and Features\nAardvarks use their long, sticky tongue to lap up to 50,000 insects a night from inside termite mounds or underground ant nests. Their worm-like tongues can actually grow up to 30 cm in length meaning they can reach more termites further into the mound. Their love of insects has actually led aardvarks also being known as Antbears! Interestingly enough, aardvarks are also thought to get almost all of the moisture they need from their prey meaning that they actually have to physically drink very little water. Aardvarks are thought to be one of the world\u2019s most prolific diggers with their strong limbs and claws and shovel-like feet helping them to be able to shift 2ft of soil in just 15 seconds!\nAardvark Relationship with Humans\nDue to the fact that they spend the daytime hours hidden in the safety of their underground burrows, only emerging under the cover of night to hunt for food, aardvarks are very seldom seen by many people. In some regions though, they are hunted by people for food and are becoming increasingly affected by expanding human populations as more of their natural habitats disappear to make way for growing settlements.\nAardvark Conservation Status and Life Today\nToday, aardvarks are listed by the IUCN as a species that is of Least Concern. Despite the fact that population numbers of aardvarks most certainly declined in some countries, in others, their numbers remain stable and they are often commonly found in both protected areas and regions with suitable habitats. They are however becoming increasingly affected by habitat loss in both the form of deforestation and expanding towns and villages. Due to their incredibly elusive nature, exact population sizes are not fully understood.\nView all 122 animals that start with A"}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Jellyfish images!\nJellyfish are prehistoric marine creatures and have been known to exist in oceans for the past millions of years.\nThough they are not usually aggressive, these fish are famous for their ability to sting, allowing them to defend themselves against any sort of danger.\nThese fish use their tentacles for hunting. However, they do not have any bones, heart, or most other organs. Interestingly, their bodies are mostly made up of water.\nThey have a lifespan of about three to six months and can grow up to 7 feet in size.\nDo Jellyfish Have Brains?\nAs beautiful as these sea creatures are, they don\u2019t actually have a brain. Instead, the body is made up of a complex nervous system, which is where all of their motor functions and sensory activity occurs. Through the neurons in this system, the body tells the muscles when to contract, which is how they swim.\nIncredible Jellyfish Facts!\nNo brains, heart, or eyes: These fish are mostly made up of water. They have no brains, heart, or eyes. They also have no bones, and their body is primarily controlled by the nervous system.\nAncient, prehistoric beings: Jellyfish are known to have been around for millions of years \u2013 even before dinosaurs!\nBioluminescent: These fish are bioluminescent \u2013 which means that they can produce their light.\nQuick digestion: The digestive process doesn\u2019t take very long when jellyfish eat. This quick process ensures that they can remain afloat in water.\nWorldwide delicacies: Jellyfish are not loved by the predators that feed on them but also by the human population across the globe.\nJellyfish Classification and Scientific Name\nThese animals go by the scientific name Scyphozoa and belong to the kingdom Animalia and phylum Cnidaria. Scyphozoa comes from two Greek words \u2013 skuphos and z\u014dion. While skuphos means \u201cdrinking cup,\u201d the word z\u014dion means \u201canimal.\u201d The name is an interpretation to mean that this animal contains water. The phylum cnidaria is interesting as well since it comes from the modern Latin word knid\u0113, which means \u201cnettle.\u201d\nAs a part of their classification, these fish come from the sub-phylum Medusozoa and class Scyphozoa \u2013 which is the same as the jellyfish\u2019s scientific name in the classification. Medusozoa comes from the Ancient Greek \u039c\u03ad\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1, which comes from the word for \u201crule over\u201d (\u03bc\u03ad\u03b4\u03c9).\nJellyfish Species\nJellyfish form a large family of planktonic creatures, and recent studies show that there are at least 4,000 that have already been discovered. Considering the vastness of the oceans, scientists believe that this number is barely a fraction of what is actually in the sea.\nEven with all of these species around the world, only 70 are considered to be a threat to humans. Some of those dangerous species include the Malo kingi and the Chironex Fleckeri, which are both in the box jellyfish family. The venom is potent and painful enough to kill.\nThere are some types that are even kept as pets, primarily for their inability to sting their owner. The most common jellyfish to keep as a pet is the moon jellyfish, which lives for about 15 months. Other species of jellyfish can live much, much longer.\nImmortal Jellyfish\nTurritopsis dohrnii that is also called the Immortal jellyfish is a small and transparent jellyfish and can interestingly reverse to earlier stages of their lives. This transition can take the animal back to the state that the jellyfish was in as a fertilized egg when it settles on the seafloor at old age.\nJellyfish Appearance\nSome of these animals are transparent while others exist in bright colors like yellow, blue, and pink. These fish are bioluminescent which means that they produce their light.\nTheir bodies may look complex due to the way they look but they are quite simple. Jellyfish have a smooth body with tentacles that contain tiny cells that can be used when they use their stinging capabilities.\nThey have no bones, brains, heart, or eyes. Their mouths are found in the center of their bodies. They are usually about 0.5 to 16 inches and can grow up to 7 feet and usually weigh around 440 pounds.\nYellow Jellyfish in ocean Dan90266 / Creative Commons\nJellyfish Tentacles\nThese animals have tentacles that are equipped with tiny stinging cells that are activated when these fish when they launch a sting attack on their prey. These tentacles are used to paralyze and stun the prey that the jellyfish stings. These tentacles are found hanging from the jellyfish\u2019s body.\nThough these tentacles are controlled by the nervous system, the sting is rarely fatal. Most box jellyfish have strong enough venom to execute the victim. The purpose of the tentacles is to stop the movement of its prey, though they are also used as a way to defend the animal.\nJellyfish Distribution, Population, and Habitat\nThey are found across the globe and can be found in every ocean on the planet. Many species choose to live in warm tropical waters or cold Arctic waters. They can exist at the bottom of the oceans as well as on the water surfaces, making them incredibly versatile.\nThough the specific areas may vary, every species must live in saltwater to thrive. As of 1990, there were 900 million tons of jellyfish in the Black Sea alone.\nEven with this ability to survive in so many locations, pollution is a big threat to every species. Oil spills and dumping chemicals in the water can easily absorb into their skin, which makes it impossible for them to reproduce. Though the pollution doesn\u2019t always kill them instantly, most species will not live nearly as long once they are exposed.\nJellyfish Predators and Prey\nThese animals face threats from various sea and land creatures including sea anemones, swordfish, sea turtles, tuna, and penguins. When the jellyfish get washed up on beaches, they are usually found and eaten by foxes and other birds and animals. If humans manage to catch them, it isn\u2019t uncommon to cook it as a delicacy.\nThese fish in turn feed on many different things like planktonic eggs, small plants, small fish and larvae, fish eggs, and other small marine animals.\nThe Sting of the Jellyfish\nThese animals have tentacles that are armed with tiny sting cells that the fish use on their prey or when they sense danger. They often use their stinging characteristics to defend themselves and use their tentacles to inject venom into other creatures.\nThe stings can cause pain and irritation and can sometimes also result in whole-body illness. Some stings can even be life-threatening. The most severe sting comes from Australian box jellyfish, which is the most deadly jellyfish in the world. Their venom can be so painful it often leads to drowning from victims who go into shock.\nJellyfish Reproduction and Lifespan\nThese animals are known to reproduce both sexually and asexually. While one of the species reproduces sexually, some other types reproduce asexually. However, for both the processes, the fertilized eggs settle on the seafloor after developing into a multi-cellular planula.\nWhile most jellyfish live only about three to six months, some live longer and can survive for two to three years. After all, the immortal jellyfish never technically dies. Instead, it eventually settles on the seafloor and contributes to the birth of a younger jellyfish from its own DNA. Essentially, it creates a clone of itself without ever technically \u201cdying.\u201d\nJellyfish in Fishing and Cooking\nJellyfish can be caught and eaten. More than twelve species are edible and are savored around the globe as delicacies. These fish are a rich source of protein and fatty acids.\nOne popular recipe is sesame jellyfish, which pairs the fish with soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, and sometimes chili oil.\nView all 25 animals that start with J"}

Their bodies are incredibly strong, though this strength is used for multiple purposes.\nSnakes have a close relationship to lizards, which are also reptiles. While snakes have no eyelids or ear holes, they have become a well-loved pet by many eclectic owners. The serpent, a mythical symbol that is broadly known everywhere, is simply another term for it.\n5 Incredible Snake Facts!\nHere are a few interesting facts about these reptiles:\nOut of over 3,800 different types, only 600 have venomous fangs. Snakes like the gopher snake and kingsnakes are nonvenonmous. Only 200 of these snakes have enough potency to harm a human.\nThough they are a reptile, like a lizard is, they have no eyelids or ear holes.\nSnakes do not chew their food, despite the presence of teeth. Instead, they swallow it whole.\nThese reptiles can be found on every continent but Antarctica.\nThe snake to have lived the longest is located in Missouri and she is 62 years old.\nSnake Scientific Name\nThese reptiles go by the scientific name Serpentes and belong to the kingdom Animalia and Phylum Chordata. Their class is called Reptilia and the order is called Squamata. The clade is called Ophidia.\nSerpentes, which is often shortened to the serpent in mythical stories, comes from the Latin word \u201cserp\u014d,\u201d which means \u201ccreep\u201d or \u201ccrawl.\u201d\nSnake Appearance\nSnakes are reptiles, but they noticeably have no legs. However, not every legless reptile is known as a snake. Seemingly, the only components to a snake are their head and their tail, which takes up the entire length of their body. Some snakes are as short as 4.1 inches (like the Barbados thread snake), though the longest snake in the world (which is the reticulated python) is over 20 feet long.\nThe teeth of these reptiles will vary by the species as well. Some species have several needle-sharp teeth, while others have fangs. The snakes with fangs naturally store their venom in the sacs that are behind the eyes. The venom is poisonous, but only about 600 species have it. A snake, sometimes referred to as a serpent, has no earholes, but its ears are internal.\nThese reptiles are covered in scales, though they have skin like humans underneath them. The markings are determined by the species, but there is hardly a color that you won\u2019t see. The color is often a sign of how dangerous the snake is, but the pattern will help differentiate the threats from harmless animals. Often, snakes are found in every color of the rainbow, including red, green, yellow, blue, and black. A high abundance of color means that it is more dangerous, though venomous snakes usually have a triangular head. Read here to know about snakes that change their color to blend it.\nRattlesnakes have a large rattle at the end of their tail, which emits a loud noise to let animals and humans know that they are not to be messed with. It is also important to note that there are some animals that look like snakes, but aren\u2019t.\nThe body of the animal is also indicative of the way that the snake hunts. Animals with long and thin bodies will hunt down their prey by hunting through bushes, while short yet thick snakes will sit and wait for their prey.\nRead here to learn more about the anatomy of snakes. Also, read here to learn about the most colorful snakes in the world.\nSome snakes look like dragons. Read here to find out about them.\nreptiles4all/Shutterstock.com\nSnake Behavior\nWhen it comes to hunting, snakes have an incredible sense of smell that they rely on. As they flick out their tongue, they seek out the chemicals in the air. Other snakes will use their ability to detect body heat. Constriction and venom tend to be the main ways that the prey is overpowered.\nThese reptiles seek out the right environment to keep their body warm since their cold-blooded body is unable to regulate their temperature. Most often, snakes will use natural sunlight to keep their body warm, but they will hide to cool off as well.\nSnakes shed their skin when they grow. Some of them change their eye color when the shedding occurs, becoming paler than their typical color. The shedding process can be rather uncomfortable, but it is harmless to the user.\nThough some species produce venom, the majority do not. Only 600 species have any kind of venom, and only a third of those venomous snakes have the capacity to wound humans at all, and even fewer can fatally kill them. Learn about the toughest animals in the world here.\nThough humans are not a natural part of the reptile\u2019s diet, it will bite if it feels threatened. In certain species, this bite can be fatal. There are scary and dangerous species in the world, the most lethal being the saw-scaled viper, killing more humans than any other species.\nRead about the most dangerous animals on earth to humans here.\nCommon Types of Snakes\nThe following list includes some common types of snakes found around the world:\nPythons \u2013 Pythons are a family of snakes consisting of 42 total recognized species. These reptiles can be found mostly in Asia, Australia, and Africa; however, the Burmese python was introduced in the Florida Everglades and is currently considered an invasive species. Most species in this family are \u201cambush predators\u201d meaning they remain motionless and strike as prey passes by.\n\u2013 Pythons are a family of snakes consisting of 42 total recognized species.

Elapids \u2013 Most elapids are commonly referred to as \u201ccobras.\u201d These snakes are characterized by the erect, venomous fangs at the front of their mouths, and species can be terrestrial or aquatic. Elapids are endemic to tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world.\n\u2013 Most elapids are commonly referred to as \u201ccobras.\u201d These snakes are characterized by the erect, venomous fangs at the front of their mouths, and species can be terrestrial or aquatic.

Rattlesnakes \u2013 Rattlesnakes are found on the American continents and are characterized by the rattle at the end of their tails which they use to scare off predators. Although rattlesnakes rarely attack humans unless provoked, rattlesnake bites are the leading cause for snakebite injuries in North America.\n\u2013 Rattlesnakes are found on the American continents and are characterized by the rattle at the end of their tails which they use to scare off predators. Although rattlesnakes rarely attack humans unless provoked, rattlesnake bites are the leading cause for snakebite injuries in North America. Garters \u2013 Garter snakes are generally harmless snakes found throughout North and Central America. These snakes were long believed to be non-venomous, but recent studies have determined that they produce a neurotoxic venom which is too mild to injure or kill a human.\nSnake Habitat\nSnakes are quite versatile, and many types work in the climates of the world. Though the only continent without snakes is Antarctica, there are a few countries that aren\u2019t home to any native snake, including Ireland, New Zealand, and Iceland. Alaska is one of the few states that also has no native species.\nThe typical habitat is just as broad as where they can live. In water-based and land-based environments alike, these reptiles can also be found in tropical areas. While the water moccasin and the water snake commonly live near and in water, most snakes live on land. Based on the species, snakes can live in deserts, grasslands, and the rainforest.\nSnake Diet\nThese reptiles have a carnivorous diet, meaning that their diet entirely consists of other animals. They can choose warm-blooded or cold-blooded animals, seeking out amphibians, insects, and mammals. For the most part, they don\u2019t eat other reptiles, but some of them have been known to go after smaller species.\nThough every snake will consume their prey whole, the way that they render them helpless varies. Boas and pythons will bite their prey to hold onto them, wrapping their body around and squeezing the life from the prey. If the animal has fangs, it will deliver venom to its prey. The venom comes from a sac that is hidden behind the eyes.\nSnake Predators and Threats\nThese reptiles are rather quick and effective predators, but they are also the prey of many different animals. One of the biggest predators of these reptiles is humans. Humans will use them for meat, clothing, and many other purposes, though the animal is largely not considered to be endangered.\nThe population of these reptiles can be negatively impacted by deforestation, hunting, and climate change. Ultimately, the threat that the snake faces is specific to many factors, like the species, where they live, and how much meat that they provide. Learn about some snakes that are endangered here.\nTo learn about some snakes that don\u2019t bite, read here.\nWhat Eats Snakes?\nThese reptiles may be rather impressive hunters, but animals like large birds and coyotes have made these reptiles into a regular part of their diet. They are also hunted by mongooses, wild boars, foxes, raccoons, and other game that can pick them up and consume them. Some snakes eat other snakes. They are called ophiophagus.\nLuckily, each species has its own way to defend itself against threats. Camouflage plays a major role in their defense, hiding for additional coverage. Venomous species will bite as a last resort, but they primarily will try to flee instead.\nWhat Do Snakes Eat?\nSince all of these reptiles are carnivores, there are many small animals that can become their prey. The diet that the animal consumes is based on their species. Insects, amphibians, earthworms, slugs, fish, rodents, rabbits, and birds are all possible foods. Some snakes eat eggs.\nRead here to discover some snakes that eat fish and some snakes that eat birds.\nSnake Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nThe reproduction process of these reptiles is primarily a process of internal fertilization. Most species intertwine their bodies with that of their partner, and the male releases the sperm from one of the two organs it has. The female doesn\u2019t necessarily become pregnant with her young right away; some females can store the male\u2019s sperm for 2-5 years before fertilization.\nThe species will determine the type of birth that the female has. Rattlesnakes and garter snakes will give birth to their babies as live young, which makes them ovoviviparous. However, species like the ball python and the corn snake will lay eggs, which makes them oviparous. In fact, approximately 70% of all these reptiles are oviparous, rather than ovoviviparous.\nThe number of eggs or live young will vary greatly. For snakes that give birth to live young, about 10-30 are born in each litter, though the diamondback water snake can have up to 40 babies in a litter. The live-bearing females often find a sheltered spot where they give birth to the babies. For the species that lay eggs, the clutch size varies significantly. While the ball python may only lay a single egg, some clutches are up to 100 eggs annually.\nThe species of snake will determine their lifespan. While smaller species (like the garter snake) live for less than ten years, the various types of boas can leave for about 25 to 50 years. As of September 2020, the longest living snake is a ball python who is currently 62 years old and lives in the St. Louis Zoo of Missouri.\nSnake Population\nJukka Palm/Shutterstock.com\nWith over 3,000 types of snakes around the world, the total population varies from country to country. Interestingly, there are a few countries that have no known native species of snakes at all, including Ireland and Antarctica. Here is a compilation of pre-historic snakes.\nOf the thousands of snake species, approximately 600 species are venomous. Still, the unpopular nature of this reptile has led many people to believe that this statistic means that they are dangerous, which is not accurate. Of the 600 venomous snakes, only 22 species actually can harm a human.\nThough there are some species with lower populations, snakes (as a whole) are classified as \u201cnot extinct\u201d by the IUCN. Here is a list of the most popular snakes in the world.\nRead about the rarest snakes in the world here. To know more about some prehistoric snakes, read here.\nSnakes In the Zoo\nThese reptiles can be found at nearly every major zoo, allowing the public to become more informed of the types of this reptile that span across the globe. Most often, the zoos will include snakes that are local to their region, so the species will vary from one location to the next.\nWhen visiting this reptile, most species will simply relax in their tank. However, some zoos (like the Virginia Living Museum) features demonstrations outside of the tanks to allow patrons to get a closer look. With more awareness about harmless and dangerous types of snakes, the fear typically associated with these animals can be erased.\nSnakes that live in zoos may not exhibit the same outward symptoms of illness that they show in the wild. Zookeepers are incredibly familiar with the behavior that these snakes show when they are ill, allowing them to get fast treatment when they become sick.\nSome types of snakes can be kept as pets, like the corn snake or the rosy boa.\nRead More\nRead about:\nTypes of Snakes\nList of Snakes\nView all 180 animals that start with S"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Mongoose Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Mongoose-facts.html", "text": "mongoose Facts\nAlthough they appear remarkably similar to weasels in form and lifestyle, mongooses are actually members of the superfamily feliforma, or \"cat-like\" carnivores, while weasels are in the superfamily caniforma or \"dog-like\" carnivores.\nAnd yes - the plural of mongoose is mongooses - not mongeese!\nFeliforms and caniforms have significant differences in skull structure among other things, and are classified based on these complex, skeletal criteria. So the mongoose, which shares ancient ancestors with cats, is actually most closely related to the civet, and is in the same superfamily as the hyena and the leopard.\nSimply put, the mongoose is not a weasel. The meerkat, however, is a mongoose, but since it is such a popular little animal and is in its own genus, you can read about it here - Meerkat Facts.\nMost mongoose species are highly social animals living in busy groups of 6 to 40 individuals called \"packs\" or \"mobs\". Some particularly gregarious species like the Gambian mongoose may live in packs of 50 or more. These groups may be lead by an alpha male and female who are often the only two individuals who mate and reproduce.\nSome mongoose species live in a cooperative society where each member of the pack has a specific job and subsequent duties. Some are hunters, some stay behind and \"baby sit\". In this system, older or infirmed members and youngsters are often nurtured by the entire pack, with kills being brought back to the home front and generally freely shared.\nThe mongoose is a small animal but an excellent hunter, with keen senses of smell, sight and hearing, and remarkable reflexes. They hunt insects and small animals such as mice, rats, rabbits, lizards and snakes, including one of the most dangerous creatures on Earth - the dreaded King cobra. They are largely immune to the venom of scorpions and snakes, although repeated stings or strikes may sicken and even kill them.\nMongooses are remarkably bright animals that have complex social structures and have even displayed simple tool use. Several species of mongoose routinely crack open eggs, nuts, or shelled creatures such as crabs or mollusks by dropping or throwing them on rocks. Some will raise up on their hind legs with the item in their forepaws and drop it on a stone. Others have been observed hunched over like a football center, launching objects between their legs against a large stone or tree. This behavior is observed and practiced by youngsters until perfected. - Mongoose Facts\nhow does a mongoose kill a cobra?\nThe mongoose is notorious for one fascinating fact - their astounding ability to battle and kill some of the deadliest creatures on Earth. Native to India, the King cobra is the largest venomous snake in the world, capable of reaching a length of 20 feet and a weight of over 35 pounds. A bite from a King cobra can kill an adult human being in less than 30 minutes.\nIn the wild, there are only 2 things a King cobra must fear, people and mongooses. The mongoose is a constantly active hunter and forager that eats a wide variety of small prey animals and loves snakes in particular. All species of mongoose eat snakes regularly, but the slender mongoose and the grey mongoose are the two species most likely to confront and devour a King cobra.\nFirst, their habitats overlap, second, these mongooses are some of the largest species, and third, practice makes perfect. A confrontation between a mongoose and a cobra is not an everyday event, but it is not uncommon either. In general, the mongoose is the cobras only natural predator other than human beings.\nKing cobras actually eat other snakes as their main diet, as well as small animals like rats and birds. Many of the things they eat are larger than a typical mongoose, but the King cobra wants no part of the mongoose. The snake will try to avoid confrontation if it runs into a mongoose, but will stand its ground once cornered and defend itself if it can't get away.\nThe mongoose is incredibly, blurringly swift and is capable of dodging the strikes of the also very swift cobra, but the mongoose also possesses something called acetylcholine receptors which make it , not fully immune, but relatively tolerant of cobra venom. When it makes its move, the mongoose leaps, teeth bared, directly for the head of the snake. If the mongoose grabs the snake correctly it will kill it by biting right into its skull.\nThe cobra may wrap around the mongoose but will usually succumb to the mongooses attack in a matter of moments If the mongooses first leap is inaccurate, it may be bitten.\nIf the cobra bites the mongoose more than once, the mongoose may loose the battle and become the cobras dinner. It is thought that mongooses win about 75 to 80% of these encounters, and they will eat the cobra, venom sacs and all.\nA king cobras venom is not poison, it is a modified saliva that must be injected into the victim in order to be lethal, so the mongoose is free to consume the entire body of its neutralized victim. - Mongoose Facts\nsome of the many mongoose species\nmongoose reproduction\nMongoose mother and baby\nThe numerous species of mongooses have many different lifestyles and reproductive strategies.\nSome live in groups where only the alpha male and female will reproduce. In these packs the rest of the gang will help with the raising of just a few youngsters from this select breeding.\nOther species live in larger colonies where the females have synchronized estrus cycles. All the females will mate with the most dominant males and they will all give birth within hours of each other.\nThe babies will be raised by the entire colony, and when the members of these packs leave the den to forage, several \"babysitters\" will stay behind and mind the huge, communal litter of pups.\nA few mongoose species are solitary animals with males and females only coming together to mate once a year. With these species the male may stay to help raise the litter of 2 to 6 babies called pups, or the female may raise her pups alone.\nIn some mongoose societies, young pups beg all the adults in the pack for food but eventually choose one adult, called an \"escort\" who will provide that individual pup with food until the youngster can fend for itself at about 5 months old.\nA baby mongoose spends most of its time playing and wrestling with litter mates while the adults in the pack forage. When an adult uncovers a beetle, digs up a millipede or snatches an egg, the pups forget about play and beg for a meal using high-pitched chirps like baby birds. Youngsters of most species remain with their family group for life. - Mongoose Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

They are sometimes referred to as red meerkats although both animals are in their own genus. The yellow mongoose lives in busy colonies and digs large and fairly elaborate dens with multiple rooms and tunnels. They often peacefully share their dens with ground squirrels. The colony will usually start the day by slowly emerging from their burrow and lounging about the entrance sunbathing and grooming each other. Then they will set off to forage for their favorite foods - big bugs.\nBasically an insectivore, the yellow mongoose relishes scorpions, millipedes, beetles and roaches. Birds eggs, the occasional mouse or lizard and some unfortunate snakes round out the menu, but bugs are by far the bulk of their diet.\nYellow mongoose packs usually consist of an alpha male and female and assorted relatives. Youngsters are commonly cared for by the entire family, and older or less able individuals are often nurtured by the group as a whole, supplied with food, and protected by all the members of the pack. - Mongoose Facts\nbanded mongoose facts\nThe banded mongoose is a medium sized species of mongoose weighing about 5 pounds. They live in big social groups with several dominant males who not only routinely mark their territory but also the other members in the group with their scent glands.\nThe banded mongoose has several very unique habits and has become famous for its interaction with other species of animals. Bandeds have been observed foraging with troops of chacma baboons and co-existing rather peacefully. Some baboons have been observed stroking and even holding mongooses as if they were pets. Mostly, the two species must find some safety in numbers as they forage.\nIn another interesting example of inter-species activity, banded mongooses have been regularly observed grooming warthogs. Individuals have been seen climbing on the backs of these potentially very dangerous animals and carefully removing ticks and other irritants.\nThis species of mongoose in particular, has shown amazing adaptive abilities, and their cooperation with other species is matched only by teamwork within their own pack.\nIf startled or threatened a pack of banded mongooses has a unique and unsettling defense mechanism. Sometimes referred to as \"mobbing\" the entire group will mass together in a tightly packed formation and charge their opponent as one. While charging they will scream, churl and holler, but most unnervingly they will rise up, sink down and writhe side to side creating the illusion of one single huge and convulsing animal.\nFew foes will stand their ground against a well executed banded mongoose mobbing, and many a hyena, leopard or lion has been sent fleeing from the sight! - Mongoose Facts\ndwarf mongoose facts\nThe smallest of the mongoose species, the tiny dwarf mongoose is only 7 to 10 inches long and lives in social groups of up to 20 individuals. The dwarf mongoose pack moves about its large territory using numerous termite mounds, caves and tree hollows as shelters for a few days at a time. Termite mounds are a favorite, and they will renovate the structures to suit their needs, adding rooms and widening tunnels.\nThey mark their territory with anal gland secretions, rubs of their cheek glands, and the strategic placement of communal latrines, where all members defecate in a concentrated pile. The dwarf mongoose pack is usually led by a dominant female who chooses new den sites and directions of travel. Generally she is the only female to mate and will often produce three litters a year. The pups, usually 2 to 5 per litter, will be raised by the entire pack. Subordinate females within the group lactate and actually nurse the dominant females pups.\nLike the banded mongoose, the dwarf mongoose has been seen collaborating with other species. They are often seen together with birds of the hornbill species, each creature benefiting from the others heightened senses and alerting each other of predators as they forage. - Mongoose Facts\na few more mongoose facts\nA group of mongooses is called a \"mob\" a \"pack\" a \"gang\" or a \"troop\"\nThe mongoose is not a weasel\nThe meerkat is a species of mongoose\nSome mongoose species live in abandoned termite mounds\nThe mongoose was made famous in the jungle book story \"Rikki tikki tavi\" by Rudyard Kipling, a short story about an Indian grey mongoose.\nSeveral species of mongoose show an example of simple tool use by throwing or dropping eggs, shellfish and nuts against rocks to open them.\nThe mongoose has horizontal pupils.\nMost mongoose species have very high tolerance to scorpion and snake venom -Mongoose Facts!\nthe mongoose is a\ncarnivorous (meat-eating)\ndiurnal (active during the day)\nterrestrial (lives on ground) digitigrade(walks on toes)\nfeliform (cat-like carnivore)\nmammal (animal with mammary glands and hair follicles) Scientific Classification\nClass - Mammalia\nOrder - Feliforma\nFamily - Herpestidae\nGenus - 18\nSpecies - 37 MONGOOSE - animalstats - MALE FEMALE YOUNG SOCIAL UNIT male female pup, puppy usually colony GROUP HOME HABITAT FAVORITE FOOD gang, pack Europe, Asia, Africa grasslands,desert insects, mice ENEMIES AVG.

(10 Top Predators) \u2013 Fauna Facts", "url": "https://faunafacts.com/crocodiles/what-eats-crocodiles/", "text": "Crocodiles have many different predators, such as big cats like jaguars or leopards, and big serpents like anacondas and pythons. Other predators of crocs include hippos and elephants. Baby crocodiles are especially vulnerable to predators, and they\u2019re hunted by herons, egrets, and eagles, and even wild pigs.\nCrocodiles are one of the most feared animal species in the world. They\u2019ll attack and eat almost any animal that comes its way, so it\u2019s not a choosy predator.\nBut crocodiles are sometimes susceptible to surprise attacks, especially when they\u2019re nice and comfortable resting in the water. That\u2019s when larger snakes such as pythons take the opportunity to wrap themselves around the crocodile, kill it, and then eat it whole.\nBaby crocodiles are especially vulnerable to predator attacks, especially if they\u2019re alone. Various animals take the opportunity to hunt them and eat them.\nIn this article, you\u2019ll find a list of the most common crocodile predators and a description of how they hunt down these animals.\nWhat Eats Crocodiles? (Top 10 Predators)\nThese are the most common animals that eat predators.\n1. Jaguars\nJaguars are known to eat crocodiles. Crocodiles and wild cats are usually direct competitors for the prey in their domains.\nJaguars are apex predators, meaning they don\u2019t have any real natural predators. They\u2019re much faster than crocodiles, allowing them to strike first and thus, win the fight.\nUsually, jaguars will use their agility and speed to get in behind the crocodiles and surprise them. They\u2019ll strike from behind and attack them by jumping on their backs, which is a massive area of weakness for crocodiles. Smaller species of crocodiles simply can\u2019t cope with the strength and speed of the jaguars, especially on land.\n2. Leopards\nLeopards are known to eat crocodiles. Like jaguars, leopards also compete with the crocodiles for land and prey.\nThat\u2019s why they will attack them and try to get rid of them to establish dominance over other species. But they\u2019ll also attack crocodiles for food, as they\u2019re a rich source of protein and fat.\nLeopards will normally attack smaller crocodile species as well as baby crocs. When these find themselves stranded on land, they are not able to fend off the fierce leopard attacks. These attacks will only happen when crocodiles come out of water.\n3. Pythons\nThe python is one of the most ruthless predators in the wild. A python will squeeze their prey to death, giving them no chance of escape.\nPythons will normally hide on trees, branches, and underwater in order to surprise the crocodile.\nBut pythons are not poisonous animals, so they won\u2019t kill their prey by biting it. Instead, the python will wrap around the body of the prey and suffocate it to death. With this mechanism, the python is capable of hunting animals that are much larger than themselves.\nOnce the prey is dead, the python will ingest it whole. They\u2019re able to eat and swallow much larger animals than them, which might suffice for several days to keep them fed. Crocodiles are susceptible to being eaten by pythons when they\u2019re not able to prepare.\n4. Anaconda\nAnacondas are quite similar to pythons when it comes to hunting. They don\u2019t chase their prey, but they ambush it. That\u2019s how they are able to catch crocodiles, especially the smaller ones.\nThey will wait for hours on trees, waiting for an unsuspecting crocodile to pass by.\nThe anaconda will do its best hunting when it gets dark. And even though crocodiles have pretty good eyesight during the night, they simply cannot expect an attack coming from above. Sometimes, anacondas will even ambush the crocodile in the water, giving it no chance to fight back.\n5. Hippopotamus\nThe crocodile and the hippo are direct competitors in many different habitats, especially in Africa and South America.\nPrey is usually not that plentiful in many of the areas where hippos and alligators share a common habitat, so the larger animals will have to compete for it.\nAnd hippos are much larger than crocodiles, so they\u2019re able to fight them with their sheer power. Hippos are one of the most aggressive species in the world, and won\u2019t hesitate to attack the crocodile \u2013 or any other species that comes its way, for that matter.\n6. Elephants\nElephants will also kill crocodiles, but this is not as common as with some other species. This will only happen if the crocodile provokes the elephant and tries to attack the baby elephants that might be lurking around.\nThat\u2019s when the bigger elephants will come and try to protect the baby elephant. They\u2019re ferocious when they get angry, and will often fight back against the crocodile with its feet and trunk. Although elephants are not always successful in their fight against the crocodile, it is yet another species that can kill an elephant.\n7. Heron\nNow we\u2019re moving to animals that will only eat crocodile babies. The heron is one of those species \u2013 though they will only attack very small croc babies, usually the ones that have just been hatched and born.\nThese will get guarded by larger crocodiles almost constantly. But once the mother crocodile leaves the small crocodiles alone in order to get food, it\u2019s a great chance for the heron to strike and eat the baby crocs. But if the heron gets caught by the larger crocodiles, it usually won\u2019t end well for them.\n8. Egret\nEgrets will also only attack the baby crocodiles, and they\u2019ll use similar mechanisms as herons do.\nThese animals are sneaky animals. They\u2019ll wait for their opportunity, as they\u2019re quite opportunistic in nature. Their attacks will not always succeed, but baby crocodiles can present an important source of food for egrets.\n9. Eagles\nBaby crocodiles can\u2019t defend themselves from attacks from the air. They are vulnerable to attacks that will strike their backs, as they can\u2019t turn around quickly enough to repel those attacks.\nAlso, they\u2019re not quick enough to outrun the speed of an eagle, which is why crocodile babies are so vulnerable against eagles.\nThe eagle is very good at sniffing out opportunities to strike from very high altitudes, leaving its prey unaware of the potential threat. Baby crocodiles are especially vulnerable to these attacks, as are some smaller alligator and crocodile species.\n10. Other Crocodiles\nYes, cannibalism is present among crocodiles, but it\u2019s not very common. This will ONLY happen where there is no other food around, and only when a larger croc encounters a smaller species.\nAdult crocodiles won\u2019t each other because they\u2019re too big for each other. But if the other crocodile is small enough and it threatens to usurp the territory of the larger crocodile, then it will not hesitate to kill it \u2013 and even eat it! This will mainly only happen with males, while larger males will leave female crocs be if they enter their area.\nFinal Thoughts\nCrocodiles are normally viewed as fierce and dominant animals that don\u2019t spare many animals that come into their territories. However, they\u2019re not always able to protect themselves, especially against larger species and some snake species such as anacondas and pythons.\nTo defend themselves, they\u2019ll use their teeth and strong jaws to strike back. But when they\u2019re attacked from above or behind, they have little to no chance to strike back, especially if the attacks are quick and fierce."}

Dugong has evolved 50 to 60 million years ago, when an elephant-like creature entered the water.\nDugong has large mouth with upper lip designed for bristling of sea grass.\nDugong is a true vegetarian. It eats only sea grass. Dugong can eat up to 88 pounds of seaweed daily.\nBefore swallowing of the sea grass, dugong will shake its head to eliminate sand from the food.\nDugong breathes using the lungs. It needs to reach the surface of the water every six minute to breathe atmospheric oxygen.\nWhen dugong is located in the shallow water, it can \"stand\" on its tail with head above the water's surface.\nDugong can live on its own, in pairs or in larger groups. When in the group, dugong uses various sounds to communicate. Most often they use barks, chirp-squeaks and trills.\nDugong is not a very fast swimmer. It normally swims 6 miles per hour, but it can accelerate to 14 miles per hour when needed.\nDugong has very dense and heavy bones which hold the animal submerged under water. Lungs are positioned along the back and they keep dugong in horizontal position during swimming.\nMale dugong will develop tusks during puberty, at age between 12 and 15 years. Females usually do not have visible tusks.\nMain predators of dugong are killer whales, sharks and crocodiles. Bigger threat to their survival is associated with negative human activity.\nDugong reaches sexual maturity between 9th and 15th year. Males establish and protect their courtship territory. Pregnancy lasts one year and ends with one calf. Female give birth every 3 to 7 years.\nBond between mother and the calf is very strong. Mother helps baby to reach the surface of the water for its first breath. Calf stays with mother usually until the age of 18 months."}

With their massive claws, they hollow out an impressive system of tunnels and chambers underneath soft, moist soil. These complex underground labyrinths provide defensive protection, a source of food, and an entire home for the mole. This is critical to moles\u2019 survival, because they are otherwise defenseless animals against humans and predators. It has proven to be a remarkably successful survival strategy that enables the moles to flourish around the world.\nAn Incredible Animal: 4 Mole Facts\nDuring the Middle Ages, the English word for the mole was actually moldwarp. This has its origins in a Germanic word possibly meaning earth thrower . The term \u201cmountain out of a molehill\u201d probably originated later from the English Tudor period around the 1500s.\n. The term \u201cmountain out of a molehill\u201d probably originated later from the English Tudor period around the 1500s. These creatures have sometimes been hunted for their short, soft coat of fur. In order to make it easier for the mole to move around in the tunnels, this fur can bend in any direction .\n. The star-nosed mole is perhaps the strangest looking species of moles. To give you an idea of what it looks like, you should picture 22 tentacle-like structures jutting out from the nose. These tentacles make the star-nosed mole extremely sensitive to vibrations and electricity produced by prey.\nand electricity produced by prey. They can dig about 15 to 18 feet of tunnels in an hour.\nMole Scientific Name\nMole, as a term, refers to any species in the family Talpidae (which simply means \u201cmole\u201d in Latin). The earliest of the species probably evolved in the Eocene Epoch some 34 to 55 million years ago somewhere in Europe and then spread out from there over the ensuing millions of years. There are some 42 species currently living in the world. These species are spread out among some 10 genera (the scientific classification between family and species). Together, the entire family is known as the true moles. This family belongs to the order Eulipotyphla, which also includes shrews and hedgehogs.\nIn addition to the true mole family, there are several species that resemble a mole but are not actually part of the mole lineage. One of them is the golden mole of sub-Saharan Africa. This family is actually part of an entirely separate order called Afrosoricida. Another is the marsupial mole of Australia. It is more closely related to other marsupials like kangaroos than the true mole counterparts. These creatures are an example of convergent evolution: two distinct lineages that evolved separately but adapted similar traits for related lifestyles. In this case, they separately evolved shovel-like paws, poor sight, and a long body. But there are many differences that attest to their separate lineages. The pouch of the marsupial mole is one example.\nMole: The Animal\u2019s Appearance and Behavior\nThe mole is an animal with a striking, distinctive appearance, well-adapted for its burrowing lifestyle. Its massive hands, short limbs, and sharp claws enable it to burrow through the ground with relative ease. These hands also sometimes make excellent paddles for swimming. What\u2019s really remarkable about the physical characteristics is that these huge forepaws contain two thumbs each. Whereas the other fingers have multiple joints, the thumbs are only composed of a single bone. This digital setup appears to be unique to this animal, because it is not a feature of the closely related shrews. Other interesting features of the mole include the small, beady eyes and the lack of visible external ear flaps. This is complemented by a short tail and a hairless pointed snout lined with whiskers. The long, flat body is covered in black or brown fuzzy fur as well.\nThis creature digs through the ground with a swift fore-and-aft motion, which resembles a swimming stroke. It will then push the loose soil to the surface, creating the well-known molehill. The mole has a much easier time digging in moist soil, though it can also churn through dry soil as well. The underground tunnels are quite complex, extending perhaps hundreds of feet in every direction and containing both storage and nesting areas. These chambers can exist a full 15 feet underground. When needed, the mole is a master of improvisation. It can create entirely new underground networks in a matter of hours.\nOndrej Prosicky/Shutterstock.com\nMoles spend the majority of their lives underground, only traveling to the surface to gather nest material and find water during droughts. It does almost everything else underground, including feeding and copulation. The mole has evolved unique hemoglobin (oxygen-carrying molecules) in the blood to survive long periods of low oxygen while underground. They are active in both day and night during short spurts of wakefulness in between intervals of sleep.\nThe mole family is an incredibly diverse bunch that has evolved unique characteristics to cope with the various ecosystems in which it resides. For instance, the American, Asia, and Japanese shrew moles have long tails, external ear flaps, and smaller hands. They spend more time above ground than the typical mole. Some species of Russian moles, on the other hand, are amphibious creatures with webbed feet, water-repellent fur, long tails, and closable facial openings to prevent water from entering. They still nest in burrows but come out to forage underwater for their food. Finally, the European mole has the ability to construct a large mound above ground, composed of nearly 2,000 pounds of soil. This formidable structure contains the same network of tunnels and rooms as a normal underground burrow.\nThese creatures differ quite a bit in terms of size too. The American shrew mole is the smallest of the species. Its body measures less than 2 inches and weighs no more than an ounce. The largest species is the Russian desman, which measures up to 9 inches and weighs nearly 8 ounces. The typical mole species is somewhere in between these two extremes. It measures about 6 inches long and weighs about 4 ounces, or less than the size of a chipmunk. Males are called boars, while females are called sows. The sexes are very similar in size and appearance, but female anatomy may undergo significant changes during the breeding season.\nThe mole compensates for its poor vision with a powerful sense of hearing and touch. The hairs on the snout and claws are capable of sensing the surrounding environment with remarkable detail. The mole also communicates via scent glands by marking its territory as a warning against outside intruders. The mole is a solitary creature that will aggressively defend its territory from any perceived threats. A group of moles, which is called a labour, may come together at certain times of the year for the breeding season. Some moles are also known to take over an absent neighboring burrow when given the opportunity.\nMole: The Animal\u2019s Habitat\nThe mole family is present on every major continent except for Antarctica. It prefers temperate ecosystems with moist or loose soil, including prairies, floodplains, forests, coastal dunes, wetlands, gardens, cultivated fields, and lowland or alpine meadows. In warmer climates, the mole is primarily restricted to the cooler mountainous habitats. Given its massive range, this species is a very diverse family with lots of different physical characteristics, habitats, and survival strategies.\nMole Diet: What does the Animal Eat?\nThe mole\u2019s favorite food is earthworm, insects, and other small invertebrate. This is supplemented with seeds, roots, tubers, fungi, and small mammals. Some species have specialized diet requirements. In the case of some amphibious moles, they will also eat fish and amphibians. The mole has a special toxin in its saliva that immobilizes prey so it can store and consume the meat at a later time. The creature can consume its entire body weight in food every single day to support its energy-intensive digging habits.\nMole Predators and Threats\nThe small and defenseless moles are often preyed upon by foxes, coyotes, weasels, snakes, hawks, and owls. Because the moles are so vulnerable above ground, the burrow provides a natural defense against most predators. However, this may not save the mole from predators with a very good ability for digging.\nHabitat loss isn\u2019t too much of a problem for this group. Because moles prefer agriculture and gardens, they have adapted very well to human habitats. However, this also singles them out as annoying pests that can disrupt or ruin crops, even as they sometimes consume other insects and pests as well. This brings to mind images of uprooted plants and piles of soil. Many moles end up hunted or poisoned by humans to prevent this kind of damage. A more humane strategy is to release noxious chemicals to drive them away or catch them in traps and transport them elsewhere. Usually, though it is not the crops and plants they are consuming, but rather the worms and insects near those crops. The plants are mere casualties of the mole\u2019s intense foraging behavior.\nMole: The Animal\u2019s Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nMost of the species have a single breeding season that lasts throughout the spring months. Much of the action occurs underground, beginning with the search for an appropriate mate. Males will travel up to half a mile to look for a female\u2019s burrow. If no existing tunnel is available to connect the respective burrows, then the males may dig entirely new tunnels.\nAfter copulation, the female is largely left alone to rear the young by herself without any help from the male. She carries the children for approximately a month and then produces a litter of three to five young at a time. These pups are born hairless and blind in a nest of dry vegetation, but they grow and develop rapidly toward maturity after only a few months of life.\nThe mother will fully wean her pups after about a month. They will then leave the nest and begin to seek their independence shortly afterward. This is the time they are most vulnerable to predators. If they survive, then the young are ready to reproduce the following spring after their birth. The typical lifespan of a mole is only about three years in the wild.\nSebastjan Medved/Shutterstock.com\nMole Population\nBased on conservation estimates, the mole family as a whole appears to be a picture of excellent health. According to the IUCN Red List, which tracks the conservation status of numerous species, these creatures are mostly listed as being of least concern. However, there are several exceptions, including the Etigo mole of Japan and the Russian desman (both endangered), the vulnerable Pyrenean desman of Spain, and the near threatened Sado mole of Japan. It is not entirely clear how many moles are currently living, but many populations appear to be stable, though some are decreasing in number.\nView all 111 animals that start with M"}

No other large animal of this size has the same ability. As the national symbol of Australia, the kangaroo adorns a coat of arms, coins, and even the logos of sports teams and organizations. It has adapted very well to the presence of humans.\n5 Incredible Kangaroo Facts!\nThe name kangaroo was adapted into English from the aboriginal term ganguru. This was a Guugu Yimithirr word that specifically referred to the eastern grey kangaroo.\nDespite their important status in the Australian culture, these animals are still harvested for their skin and meat. These body parts are made into rugs, clothing, and even pet food.\nLike many grazing animals, the kangaroo breaks down vegetation via microbes in the gut. This fermentation process normally releases huge amounts of methane into the atmosphere when the animal burps, exhales or farts. It\u2019s actually believed that kangaroos produce less methane than other grazing animals, though how much less, and for what reason, is an open question.\nThe evidence suggests that marsupials may have evolved the hopping ability some 20 million years ago, but it wasn\u2019t until the expansion of grasslands across Australia some 3 to 5 million years ago that kangaroos really began to spread.\nA giant short-faced kangaroo, which weighed some 500 pounds, once prowled the continent. The facts suggest that it was too large to hop, but probably shuffled around on its two feet. They went extinct around the same time humans first arrived in Australia.\nKangaroo Scientific Name\nThe kangaroo is formally defined as several large, hopping marsupials in the genus Macropus. This scientific name derives from the word macropod, which means \u201clarge foot\u201d in Latin. The four main species in this classification are the red kangaroo, western gray kangaroo, eastern gray kangaroo, and antilopine kangaroo. The black wallaroo and common wallaroo are also sometimes considered to be a true kangaroo as well. The wallaby is not considered to be a true kangaroo, but it\u2019s similar enough to be a member of the same genus classification, Macropus. All of these species are part of the same family, which goes by the scientific name of Macropodidae.\nKangaroo vs. Wallaby\nThe difference between a kangaroo, wallaroo, and a wallaby mostly comes down to size. Kangaroos are the largest members of the genus, while the wallabies are the smallest. Wallaroos, as the name implies, have an intermediate size between the kangaroo and the wallaby. Otherwise, their anatomy is fairly similar.\nKangaroo Appearance\nThis animal\u2019s most important anatomical feature is the exceptionally long hind legs. These legs are specifically adapted for bipedal hopping at distances up to 30 feet and a height of up to 10 feet. The animal has a unique arrangement of digits. Each hind foot consists of four individual toes, but only the big toe bears most of the animal\u2019s weight. The second and third toe are actually fused together and highly reduced. The kangaroo\u2019s hands have five digits and sharp claws. They are somewhat similar to human arms, but they lack opposable thumbs.\nThese animals also have a unique body shape to match its lifestyle. The body is defined by the big, arched back and a comparatively small head that ends in a sleek snout and big rounded ears. Another important feature is the long, thick tail, which serves as a kind of third leg to help it properly balance on the ground. The kangaroo\u2019s coat color can vary between a rusty red and bluish-grey.\nThese animals take the crown as the world\u2019s largest marsupial. Depending on the species, it stands about 3 to 7 feet tall and weighs 40 to 200 pounds. Females (also known as jills or does) are slightly smaller compared with the males (which are called jacks or boomers). Females also have a forward-opening pouch with four teats.\nBreathes/Shutterstock.com\nKangaroo Behavior\nThe kangaroo is a highly social animal that likes to congregate in groups of between 10 and 100 individuals at a time, which are known as mobs, troops, or herds. The most common social arrangement involves a group of females, their offspring, and one or more males. However, since individuals can move around independently, these mobs only have a loose organization. The primary benefit is that groups offer protection and security for all of their members. An individual can signal for the presence of danger by beating its tail against the ground.\nThese animals have numerous other ways to communicate with each other. These include eye contact, sniffing, touching, and vocalizations. They will seek to avoid confrontation when they can, but both males and females may fight each other for limited resources. The familiar boxing behavior for which they are known is a male-only competition to determine who gets access to females. These matches take a ritualized form in which one male issue a challenge and the other male can accept or decline. The males will lock arms, push each other, and kick out while standing on the tail.\nThe kangaroo is a very fast and agile animal that can achieve a top speed of about 40 mph and a consistent speed of around 20 to 25 mph. Because of its powerful leg muscles and big tail, the kangaroo actually expends less energy at this moderate cruising speed than at slower speeds. This allows it to outlast predators who may grow weary of the chase.\nKangaroos have the ability to feed at all hours of the day. However, they are most active at night or in other periods of low light. Most individuals stay within a well-defined home range and don\u2019t move around too much except when they\u2019re pursued.\nKangaroo Habitat\nThe kangaroo is found exclusively in Australia, Tasmania, and the surrounding islands. Each species has a different geographical range. The red kangaroo, which has the widest range, can be found all over the open plains of inland Australia. The eastern and western grey kangaroo species are found in the east and west, respectively. The antilopine kangaroo occupies the northern part of the country.\nKangaroos can live in a wide variety of different habitats, including grasslands, savannas, and bushlands with sparse woods or no trees at all. They are well-adapted for life in hot, dry conditions and can survive for long periods of time without water.\nKangaroo Diet\nThe kangaroo has an herbivorous diet, which is reflected in its highly specialized anatomy. Like a cow, it has a multi-chambered stomach that allows it to digest tough plant material and draw out the nutrients. The kangaroo also has the ability to regurgitate the food and chew it again to completely break down the material. The kangaroo\u2019s sharp incisors are specialized for cutting vegetation close to the ground, while the flatter molars are specialized for grinding up the vegetation.\nWhat does the kangaroo eat?\nThe kangaroo\u2019s diet largely consists of grass, shrubs, and many different types of flowering plants.\nKangaroo Predators and Threats\nThese animals are hunted by both people and other animals. They have been used as food and resources since people first arrived on the island some tens of thousands of years ago. Even today, many thousands of kangaroos are hunted and culled every year. Despite a large number of kangaroos killed, this has had minimal effect on their conservation status. In fact, like deer in the United States, kangaroo hunting is regulated and even encouraged as a way to control wild population numbers.\nWhat eats the kangaroo?\nA fully grown adult kangaroo has few natural predators in the wild. However, dingoes, feral cats, foxes, and raptors, many of which have been introduced by humans over the millennia, do sometimes feed on juveniles or dead kangaroos.\nKangaroo Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nThe kangaroo is not limited to a single established breeding season. Instead, it can choose to mate at any time throughout the year as circumstances dictate. This means it is more likely to reproduce when resources are particularly bountiful. Kangaroos engage in a brief courtship period but do not form long-term pair bonds after copulation. Since reproduction is a bit of a free for all, males compete with each other to monopolize access to females. The male plays no other role in the development of the young.\nAfter a month-long gestation period, the young joey is born hairless, helpless, and completely blind, measuring no more than an inch in size. The first thing it does is crawl into the mother\u2019s pouch and attach it to her teat. It remains there for 120 to 400 days. Even after it emerges from the pouch, the young kangaroo will remain with its mother for another year and a half, growing to its adult size.\nIf resources are particularly plentiful, then the mother has the ability to take care of three offspring at the same time: the undeveloped embryo, the joey inside of the pouch, and a joey outside of the pouch. The embryo can enter a dormant state, known as diapause, for as long as necessary until the other baby has left the pouch. The mother\u2019s anatomy is specifically adapted to deal with this. She has the ability to produce two different types of milk, one for the newborn joey and one for the larger juvenile. This allows her to maximize the number of offspring she can raise at one time. It may help the kangaroo recover quickly from long periods of drought, during which time reproduction is suspended to conserve resources for the mother.\nIf the joey\u2019s development goes smoothly, then it can expect to reach sexual maturity within the first two years of age. The life expectancy of the typical kangaroo is around 20 years in the wild, though some individuals have been known to live longer.\nKangaroo Population\nAccording to the IUCN Red List, the current classification of the four kangaroo species, plus the common wallaroo, is least concern. Only the black wallaroo is considered to be near threatened. The best population estimates suggest that tens of millions of kangaroos roam across Australia.\nKangaroos in the Zoo\nThe San Diego Zoo is one of the major destinations in the United States for both red and gray kangaroos and several wallaby species. Their Walkabout Australia section, which opened at the Safari Park in 2018, allows visitors to walk along the pathways among the grassy habitat and get an up-close view of the animals. Other major destinations include the Denver Zoo, Saint Louis Zoo, Detroit Zoo, Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden, Philadelphia Zoo, Dallas Zoo, San Francisco Zoo, Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, and much more.\nView all 43 animals that start with K"}

Although the Indian rhinoceros is still under threat today, its numbers have rebounded to the point it\u2019s no longer endangered.\nIncredible Indian Rhino Facts!\nOnce numbering fewer than 100 individuals, today the great one-horned rhinoceros has seen its population rebound to the point it\u2019s no longer endangered but listed as \u2018Vulnerable.\u2019\nAlso known as the greater one-horned rhinoceros, the Indian rhino is the largest rhinoceros species in Asia and can weigh up to 3,000 kg (6,600 lbs)!\nThe Indian rhino was brought to Europe during the Renaissance in 1515! Artwork of the animal was mass produced across Europe and has been hailed as \u201cthe most influential animal picture ever.\u201d\nIndian Rhinoceros Scientific Name\nThe scientific name for the Indian rhinoceros is Rhinoceros unicornis. The genus Rhinoceros is Greek for \u2018nose\u2019 and \u2018horn\u2019 and comprises the two species of one-horned rhinos, the Indian and Javan rhinoceros.Unicornis is latin and means one-horned.\nIndian Rhino Appearance\nThe Indian rhino is the second largest rhinoceros species after the white rhino, weighing 2,200 to 3,000 kg (4,900 to 6,600 lbs). At its shoulders, it stands 1.7 to 2 meters (5.6 to 6.6 ft).\nAll rhino species have thick skin that forms a natural \u201carmor\u201d across their bodies, but the skin of the Indian rhinoceros has a unique appearance where flexible skin folds give the look of armor plates across its body.\nIn addition, the Indian rhino has distinctive bumps that can cover its legs, shoulders, and hindquarters.\nGreater one-horned rhinoceros\nA common name for the Indian rhino is the \u2018greater one-horned rhinoceros.\u2019 In historic times, the range of the Indian rhinoceros overlapped with a subspecies of the Javan rhinoceros, a species of rhino that also has one horn but is smaller than the Indian rhinoceros. Thus, the Javan rhino was often distinguished as the \u2018lesser one-horned rhinoceros.\u2019\nToday, the Javan rhino subspecies that used to live across parts of India and Southeast Asia is extinct (although Javan rhinos still survive in Indonesia), but the name \u2018greater one-horned rhinoceros\u2019 is still commonly used for Indian rhinos.\nThe Indian rhino\u2019s horn is generally less than a foot (30 cm) in length, although it has reached record sizes of up to 23 inches (57 cm).\nIndian Rhino Habitat\nHistorically, the Indian rhinoceros had a vast range across northern India but today that range has been drastically reduced due to excessive hunting. The Indian rhinoceros is now confined to the tall grasslands and forests that surround the Himalayas Mountain range.\nGrasslands the Indian rhino live in includes the Terai-Duar grasslands, which are among the tallest in the world. The region\u2019s \u2018elephant grass\u2019 can reach up to 22 ft (7 m), tall enough to provide cover even for a species the Indian rhino\u2019s size.\nIndian Rhino Population \u2014 How Many Indian Rhinos Are Left?\nIts estimated that fewer than 100 Indian rhinos were left at the beginning of the 20thcentury. Across the 20th century populations rebounded, and as of 2019, an estimated 3,600 individuals live in the wild.\nThe rebound in Indian rhino populations has been strong enough that as of 2008, the species is no longer listed as Endangered. Instead, Indian rhinos are listed as Vulnerable despite having a lower population than the Critically Endangered black rhinoceros.\nDespite its increasing populations, Indian rhinos continue to face several threats. For example, the majority of Indian rhinos \u2013 2,413 individuals as of 2018 \u2013 live in India\u2019s Kaziranga National Park. This concentration means a disease could take a significant toll on this concentrated population.\nIndian Rhino Diet\nThe Indian rhino lives across a fertile plain that has abundant tall-grass it consumes for the majority of its diet. Indian rhinos are herbivorous animals, and in addition to grass will also browse the densely vegetated sub-tropical forest for leaves, flowers, buds, fruits, berries and roots which they dig up from the ground using their horns.\nIndian Rhino Predators\nDue to its large size, the Indian rhino\u2019s only real predator in the wild are large wild cats such as tigers that will prey on the Indian rhino calves and weak individuals. Humans are the biggest threat to the Indian rhinoceros as they have been hunted to the brink of extinction for their horns.\nIndian Rhino Reproduction and Life Cycles\nThe Indian rhinoceros is a solitary animal and only comes together with other Indian rhinos to mate. The female Indian rhinoceros gives birth to a single calf after a gestation period that is over a year long (about 15-16 months). The Indian rhinoceros calf remains with its mother until it is at least 2 years old and big enough to become independent.\nIndian Rhinos in Zoos\nAs of 2018, 67 zoos were home to 182 Indian rhinos. In total, there are 1,037 different rhinos of differing species across the worlds zoos.\nSelect zoos where you can see an Indian rhino in person!\nZoo Miami: Welcomed a new Indian rhino calf on May 1, 2019.\nCincinnati: Once home to the Sumatran rhino, today the Cincinnati Zoo houses an Indian rhino named \u2018Manjula.\u2019\nSan Diego Safari Park: Welcomed a calf Indian rhino to its Savanna field exhibit in August, 2019.\nIndian Rhino Facts\nDurer\u2019s Rhinoceros\nIn 1515 an Indian rhinoceros was sent to the King of Portugal in Lisbon. The exotic animal was shocking at the time, and a woodcut created by a German painter went on to be mass produced across Europe. Unfortunately, the Indian rhino soon thereafter drowned, when a boat bringing it to the Pope was lost at sea.\nHow do you count Indian rhinos? On the backs of elephants! Two-thirds of Indian rhinos live in Kaziranga National Park. Every three years a census is conducted to see if the population of Indian rhinos in this vital park continues to grow. To count the rhinos, officials rode 40 elephants in addition to sports vehicles.\nPoaching remains a threat, but\u2026 While poaching remains a threat, in 2015 Kaziranga National Park guards shot dead more would-be poachers than rhinos were shot. The relative protection from poaching is one of the reasons Indian rhinos are no longer listed as Endangered.\nView all 27 animals that start with I"}

Learn what they eat, how far sloths can extend their tongue, where they live, why sloths move so slowly and lots more interesting information. Read on and check out our cool trivia about sloths.\nSloths are a medium-sized mammal. There are two types of sloth the two-toed sloth and the three-toed sloth, they are classified into six different species.\nAll sloths actually have three toes, but the two-toed sloth has only two fingers.\nSloths are part of the order Pilosa so they are related to anteaters and armadillos.\nSloths are tree-dwelling animals, they are found in the jungles of Central and South America.\nA sloth's body is usually 50 to 60 cm long. Skeletons of now extinct species of sloth suggest some varieties used to be as large as elephants.\nSloths mainly eat the tree buds, new shoots, fruit and leaves, of the Cecropia tree. Some two-toed sloths also eat insects, small reptiles, and birds.\nSloths have a four-part stomach that very slowly digests the tough leaves they eat, it can sometimes take up to a month for them to digest a meal. Digesting this diet means a sloth has very little energy left to move around making it one of the slowest moving animals in the world.\nSloths can move along the ground at just 2 m (6.5 ft) per minute! In the trees they are slightly quicker at 3 m (10 ft) per minute.\nThe slow-movement and unique thick fur of the sloth make it a great habitat for other creatures such as moths, beetles, cockroaches, fungi, and algae. In fact, this green colored algae provides a camouflage so sloths can avoid predators.\nSloths can extend their tongues 10 to 12 inches out of their mouths.\nThe sloth has very long, sharp, and strong claws that they use to hold on to tree branches. The claws are also their only natural defense against predators.\nSloths usually only leave the tree they live in to go to the toilet once a week on the ground. This is when they are most vulnerable to being attacked by their main predators such as jaguars, the harpy eagle and snakes.\nTwo-toed sloths are nocturnal, being most active at night. While three-toed sloths are diurnal which means they are most active during the day.\nIt used to be thought sloths slept for 15 to 20 hours a day. However, its now believed they only sleep around 10 hours a day.\nIn the wild, sloths live on average 10 - 16 years and in captivity over 30 years."}

But there is much more to these animals and their behavior! Keep reading to learn more facts about these amazing animals.\n5 Amazing Dolphin Facts!\nThese animals are social and typically live in groups called pods. Most pods have up to 30 individuals, but superpods of more than 1,000 dolphins have been observed!\nNot all of them live in ocean habitats. There are a few remaining species of river dolphins \u2013 one of them is pink in color!\nThey have been known to help or protect humans, often by scaring away sharks.\nBeginning in the 1960s, these animals were trained for military purposes such as locating and collecting lost objects, delivering items to divers, guarding vessels, or holding a surveillance camera in their mouths. The program ended in the 1990s, and some of the retired animals began working with children as therapy animals.\nThese animals show self-awareness in that they are able to recognize themselves and experience individuality. Only a few animals \u2013 apes, elephants, dolphins, and toothed whales \u2013 demonstrate this trait.\nWhere to Find Dolphins\nThese animals can be found in all of the world\u2019s oceans, and they are especially prominent in coastal areas. Five species live in brackish habitats or freshwater river systems in South America or Asia.\nScientific Names\nThe common name \u201cdolphin\u201d comes from the Greek delphis, meaning \u201cwomb.\u201d Even these ancient observers realized dolphins\u2019 classification as mammals, or animals with a womb.

Many die each year after becoming entangled in fishing nets.\nWhat Eats Dolphins?\nSharks and orcas may opportunistically prey on juveniles.\nReproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nThese animals typically give birth to just one offspring, but twins and triplets have been observed. The infant feeds on milk, and the mothers train and care for their babies for several years. Dolphins typically live 10-20 years in the wild.\nDolphin Intelligence\nDolphins have brains that are larger than human brains and are among the most intelligent species on Earth. They possess surprisingly complex communication. Yet, they\u2019re not as smart as humans. What are the key differences between human brains and dolphin brains? One difference is that dolphin brains have a relatively small prefrontal cortex and a smaller hippocampus. These smaller areas on the brain lead to dolphins having less higher-level thinking and memory when compared to humans. Yet, dolphins are still perhaps the second most intelligent species on Earth.\nPopulation\nThe most common species number into the hundreds of thousands or even millions. The most endangered species, the Irrawaddy dolphin, has only 92 known individuals.\nView all 58 animals that start with D"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "7 Facts About Elephants and Why They Don\u2019t Belong in Captivity", "url": "https://www.worldanimalprotection.us/blogs/facts-about-elephants", "text": "Facts about elephants and why they don\u2019t belong in captivity:\nThere are three species of elephants.\nIt\u2019s true! While most people assume there are only two\u2014Asian and African\u2014there are actually three: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Forest elephants are smaller than bush elephants at about half the size and their tusks are straighter and downward pointing while African bush elephants have more curved tusks. Both evolved from a common ancestor and have distinctly different DNA.\nEars are the easiest way to tell elephant species apart.\nOne of the things I learned in grade school is that one of the easiest ways to tell a species of elephant apart is from the shape of their ears. Both forest and bush African elephants have ears resembling the geometry of Africa while Asian elephants have ears that resemble the geometric shape of continental Asia. Asian elephants have significantly smaller ears than their African counterparts.\nAfrican elephants are the largest land mammals.\nThe African elephants species can reach a staggering 13 feet tall at shoulder height. To put it in perspective, Asian elephants can reach about 10 feet tall and are a minimum height of 6.8 feet. In relation to humans, the tallest man on record is Sultan K\u00f6sen who grew to be 8 foot, 2 inches. African elephants are just about twice the size of Michael Jordan!\nAbout one-third of Asian elephants live in captivity.\nAs Asian elephant populations decrease (they\u2019re listed as endangered by IUCN), the numbers of elephants in captivity continue to rise for various exploitative industries. In the US, Asian elephants have been used in circuses like the now defunct Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey, Cole Bros. Circus, and Shiners (which still continues to travel and perform). In Thailand, these elephants are being used for riding, bathing, for selfies, and in the logging industry. World Animal Protection is working to end elephant entertainment through legislation in the US and by transforming commercial Thai venues to stop all direct contact interactions.\nMost illegal ivory comes from African elephants.\nNearly 35,000 African elephants are poached for their tusks each year for traditional Chinese medicine. While Asian elephants are still poached for their tusks, all species are at risk for poaching due to demand for their skin, which is fashioned into jewelry. Conservation organizations estimate nearly 100 elephants are poached each day. Most tuskers are male, with the largest tusks being targeted for the most ivory. However, most recently tuskers have been found with smaller tusks either as a protective evolutionary trait or because larger males have been poached out of the gene pool.\nElephants suffer in captivity.\nElephants in the wild have one of the largest home ranges, often walking up to 40 miles each day. In captivity, whether it\u2019s a circus, zoo, or other commercial venue, captivity can not nearly replicate their natural environment. Unlike dogs and cats, working alongside, breeding, and interacting with elephants has not changed their behaviors and they remain wild (undomesticated). This means that trainers have to implement painful and traumatizing techniques, such as \u201cthe crush\u201d to force the captive elephants to obey.\nHow can we protect elephants?\nOne of the most important things we can do to protect elephants is to refuse to participate in activities where direct contact of wild animals takes place. Bathing, riding, feeding, or simply touching an elephant means that the animal had to endure being torn from its mother\u2019s side, tied down, and beaten with sharp weapons called a bullhook in order to make it submit to human interaction.\nWe can also take action by reporting illegal ivory sold in shops where there is a ban in place to the proper authorities, decreasing the social acceptance of ivory, and working to protect their natural habitats."}

They are both revered in religion and respected for their prowess in war. They also have negative connotations such as being a symbol for an unnecessary burden. Ever since the Stone Age, when elephants were represented by ancient petroglyphs and cave art, they have been portrayed in various forms of art, including pictures, sculptures, music, film, and even architecture.\nReligion, mythology and philosophy [ edit ]\nThe Asian elephant appears in various religious traditions and mythologies. They are treated positively and are sometimes revered as deities, often symbolising strength and wisdom. Similarly, the African elephant is seen as the wise chief who impartially settles disputes among the forest creatures in African fables, and the Ashanti tradition holds that they are human chiefs from the past.\nThe Earth is supported and guarded by mythical World Elephants at the compass points of the cardinal directions, according to the Hindu cosmology of ancient India. The classical Sanskrit literature also attributes earthquakes to the shaking of their bodies when they tire. Wisdom is represented by the elephant in the form of the deity Ganesha, one of the most popular gods in the Hindu religion's pantheon. The deity is very distinctive in having a human form with the head of an elephant which was put on after the human head was either was cut off or burned, depending on the version of the story from various Hindu sources. Lord Ganesha's birthday (rebirth) is celebrated as the Hindu festival known as Ganesha Chaturthi. In Japanese Buddhism, their adaptation of Ganesha is known as Kangiten (\"Deva of Bliss\"), often represented as an elephant-headed male and female pair shown in a standing embrace to represent unity of opposites.\nIn Hindu iconography, many devas are associated with a mount or vehicle known as a v\u0101hana. In addition to providing a means of transport, they symbolically represent a divine attribute. The elephant v\u0101hana represents wisdom, divine knowledge and royal power; it is associated with Lakshmi, Brihaspati, Shachi and Indra. Indra was said to ride on a flying white elephant named Airavata, who was made the King of all elephants by Lord Indra. A white elephant is rare and given special significance. It is often considered sacred and symbolises royalty in Thailand and Burma, where it is also considered a symbol of good luck. In Buddhist iconography, the elephant is associated with Queen M\u0101y\u0101 of Sakya, the mother of Gautama Buddha. She had a vivid dream foretelling her pregnancy in which a white elephant featured prominently. To the royal sages, the white elephant signifies royal majesty and authority; they interpreted the dream as meaning that her child was destined for greatness as a universal monarch or a buddha.\nElephants remain an integral part of religion in South Asia and some are even featured in various religious practices. Temple elephants are specially trained captive elephants that are lavishly caparisoned and used in various temple activities. Among the most famous of the temple elephants is Guruvayur Keshavan of Kerala, India. They are also used in festivals in Sri Lanka such as the Esala Perahera.\nIn the version of the Chinese zodiac used in Northern Thailand, the last year in the 12-year cycle \u2013 called \"Year of the Pig\" in China \u2013 is known instead as \"Year of the Elephant\", reflecting the importance of elephants in Thai culture.\nIn Islamic tradition, the year 570 is when the Prophet Muhammad was born and is known as the Year of the Elephant. In that year, Abraha, ruler of Yemen tried to conquer Mecca and demolish the Kaaba, reportedly in retaliation for the previous Meccan defilement of Al\u2013Qalis Church in Sana'a, a cathedral Abraha had constructed. However, his plan was foiled when his white elephant named Mahmud refused to cross the boundary of Mecca. The elephant, who led Abraha's forty thousand men, could not be persuaded with reason or even with violence, which was regarded as a crucial omen by Abraha's soldiers. This is generally related in the five verses of the chapter titled 'The Elephant'[b] in the Quran.\nIn the Judeo-Christian tradition, medieval artists depicted the mutual killing of both Eleazar the Maccabee and a war elephant carrying an important Seleucid general as described in the apocryphal book of 1 Maccabees. The early illustrators knew little of the elephant and their portrayals are highly inaccurate.\nThe unfamiliarity with the exotic beast has also made elephants a subject of widely different interpretations thus giving rise to mythological creatures. The story of the blind men and an elephant was written to show how reality may be viewed from differing perspectives. The source of this parable is unknown, but it appears to have originated in India. It has been attributed to Buddhists, Hindus, Jainists, and Sufis, and was also used by Discordians. The scattered skulls of prehistoric dwarf elephants, on the islands of Crete and Sicily may have formed the basis of belief in existence of cyclopes,[c] the one-eyed giants featured in Homer's Odyssey (c. 800~600 BC). As early as the 1370s, scholars had noted that the skulls feature a large nasal cavity at the front that could be mistaken for a singular eye socket; and the skulls, twice the size of a human's, looked as if they could belong to giant humanoids. It is also suggested that the Behemoth described in the Book of Job may be the elephant due to its grazing habits and preference to rivers.\nIn art [ edit ]\nFrom Stone Age rock-art to Modern age street-art, the elephant has remained a popular subject for artists.\nPrehistoric [ edit ]\nPrehistoric North Africans depicted the elephant in Paleolithic age rock art. For example, the Libyan Tadrart Acacus, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, features a rock carving of an elephant from the last phase of the Pleistocene epoch (12,000\u20138000 BC) rendered with remarkable realism. There are many other prehistoric examples, including Neolithic rock art of south Oran (Algeria), and a white elephant rock painting in 'Phillip's Cave' by the San in the Erongo region of Namibia. From the Bovidian period[d] (3550\u20133070 BCE), elephant images by the San bushmen in the South African Cederberg Wilderness Area suggest to researchers that they had \"a symbolic association with elephants\" and \"had a deep understanding of the communication, behaviour and social structure of elephant family units\" and \"possibly developed a symbiotic relationship with elephants that goes back thousands of years.\"\nAncient [ edit ]\nIndian rock reliefs include a number of depictions of elephants, notably the Descent of the Ganges at Mahabalipuram, a large 7th-century Hindu scene with many figures that uses the form of the rock to shape the image. At Unakoti, Tripura there is an 11th-century group of reliefs related to Shiva, including several elephants.\nIndian painting includes many elephants, especially ones ridden for battle and royal transport in Mughal miniatures.\nModern [ edit ]\nElephants are often featured in modern artistic works, including those by artists such as Norman Rockwell, Andy Warhol and Banksy. The stork-legged elephant, found in many of Salvador Dal\u00ed's works,[e] is one of the surrealist's best known icons, and adorn the walls of the Dal\u00ed Museum in Spain. Dali used an elephant motif in various works such as Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening, The Elephants and in The Temptation of Saint Anthony. The Elephant and Obelisk motif also found its way to various works by this artist.\nPolitics and secular society [ edit ]\nThe elephant is also depicted by various political groups and in secular society.\nIn Asia [ edit ]\nAsian cultures admire the high intelligence and good memory of Asian elephants. As such, they symbolize wisdom and royal power. They are used as a representative of various political parties such as United National Party of Sri Lanka and Bahujan Samaj Party of India. The Elephants of Kerala are an integral part of the daily life in Kerala, South India. These Indian elephants are loved, revered, groomed and given a prestigious place in the state's culture. There they are often referred to as the 'sons of the sahya.' The elephant is the state animal of Kerala and is featured on the emblem of the Government of Kerala. The elephant is also on the flag of the Kingdom of Laos with three elephants visible, supporting an umbrella (another symbol of royal power) until it became a republic in 1975. Other Southeast Asian realms have also displayed one or more white elephants.\nThe elephant also lends its name to some landmarks in Asia. Elephanta Island (also called \"Gharapuri Island\") in Mumbai Harbour was given this name by 17th century Portuguese explorers who saw a monolithic basalt sculpture of an elephant near the entrance to what became known as the Elephanta Caves. The Portuguese attempted to take it home with them but ended up dropping it into the sea because their chains were not strong enough. Later, the British moved this elephant to the Victoria and Albert Museum (now Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum) in Mumbai.\nIn Europe [ edit ]\nAside from being a curiosity for Europeans, the elephant also became a symbol of military might from the experience of fighting foreign powers that fielded war elephants throughout history. In 326 BC after Alexander the Great's victory over King Porus of India, the captured war elephants became a symbol of imperial power, being used as an emblem of the Seleucid Diadoch empire.\nIn about the year 800 AD, an elephant called Abul-Abbas was brought from Baghdad to Charlemagne's residence in Aachen as a symbol of the beginning of the Abbasid\u2013Carolingian alliance.\nCremona elephant 1229, after Matthew Paris from Chronica maiora Part II\nIn 1229, the so-called Cremona elephant was presented by Sultan of Egypt Al-Kamil to the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, and the elephant was used by the Emperor in parades. The elephant is mentioned in the visit of Frederick's brother-in-law Richard of Cornwall to Cremona in 1241, in the Chronica Maiora of Matthew Paris. The presence of the animal is also recorded in 1237 in the Cremona city annals.\nCollar of the Danish Order of the Elephant\nIn 1478, the Order of the Elephant (Danish: Elefantordenen) was founded by King Christian I. This very select religious organization is the highest order of Denmark, and uses the elephant as a symbol of docility, sobriety and piety; instituted in its current form in 1693 by King Christian V.\nIn the early 1800s Napoleon Bonaparte wanted a monument to his own imperial power, and he decreed that a colossal bronze elephant fountain be cast from guns captured at his victorious 1807 Battle of Friedland. This was intended for the site where the Bastille once stood.\nOne of the elephants shot for its meat at Paris in December 1870.\nIn 1870, the killing and eating of the elephants Castor and Pollux from the Botanical gardens during the Siege of Paris received considerable attention at the time. This became emblematic of the hardships and degradation caused by siege and war, especially since the two elephants were previously very popular with the Parisian public.\nThe city of Catania, Sicily has an immemorial connection with the elephant. The local sorcerer Heliodorus, was credited with either riding a magic elephant or transforming himself into this animal. Under medieval Arab rule Catania was known as Medinat-ul-Fil or Balad-ul-Fil (City/State of the Elephant). The symbol of the city is the Fontana dell'Elefante (Fountain of the Elephant) assembled in its present form in 1736 by Giovanni Battista Vaccarini.\nIn Central London, England, an area known as the \"Elephant and Castle\" (or \"The Elephant\") is centered on a major road intersection and a station of the London Underground. The \"Castle\" in the location's name refers to a medieval European perception of a howdah. The heraldic elephant and castle has also been associated with the city of Coventry, England since medieval times, where it denotes religious symbolism[f] and with the town of Dumbarton, Scotland.[g] More recently in Britain, Welephant, a red elephant cartoon character with a fireman's helmet, was originally used as a mascot by fire brigades in the United Kingdom to promote fire safety for children and has become the mascot for the Children's Burn Trust.\nIn America [ edit ]\nThe elephant as the symbol for the Republican Party of the United States originated in an 1874 political cartoon of an Asian elephant by Thomas Nast in Harper's Weekly. This cartoon, titled \"Third Term Panic\", is a parody of Aesop's fable,[h] \"The Ass in the Lion's Skin\". It depicts an elephant (labelled The Republican Vote) running toward a chasm of chaos; frightening a jackass[i] in a lion's skin (labelled Caesarism) which scatters animals representing various interests. Although Nast used the elephant seven more times to represent the \"Republican Vote\", he did not use it to represent the Republican Party until March 1884 in \"The Sacred Elephant\".\nIn Africa [ edit ]\nMany African cultures revere the African Elephant as a symbol of strength and power. It is also praised for its size, longevity, stamina, mental faculties, cooperative spirit, and loyalty. South Africa, uses elephant tusks in their coat of arms to represent wisdom, strength, moderation and eternity. The elephant is symbolically important to the nation of Ivory Coast (C\u00f4te d'Ivoire); the Coat of arms of Ivory Coast features an elephant head escutcheon as its focal point.\nIn the western African Kingdom of Dahomey (now part of Benin) the elephant was associated with the 19th century rulers of the Fon people, Guezo and his son Glele.[j] The animal is believed to evoke strength, royal legacy, and enduring memory as related by the proverbs: \"There where the elephant passes in the forest, one knows\" and \"The animal steps on the ground, but the elephant steps down with strength.\" Their flag depicted an elephant wearing a royal crown.\nPopular culture [ edit ]\nThe elephant has entered into popular culture through various idiomatic expressions and adages.\nThe phrase \"Elephants never forget\" refers to the belief that elephants have excellent memories. The variation \"Women and elephants never forget an injury\" originates from the 1904 book Reginald on Besetting Sins by British writer Saki.\nThis adage seems to have a basis in fact, as reported in Scientific American:\nRemarkable recall power, researchers believe, is a big part of how elephants survive. Matriarch elephants, in particular, hold a store of social knowledge that their families can scarcely do without, according to research conducted on elephants at Amboseli National Park in Kenya.\n\"Seeing the Elephant\" is a 19th-century Americanism denoting a world-weary experience; often used by soldiers, pioneers and adventurers to qualify new and exciting adventures such as the Civil War, the Oregon Trail and the California Gold Rush. A \"white elephant\" has become a term referring to an expensive burden, particularly when much has been invested with false expectations. The term 'white elephant sale' was sometimes used in Australia as a synonym for jumble sale. In the U.S., a White elephant gift exchange is a popular winter holiday party activity. The idiom Elephant in the room tells of an obvious truth that no one wants to discuss, alluding to the animal's size compared to a small space. \"Seeing pink elephants\" refers to a drunken hallucination and is the basis for the Pink Elephants on Parade sequence in the 1941 Disney animated feature, Dumbo. \"Jumbo\" has entered the English language as a synonym for \"large\".[k] Jumbo originally was the name of a huge elephant acquired by circus showman P. T. Barnum from the London Zoo in 1882. The name itself may have come from a West African[l] native word for \"elephant\".\nLiterature [ edit ]\nThe elephant is viewed in both positive and negative lights in similar fashion as humans in various forms of literature. In fact, Pliny the Elder praised the beast in his Naturalis Historia as one that is closest to a human in sensibilities. The elephant's different connotations clash in Ivo Andri\u0107's novella The Vizier's Elephant. Here the citizens of Travnik despise the young elephant who symbolises the cruelty of the unseen Vizier. However, the elephant itself is young and innocent despite unknowingly causing havoc due to youthful play. In the Tarzan novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Tantor is the generic term for \"elephant\" in the fictional simian Mangani language, but is associated with a particular elephant who eventually becomes Tarzan's faithful companion. Other elephant characters that are shown in a positive light include Jean de Brunhoff's Babar and Dr. Seuss' Horton. Jules Verne featured a steam-powered mechanical elephant in his 1880 novel The Steam House. In addition, the animal is depicted in its military use through the oliphaunts of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the alien invaders of Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle's 1985 science fiction novel, Footfall.\nNotable short stories featuring elephants include Rudyard Kipling's \"Toomai of the Elephants\" and \"The Elephant's Child\"; as well as Mark Twain's \"The Stolen White Elephant\". George Orwell wrote an allegorical essay, \"Shooting an Elephant\"; and in \"Hills Like White Elephants\", Ernest Hemingway used the allegorical white elephant, alluding to a pregnancy as an unwanted gift.\nThe animal is also seen in historical novels. The Elephant's Journey (Portuguese: A Viagem do Elefante, 2008) is a novel by Nobel laureate Jos\u00e9 Saramago. This is a fictional account based on an historical 16th century journey from Lisbon to Vienna by an elephant named Solomon. An Elephant for Aristotle is a 1958 historical novel by L. Sprague de Camp. It concerns the adventures of a Thessalian cavalry commander who has been tasked by Alexander the Great to bring an elephant captured from King Porus of India, to Athens as a present for Alexander's old tutor, Aristotle.\nElephants can also represent the hugeness and wildness of the imagination, as in Ursula Dubosarsky's 2012 children's book, Too Many Elephants in This House, which also plays with the notion of the elephant in the room. An imaginary elephant can (perhaps) become real, as with the elusive Heffalump. Although never specified as an elephant in A. A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh stories, a heffalump physically resembles an elephant; and E. H. Shepard's illustration shows an Indian elephant. \"Heffalump\" has since been defined as \"a child's term for an elephant.\"\nSports [ edit ]\nThe elephant is used as a mascot or logo for various sports groups.\nCircus showman P. T. Barnum donated the stuffed hide of Jumbo the elephant to Tufts University in 1885, where Jumbo soon became the mascot for their sports teams. However, all that remains of Jumbo are some ashes stored in a peanut butter jar and a piece of his tail following a fire in 1975. \"Jumbo's spirit lives on\" in the peanut butter jar which is ceremoniously passed on to successive athletic directors.\nThe mascot for the Oakland Athletics baseball team is based on the figurative white elephant. The story of picking the mascot began when New York Giants' manager John McGraw told reporters that Philadelphia manufacturer Benjamin Shibe, who owned the controlling interest in the new team, had a \"white elephant on his hands\"; manager Connie Mack defiantly adopted the white elephant as the team mascot.[m] The A's are sometimes, but infrequently, referred to as the 'Elephants' or 'White Elephants'. Their mascot is nicknamed Stomper.\nUniversity of Alabama's Crimson Tide mascot has been an elephant since 1930 after a sportswriter wrote of a fan yelling \"Hold your horses, the elephants are coming!\" as the football team rumbled onto the field. Their elephant-costumed \"Big Al\" officially debuted at the 1979 Sugar Bowl.\nCatania, Italy uses the elephant to represent their football team, referencing the animal that has represented their city since ancient times.\nThe crest of Kerala Blasters FC, an Indian association football club is designed around an elephant holding football. Elephants are the state animal of Kerala and have a main role in their culture. They are considered as symbol of unity, power, and pride. The crest of the club symbolises the heritage, culture, spirit, and passion of Kerala, and its love for football.\nMusic [ edit ]\nThe elephant is also represented in music such as Henry Mancini's hit song \"Baby Elephant Walk\", which has been described as \"musical shorthand for kookiness of any stripe\". The American band the White Stripes' fourth album was entitled Elephant in honour of the animal's brute strength and closeness to its relatives. The hit single \"Elephant\" by British recording artist Alexandra Burke is based on the expression \"elephant in the room\". \"Nellie the Elephant\" is a children's song first released in 1956 and since covered by many artists including the punk-rock band Toy Dolls; For her album, Leave Your Sleep, Natalie Merchant set to music \"The Blind Men and the Elephant\" poem by John Godfrey Saxe, which is based on the parable.\nFilm and television [ edit ]\nThe elephant is also featured in film and on television. Thailand has produced various movies about the animal, from the 1940 historical drama film King of the White Elephant to the 2005 martial-arts action film, Tom-Yum-Goong.[n] In the West, the elephant was popularised by Dumbo, the elephant who learns to fly in the 1941 Disney animated feature of the same name. Kipling's \"Toomai of the Elephants\" was adapted as the 1937 British adventure film Elephant Boy. In popular modern films, Tai the elephant-actress has portrayed Bo Tat in Operation Dumbo Drop (1995), Vera in Larger than Life (1996), and Rosie in Water for Elephants (2011). Elephants have also been featured in the modern live action Disney movies Whispers: An Elephant's Tale (2000) and the 2019 remake of Dumbo.\nOn television, Nellie the Elephant is a 1990 UK cartoon series inspired by the 1956 song of the same name, featuring Scottish singer Lulu voicing Nelly. Britt Allcroft adapted \"Mumfie\" the elephant from Katherine Tozer's series of children's books,[o] originally in a '70s televised puppet show and then in the '90s animated Magic Adventures of Mumfie series.\nThe 2016 action-comedy film The Brothers Grimsby gained notoriety for its crude and graphic elephant scene.\nGames [ edit ]\nThe elephant can also be found in games. In shatranj, the medieval game from which chess developed, the piece corresponding to the modern bishop was known as Pil or Alfil (\"Elephant\"; from Persian and Arabic,[p] respectively). In the Indian chaturanga game the piece is also called \"Elephant\" (Gaja). The same is true in Chinese chess,[q] which has an elephant piece (\"Xi\u00e0ng\", \u8c61) that serves as a defensive piece, being the only one that may not cross the river dividing the game board. In the Japanese shogi version, the piece was known as the \"Drunken Elephant\"; however, it was dropped by order of the Emperor Go-Nara and no longer appears in the version played in contemporary Japan. Even with modern Chess, the word for the bishop is still Alfil in Spanish, Alfiere in Italian, Feel in Persian, and \"Elephant\" (\u0421\u043b\u043e\u043d) in Russian. All of these games originally simulated a kind of battlefield, thus this piece represented a war elephant. In the present-day canonical Staunton chess set, the piece's deep groove, which originally represented the elephant's tusks, is now regarded as representing a bishop's mitre.\nArchitecture [ edit ]\nIn the 18th-century, French architect Charles Ribart planned to build a three-level elephant building at the Paris site where the Arc de Triomphe was eventually built. Nothing became of this, but in the early 19th-century, Napoleon conceived of an even larger elephant structure, the Elephant of the Bastille. Although the ambitious project was never completed with its intended bronze elephant, a full-sized plaster and wood-frame model stood in its place. After Napoleon's defeat, this structure eventually became a neglected eyesore, and a setting in Victor Hugo's 1862 novel, Les Mis\u00e9rables.\nThree multi-story elephant shaped buildings were built in America by James V. Lafferty in the 1880s. The largest, seven-story, thirty-one room Elephantine Colossus served as a hotel, concert hall, and attraction on Coney Island before it burned down in 1896. The six-story Lucy the Elephant is the only remaining of the three, and survives as a tourist attraction near Atlantic City. These giant elephant structures, however, are dwarfed by the 32-story Bangkok Elephant Tower in Thailand. This iconic elephant-inspired building reflects the influence of the elephant in Thai culture.\nGallery [ edit ]\nBuddhist parable of the blind monks examining an elephant; illustrated by Itch\u014d Hanabusa.

The book was published in 2006 by Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill. The historical fiction novel is a 20th century circus drama. Gruen wrote the book as part of the National Novel Writing Month.\nPlot [ edit ]\nThe story is told through a series of memories by Jacob Jankowski, a man who can't remember if he's 90 or 93-years-old and lives in a nursing home. In the nursing home, Jacob's life lacks excitement. He gets visited every Sunday by one of his five children and has good rapport with a kind nurse named Rosemary, but for the most part, Jacob's a tired old man whose life is highly regimented and scheduled. This all changes, however, when the circus parks right outside of the nursing home window, igniting Jacob's memories of his time working with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.\nAs his memories begin, Jacob is a 23-year-old Polish American preparing for his final exams as a Cornell University veterinary student when he receives the devastating news that both of his parents have died in a car accident. Jacob's father was a veterinarian and Jacob had planned to join his practice in Norwich. When Jacob learns that his parents' home has been mortgaged to pay for his tuition and that his father's practice will not become his own, he has an emotional breakdown and leaves his Ivy League school just short of graduation.\nIn the dark of night, Jacob jumps on a train, later learning it is a circus train belonging to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. On the train Jacob is befriended by Camel, an old man and circus veteran, who persuades his companions not to throw Jacob off the train. Camel takes him under his wing and is able to find him odd menial jobs. When the owner of the circus, Alan J. Bunkel, \"Uncle Al,\" learns of Jacob's training as a vet, he is hired to care for the circus animals. This leads Jacob to share quarters with a little person named Walter (who is known as Kinko to the circus) and his Jack Russell Terrier, Queenie. A few weeks later Jacob is summoned to examine Camel, who, after drinking \"Jake\" (adulterated Jamaican ginger extract) for many years, is unable to move his arms or legs. Fearing Camel will be \"red-lighted\" (thrown off a moving train as punishment or as severance from the circus to avoid paying wages), Jacob hides him in his room.\nThe equestrian director, August Rosenthul, is a brutal man who abuses the animals in his care (such as the new elephant, Rosie) and the people around him, though he can also be charming and generous. Jacob develops a guarded relationship with August and his wife, Marlena, with whom Jacob eventually falls in love. August is suspicious of their relationship and physically assaults both Marlena and Jacob. Marlena subsequently leaves August and stays at a hotel while she is not performing. Uncle Al then informs Jacob that August is a paranoid schizophrenic and utters a threat: reunite August and Marlena as a happily married couple or Walter and Camel get red-lighted.\nA few days later, after discovering that August has tried to see Marlena, Jacob visits her in her hotel room. Soon after he comforts her, they end up making love, and soon declare their love for each other. Marlena soon returns to the circus to perform (and have secret meetings with Jacob), but refuses to allow August near her, which makes Uncle Al furious. Soon after returning to the circus, Marlena discovers that she is pregnant.\nOne night Jacob climbs up and jumps each train car, while the train is moving, to August's room, carrying a knife between his teeth intending to kill August. However, Jacob backs out, leaving the knife on August's pillow to send a message. When Jacob returns to his train car, he finds that no one is there, except for Queenie. He then realizes that Walter and Camel were red-lighted and that he was also supposed to have been too.\nAs the story climaxes, several circus workers who were red-lighted come back and release the animals, causing a stampede during the performance.\nIn the ensuing panic, Rosie (the elephant that August abused) takes a stake and drives it into August's head. August's body is then trampled in the stampede. During the ensuing melee Jacob was the only who witnessed what truly happened to August. As a result of this incident, the Benzini Brothers circus is shut down. Soon after, Uncle Al's corpse is found with a makeshift garrote around his neck. Marlena and Jacob leave, taking with them a number of the circus animals including Rosie, Queenie, and Marlena's horses. Jacob and Marlena begin their life together by joining the Ringling Bros. Circus. Later, Jacob becomes the chief veterinarian at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago where they settled.\nThe story then comes back to Jacob in the nursing home. Jacob is waiting for one of his children to take him to the circus. It is revealed that Jacob and Marlena married and had five children, spending the first seven years with Ringling before Jacob got a job as a vet for the Chicago Zoo. Marlena is revealed to have died a few years before Jacob was put into the nursing home. After finding out no one is coming for him, Jacob makes his way to the circus next to the nursing home on his own. He meets the manager, Charlie, and, after the performance, Jacob begs to be allowed to stay with the circus, selling tickets. Charlie agrees, and Jacob believes that he has finally come home.\nCharacters [ edit ]\nJacob Jankowski \u2013 The protagonist, a 93-year-old nursing home resident reminiscing on the time he spent as a circus veterinarian during the Great Depression.\n\u2013 The protagonist, a 93-year-old nursing home resident reminiscing on the time he spent as a circus veterinarian during the Great Depression.

Their brains can weigh up to a whopping 5.4kg and are, without doubt, the largest brain of all animals living on land. Need help remembering which is an African elephant and which is an Asian elephant? Check out their ears! African elephant ears are, rather helpfully, the shape of Africa. Have you ever seen an elephant swim? It\u2019s pretty special! But not only can they swim, did you know they\u2019ve also been spotted using their trunks as a snorkel when crossing rivers?! Now that\u2019s handy\u2026 Elephant family groups are very close. While they can\u2019t exactly hug each other, elephants do wrap their trunks around younger relatives to reassure them and to greet each other they twine their trunks together. Elephants are super smart! They can both learn and feel emotions. If a member of their family group is injured, the rest of the group may come and help it. They also know when a family member is no longer in the herd and it\u2019s a truly heart-breaking sight to see an elephant grieve over the bones of lost family and friends. Female elephants have the longest pregnancy of any mammal. It\u2019s a lengthy 22 months before baby elephants are ready to be born! Baby elephants stay with mum for up to 10 years. They even learn to eat by putting their trunks inside their mothers\u2019 mouths to take food. Did you know elephants can get sunburned? Ouch! These giants bathe in mud to help protect their skin from the sun. You definitely don\u2019t want to get in the way of a charging elephant. It\u2019s said they can reach speeds of 40km/h! Elephants make sounds that we can\u2019t even hear. Some of their calls are so low, they are below the range of human hearing. And these amazing animals can recognise over 100 different friends from their calls alone.\nBonus fact\u2026 it\u2019s not something to celebrate, but here\u2019s why we so desperately need to save elephants.\nAdult elephants have no real predators in the wild\u2026 except us.\nRight now, elephants are fighting for their survival. Despite a ban on international sales ivory in 1989, the illegal trade has expanded, particularly over the last 10 years and is now bigger than ever. The number of elephants being poached for their ivory is unacceptable and we must end this before it\u2019s too late.\nConnect with us on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter to find out the latest news about elephants!"}

Powering themselves with their strong tails, manatees typically glide along at 5 miles an hour but can swim 15 miles an hour in short bursts.\nManatees are usually seen alone, in pairs, or in small groups of a half dozen or fewer animals. From above the water's surface, the animal's nose and nostrils are often the only thing visible. Manatees never leave the water but, like all marine mammals, they must breathe air at the surface. A resting manatee can remain submerged for up to 15 minutes, but while swimming, it must surface every three or four minutes.\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\nManatee Populations\nThere are three species of manatee, distinguished primarily by where they live. The West Indian manatee ranges along the North American east coast from Florida to Brazil. The Amazonian manatee species inhabit the Amazon River and the African manatee swims along the west coast and rivers of Africa.\nParenting and Diet\nManatees are born underwater. Mothers must help their calves to the surface so that they can take their first breath, but the infants can typically swim on their own only an hour later.\nManatee calves drink their mothers' milk, but adults are voracious grazers. They eat water grasses, weeds, and algae\u2014and lots of them. A manatee can eat a tenth of its own massive weight in just 24 hours.\nThreats to Survival\nManatees are large, slow-moving animals that frequent coastal waters and rivers. These attributes make them vulnerable to hunters seeking their hides, oil, and bones. Manatee numbers declined throughout the last century, mostly because of hunting pressure. Today, manatees are at-risk. Though protected by laws, they still face threats. The gentle beasts are often accidentally hit by motorboats in ever more crowded waters, and sometimes become entangled in fishing nets.\n1:43"}
{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Fastest animals - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastest_animals", "text": "Wikipedia list article\nThis is a list of the fastest animals in the world, by types of animal.\nFastest organism [ edit ]\nThe fastest land animal is the cheetah. The peregrine falcon is the fastest bird, and the fastest member of the animal kingdom, with a diving speed of 389 km/h (242 mph). Among the fastest animals in the sea is the black marlin, with uncertain and conflicting reports of recorded speeds.\nWhen drawing comparisons between different classes of animals, an alternative unit is used for organisms: body length per second. The fastest organism on earth, relative to its body length, is the Southern Californian mite, Paratarsotomus macropalpis, which has a speed of 322 body lengths per second. The equivalent speed for a human, running as fast as this mite, would be 1,300 mph (2,092 km/h). The speed of the P. macropalpis is far in excess of the previous record holder, the Australian tiger beetle Cicindela eburneola, which is the fastest insect in the world relative to body size, with a recorded speed of 1.86 metres per second (6.7 km/h; 4.2 mph), or 171 body lengths per second. The cheetah, the fastest land mammal, scores at only 16 body lengths per second, while Anna's hummingbird has the highest known length-specific velocity attained by any vertebrate.\nInvertebrates [ edit ]\nAnimal Maximum recorded speed Notes Horsefly 145 km/h (90 mph)\n[ unreliable source? ] The pursuit maneuver used by male Hybomitra hinei wrighti, measured by interpolation of slow-motion cinematography. Members of Loliginidae and Ommastrephidae 36 km/h (22 mph) Many of these species \"fly\" out of the water to escape danger. The Japanese flying squid can glide for 3 seconds over 30 metres. Paratarsotomus macropalpis 22 cm/s (8.7 in/s)\n800 m/h (730 ft/ks) 0.7 mm long mite endemic to Southern California, tracked running up to 322 body lengths per second, equivalent to a human running at around 2,092 km/h (1,300 mph). Because of this feat, it is ranked the fastest animal on the planet relative to its body size. It can also withstand temperatures of 60 \u00b0C (140 \u00b0F), which are lethal to many animals. Tiger beetle 6.8 km/h (4.2 mph)\nThe Australian tiger beetle, Cicindela eburneola, is one of the fastest running insects in the world relative to body size, which has been recorded at 6.8 km/h (4.2 mph) or 171 body lengths per second. It can fly at 43 km/h (27 mph).\nFish [ edit ]\nDue to physical constraints, fish may be incapable of exceeding swim speeds of 36 km/h (22 mph). Larger reported figures are therefore highly questionable.\nAnimal Maximum recorded speed Notes Black marlin 132 km/h (82 mph)[ citation needed ][ dubious discuss ] A hooked black marlin has been recorded stripping line off a fishing reel at 120 feet per second (82 mph; 132 km/h). Sailfish 109.19 km/h (67.85 mph)[ citation needed ][ dubious discuss ] In a series of tests carried out in a fishing cam at Long Key, Florida, United States, sailfish swam and leapt 91 meters (300 feet) in 3 seconds, equivalent to a speed of 109 km/h (68 mph), although this speed includes leaps out of the water, which do not strictly qualify as swimming speed. Swordfish 97 km/h (60 mph)[ citation needed ][ dubious discuss ] The 60 mph (97 km/h) figure listed for the swordfish is based on a corrupted version of calculations made by Sir James Gray to estimate the impact speed necessary for a hypothetical 600-pound (270 kg) swordfish to embed its sword 3 feet in the timbers of ships, as has been known to occur; the figure seems to have entered the literature without question as though someone had actually timed a swordfish at that speed. Yellowfin tuna 76 km/h (47 mph)\n[ dubious discuss ] Many tuna species are capable of swimming at fast speeds colloquially cited at around 80 km/h (50 mph). The tails of tuna move fast enough to cause cavitation, which slows them down as vapour accumulates. Tuna have bony fins without nerve endings, which prevents the fish from feeling the pain of cavitation but does not fully protect them from the implosive damage. Shortfin mako shark 72 km/h (45 mph)[ citation needed ][ dubious discuss ] Underwater and unimpeded by a fishing line, the Shortfin Mako has been reliably clocked at 31 miles (50 kilometres) per hour, and there is a claim that one individual of this species achieved a burst speed of 46 miles (74 kilometres) per hour. But it is extremely difficult to get a fish in the wild to swim in a straight line over a measured course. Laboratory measurements of numerous kinds of fishes \u2014 representing a wide range of body sizes \u2014 swimming against an artificial current have revealed a surprisingly uniform maximum burst speed of about 10 times the body length per second. Thus, for an average-sized, 6.5-foot (2-metre) Shortfin, its theoretical maximum speed might be something on the order of 45 miles (72 kilometres) per hour. Yet some estimates of the top-speed of a Shortfin Mako are considerably higher.\nAmphibians [ edit ]\nAnimal Maximum recorded speed Notes Nauta salamander 24.14 km/h (15.00 mph)\nAlso known as the Andean Salamander, it is the fastest amphibian recorded.\nReptiles [ edit ]\nBirds [ edit ]\n^ Sustained ground speed for approximately nine hours with no rest on high tailwinds during an Antarctic storm.\nMammals [ edit ]\nSee also [ edit ]\nNotes [ edit ]"}

We\u2019ve selected desert animals from all over the world, and because many of these species are threatened, we\u2019ve included their conservation status according to the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature).\nDesert Animals\nExamples of desert animals include invertebrates such as scorpions and camel spiders; reptiles such as the thorny devil, Gila monster and sidewinder rattlesnake; mammals such as the fennec fox, meerkat, dromedary and Bactrian camel; and birds such as the sandgrouse and lappet-faced vulture.\nIntroduction To Deserts & Animals That Live In Deserts\n(Click here or scroll down to go directly to the animals!)\nDeserts are regions in which very little rain falls. Because living things need water to survive, deserts are home to relatively few plants and animals (especially when compared to habitats such as rainforests, jungles and oceans).\nAlthough deserts are known for being extremely hot during the day, they can also get very cold at night (because there are no clouds to prevent a desert\u2019s heat from escaping into space).\nWith very little water, and therefore very little food (plants can\u2019t grow without water) \u2013 not to mention those extreme temperatures, life in the desert isn\u2019t easy.\nMany animals that live in the desert have special adaptations to help them survive in this inhospitable environment.\nDesert Animal Adaptations\nDesert animal adaptations include: large ears for dissipating body heat; a light-colored coat to reflect heat; hairy paws for walking on hot sand; the ability either to store water or to survive on very little water; being nocturnal; and living in a burrow.\nCold Deserts\nNot all deserts are hot. Because both the Arctic and Antarctica have very little rain (or snow) they\u2019re also considered to be deserts.\nThese polar regions are known as \u2018cold deserts\u2019. You can find out about the animals that live in cold deserts on these pages: Arctic Animals and Antarctic Animals.\nHot Deserts\nThe animals in the list below all live in \u2018hot deserts\u2019 such as the Sahara Desert and Kalahari Desert in Africa, the Sonoran Desert and Mojave Desert in North America, the Great Victoria Desert in Australia, and the Arabian Desert in the Middle East.\nFree Desert Animals Worksheet To Download & Print\nTest your knowledge of desert animals with this free printable question sheet!

Links to further information are provided for many of the animals.\nAddax\nScientific name: Addax nasomaculatus\nAddax nasomaculatus Type of animal: Mammal, Even-toed ungulate\nMammal, Even-toed ungulate Where found: Sahara Desert\nSahara Desert Conservation status: Critically endangered\nThe addax is a critically endangered species of antelope found in the Sahara Desert. The species is also known as both the \u201cwhite antelope\u201d and the \u201cscrewhorn antelope\u201d due to its pale coat and long, spiral horns.\nThe main threat to the addax is poaching. Habitat loss has also played a part in the species\u2019 Critically Endangered status, with much of the addax\u2019s traditional territory having being converted into farmland.\nThere may be fewer than 90 adult addax left in the wild; perhaps as few as 30. This desert animal may soon be extinct in the wild.\nAntelope Jackrabbit\nScientific name: Lepus alleni\nLepus alleni Type of animal: Mammal, family Leporidae (the rabbit and hare family)\nMammal, family Leporidae (the rabbit and hare family) Where found: Sonoran Desert, Arizona & Northern Mexico\nSonoran Desert, Arizona & Northern Mexico Conservation status: Least Concern\nThe antelope jackrabbit is a hare found in deserts and other dry habitats in the south western United States. It is one of the largest North American hares.\nThe species can be identified by its large size, very long, pointed ears, white / gray sides, white underparts, buff neck and chest, and black / buff back.\nThe diet of this herbivorous mammal includes cacti and mesquite leaves. (Mesquite is a small tree that grows in deserts and other dry habitats.)\nArabian Oryx / White Oryx\nScientific name: Oryx leucoryx\nOryx leucoryx Type of animal: Mammal, Even-toed ungulate\nMammal, Even-toed ungulate Where found: Arabian Desert\nArabian Desert Conservation status: Vulnerable\nThe Arabian oryx is the smallest of the four antelopes in the genus oryx. It stands 1m tall at the shoulders, and its long, straight horns are almost as tall again, reaching 75 cm in length.\nThe Arabian oryx became extinct in the wild in the early 1970\u2019s. A reintroduction program that began in the 1990\u2019s saw captive animals being released back into the wild. Today there are around 850 Arabian oryxes living in the wild.\nThe biggest threat to the species is illegal hunting.\nArabian Sand Gazelle / Reem\nScientific name: Gazella marica\nGazella marica Type of animal: Mammal, Even-toed ungulate\nMammal, Even-toed ungulate Where found: Syrian Desert, Arabian Desert\nSyrian Desert, Arabian Desert Conservation status: Vulnerable\nThe Arabian sand gazelle (also known as a \u2018reem\u2019) is a small antelope. The ends of its horns curve inwards.\nA desert specialist, the Arabian sand gazelle was once found throughout the Arabian Peninsula. Today most of the population resides in protected areas.\nThe species is currently rated Vulnerable by the IUCN (the International Union for Conservation of Nature). The main threats to the species are illegal hunting and habitat loss.\nCamel Spiders\nType of animal: Arachnids, order Solifugae\nArachnids, order Solifugae Where found: Syrian Desert\nCamel spiders are arachnids in the order Solifugae. (An order is a group of related animals.) Camel spiders are also known as wind scorpions, sun spiders and solifuges.\nMany camel spiders can be identified by their large, powerful mouth parts. All camel spiders have four pairs of legs and a pair of additional, leg-like structures called \u2018predipalps\u2019, which are used for sensing and feeding.\nUnlike their fellow arachnids the spiders, camel spiders are unable to produce silk, and do not spin webs.\nThere are over 1,000 species of camel spider. They range in size from a few millimeters to 15 cm (6 in.) in length (including legs). Most camel spiders are desert animals, although some are found in grasslands and forests.\nYou can find out more about camel spiders here: Camel Spider Facts\nDeathstalker Scorpion\nScientific name: Leiurus quinquestriatus\nLeiurus quinquestriatus Type of animal: Arachnid, scorpion\nArachnid, scorpion Where found: Sahara Desert, Arabian Desert\nSahara Desert, Arabian Desert Conservation status: n/a\nThe deathstalker is one desert animal you probably don\u2019t want to encounter. Its venom is among the most powerful of all scorpions. A sting from this fearsome arachnid is extremely painful and potentially fatal.\nThe deathstalker inhabits desert and scrubland habitat in North Africa and Western Asia. It is around 2.36 in / 6 cm in length, and appears in a variety of colors and markings, making it hard to identify.\nThe deathstalker isn\u2019t all bad news; its venom can be used to locate tumors in the human body.\nYou can find out more about scorpions here: Scorpion Facts\nDesert Iguana\nScientific name: Dipsosaurus dorsalis\nDipsosaurus dorsalis Type of animal: Reptile, order Squamata\nReptile, order Squamata Where found: Sonoran Desert, Mojave Desert\nSonoran Desert, Mojave Desert Conservation status: Least Concern\nThe desert iguana is found in the southwestern USA and northern Mexico. It is one of the most commonly encountered lizards in the deserts in this region.\nThe species grows to around 24 in. (60 cm) in length including the tail, which is around 1 \u00bd times the length of the body. Its base color is grey / light brown, with darker lines running along its back, and dark rings on its tail.\nThe desert iguana is active during the day even in high temperatures. If disturbed, it will quickly retreat into a burrow or other shelter.\nDromedary\nScientific name: Camelus dromedarius\nCamelus dromedarius Type of animal: Mammal, order Artiodactyla (the even-toed ungulates)\nMammal, order Artiodactyla (the even-toed ungulates) Where found: Sahara Desert\nSahara Desert Conservation status: Domestic animal\nCamels are among the most famous of all desert animals. These hoofed mammals are a common sight in many desert regions, where they were domesticated around 4,000 years ago. Camels are used for transport, food and clothing.\nThere are three camel species: the single-humped dromedary, and the two-humped Bactrian and Wild Bactrian. They make up the genus Camelus.\nThe dromedary is by far the most abundant camel, representing 94% of all camels. Today it is a domestic animal, most often seen in desert regions. Australia has a small feral dromedary population made up of the descendants of animals introduced to the country by humans.\nThe dromedary has many adaptations for living in the desert. These include bushy eyebrows, double-layered eyelashes, and nostrils that can close up completely, all of which provide protection from sand storms.\nThe dromedary is able to go long periods of time without drinking. It stores both water and energy \u2013 in the form of body fat \u2013 in its hump.\nFennec Fox\nScientific name: Vulpes zerda\nVulpes zerda Type of animal: Mammal, order Carnivora\nMammal, order Carnivora Where found: Sahara Desert\nSahara Desert Conservation status: Least Concern\nThe fennec fox is a mammal found in North Africa and the Middle East. It is the smallest member of the dog family Canidae, with a maximum body length of around 16 in. (41 cm).\nThe fennec fox is known for its distinctive long ears, which are up to 15 cm (almost 6 in.) in length.\nThe fox\u2019s ears serve a dual purpose: not only do they provide extra-sensitive hearing (useful for locating prey that is underground), but they also help to keep the fox cool. Blood vessels close to the skin in the ears dissipate body heat into the air.\nA thick layer of fur on the fennec fox\u2019s paws provide grip and protection from the hot sand.\nThe fennec fox has a thick, pale orange coat. This keeps the fox warm at night, when temperatures in the Sahara Desert can be surprisingly low, even (occasionally) dropping below 0 \u00b0C.\nYou can find out more about this animal here: Fennec Fox Facts\nGreater Flamingo\nScientific name: Phoenicopterus roseus\nPhoenicopterus roseus Type of animal: Bird, family Phoenicopteridae\nBird, family Phoenicopteridae Where found: Kalahari Desert\nKalahari Desert Conservation status: Least Concern\nThe greater flamingo is the largest of the six species of flamingo, and one of only two found outside of the Americas.\nThis large, pale pink bird is found in shallow lakes, lagoons and estuaries in Africa, Asia and Europe.\nAlthough not exclusively a desert animal, the greater flamingo does visit shallow lakes and flood plains in desert regions.\nEach year, many thousands of greater flamingos visit the Makgadikgadi Pan of north eastern Botswana in order to breed. The shallow, highly salty waters of the Makgadikgadi Pan are surrounded by the Kalahari Desert.\nYou can find out more about this species here: Greater Flamingo Facts\nGila Monster\nScientific name: Heloderma suspectum\nHeloderma suspectum Type of animal: Reptile, order Squamata\nReptile, order Squamata Where found: Sonoran Desert\nSonoran Desert Conservation status: Near Threatened\nThe Gila monster is a lizard found in a range of dry habitats throughout the southwestern United States and Northern Mexico. It is a relatively large, slow-moving lizard. It has rounded, bead-like scales and a blotchy black / orange-pink coloration.\nThe Gila monster is one of only two venomous lizards found in the Americas (the other is the closely related Mexican beaded lizard).\nThe danger posed by these desert animals is often exaggerated. Although a bite from a Gila monster is painful, to most healthy humans it isn\u2019t life-threatening.\nYou can find out more about the Gila monster here: Gila Monster Facts\nGolden Hamster\nScientific name: Mesocricetus auratus\nMesocricetus auratus Type of animal: Mammal, order Rodentia (rodent)\nMammal, order Rodentia (rodent) Where found: Syrian Desert\nSyrian Desert Conservation status: Vulnerable\nThe golden hamster is a rodent found in the wild in Syria and Turkey (the animal is also known as the Syrian hamster).\nAlthough a popular pet in many parts of the world, the wild population of golden hamsters is decreasing, and the species\u2019 conservation status is Vulnerable.\nGolden hamsters are territorial, and do not tolerate other hamsters in their territories. Hamsters are able to carry large amounts of food in the cheek pouches \u2013 useful if they come across more food than they are able to eat in one sitting.\nJerboas\nType of animal: Mammal, order Rodentia (rodent), family Dipodidae\nMammal, order Rodentia (rodent), family Dipodidae Where found: Gobi Desert\nJerboas are a group of rodents within the family Dipodidae. They are found in deserts and other arid habitats in Northern Africa, Asia and Australia.\nJerboas move by hopping, in a similar way to kangaroos. They have long, powerful hind legs and short fore limbs. A long tail helps the jerboa to keep its balance when hopping or standing upright. Some jerboas can hop more than ten times their own body length!\nJerboas have several adaptations for living in the desert. These include a sandy colored coat that provides camouflage, and a burrowing lifestyle. They are active either at twilight or at night, thereby avoiding the hottest hours of the day.\nKit Fox\nScientific name: Vulpes macrotis\nVulpes macrotis Type of animal: Mammal, order Carnivora\nMammal, order Carnivora Where found: Sonoran Desert\nSonoran Desert Conservation status: Least Concern\nThe kit fox is a small canid (member of the dog family) found in the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It inhabits deserts and other dry habitats, such as scrublands and grasslands.\nThe species is known for its large ears, which provide both excellent hearing and a means of reducing body heat. Heat is dissipated by blood vessels in the ears.\nAnother adaptation for life in the desert is dense hair on the soles of the feet. This provides traction on slippery sand, and also protection from the heat.\nKit foxes rarely drink. Instead they get most of the water they require from their almost completely carnivorous diet.\nA nocturnal, burrowing lifestyle helps them avoid the highest desert temperatures.\nYou can find out more about this desert species on this page: Kit Fox Facts\nLappet-Faced Vulture\nScientific name: Torgos tracheliotos\nTorgos tracheliotos Type of animal: Bird, order Accipitriformes\nBird, order Accipitriformes Where found: Desert areas of Africa and the Middle East\nDesert areas of Africa and the Middle East Conservation status: Endangered\nThe lappet-faced vulture is a large bird of prey found in Africa and the Middle East. It has a bald, pink / red head and a powerful bill, which is almost 4 in. (10 cm) long and 2 in. (5 cm) deep. Its wingspan can reach 8.5 ft. (2.6 m).\nLike most vultures it is primarily a scavenger, although the lappet-faced vulture is also thought to hunt live prey on occasion.\nAs one of the biggest and strongest vultures, the lappet-faced vulture will prevent other vultures from feeding on carrion it has found. It has also been known to stand its ground against a jackal!\nUsing its huge bill, the vulture can tear apart even tough skin, tendons and bone. It is a \u2018living tin-opener\u2019, making carrion accessible for smaller vultures and other scavengers who can\u2019t break through the tough hides.\nMeerkat\nScientific name: Suricata suricatta\nSuricata suricatta Type of animal: Mammal, order Carnivora\nMammal, order Carnivora Where found: Kalahari Desert, Namib Desert\nKalahari Desert, Namib Desert Conservation status: Least Concern\nThe meerkat is a mammal in the mongoose family Herpestidae. It is found in desert and other dry habitats, including savannah and grassland. It is known for its highly social behavior and distinctive upright stance.\nThis characterful desert animal lives in groups that can contain up to 50 individuals. The group is active during the day, and spends the nights in large burrows.\nMembers of a group will often groom each other before heading off to forage. Sentries survey the landscape for threats, and will alert the group using different alarm calls depending on the threat.\nYou can find out more about meerkats on this page: Meerkat Facts\nMojave Desert Tortoise\nScientific name: Gopherus agassizii\nGopherus agassizii Type of animal: Reptile, order Testudines\nReptile, order Testudines Where found: Mojave Desert\nMojave Desert Conservation status: Critically Endangered\nAs its name suggests, the Mojave Desert tortoise is found in North America\u2019s Mojave Desert. Until 2011 it had been considered to be the same species as the Sonoran desert tortoise, Gopherus morafkai. Prior to then both species had been known as the \u201cdesert tortoise\u201d.\nThe Mojave Desert tortoise is present to the north and west of the Colorado River in California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona. This shy reptile is rarely encountered; it spends up to 95% of the time in burrows, or hidden in rock shelters.\nThe Mojave Desert tortoise digs its own burrows, and will hibernate underground during the winter.\nA 2020 study, whose results were published in 2021, found the species to be Critically Endangered. This is due mainly to habitat loss.\nYou can find out more about the Mojave desert tortoise here: Mojave Desert Tortoise Facts\nMulgara\nScientific name: Brush-tailed mulgara: Dasycercus blythi; Crest-tailed mulgara: Dasycercus cristicauda\nBrush-tailed mulgara: Dasycercus blythi; Crest-tailed mulgara: Dasycercus cristicauda Type of animal: Mammal, marsupial\nMammal, marsupial Where found: Great Sandy Desert\nGreat Sandy Desert Conservation status: Brush-tailed mulgara: Least Concern ; Crest-tailed mulgara: Vulnerable\nMulgaras are rat-sized marsupials found in desert regions of central Australia. There are two species of mulgara: the brush-tailed mulgara and the crest-tailed mulgara. The crest-tailed mulgara has a crest-like ridge of longer hairs on its tail.\nMulgaras are in the same family, Dasyuridae, as the Tasmanian devil and the quolls.\nBoth mulgaras are carnivorous, feeding mainly on small reptiles, insects and rodents. They conserve energy by periodically entering torpor \u2013 a state of reduced activity that resembles a \u2018mini-hibernation\u2019.\nThese Australian desert animals rarely drink, and their kidneys are specially adapted to preserve water.\nNamib Desert Beetle / Fogstand Beetle\nScientific name: Stenocara gracilipes\nStenocara gracilipes Type of animal: Insect, order Coleoptera (beetles)\nInsect, order Coleoptera (beetles) Where found: Namib Desert\nNamib Desert Conservation status: Unassessed\nThe fogstand beetle is an insect found in the Namib Desert, a coastal desert in southern Africa.\nUsing its specially-adapted wing-cases, the beetle can collect minute droplets of water from the early morning fog. The tiny droplets build up until the water runs down the beetle\u2019s back and into its mouth.\nThis is a useful skill to have in a region that receives only 1.4 cm (0.55 in.) per year!\nThis desert insect\u2019s water collecting abilities haven\u2019t gone unnoticed; inventors are working on materials and products that utilize similar methods to collect water from the air!\nOnager\nScientific name: Equus hemionus\nEquus hemionus Type of animal: Mammal, order Perissodactyla (Odd-toed ungulates)\nMammal, order Perissodactyla (Odd-toed ungulates) Where found: Gobi Desert, other dry habitats in Asia\nGobi Desert, other dry habitats in Asia Conservation status: Near Threatened (two subspecies are Endangered )\nAlso known as the Asiatic wild ass, the onager is a hoofed mammal in the horse family Equidae. The species is found in Asia, where it inhabits deserts (including the Gobi desert) and other dry, open habitats.\nThe species has four living subspecies: the Mongolian wild ass, Turkmenian kulan, Persian onager and Indian wild ass. Each is found in a different part of Asia. Both the Turkmenian kulan and Persian onager are rated Endangered.\nThe onager is one of the world\u2019s fastest mammals. It is capable of reaching speeds of up to 70 km/h / 43 mph.\nRed-Spotted Toad\nScientific name: Anaxyrus punctatus\nAnaxyrus punctatus Type of animal: Amphibian, order Anura (frogs and toads)\nAmphibian, order Anura (frogs and toads) Where found: Mojave Desert\nMojave Desert Conservation status: Least Concern\nThis small toad is found in deserts and other dry habitats in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It reaches lengths of around 3 inches (7.6cm), and has pale olive green skin marked with black patches and smaller red spots.\nThe red-spotted toad spends much of its time sheltering from the sun in rocky crevices near streams. It is most often seen during periods of rainfall, when it emerges from its hiding place.\nRoadrunner (Greater)\nScientific name: Geococcyx californianus\nType of animal: Bird, family Cuculidae\nWhere found: Desert regions of the United States & Mexico\nConservation status: Least Concern\nThe greater roadrunner is one of two species of roadrunner, the other being the lesser roadrunner (Geococcyx velox), which is found in Mexico and Central America. The two roadrunners are the only living members of the genus Geococcyx, which is part of the cuckoo family, Cuculidae.\nAlthough roadrunners can fly, they only do so as a last resort when evading predators \u2013 they spend most of the time on the ground, and are excellent runners.\nThe greater roadrunner can run at speeds of up to 26 mph (41.8 km/h) \u2013 faster than any other non-flightless bird (even record-breaking sprinter Usain Bolt can only reach this speed for a few seconds in a race).\nSaharan Silver Ant\nScientific name: Cataglyphis bombycina\nCataglyphis bombycina Type of animal: Insect, family Formicidae (the ant family)\nInsect, family Formicidae (the ant family) Where found: Sahara Desert\nSahara Desert Conservation status: Unassessed\nThe silvery appearance of this African desert ant is caused by tiny hairs on its body; a special adaptation that reflects the hot desert sun, preventing the insect from overheating.\nThe Saharan silver ant has other adaptations for living in the desert: its long legs keep its body away from the hot sand, and it often walks using just four of its six legs, thereby minimizing the area in contact with the sand.\nThese adaptations are vitally important because the Saharan silver ant only emerges from its nest for around 10 minutes per day. The timing is crucial: it has to be hot enough so that ant-eating lizards are forced to seek shelter.\nSand Cat / Sand Dune Cat\nScientific name: Felis margarita\nFelis margarita Type of animal: Mammal, order Carnivora, family Felidae (the cat family)\nMammal, order Carnivora, family Felidae (the cat family) Where found: Sahara Desert, Arabian Desert\nSahara Desert, Arabian Desert Conservation status: Least Concern\nThe sand cat is a rarely-seen desert cat found in northern Africa and the Middle East. It is smaller than a domestic cat, and has pale, sandy-colored hair, which is often marked with darker spots or stripes.\nA layer of thick fur on the sand cat\u2019s paws provides protection from the hot desert sand.\nThe sand cat has large, pointed ears, and is thought to have hearing that is far more acute than that of a domestic cat.\nThe sand cat is usually either nocturnal or crepuscular (active at dawn or dusk). It is only active during the day in the coolest months of the year.\nYou can find out more about sand cats on this page: Sand Cat Facts\nSandgrouse\nType of animal: Birds in the family Pteroclidae\nBirds in the family Pteroclidae Where found: Desert regions of Africa & Asia\nSandgrouses are birds in the family Pteroclidae. Most of the 16 members of this family are found either in deserts or other dry habitats.\nThese medium-sized, ground-dwelling birds are seed-eaters. Sandgrouses often congregate in large numbers around waterholes then disperse to forage for seeds either alone or in smaller groups.\nThe Namaqua sandgrouse (pictured above) is found in Southern Africa, including the Kalahari Desert and the Namib Desert.\nSidewinder\nScientific name: Crotalus cerastes\nCrotalus cerastes Type of animal: Reptile, order Squamata\nReptile, order Squamata Where found: Mojave Desert & other regions of SW United States and NW Mexico\nMojave Desert & other regions of SW United States and NW Mexico Conservation status: Least Concern\nThe sidewinder is a species of rattlesnake that inhabits desert regions in California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona. It is also found in northern Mexico.\nThe species\u2019 name comes from the way in which it moves; by anchoring its tail and pushing its head forwards, then pulling its tail forwards and repeating the process, it can move at high speeds over sand. Although the snake\u2019s head points in the direction of travel, its body appears to be moving sideways.\nThis way of moving is also used by other desert snakes, and is known as sidewinding.\nThe sidewinder is also known as the horned rattlesnake due to the horn-like scales that project out from above its eyes.\nThe sidewinder is venomous. Its bite is extremely painful, but rarely life-threatening. The sidewinder\u2019s venom is relatively weak compared to that of most other rattlesnakes.\nYou can find out more about this species here: Sidewinder Facts\nSouthern Marsupial Mole\nScientific name: Notoryctes typhlops\nNotoryctes typhlops Type of animal: Mammal, marsupial\nMammal, marsupial Where found: Great Victorian Desert\nGreat Victorian Desert Conservation status: Least Concern\nConvergent evolution occurs when different types of animal develop similar characteristics or abilities due to their having the same type of lifestyle.\nThe marsupial mole, an Australian desert animal, is an example of convergent evolution. It looks and behaves very much like a true mole, but as a marsupial is only very distantly related to the animals from which it gets its name.\nThis rat-sized desert marsupial lives in the hot, dry regions of inner Australia. It lives underground in tunnels, where it hunts earthworms and other invertebrates. The marsupial mole is blind, and probably uses a well-developed sense of smell to find its food.\nTarantula Hawk Wasp\nScientific name: Pepsis grossa / Pepsis formosa (and other members of genera Pepsis and Hemipepsis)\nPepsis grossa / Pepsis formosa (and other members of genera Pepsis and Hemipepsis) Type of animal: Insect in the family Pompilidae (the spider wasp family)\nInsect in the family Pompilidae (the spider wasp family) Where found: Mojave Desert\nMojave Desert Conservation status: unassessed\nTarantula hawk wasps are large wasps of genus Pepsis.\nOne of the best known species of tarantula hawk wasp is Pepsis grossa. Its sting is said to be the second most painful in the insect world, after that of the infamous bullet ant.\nThe tarantula hawk\u2019s sting scores pain level 4 \u2013 the highest score \u2013 on the Schmidt sting pain index, a scale for rating insect stings. Although excruciatingly painful, the sting is short-lived and non-fatal to humans.\nPepsis grossa is found in the southern United States and Mexico. It uses its powerful sting to hunt tarantula spiders.\nThe tarantula hawk wasp is the state insect of New Mexico.\nThorny Devil\nScientific name: Moloch horridus\nMoloch horridus Type of animal: Reptile, order Squamata\nReptile, order Squamata Where found: Great Victorian Desert\nGreat Victorian Desert Conservation status: Least Concern\nThe thorny devil is a small lizard found in dry regions throughout most of central and west Australia. Its body and limbs are covered in rows of spines. Behind its head is a \u2018decoy head\u2019; a fleshy growth with two large horns. This is displayed to deter potential predators.\nTiny grooves in the thorny devils\u2019 skin transport water directly to its mouth. Using this adaptation, the lizard can drink from the dew that forms on its body overnight.\nYou can find out more about the thorny devil here: Thorny Devil Facts\nWater-Holding Frog\nScientific name: Cyclorana platycephala\nCyclorana platycephala Type of animal: Amphibian, order Anura (frogs and toads)\nAmphibian, order Anura (frogs and toads) Where found: Great Victorian Desert\nGreat Victorian Desert Conservation status: Least Concern\nThe water-holding frog is a desert amphibian found in the dry central region of Australia.\nAlthough a member of the family Hylidae (the tree frog family), the water-holding frog lives on the ground.\nIn fact, the species spends much of its life buried up to 1 meter (3.28 ft.) underground, wrapped in a cocoon. It only emerges after a period of heavy rain, when it makes its way to a swamp or waterhole in order to breed.\nDuring dry periods the water-holding frog is able to aestivate. Aestivation is a state similar to hibernation, in which the frog becomes inactive in order to conserve energy.\nThe water-holding frog is so-named because it stores water in its bladder when buried. Australian aborigines used to dig the frogs up as a source of water.\nWild Bactrian Camel\nScientific name: Camelus ferus\nCamelus ferus Type of animal: Mammal, Even-toed ungulate\nMammal, Even-toed ungulate Where found: Gobi Desert\nGobi Desert Conservation status: Critically Endangered\nThe wild Bactrian camel is a critically endangered desert animal. It is closely related to the Bactrian camel, a domesticated species.\nBoth Bactrian camels have two humps, but those of the wild Bactrian are smaller. The species is also slightly smaller in overall size than its domestic relative.\nThe wild Bactrian camel is said to be able to tolerate water even saltier than seawater.\nOnly around 950 wild Bactrian camels remain in the wild. Around 600 live in the Lop Nur Wild Camel National Nature Reserve in China. Around 350 live in the Great Gobi A Strictly Protected Area in Mongolia. Their numbers are decreasing.\nYou can find out more about the wild Bactrian camel here: Wild Bactrian Camel Facts\nDesert Animals For Kids: Conclusion\nWe hope that you have enjoyed meeting these desert animals.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Do Elephants Weep as an Emotional Response? | Animal Behavior | Live ...", "url": "https://www.livescience.com/40029-do-elephants-weep-as-an-emotional-response.html", "text": "Marc Bekoff, emeritus professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder, is one of the world's pioneering cognitive ethologists, a Guggenheim Fellow, and co-founder with Jane Goodall of Ethologists for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. This essay is adapted from one that appeared in Bekoff's column Animal Emotions in Psychology Today. He contributed this article to LiveScience's Expert Voices: Op-Ed & Insights.\nA recent newspaper article called \"Elephant tears: Newborn weeps after being parted from mother who tried to kill him\" reports about a newborn male elephant who \"cried for five hours without stopping after he was rejected by his mother.\"\nThis story immediately made me think of the book When Elephants Weep (opens in new tab) (Delta, 1996), which helped to open the door to people taking the emotional lives of animals more seriously than they previously had.\nI've been studying various aspects of animal behavior and animal emotions for more than four decades, and have published numerous books and essays about these areas of inquiry, so the story about the weeping elephant resulted in my receiving a number of emails and also in doing an interview with Discovery News.\nMy approach to, and take on, this story, is fairly straightforward. I did a Google search for topics including \"Do/can elephants weep?\", \"Do/can elephants cry?\", \"Do/can animals weep?\", and \"Do/can animals cry?\" and found some very interesting answers that ranged all over the place from \"Sure they do\" to \"Probably they do\", to \"No, they don't\" I also looked for various positions on whether or not crying/weeping were associated with various emotions as they are in human animals.\nIn a nutshell, available information supports the view that other animals do cry and weep and that they can be closely associated with various emotions, including, perhaps most likely, sadness and grief that are associated with loss. Of course, crying or weeping may be more hard-wired, in the recent case with the infant elephant responding to a loss of much-needed touch or what is also called \"contact comfort\" offered by his mother.\nIf you're a topical expert \u2014 researcher, business leader, author or innovator \u2014 and would like to contribute an op-ed piece, email us here\nOne worker quoted in the above article noted, \"The calf was very upset and he was crying for five hours before he could be consoled.\" Humans did try to calm him down but their touch is not the same as another elephant's, and of course there could also be visual and olfactory components associated with the potpourri of contact comfort.\nSo, while scientists are not 100-percent certain, solid scientific research supports the view that elephants and other nonhuman animals weep as part of an emotional response. Rather than dismissing this possibility as merely storytelling, we need to study it in more detail. After all, \"the plural of anecdote is data\" and stories and citizen science can and should motivate rigorous scientific research. And, let's not forget that many \"surprises\" have been discovered in the emotional lives of animals, including laughing rats and dogs and empathic chickens, mice and rats \u2014 all published in outstanding peer-reviewed professional journals.\nAt one website called \"Do elephants cry?\" I found the following quote: \"However, we do not know what emotions elephants feel, if any, in the same manner that we do not necessarily know for sure what emotions other people feel. This is simply because we cannot measure emotions, we can only experience them. As a result, science cannot say whether elephants experience emotions, whether other people experience emotions, or what these emotions are like. This is because science requires that we be able to measure something in order to draw any conclusions about it.\"\nI couldn't find the date this answer was posted but it surely does not reflect current or even recent ideas about the study of human and nonhuman emotions. For example, you can read excellent examples of recent work in such books as \"Gifts of the Crow: How Perception, Emotion, and Thought Allow Smart Birds to Behave Like Humans (opens in new tab)\" (Atria Books, 2013) and \"Animal Wise: The Thoughts and Emotions of Our Fellow Creatures (opens in new tab)\" (Crown, 2013)\nAs with many other aspects of the cognitive and emotional lives of animals, it turns out that we are not alone, and that human exceptionalism is more a myth than a fact. So, I offer that we are not the only animals who cry or weep as an emotional response, though I look forward to more research on this topic.\nBekoff's most recent Op-Ed was \"'The Smile of a Dolphin,' Banned in Texas.\" This article was adapted from \"Do Elephants Weep as an Emotional Response?\" in Psychology Today. More of the author's essays are available in \"Why Dogs Hump and Bees Get Depressed (opens in new tab).\" The views expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the publisher.

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "10 facts about zoos | Freedom for Animals", "url": "https://www.freedomforanimals.org.uk/Blogs/blog/10-facts-about-zoos", "text": "Animals should not spend their entire lives in captivity simply to fulfil our desire to see them. Here are our top ten facts about zoos that you need to know...\n1. Zoos are miserable places for animals\nIn 2010, a Freedom for Animals undercover investigator filmed sick animals left untreated and dead animals to rot on floors at Tweddle Farm Zoo. Freedom for Animals had to take rabbits to a vet to have infections treated and after our expose local police confiscated a monkey who had been kept alone and given cake and other junk food to eat.\nThink safari parks are better than \u2018traditional\u2019 zoos? Woburn Safari Park was keeping its lions locked into small enclosures for 18 hours a day. A government zoo inspection report in 2010 said: \u201cThe animals were very crowded and there was no provision for individual feeding or sleeping areas. There was no visible environmental enrichment. Some of the lions exhibited skin wounds and multiple scars of various age, some fresh, some healed.\u201d\nIn late 2012, another safari park was shamed as West Midland Safari Park was exposed for providing white lion cubs to a notorious circus animal trainer, who sent them to a traveling circus in Japan. The Lions remain in the circus today.\nA government-funded study of elephants in UK zoos found \u201cthere was a welfare concern for every elephant in the UK.\u201d 75% of elephants were overweight and only 16% could walk normally, the remainder having various degrees of lameness. Less than 20% were totally free of foot problems.\n2. Zoos can\u2019t provide sufficient space\nZoos cannot provide the amount of space animals have in the wild. This is particularly the case for those species who roam larger distances in their natural habitat. Tigers and lions have around 18,000 times less space in zoos than they would in the wild. Polar bears have one million times less space.\n3. Animals suffer in zoos\nA government-funded study of elephants in UK zoos found that 54% of the elephants showed stereotypies (behavioural problems) during the daytime. One elephant observed during day and night stereotyped for 61% of a 24-hour period.\nLions in zoos spend 48% of their time pacing, a recognised sign of behavioural problems.\n4. Animals die prematurely in zoos\nAfrican elephants in the wild live more than three times as long as those kept in zoos. Even Asian elephants working in timber camps live longer than those born in zoos.\n40% of lion cubs die before one month of age. In the wild, only 30% of cubs are thought to die before they are six months old and at least a third of those deaths are due to factors which are absent in zoos, like predation.\n5. Surplus animals are killed\nA Freedom for Animals study found that at least 7,500 animals \u2013 and possibly as many as 200,000 \u2013 in European zoos are \u2018surplus\u2019 at any one time.\nAnimals are regularly \u2018culled\u2019 in UK zoos. In 2006 the whole pack of wolves at Highland Wildlife Park were killed after the social structure of the pack had broken down. In 2005 two wolf cubs and an adult female were shot dead at Dartmoor Wildlife Park. The vet reported: \u201cSelective cull due to overcrowding and fighting in the pack\u201d and \u201cFurther cull of cubs needed\u201d. In 2001 a DEFRA zoo inspection of Dartmoor Wildlife Park in October 2001 found that \u201cseveral significant dead animals\u201d were stored in a food freezer \u201cfor taxidermy in the future\u201d.\nThe European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) said in 2007 that member zoos were being actively encouraged to kill unwanted animals, including tigers, if other zoos did not want them and if they were hybrids. It said that such animals take up space and keeper time.\nIn 2010, zoo trade bodies rallied to the defence of a German zoo which was prosecuted for breaching animal welfare laws after it killed three tiger cubs because they were not pure-blooded (hybrid).\nIn 2011, an expos\u00e9 of Knowsley Safari Park led by Freedom for Animals following information provided by a whistleblower showed the safari park to be in contravention of legislation on disposal of carcasses as well as raising queries over handling of firearms. A former employee of the safari park alleged: \u201cculling was being used as a means of training instead of being carried out in the kindest and most humane way.\u201d\nIn early 2014, there was global outrage when Copenhagen Zoo killed a healthy young giraffe called Marius. The event triggered a worldwide debate on culling in zoos and it was admitted by zoo spokespeople that thousands of healthy animals are deliberately killed in European zoos alone each year.\n6. UK zoos are connected to animal circuses\nFreedom for Animals exposed a UK zoo in 2009 that was a member of the trade body BIAZA (which supposedly upholds the highest standards) as having a breeding connection with a controversial animal circus. Noah\u2019s Ark Zoo Farm had been breeding camels from the Great British Circus for several years and in 2009 obtained three tigers from the circus.\nA female tiger at the zoo had three stillborn cubs and another who died at three weeks old. The mother also died.\nThe same zoo was found to doing business with another circus animal trainer in 2013. This was the same trainer who had been sold lion cubs by West Midland Safari Park and sent them to a traveling circus in Japan.\n7. Animals are trained to perform tricks\nMany zoos train animals to perform tricks as if they were in a circus. Performing sea lions, birds and elephants can be seen at many UK zoos.\nSome training of elephants has been done using electric goads. Freedom for Animals infiltrated a training session held at Blackpool Zoo in 1998 and filmed elephants being trained to lift their feet and head, hold sticks in their mouths and jabbed with elephant hooks in the shoulder and head.\nIn 2010 it was revealed that an elephant at Woburn Safari Park had previously been trained using an electric goad .\nBlackpool Zoo proudly publicised its training of a baby sea lion for shows in mid 2013 . This is in spite of the fact that the UK Government has agreed to ban similar shows in circuses on the basis that: \u201cwe should feel duty-bound to recognise that wild animals have intrinsic value, and respect their inherent wildness and its implications for their treatment\u201d.\n8. Animals are still taken from the wild\nIn 2003 the UK government gave permission for the capture of 146 penguins from a British territory in the South Atlantic (Tristan da Cunha). Those who survived the seven-day boat journey from Tristan to a wildlife dealer in South Africa were sold to zoos in Asia .\nIn 2010, Zimbabwe planned to capture two of every mammal species found in Hwange National Park and send them to North Korean zoos. This included rhinos, lions, cheetahs, zebras and giraffes as well as two 18-month-old elephants. The plan was only stopped after international pressure by a coalition of organisations including Freedom for Animals.\n70% of elephants in European zoos were taken from the wild .\nA Freedom for Animals study found that 79% of all animals in UK aquariums were caught in the wild. Sea Life aquariums admitted to taking animals from the wild as recently as 2013, but refused to provide information on how many of the animals held by them were wild-caught.\n9. Zoos don\u2019t serve conservation\nZoos claim to breed animals for eventual release to the wild but breeding programmes are primarily to ensure a captive population, not for reintroduction.\nLions are popular in zoos, but the vast majority \u201care \u2018generic\u2019 animals of hybrid or unknown subspecific status, and therefore of little or no value in conservation terms .\nZoo director David Hancocks said: \u201cThere is a commonly held misconception that zoos are not only saving wild animals from extinction but also reintroducing them to their wild habitats. The confusion stems from many sources, all of them zoo-based\u2026 In reality, most zoos have had no contact of any kind with any reintroduction program.\u201d\nCaptive breeding is considered by some conservation scientists to be a diversion from the reasons for a species\u2019 decline, giving \u201ca false impression that a species is safe so that destruction of habitat and wild populations can proceed\u201d.\nZoos spend millions on keeping animals confined, while natural habitats are destroyed and animals killed as there is insufficient funding for protection. When London Zoo spent \u00a35.3 million on a new gorilla enclosure, the chief consultant to the UN Great Ape Survival Project said he was uneasy at the mismatch between lavish spending at zoos and the scarcity of resources available for conserving threatened species in the wild.\n\u201cFive million pounds for three gorillas when national parks are seeing that number killed every day for want of some Land Rovers and trained men and anti-poaching patrols. It must be very frustrating for the warden of a national park to see\u201d.\nMeasures to protect giant pandas\u2019 habitat also supports hundreds of species of mammals, at least 200 birds, dozens of reptiles and over half of the plants known to exist in China .\nIn 2013, Freedom for Animals revealed that the UK\u2019s largest aquarium operator, Sea Life, could trace less than 3 pence per visitor to in situ conservation projects.\n10. Zoos fail education\nA Freedom for Animals study of UK aquariums found that 41% of the animals on display had no signs identifying their species \u2013 the most basic of information.\nA US study found no compelling evidence for the claim that zoos and aquariums promote attitude change, education, or interest in conservation in visitors. The study authors urged zoos to stop citing a zoo-funded study which claimed an educational benefit from visits \u201cas this conclusion is unwarranted and potentially misleading to consumers.\u201d\nIn 2010, a Government-commissioned study found that \u201cConcerns remain, however, with regard to the lack of available evidence about the effectiveness\u201d of conservation and education projects in zoos.\nAnimals in zoos are suffering.

Near threatened LC NT VU EN CR EW EX Least Concern Extinct Current Population Trend : Decreasing\nWhat is the jaguar?\nJaguars are the only big cat in the Americas and the third biggest in the world after tigers and lions. They look a lot like leopards, which live in Africa and Asia, but jaguars\u2019 spots are more complex and often have a dot in the center.\nThese powerful cats were worshipped as gods in many ancient South American cultures, and representations of the jaguar show up in the art and archaeology of pre-Columbian cultures across the jaguar\u2019s range.\nDiet and behavior\nUnlike many other cats, jaguars do not avoid water. In fact, they are quite good swimmers. They hunt fish, turtles, and even caimans, using their incredibly powerful jaws to pierce the animals\u2019 skulls. Jaguars also eat deer, peccaries, capybaras, tapirs, and a number of other land animals, which they prefer to ambush at night.\nJaguars live alone, and they\u2019re territorial\u2014they define their area by marking with their waste or clawing trees.\nFemales have litters of one to four cubs, which are blind and helpless at birth. The mother stays with them and defends them fiercely from any animal that may approach\u2014even their own father. Young jaguars learn to hunt by living with their mothers for two years or more.\nRange and habitat\nJaguars once roamed broadly from central Argentina all the way up to the southwestern United States. Since the 1880s, they\u2019ve lost more than half their territory. Their main stronghold today is the Amazon Basin, though they still exist in smaller numbers through Central America as well.\nThey\u2019re typically found in tropical rainforests but also live in savannas and grasslands.\nThreats to survival\nJaguars face a number of threats, including habitat fragmentation and illegal killing. South and Central America\u2019s high rates of deforestation\u2014for grazing land, agriculture, and other uses\u2014have not only destroyed jaguars\u2019 habitat but also broken it up. Fragmented forests mean that cats get boxed into patches of forest and can\u2019t travel far to find new mates. That kind of isolation can lead to inbreeding and local extinctions.\nAnother threat jaguars face is retaliatory killings from ranchers. As grazing land replaces forests, jaguars are more likely to hunt cattle. In response\u2014and sometimes in anticipation\u2014cattle owners kill jaguars.\nPoaching is another growing problem for jaguars. They\u2019ve long been hunted for their pelts, and now there\u2019s a growing illegal, international trade in jaguar teeth and jaguar bone products going to China.\nConservation\nJaguars are classified as near-threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The species has national protections in almost every country it\u2019s found, and trade in its parts is banned by CITES, a global treaty that regulates the cross-border wildlife trade. Still, poaching and the illegal trade continues so strengthening law enforcement is important.\nThere are major efforts to support and develop jaguar corridors to connect isolated populations as well as to work with ranchers to reduce human-jaguar conflict. Workshops help ranchers learn better husbandry practices, and a growing number of programs compensate ranchers when they lose cattle to jaguars, so that they\u2019re less motivated to kill the cat in retaliation.\nFighting deforestation, which a number of international NGOs and indigenous groups are involved in, is critical.\n2:01"}

{"animal": "elephant", "title": "Ammonites, facts and photos - Animals", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/facts/ammonites", "text": "Common Name : Ammonites/Ammonoids Scientific Name : Ammonoidea Type : Prehistoric Animals Diet : Carnivore Size : From less than an inch to more than nine feet in diameter Size relative to a 6-ft man :\nWith squidlike tentacles extending from their distinctive multichambered shells, the extinct marine predators known as ammonites were once among the most successful and diverse animals on Earth. Scientists have identified more than 10,000 species from fossils found nearly everywhere on the planet where oceans once existed, from the Great Plains of North America to the foothills of the Himalaya and the glaciers of Antarctica.\nAmmonite is actually the colloquial term for ammonoids, a large and diverse group of creatures that arose during the Devonian period, which began about 416 million years ago. Ammonoids are related to other cephalopods\u2014such as squid, octopuses, and cuttlefish\u2014and they were early relatives of the modern nautilus. Meanwhile, true ammonites are a suborder of ammonoids that didn\u2019t appear until about 200 million years ago , in the Jurassic period.\nDuring their long history, ammonites survived three mass extinctions\u2014most notably the Permian extinction, a global warming that was brought on by volcanic activity about 252 million years ago, and that killed 96 percent of the planet\u2019s marine species. While many species of ammonites died out in that extinction event, scientists believe the survivors diversified explosively in the million years that followed. Ammonites hunted the planet\u2019s seas until they were entirely wiped out by the same cataclysm that claimed the non-avian dinosaurs about 66 million years ago.\nAppearance and behavior\nBased on the fossil record, ammonites came in a wide range of sizes and shapes, from smaller than an inch to as large as nine feet wide. Some ammonites had long, straight shells, while others had helix-shaped shells. Most species, however, had coiled shells lined with progressively larger chambers separated by thin walls called septa.\nThe animals constantly grew new shell material as they aged, but the their bodies always remained in the outer chamber. The walls that separated each chamber helped protect the shell from being crushed. They were connected to the shell by intricate lines known as sutures\u2014the complexity of which varied tremendously throughout this animal\u2019s evolution.\nThe many chambers of their shells likely helped these cephalopods glide through the planet\u2019s warm, shallow seas. A thin, tubelike structure called a siphuncle pumped air through the interior chambers of the shell, which scientists believe helped provide buoyancy and move ammonites through the water. It\u2019s unclear whether ammonites were very efficient swimmers, though.\nScientists believed that ammonites, like modern cephalopods, had soft body tissue with tentacles attached to their heads for catching prey. Fossil evidence indicates they had sharp, beaklike jaws to snare prey such as plankton, crustaceans, and other ammonites. They were also preyed on by larger reptiles and fish.\nEvolution and extinction\nAs ammonites evolved throughout the Mesozoic era, between 252 and 66 million years ago, their shell structures grew smaller, more tightly coiled, and more complex. Early ammonites had simple suture lines traced across their shells, while the sutures on species from the Cretaceous period (145 to 66 million years ago) formed intricate patterns that may have given later ammonites greater buoyancy control.\nThe ammonites came to an end 66 million years ago, during the planet\u2019s most recent mass extinction event. In the final days of the Cretaceous, a 7.5-mile-wide asteroid slammed into Earth and killed off more than three-quarters of all species on the planet. Some scientists hypothesize that the ammonites couldn\u2019t survive the aftermath because of the sudden decline of their main food source: marine plankton.\nAmmonite shells are used today as index fossils, meaning they can help date other fossils that are found in the same layer of marine rock. These cephalopods make for ideal index fossils because they are abundant, widespread, and their various species lived during distinct time periods that can be easily identified by their suture patterns. Ammonite fossils also reveal information about ancient climates, as the sites where they are unearthed must have once been covered by ancient seas."}

The catfish also has approximately 100,000 taste buds. (Humans have only 10,000 taste buds.)\nFish (Deep sea) Only have rods in the retina: 25 million rods/sq. mm. Perhaps they need this high density of photoreceptors to detect the dim biolumninescence that exists in the ocean depths.\nFish (Drum Fish) Collects underwater sound vibrations with an air bladder. The signals are then sent from the air bladder to the \"weberian apparatus\" in the middle ear and then to the inner ear. Hair cells in the inner ear respond to the vibration and transmit sound information to the fish brain.\nFish (\"Four-eyed Fish\" Anableps microlepis) Can see in air and water simultaneously. Each eye is divided by flaps, so there is one opening in the air and one in the water.\nFly Each eye has 3,000 lenses. (Simmons and Young, 1999)\nEye has a flicker fusion rate of 300/sec. Humans have a flicker fusion rate of only 60/sec in bright light and 24/sec in dim light. The flicker fusion rate is the frequency with which the \"flicker\" of an image cannot be distinguished as an individual event.

By tasting this way, an octopus does not have to leave the safety of its home.\nPenguin Has a flat cornea that allows for clear vision underwater.\nPenguins can also see into the ultraviolet range of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nPig Tongue contains 15,000 taste buds. For comparison, the human tongue has 9,000 taste buds.\nXan smell truffles under six inches of soil.\nPigeon With eyes mounted laterally on their heads, pigeons can view 340 degrees...everywhere except in back of their heads.\nCan detect sounds as low as 0.1 Hz.\nPlatypus Has electric sensors in its bill that can detect 0.05 microvolts. Other receptors in the bill are for touch and temperature detection.\nThe cochlea of the inner ear is coiled only a quarter of a turn. In man, the cochlea is coiled about 2.7 times.\nRabbit Tongue contains 17,000 taste buds.\nRat Has hearing range between 1,000 and 90,000 Hz.\nSeahorse Each eye can move independently.\nScallop Has 100 eyes around the edge of the shell.

These receptors may be used to locate prey. The dogfish can detect a flounder that is buried under the sand and emitting 4 uAmp of current.\nSome sharks can detect fish extracts as concentrations lower than one part in 10 billion.\nSome sharks sense light directly through the skull by the pineal body.\nThe thresher shark has an eye up to 5 inches (12.5 cm) in diameter. The last three facts are from D.Perrine, Sharks and Rays of the World, Stillwater: Voyaguer Press, 1999.\nSnakes Pit-vipers have a heat-sensitive organ between the eyes and the nostrils about 0.5 cm deep. This organ has a membrane containing 7,000 nerve endings that respond to temperature changes as small as 0.002-0.003 degrees centigrade. A rattlesnake can detect a mouse 40 cm away if the mouse is 10 degrees centigrade above the outside temperature.\nThe tongue of snakes has no taste buds. Instead, the tongue is used to bring smells and tastes into the mouth. Smells and tastes are then detected in two pits, called \"Jacobson's organs\", on the roof of their mouths. Receptors in the pits then transmit smell and taste information to the brain.\nSnakes have no external ears. Therefore, they do not hear the music of a \"snake charmer\". Instead, they are probably responding to the movements of the snake charmer and the flute. However, sound waves may travel through bones in their heads to the middle ear.\nSnakes have no moveable eyelids. Instead, they have a clear, scale-like membrane covering the eye.\nSparrow Retina has 400,000 photoreceptors per sq. mm."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Hyena images!\nHyenas are animals that are biologically closer to cats than dogs.\nHumans tend to make snap judgments about these animals. We think of them as savage gluttons with demonic laughs. But it\u2019s an unfair characterization. In reality, they are sociable and smart. Plus, they play a vital role in the African, Middle Eastern, and Asian ecosystems. Hyenas rival lions in terms of predatory prowess and the spotted hyena\u2019s community structure will make you shout, \u201cno way!\u201d So, let\u2019s abandon our assumptions and dive into the wild and wondrous world of these animals.\n9 Fascinating Hyena Facts\nTalking hyenas are a staple in Disney animated features, including Dumbo, Lady and the Tramp, Noah\u2019s Ark, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, and, of course, The Lion King.\nIn 1999, the lions and hyenas of Ethiopia\u2019s Gobele wilderness went to war. The situation grew so deadly that the military intervened. In the end, the lions killed 35 hyenas, and the hyenas managed to kill six lions.\nIn some parts of Somalia, these animals are a delicacy.\nSome species have bright white feces due to the large amount of calcified bones they eat.\nFemales dominate in spotted hyena clans.\nContrary to popular belief, hyenas have more in common with cats than dogs.\nThe 26th president of the United States, Teddy Roosevelt, maintained an animal menagerie that included a hyena.\nAncient Greeks and Romans believed hyena parts were effective shields against evil and ensured fertility.\nHyenas have one of the strongest bite forces in the animal kingdom. The spotted hyena has a bite force of 1,100 PSI, whih is slightly below a polar bear\u2019s bite force of 1,200 PSI. Hyenas have a bite force that\u2019s greater than lions.\nScientific Name\nThe scientific name for hyena is Hyaenidae, which doubles as the animal\u2019s taxonomic family that includes four extant species dispersed over three genera.\nThese include:\nAardwolf (Proteles cristata)\nBrown hyena (Hyaena brunnea)\nSpotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta)\nStriped hyena (Hyaena hyaena)\nAardwolf Scientific Name\nThe scientific name for aardwolves \u2014 which means \u201cearth-wolves\u201d in the Afrikaans and Dutch languages \u2014 is Proteles cristata. Proteles is a portmanteau of two ancient Greek words, teleos and protos, which roughly translate to \u201ccomplete\u201d and \u201cfront or first,\u201d respectively. Combined, they mean \u201ccomplete in front,\u201d a reference to the aardwolf\u2019s five-toed front feet.\nCristata derives from the Latin word \u201ccristatus,\u201d which means \u201cprovided with a comb,\u201d a reference to the animal\u2019s mane.\nOther names for aardwolf include \u201cmaanhaar-jackal,\u201d \u201cany hyena,\u201d \u201ctermite-eating hyena,\u201d and \u201ccivet hyena.\u201d The Nama people use \u201c|g\u012bb\u201d to label the animal.\nBrown Hyena Scientific Name\nHyaena brunnea is the scientific name for the brown hyena. Hyaena derives from the ancient Greek word \u201chyaina,\u201d which evolved from \u201chys,\u201d meaning hog or pig. Under the Roman pen, hyaina became hyaena, and when Middle English emerged as the prominent language, hyaena morphed into hyena.\nBrunnea comes from the Latin word \u201cbrunneus,\u201d which means \u201cbrown.\u201d\nBrown hyenas are also known as strandwolves.\nSpotted Hyena Scientific Name\nThe scientific name for the spotted hyena is Crocuta crocuta. For decades, people thought \u201ccrocuta\u201d came from the Latin word \u201ccrocutus,\u201d which means \u201csaffron-colored one,\u201d but they were wrong. The taxonomic label for spotted hyenas comes from the ancient Greek word \u201c\u039a\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2,\u201d which translates to \u201cgolden jackal.\u201d\nColloquially, spotted hyenas are also known as laughing hyenas.\nStriped Hyena Scientific Name\nHyaena hyaena is the scientific name for striped hyenas. As we discussed under the brown hyena section, Hyaena derives from the ancient word \u201chyaina,\u201d which relates to wild pigs. The Greeks associated the two animals because they both had manes.\nHyena Appearance\nThese animals belong to the carnivorous suborder Feliformia \u2014 sometimes called Feloidea \u2014 which includes meat-eating mammals with \u201ccat-like\u201d physical and behavioral features. Currently, there are four species of these animals scavenging throughout large swaths of Africa, the Middle East, and Eurasia.\nGenerally speaking, hyenas are four-legged animals with scraggly fur and large ears. Interestingly, they have both feline and canine features, and all sport manes. They also have downward sloping spines, long front legs, and short hind legs. Learn about the ugliest animals on earth here.\nAardwolves, brown -, and striped hyenas have lined coats. The spotted hyena, as its name suggests, sports dotted pelage. Like dogs, their short claws are non-retractable, but they have more ribs than canids and rough tongues similar to felines.\nMale individuals in the aardwolf, striped, and spotted hyena species are usually larger than their female counterparts. In the spotted variety community, however, the women are bigger. They dominant the males and even have external genitalia.\nHow Big Are Hyenas?\nHyenas vary in size depending on the species and sex.\nSpecies Sex Average Height Average Length Average Weight Aardwolf Female 16 to 20 inches 22 to 31 inches 15 to 22 pounds Aardwolf Male 16 to 20 inches 22 to 31 inches 15 to 22 pounds Brown Female 28 to 31 inches 51 to 63 inches 83 to 89 pounds Brown Male 28 to 31 inches 51 to 63 inches 89 to 96 pounds Spotted Female 28 to 36 inches 37 to 65 inches 98 to 153 pounds Spotted Male 28 to 36 inches 37 to 65 inches 89 to 149 pounds Striped Female 24 to 31 inches 33 to 51 inches 49 to 121 pounds Striped Male 24 to 31 inches 33 to 51 inches 49 to 121 pounds\nHyena Behavior\nLike house cats, these animals are avid groomers that also mark territory, but they use anal glands instead of urination. They\u2019re primarily a nocturnal species, though spotted hyenas occasionally venture out during the day, especially if humans aren\u2019t poking around.\nThe striped variety typically lives alone or in pairs, though some populations travel in packs up to seven-deep. Spotted hyenas are the exception. Exceptionally sociable, they live in highly organized communities of up to 80 individuals. Matriarchal and monarchical by nature, females of the species dominate. Plus, when a pack leader dies, her oldest daughter automatically takes over!\nMostly they burrow in caves and under crevices. Striped hyenas also dig dens.\nThe animals vocalize loudly and frequently. However, not all species laugh, as is often assumed. In fact, spotted hyenas are the only extant species known for laughing. Notably, they use about a dozen distinct grunts, laughs, and barks to communicate with their clan members about food and migration efficiently.\nHyena Habitat\nThese animals live throughout Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. Aardwolves roam in southern and eastern Africa, whereas brown hyenas stick to South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana, with some overflow into Angola, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique. The spotted variety\u2019s range is central, western, and southern Africa, though very few live in South Africa. Striped hyenas cover northern Africa, the Middle East, and large swaths of India.\nAardwolves live in bushlands and heavily grazed arid plains where termites \u2014 an essential part of their diet \u2014 are plentiful. Typically, aardwolves stay in the same place for about six weeks and cluster their dens together.\nDeserts and coastal lands are where you\u2019ll find the brown variety, whereas spotted populations favor woodlands, savannahs, semi-deserts, and hilly forests below 4,000 meters. Striped hyenas prefer dry woodlands in mountainous regions, savannahs, and dense grasslands. Typically, they make dens in rocky outcrops, ravines, and crevices.\nHyena Diet\nThese animals are primarily scavengers, but they also kill prey. As carnivores, they mostly consume meat but have been known to supplement their diets with fruit in tough times. They are also members of the \u201cclean plate club,\u201d meaning they eat every last bit of a kill, including bones and hooves. Plus, they aren\u2019t particularly picky about what type of meat they eat.\nThese animals have digestive systems made of steel! So much so that field scientists and anthropologists often report of them feasting on inanimate objects, like tires and tent materials.\nAardwolf Diet\nAardwolves\u2019 primary source of nourishment is termites from the genus Trinervitermes. Using sound and scent clues, aardwolves locate the crawlers and lick them off the ground using their sticky tongues. In a single night, an individual aardwolf may consume upwards of 250,000 insects. Conscious of their constant need for sustenance, aardwolves never eat an entire pile of termites. Instead, they leave it partly intact, and the mound serves as a replenishing source.\nThe aardwolf diet differs from other hyena species because it doesn\u2019t include any carrion, which is the meat of an already killed animal. Instead, aardwolves stick to insects and larva.\nBrown Hyena Diet\nThese animals aren\u2019t great hunters. As such, they rely on carcasses killed by other predators. They also supplement their meals with rodents, insects, eggs, fruit, and fungi.\nSpotted Hyena Diet\nSpotted hyenas, arguably the most aggressive Hyaenidae species, differ from their cousins because they primarily hunt prey instead of sticking to carrion. Except for spotted populations in west Africa, who largely scavenge for meat, the species preys on large, hooved, plant-eating animals, including, but not limited to, wildebeests, giraffes, gazelles, impalas, gemsboks, sheep, goats, and cattle. They\u2019ve also been known to catch fish, and, on rare occasions, humans!\nThese animals have huge appetites. A single individual can pack away up to 32 pounds of meat in a single feeding!\nStriped Hyena Diet\nThese animals are scavengers who eat almost any meat, though they turn their noses up at vulture flesh. They also feast liberally on bones and bone marrow.\nHyena Predators and Threats\nLions are These animals\u2019 primary foe even though the former usually don\u2019t eat the latter. But lions see them as fellow apex predators and will kill them to reduce competition. Similarly, in the Middle East, striped hyenas compete with wolves for food. But at times, the two animals cooperate and travel in joint-species hunting packs.\nLeopards also prey on these animals in certain regions.\nAccording to conservationists, aardwolf and spotted hyenas currently enjoy stable wild populations and don\u2019t face imminent extinction. Striped and brown varieties aren\u2019t as fortunate because humans are increasingly encroaching on their natural habitats and killing them at alarming rates using traps, poison, and wire snares. Farmers often eliminate brown hyenas in retaliation for livestock deaths. In reality, though, they don\u2019t kill prey; they only scavenge for dead animals, which sometimes includes already deceased livestock.\nHyena Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan\nHyena Reproduction\nSpotted, brown, and aardwolf hyenas copulate with several partners in a lifetime. Striped hyenas, on the other hand, are monogamous, meaning they mate with the same partner for most of their lives.\nFor the spotted variety, mating is an awkward and tricky process since both the male and female have genitalia on the outside of their bodies. The male has to position himself just right in order to successfully mate with the female. This process often is described as a dance because of all the jumping around he has to do.\nSpecies Gestation Period Mating Season Litter Size Parental Responsibility Aardwolf 89 to 92 days Spring or Autumn depending on location; July in South Africa 2 to 5 cubs Both parents raise cubs Brown 90 days May to August, but occasionally mate out of season 1 to 5 Cubs Males help provide food for cubs Spotted 110 days All year, but prefer wet season 2 Cubs No male help Striped 90 to 91 days Either January and February or October and November depending on location 1 to 6 Cubs Both parents raise cubs\nBabies\nThe babies are called cubs. At birth, aardwolves, brown, and striped hyenas are born with closed eyes and require adult help. Spotted hyenas, however, are born fully developed, with open eyes and teeth!\nLifespan\nThese animals usually live for about 12 years, but they can live up to 25 years. Brown hyenas, however, typically have shorter lives.\nThe oldest specimen ever was a male spotted hyena named Mars who lived in the Honolulu Zoo with his brother, Whoops. Both arrived in 1992, and both had unusually long lives. Mars broke the record with 28.5 years, and Whoops made it to 26!\nPopulation\nAccording to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, aardwolves and spotted hyenas are populations of least concern, meaning they\u2019re currently not in danger of extinction. However, brown and striped hyenas are classified as near threatened, and scientists are employing conservation efforts to combat declining population numbers.\nView all 71 animals that start with H"}

The other is the platypus. Interestingly, both animals are found in Australia. Echidnas are also found in New Guinea. Every other mammal gives birth to live young. Like other mammals, the echidna also feeds its young with milk, is warm blooded and has fur.\n5 Incredible Echidna facts\nOne species of Echidna (Zaglossus attenboroughi) is named in honor of Sir David Attenborough!\nThe Echidna is earth\u2019s oldest living mammal, with evolution that dates back to the era of the dinosaurs!\nThe Echidna is one of the most genetically unique animals alive today, with characteristics rarely seen in other species.\nThe Echidna has the lowest body temperature of any mammal on earth today\nEchidnas are one of only four non-aquatic species that uses electroreception to locate food. The others are platypuses, cockroaches, and bees.\nScientific names\nThese are four species of echidna. Their scientific names are:\nZaglossus bruijni\nZaglossus attenboroughi\nZaglossus bartoni\nTachyglossus aculeatus.\nThe Zaglossus echidnas are native to New Guinea and the Tachyglossus echidna is native to Australia. As for the meaning of their names:\nZaglossus means \u201cthrough the tongue\u201d in Greek. It\u2019s also called the Cyclops long-beaked echidna because it is from the Cyclops Mountains in New Guinea.\nZaglossus bruijni was named after the Dutch naturalist Antonie Augustus Bruijn, and Zaglossus bartoni, the eastern long-beaked echidna was probably named after the naturalist Benjamin Smith Barton. Zaglossus attenboroughi is named after the eminent English naturalist Sir David Attenborough.\nTachyglossus comes from the Greek for \u201cquick\u201d and \u201ctongue.\u201d Aculeatus means \u201cspiny.\u201d\nAppearance and behavior\nEchidnas are animals that have robust bodies and beaks through which they extrude a sticky tongue that can lap up ants, earthworms or termites. They defend themselves by rolling into a ball, very much like an aardvark or a hedgehog and presenting their spines. Echidna spines are made of keratin, like human fingernails. They have surprisingly large brains for their size and well developed cerebral cortices.\nThe eastern long-beaked echidna, Zaglossus bartoni, differs from its cousins in that it has five claws on its front feet and four claws on its back feet. It can weigh between 11 and 22 pounds and is from two to a little over three feet long. It has spurs on its back legs like the platypus. Both males and females are born with spurs, and they are not venomous, unlike the spurs of the male platypus. Females lose their spurs, but males keep them. Female eastern long-beaked echidnas are also bigger than males.\nThere are four subspecies of Zaglossus bartoni. They are Zaglossus bartoni bartoni, Zaglossus bartoni clunius and Zaglossus bartoni smeenki both of which have five claws on all of their feet and Zaglossus bartoni diamondi, which is the biggest member of the species.\nZaglossus bruijni, or the western long-beaked echidna, is the largest of all the egg laying mammals. It can weigh up to 36 pounds and has long fur along with spines. It has three claws on its feet and a short tail. The snout curves down and makes up most of the length of the animal\u2019s head. It doesn\u2019t have teeth but there are teeth-like projections on its tongue. The number of claws a member of Zaglossus bruijni has seems to depend on the individual. Some have claws on the middle three digits of a five digit foot while others have five claws. Only the males have spurs.\nSir David\u2019s long-beaked echidna, or Zaglossus attenboroughi is the smallest of the Zaglossus echidnas. It weighs between 11 and 22 pounds. In this case the male is bigger than the female, and only he has spurs on his feet. It has dense, fine fur and only a few white spines. Its lack of external genitalia gives it and other echidnas the order name of Monotremata. This means that the animal excretes, mates and lays eggs through one opening called a cloaca. Females also develop pouches.\nZaglossus attenboroughi is nocturnal and like other echidnas rolls up into a bristling ball when it\u2019s threatened. Its snout is about 2.8 inches long and a bit straighter than that of the other species.\nTachyglossus aculeatus is the short-beaked echidna, named because of the speed with which its tongue catches its prey. Like other echidnas, it is toothless and does not have external ears. It weighs between 4 and 15 pounds and is 12 to 18 inches long. Hardened pads are found at the back of the animal\u2019s mouth, and males have spurs on their hind legs. This echidna has powerful front legs and claws much like a mole. This lets it burrow into the ground quickly. It is adapted to living underground because it can tolerate environments with low oxygen and high carbon dioxide. It cannot sweat, so it stays in its borrow during the hottest part of the day.\nThe short-beaked echidna hibernates or goes into torpor during the winter.\nUnlike the Zaglossus echidnas, the short-beaked echidna is abundant and found in nearly all Australian habitats and into the eastern part of New Guinea.\nHabitat\nThe echidna is an animal that prefers moderate temperatures and can be found escaping heat in shaded areas like tunnels, fallen logs, caves, or even burrowing underground. The Zaglossus echidnas live in forests high in the mountains or in alpine meadows and tend to avoid the coast. They are found in New Guinea and Australia.\nDiet\nLong-beaked echidnas eat worms and insect larvae, while short-beaked echidnas eat mostly ants and termites. Similar to anteaters, echidnas use their specially adapted snouts and tongues to extract these small prey from hard to reach places. Echidnas also use an electroreceptive system to locate their food. They have 400-2,000 receptors in their snouts, making them incredibly sensitive to subterranean movements and therefore able to locate prey easily. While this adaptation is common in aquatic or amphibious animals, echidnas are one of only four non aquatic species with this adaption. The others are platypus, bees, and cockroaches.\nOther incredible Echidna adaptations\nUnusually, the Echidna not only lays eggs like a reptile, they have a pouch like a kangaroo, protective spikes like a porcupine (though not hollow like a porcupines) a snout like an anteater, and a spiky tongue for extracting hard to reach food. With the lowest body temperature of any mammal and a slow metabolism echidnas can live up to 50 years in captivity.\nPredators and threats\nThe greatest threat to echidnas is hunting. Aboriginal Australians consider the small creature to be a food delicacy. Though the short-beaked echidna\u2019s conservation status is Least Concern, the other echidnas are vulnerable or critically endangered. Indeed, one species might even be extinct.\nZaglossus bruijni is critically endangered thanks to the loss of its habitat and hunting. People in Papua, where it lives, consider it a delicacy. However, hunting it has been banned save under special circumstances.\nThe eastern long-beaked echidna\u2019s conservation status is Vulnerable because of habitat loss and hunting by both humans and feral dogs. However, its status has improved from critically endangered.\nEchidnas are also put in danger by parasites such as tapeworms, which they get by drinking water used by infected animals.\nReproduction, babies, and lifespan\nEchidnas are solitary and only come together to mate. After they mate, the females raise the babies exclusively. Most people do not know the exact mating habits of Zaglossus echidnas because they are so scarce, and it is difficult to even place tracking devices on them because of their spines. Biologists assume that these echidnas mate and reproduce much like their cousin Tachyglossus aculeatus.\nCaptive short-beaked echidnas reach sexual maturity when they\u2019re between five and 12 years, and females lay eggs from between every other year to every six years. There are no special names for male and female echidnas, probably because it took people so long to find out which sex was which.\nDuring the mating season, which is between June and August, the female is followed by one or a group of males. Males follow in single file in what\u2019s called an \u201cechidna train.\u201d This can go on for a few days or for weeks, but the female only mates once per season and only with one male.\nThe female is pregnant for about 23 days, and during that time she creates a nursery burrow. She lays one egg in her pouch. Echidna eggs are leathery and cream colored. They are about a half an inch in diameter and weigh between .053 and .071 of an ounce. The egg hatches in 10 days, and the baby helps itself escape with an egg tooth, much like a chicken.\nBaby echidnas are called puggles, and they are about 0.6 inches long and weigh between .011 and .014 of an ounce. They leave the pouch and attach themselves to areas on their mother\u2019s chest that secrete milk. These are not the nipples or teats found in other animals, but patches. The milk oozes out from dozens of tiny pores. The milk is so rich that it is sometimes pink from its iron content. This allows the baby to go for long periods without feeding while the mother leaves the burrow to look for food. Most puggles nurse for about 200 days, then leave the burrow soon after. When this happens, the baby and its mother cease to have contact.\nPopulation\n\u2022 Biologists believe there are between 5 and 50 million short-beaked echidnas in Australia, though they are much more rare in New Guinea.\n\u2022 The numbers of Zaglossus bruijni are in severe decline, and the animal may be extinct\n\u2022 There about 10,000 adult Zaglossus bartoni as of 2015.\n\u2022 Though the number of adult Zaglossus attenboroughi is unknown, its population is also decreasing.\nView all 68 animals that start with E"}

The skull shape also differs between the two.\nWhat is the largest breed of elephant?\nThe African savanna elephant is the largest elephant species, while the Asian forest elephant and the African forest elephant are of a comparable, smaller size.\nWhat is the largest land animal?\nThe Antarctic blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus ssp. Intermedia) is the biggest animal on the planet, weighing up to 400,000 pounds (approximately 33 elephants) and reaching up to 98 feet in length.\nWhat is the largest mammal on land?\nThe largest animal on Earth based on weight is the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), which can weigh up to 160 tonnes (352,739 lb).\nWhat is the maximum height of elephant?\nIn fact, the elephant is the largest living land mammal in the world. A male elephant can grow up to 4 metres in height and weigh up to 7 tonnes; whilst their females counterparts can still weigh in at a mere 3.5 tonnes.\nWhat was the biggest mammal ever?\nAs the largest land mammal ever to live at 25 feet in length, 17 feet tall and nearly weighing 18 tons; this replica dwarfs the T-Rex skeleton that used to take up its footprint but has since moved into the lobby. However, the blue whale still casts a mighty shadow over the Indricotherium.\nWhat were whales ancestors?\nBoth hippos and whales evolved from four-legged, even-toed, hoofed (ungulate) ancestors that lived on land about 50 million years ago. Modern-day ungulates include hippopotamus, giraffe, deer, pig and cow.\nWhat\u2019s bigger a mammoth or mastodon?\nWhile similar in size and stature, fossil evidence shows that mastodons were slightly smaller than mammoths, with shorter legs and lower, flatter heads. \u2026 Both animals were herbivores, but mastodons had cone-shaped cusps on their molars designed to crush leaves, twigs and branches.\nWhat\u2019s bigger an elephant or a hippo?\nFat \u2014 but Fast! Hippos are the second-largest land animal \u2014 second only to elephants. Male hippos can weigh more than 6,000 pounds. Females are more \u201cdelicate,\u201d topping out around 3,000 pounds.\nWhat\u2019s bigger rhino or hippo?\nAlthough both animals come in multiple species, white rhinoceroses are the biggest of all rhinos, and common hippopotamuses are the bigger of the two existing hippo varieties. White rhinoceroses, however, are larger than common hippopotamuses, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society.\nWhat\u2019s the biggest animal on land?\nThe Antarctic blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus ssp. Intermedia) is the biggest animal on the planet, weighing up to 400,000 pounds (approximately 33 elephants) and reaching up to 98 feet in length.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between a mammoth and an elephant?\nMammoths were heavier than elephants, with much longer tusks. They were more twisted than elephant tusks, and could grow up to 16 feet long. In comparison, the longest ever elephant tusks were 11 feet and 7 inches in length. \u2026 Both sexes of mammoths and African elephants have tusks.\nWhat\u2019s the toughest animal in the world?\nTardigrades are the toughest animals on Earth.\nWhich african countries have the most elephants?\nBotswana is currently home to more elephants than any other African country, and southern Africa remains a stronghold for 293,000, or 70%, of the estimated remaining African elephants. African elephants are highly social creatures that live in herds led by older, single female matriarchs.\nWhich animal has heaviest and largest brain?\nFun Facts. The sperm whale has the biggest brain of any animal species, weighing up to 20 pounds (7 to 9 kilograms). Larger brains don\u2019t necessarily make a smarter mammal.\nWhich elephant is larger after maturity?\nMale African bush elephants are typically 23% taller than females, whereas male Asian elephants are only around 15% taller than females.\nWhich elephant is the strongest?\nAfrican Bush Elephant What\u2019s the most powerful animal in the world? African bush elephants are the world\u2019s largest land animals, and the strongest mammals, able to carry up to 9,000 kg \u2013 the weight of 130 humans!\nWhich insects do elephants not like?\nElephants are afraid of bees. Let that sink in for a second. The largest animal on land is so terrified of a tiny insect that it will flap its ears, stir up dust and make noises when it hears the buzz of a beehive. Of course a bee\u2019s stinger can\u2019t penetrate the thick hide of an elephant.\nWhich is bigger elephant or blue whale?\nThe largest land-dwelling mammal on earth, at seven tons, the African elephant is smaller than the blue whale for good reason: The buoyancy of water helps to counteract the blue whale\u2019s weight, and elephants are terrestrial.\nWhich is the most beautiful elephant in world?\nPampady Rajan Species Elephas maximus (Asian Elephant) Owner Shobit M Thomas Height 3.08\u20133.14 m (10 ft 11\u20442 in\u201310 ft 31\u20442 in)\nWhich is the most intelligent mammal after humans on the earth?\nElephants are also extremely caring and empathetic to other members of their group and to other species, which is considered as a highly advanced form of intelligence. The great apes are considered to be the smartest creatures after humans.\nWhich tiger is bigger siberian or bengal?\nMain Differences Between Siberian Tigers and Bengal Tigers The length of the Siberian tiger is around 10 to 12 feet while the length of the Bengal tiger is around 8 to 10 feet. The weight of the Siberian tiger is around 675 pounds while the weight of the Bengal tiger is around 525 pounds.\nWho is stronger african elephant or asian elephant?\nAfrican Elephant Asian Elephant Weight 4000 \u2013 7000 kg 3000 \u2013 6000 kg Shoulder height 3 \u2013 4 Meter 2 \u2013 3.5 Meter Skin More wrinkled Smoother\nWho wins elephant or hippo?\nDepends on the individuals, but generally the elephant will win. It\u2019s much larger, stronger, and has tusks that could impale the hippo. The hippo, on the other hand, has a powerful bite, but nothing that could hurt the elephant before the elephant kicks or impales it.\nWho would win hippo vs elephant?\nIn an elephant vs hippo fight, the elephant is going to win. Assuming both creatures are fully grown adults, the elephant is just too big for the hippo to handle. Hippos are too smart to pick a fight with an elephant, so they have no idea what it takes to bring one down.\nWhy are african elephants so large?\nBody and brain size Elephants were also helped by the fact that they became so big. Being large opens up a whole new world of advantages: it deters predators and when food resources and water are scarce, a large body can store more fat and water, and a larger gut can digest food more efficiently."}

Antlers differ from horns in that they are not permanent and are regularly shed and regrown.\nIn Eurasia, it is believed that the reindeer has been domesticated for nearly 7,000 years - longer than the horse!\nIt is the only species of deer to be domesticated, and also the only species of deer in which both the male and the female grow antlers.\nIn North America reindeer are known as caribou, and, in general, since the term \"reindeer\" represents the family or type of deer, one could say all caribou are reindeer, but not all reindeer are caribou.\nThe North American caribou is approximately 3 subspecies of reindeer which are larger and stockier than the European and Asian reindeer. In addition, although in some reindeer species the female does not have antlers, the females of all North American subspecies do have antlers. Finally, the North American caribou has not been domesticated and is generally a wild animal.\nSome of the subtle and various differences between the other subspecies can be attributed to domestication. The various reindeer subspecies in Eurasia vary in appearance from region to region from Greenland, to Siberia to Scandinavia etc.\nLocal customs and breeding habits naturally cause change as well. There are still wild reindeer in the farthest reaches of Siberia, Norway, Greenland and Finland, but the vast majority of Eurasian reindeer are domestic animals.\nDomestication has occurred for so long that these reindeer sometimes have a \"pinto\" type coloring. The European and Asian native peoples have completely domesticated the reindeer, and their lifestyle is dependent on their relationship with the calm and good-natured domestic reindeer.\nIn Europe, Scandinavia and Asia, the reindeer is used not just for food and fur, but also for milk, as a pack animal, as a pet, and of course for pulling sleighs!\nFor the caribou of Alaska and Canada no such domestication has ever occurred. In general, the native people of Alaska and Canada do not herd or maintain caribou, they simply follow wild herds and hunt individual animals as needed for food and fur.\nThere are dozens of herds of wild caribou in the state of Alaska and their population there is estimated to be more than one million strong.\nthe nomadic reindeer\nThe reindeer of North America, known as \"caribou\", have the longest migrations of any land animal, with some herds traveling over 3,000 miles and covering nearly 300,000 square miles.\nSpringtime migration is an enormous event, with multiple small herds coming together in groups of as many as 400,000 animals.\nReindeer are powerful endurance runners. They can sprint at speeds of almost 50 miles per hour, but can travel at 20 miles per hour for extended periods.\nWhen on the move, searching for food, reindeer will cross lakes and rivers en masse and without hesitation, swimming at speeds of 4 to 6 miles per hour, and can leap large gullies and other obstacles with ease.\nWith amazingly large hearts that carry them further, in harsher environments than any other land animal, the reindeer is a true marathon athlete...\nreindeer reproduction\nReindeer live in herds of as few as 10 to as many as 1,000. They have a very typical herd-animal lifestyle with adult males battling each other for territory and the right to mate with females.\nFemales usually give birth to one calf, on rare occasions two. A newborn baby reindeer is on its feet in minutes and can run as fast as an Olympic sprinter after only half an hour.\nBy the end of day one, the baby reindeer can keep up with the herd at full speed. Amazingly, the Golden Eagle is the number one predator of baby reindeer, and can actually carry newborn calves away in their talons.\nThe mother raises the young calf but the whole herd is protective. Reindeer even have an unusual trait that helps them stay together in white-out or blizzard conditions that they experience often in their arctic world - the joints of their knees actually make clicking sounds as they walk so they know they are still with the herd.\nYoung female reindeer will stay with their mothers and sisters within the same herd their entire lives.

Ants are thought to have developed from wasp like creatures 100 million years ago after blooming flowers appeared on Earth.\nBullet Ant (Paraponera clavata)\nThe bullet ant is known for its incredible sting which has been described as \u201cthe world\u2019s most painful.\u201d Pain from their sting is almost instantaneous and feels like a bullet that moves in waves for 12 hours or more.\nThe sting of bullet ants has long been used by local tribes in puberty rites and has no known long-term impacts.\nWhat makes the bullet ant sting hurt so much? The ant delivers a neurotoxin known as \u2018poneratoxin\u2019 that disrupts the ability of nerve cells to send electrical signals, which causes extreme pain. Bullet ants are found in colonies of 1,000 to 3,000 ants from Central America into the Amazon rain forest.\nArgentine Ant (Linepithema humile)\nContrary to its name, the Argentine ant has been introduced across much of the world including the United States, Australia, and Japan. The Argentine ant is best known for its \u201csuper colonies\u201d The longest stretching super colony that has been discovered is along the Mediterranean and stretches more than 3,700 miles!\nA colony in California stretches more than 500 miles while other \u201csuper colonies\u201d exist in places like Japan.\nBlack Garden Ant (Lasius niger)\nThe black garden ant is often known as the \u2018common ant\u2019 and is found across much of the world. Queens of the species have been recorded living up to 30 years. Colonies of black garden ants will reach up to 40,000 individuals, but more commonly have fewer than 10,000 workers.\nBanded Sugar Ants (Camponotus consobrinus)\nBanded sugar ants (or, sugar ants) are found across Eastralia\u2019s East coast and is a common \u2018pest\u2019 in the environments it lives in. While banded sugar ants (true to their name) prefer sweets, they also are predators of other insects which they disable with a spray of formic acid. The species is mostly nocturnal.\nHoneypot Ant (Formicidae)\nHoneypot ants are a family (Formicidae) that use their own bodies as storage. The abdomen of \u2018repletes\u2019 \u2014 or a type of honeypot ant that\u2019s adapted specially to store food \u2014 swells and collects nourishment. As the abdomen of repletes grow, they begin to resemble \u201choney pots.\u201d\nDuring dry seasons, worker ants drain repletes, providing valuable nutrition at a time of lean sustenance. This incredible adaptation makes honeypot ants ideal for desert climates, and they can be found from America\u2019s southwest, to the Sahara, and also in Australia.\nAnt Appearance and Behavior\nAnts are found in many different sizes and vary in colour depending on the species of ant. Some species of ant even have wings so are able to fly which only extends the range of their territory. In the more humid environment of the tropical jungles of the Southern Hemisphere, the ants are generally of the bigger species, often reaching more than a few centimetres long.\nAnts are extremely sociable insects and have a complex social structure where every ant individual has a purpose (effectively a job). Ants live in colonies and have a social structure from the worker ants that gather the materials and food, as well as nursing and caring for the ant larvae (the babies), to the queen ant that runs the nest and is the only female that reproduces in her colony.\nThe queen ant often can live for over a year which is considerably longer than the lives of the worker ants which only really last for a couple of months. The queen ant produces between 800 and 1,500 eggs per day which are fertilised by the sperm of the male ants which is present in the nest. Remarkably, ant eggs that have not been fertilised will still hatch but produce sterile female ants that become worker ants as they cannot reproduce.\nAnt Diet and Predators\nAnts are omnivorous animals and therefore eat a mixture of both plant and animal matter. The diet of the ant primarily consists of leaves, fungi, honey, nectar, small insects and dead animals, although the exact diet of the ant depends on the species. Some ants species have a more herbivorous diet, where other species of ant mainly eat meat.\nDue to their abundance and small size, ants have numerous animals that prey on them from tiny insects to reptiles, mammals and fish, and even certain species of plant have also developed ways in which they can digest them.\nAn ant is said to be able lift up to 50 times its own body weight, and be able to be pull more than 30 times it own body weight. This is the equivalent of an average human adult lifting a fully grown African elephant!

The Illegal Wildlife Trade Explained", "url": "https://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/illegal-wildlife-trade", "text": "Wildlife crime is a big business. Run by dangerous international networks, wildlife and animal parts are trafficked much like illegal drugs and arms. By its very nature, it is almost impossible to obtain reliable figures for the value of the illegal wildlife trade. Experts at TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, estimate that it runs into billions of dollars.\nSome examples of illegal wildlife trade are well known, such as poaching of elephants for ivory and tigers for their skins and bones. However, countless other species are similarly overexploited, from marine turtles to timber trees. Not all wildlife trade is illegal. Wild plants and animals from tens of thousands of species are caught or harvested from the wild and then sold legitimately as food, pets, ornamental plants, leather, tourist ornaments and medicine. Wildlife trade escalates into a crisis when an increasing proportion is illegal and unsustainable\u2014directly threatening the survival of many species in the wild.\nStamping out wildlife crime is a priority for WWF because it\u2019s the largest direct threat to the future of many of the world\u2019s most threatened species. It is second only to habitat destruction in overall threats against species survival."}

They\u2019re just some of the amazing animals featured in this fact or fiction quiz.\nSeals are carnivore s, eating mainly fish, though some also consume squid , other mollusk s, and crustacean s. Unlike other seals, the leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx) of the Antarctic feeds largely on penguins, seabirds, and other seals, in addition to fish and krill . The main predators of seals are killer whales, polar bears, leopard seals, large sharks, and human beings.\nseal , any of 32 species of web-footed aquatic mammal s that live chiefly in cold seas and whose body shape , round at the middle and tapered at the ends, is adapted to swift and graceful swimming. There are two types of seals: the earless, or true, seals (family Phocidae); and the eared seals (family Otariidae), which comprise the sea lion s and fur seal s. In addition to the presence of external ears, eared seals have longer flippers than do earless seals. Also, the fur of eared seals is more apparent, especially in sea lions.\nSeal diversity\nThe Baikal seal (Phoca sibirica) of Lake Baikal in Siberia, Russia, is the smallest at 1.1\u20131.4 metres (3.6\u20134.6 feet) long and 50\u2013130 kg (110\u2013290 pounds), but some female fur seals weigh less. The largest is the male elephant seal (genus Mirounga leonina) of coastal California (including Baja California, Mexico) and South America, which can reach a length of 6.5 metres (21 feet) and a weight of 3,700 kg (8,150 pounds). The upper portions of seals\u2019 limbs are within the body, but the long feet and digits remain, having evolved into flippers. Seals possess a thick layer of fat (blubber) below the skin, which provides insulation, acts as a food reserve, and contributes to buoyancy.\nBaikal seals Baikal seals (Phoca sibirica), endemic to Lake Baikal, southeastern Siberia, Russia. \u00a9 Doug Allan/Oxford Scientific Films Ltd.\nSee harbour seals enjoying the warmth of the sun and some grooming Learn about harbour seals.

They are fairly small, with little difference in size between the sexes. Ringed seals (P. hispida) have blotches over their entire bodies, harp seals (P. groenlandica) have a large blotch of black on otherwise mostly silver-gray fur, harbour seals (P. vitulina) have a marbled coat, and ribbon seals (P. fasciata) have dark fur with ribbons of paler fur around the neck, front limbs, and posterior part of their body.\nGray seal (Halichoerus grypus). \u00a9 P.A. Hinchliffe/Bruce Coleman Inc.\nThough especially abundant in polar seas, seals are found throughout the world, with some species favouring the open ocean and others inhabiting coastal waters or spending time on islands, shores, or ice floes. The coastal species are generally sedentary, but the oceangoing species make extended, regular migrations. All are excellent swimmers and divers\u2014especially the Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddellii) of the Antarctic. Various species are able to reach depths of 150\u2013250 metres or more and can remain underwater for 20\u201330 minutes, with the Weddell seal diving for up to 73 minutes and up to 600 metres. Seals cannot swim as fast as dolphins or whales but are more agile in the water. When swimming, a true seal uses its forelimbs to maneuver in the water, propelling its body forward with side-to-side strokes of its hind limbs. Because the hind flippers cannot be moved forward, these seals propel themselves on land by wriggling on their bellies or pulling themselves forward with their front limbs. Eared seals, on the other hand, rely mainly on a rowing motion of their front flippers for propulsion. Because they are able to turn their hind flippers forward, they can use all four limbs when moving on land.\nLearn about the grey seals on the island of Heligoland, Germany Overview of the gray seal. Contunico \u00a9 ZDF Enterprises GmbH, Mainz See all videos for this article\nAll seals must come ashore once a year to breed. Nearly all are gregarious, at least when breeding, with some assembling in enormous herds on beaches or floating ice. Most form pairs during the breeding season, but in some species, such as fur seals, the gray seal (Halichoerus grypus), and elephant seals, males (bulls) take possession of harems of cows and drive rival bulls away from their territory. Gestation periods average about 11 months, including a delayed implantation of the fertilized egg in many species. Cows are again impregnated soon after giving birth. Pups are born on the open ice or in a snow lair on the ice. The mother remains out of the water and does not feed while nursing the pups. The young gain weight rapidly, for the cow\u2019s milk is up to about 50 percent fat.\nWatch as a southern elephant seal pup is startled on the Argentinian coast and hear its snarl Southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) pup on the coast of Argentina. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. See all videos for this article\nSeals have been hunted for their meat, hides, oil, and fur. The pups of harp seals, for example, are born with white coats that are of value in the fur trade. The fur seals of the North Pacific Ocean and the ringed seals of the North Atlantic Ocean have also been hunted for their pelts. Elephant seals and monk seals were hunted for their blubber, which had various commercial uses. Seal hunting, or sealing, was so widespread and indiscriminate in the 19th century that many species might have become extinct if international regulations had not been enacted for their protection. The severe decline of sealing worldwide after World War II and the effects of international agreements aimed at conserving breeding stocks enabled several severely depleted species to replenish their numbers."}
