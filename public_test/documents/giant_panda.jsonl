Occasionally Grass, Rodents & Birds. Predators: Few Predators. Snow Leopards or Jackalls can kill a panda cub. Top Speed: 32 Kph (20 Mph) No. of Species:\n1 Conservation Status:\nVulnerable\nGiant panda typically inhabit regions that are high in elevation, between 4,000 and 11,500 feet, which they share with other rare animals such as the Sichuan takin. Pandas prefer living in damp, misty forested areas.\nGiant pandas have specific needs and they include having at least two species of bamboo and a water source contained within an old-growth conifer forest. This type of forest offers large tree stumps and hollow logs that are the right size for panda dens. The other benefits to this type of habitat are that shelter and nutrients are present for the bamboo that grows there.\nThe giant panda was once widespread throughout China, and even Myanmar and northern Vietnam. However, they have been on the endangered species list from 1990 to 2016, before this was switched to vulnerable \u2013 mainly due to habitat loss, poaching and poor breeding.\nThe giant panda can now only be found in 20 isolated patches of bamboo forest in six mountain ranges in China\u2019s Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, with most in the Minshan and Qinling mountains.\nInteresting Giant Panda Facts\n1. 99% of a giant pandas diet is bamboo, and they will consume 20kg of it each day.\nThey will spend at least 12 hours of the day dining on it. Bamboo is so nutritionally poor, pandas must consume a high volume to get any benefit out of it.\n2. Giant pandas do not weigh much, even after eating so much bamboo.\nThe male panda is the heavier of the genders, weighing it at somewhere between 75 and 135 kilograms. Females, on the other hand, weigh between 70 and 100 kilograms.\n3. Giant pandas have evolved a unique opposable \u2018thumb\u2019, which they use to hold bamboo stalks.\nThis \u2018thumb\u2019 is actually a enlarged and modified wrist bone, which is also present (in \u2018original form) in racoon, red panda, and black bear.\nIt helps pandas handle bamboo, as they peel and eat it. A giant panda can peel and eat a bamboo shoot in around 40 secs.\n4. Giant pandas have teeth of a carnivore, but are herbivores.\nPandas are thought to have evolved from eating animals and plants, to an almost exclusive bamboo diet about 2 million years ago.\n5. Giant panda guts are not suited to bamboo.\nWhile they may have evolved to eating bamboo, researchers found their gut has not adapted so well. Their digestive systems are still better suited to a carnivorous diet. Scientists believe this increases their risk of extinction.\n6. The male panda has a larger range than that of the female.\nPanda home ranges cover roughly five square kilometers. The male range is on the upper end of that with females holding a slightly smaller territory.\n7. All giant pandas in the world are Chinese citizens.\nAs the giant panda is a Chinese national treasure and protected by law, if you see one in a reserve or zoo somewhere else in the world that panda is actually on loan from China. The arrangement is a little more complicated than that as each time a cub is born, it has to be sent back to China in order to assist in expanding the giant panda gene pool.\n8. China rents giant pandas to American Zoos for $1m per year.\nZoos typically sign a 10 year contract to \u2018rent\u2019 a giant panda. If a cub is born, they cost $400k and are shipped back at 3 years old to help breed.\n9. Giant panda populations are not high, but they are increasing.\nIn the 1970\u2019s there were only about 1,000 pandas on the planet. A census taken in 2014 showed that figure had increased to 1,864 pandas living in the wild.\n10. The Chinese government is improving nature reserves to help secure their survival.\nChina has a network of 67 panda reserves, which look after 66% of the giant pandas in the wild, and almost 54% of their existing habitat.\n11. Giant pandas can climb trees and can swim.\nGiant pandas can climb from around 6-months old, and like all bears, can swim rather well when required.\n12. Pandas can live almost twice as long in captivity than in the wild.\nThe average life span of a panda is between 14 and 20 years. That figure jumps to 30 years for those living in captivity.\n13. Giant pandas are \u2018lazy\u2019.\nPandas spend most of their time either eating, or sleeping. Breeding is seemingly not high on their list of priorities.\n14. The reproductive cycle for pandas is a tad on the slow side.\nMature females will breed once every two or three years in the wild. She will have around 5 litters in her lifetime.\n15. Giant pandas have been with us for a very, very long time.\nPanda fossils have been found that date back between 2 and 3 million years.\n16. The meaning of the panda scientific name pretty much describes the creature.\nAiluropoda melanoleuca translates to mean \u201cblack and white cat foot\u201d and that sort of paints a picture for you of what a panda may appear as if you had never seen one before.\n17. Giant pandas do not take a winter nap.\nThe giant panda is one of the few species of bear that do not hibernate in winter. Instead, they will move from their high elevation homes to warmer areas in lower elevations in order to continue to enjoy bamboo.\n18. Pandas were a mystery to scientists for quite some time.\nThe giant panda was a bit of a puzzle for scientists who were not certain if they were actually a type of raccoon, bear or maybe a distinctly different species of animal altogether. The DNA contained in the cells of the panda unlocked clues that solved the mystery as the genetic code showed scientists that pandas are related to bears.\n19. The black market fur trade has a high price on giant panda fur.\nThe illegal trade market a panda fur can fetch between $60,000 and $100,000.\n20. Giant pandas start life pink.\nWhen first born a panda cub has pink skin, is about 15cm in size, and is covered with a very thin coat of white fur. It also has a long tail, no teeth and its eyes are closed. In a month, that cub will have most of its black spots and its eyes will open in the following couple of weeks. By the time the cub reaches 14 weeks of age, its teeth will start to appear. At this point, both the cub and its mother will use their den less frequently.\n21. Panda mothers and cubs stick together \u2013 for a while.\nThe cub won\u2019t leave the family unit until it is about a year-and-a-half old. At that time, it will go off on its own and assume a solitary life that typically all pandas live.\n22. Pandas make a lot of different noises.\nThese bears do not roar but they are fairly vocal otherwise. In addition to sounds that resemble those of a baby goat or lamb, a panda can growl, bark, huff and honk.\n23. The panda has a relatively large repertoire.\nResearchers have been able to clearly identify a total of 11 different panda calls. They even say that four of them are reserved for when the panda is seeking a mate.\n24. The panda is a symbol of peace and friendship in China.\nHundreds of years ago in times of war, tribes would raise a flag with a panda on it to stop a battle and call a truce.\n25. The panda is a highly recognizable symbol.\nThe World Wildlife Fund chose the panda as their logo because of the peaceful nature of the bear.\n26. There was also a hidden reason for the WWF to pick the panda as their logo/brand.\nThe black and white colors of the panda ensured that printing costs would be minimal as there would be no colors required.\nGiant Panda Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification"}

A typical animal eats half the day\u2014a full 12 out of every 24 hours\u2014and relieves itself dozens of times a day. It takes 28 pounds of bamboo to satisfy a giant panda's daily dietary needs, and it hungrily plucks the stalks with elongated wrist bones that function rather like thumbs. Pandas will sometimes eat birds or rodents as well.\nBehavior and Habitat\nWild pandas live only in remote, mountainous regions in central China. These high bamboo forests are cool and wet\u2014just as pandas like it. They may climb as high as 13,000 feet to feed on higher slopes in the summer season.\nPandas are often seen eating in a relaxed sitting posture, with their hind legs stretched out before them. They may appear sedentary, but they are skilled tree-climbers and efficient swimmers.\nBreeding and Population\nGiant pandas are solitary. They have a highly developed sense of smell that males use to avoid each other and to find females for mating in the spring. After a five-month pregnancy, females give birth to a cub or two, though they cannot care for both twins. The blind infants weigh only 5 ounces at birth and cannot crawl until they reach three months of age. They are born white, and develop their much loved coloring later.\nImproved conservation efforts and better survey methods show an increase in the wild panda population. Hundreds more pandas live in breeding centers and zoos, where they are always among the most popular attractions. Much of what we know about pandas comes from studying these zoo animals, because their wild cousins are so rare and elusive."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant panda - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda", "text": "Species of bear\nThe giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: \u5927\u718a\u8c93; pinyin: d\u00e0xi\u00f3ngm\u0101o), also known as the panda bear (or simply the panda), is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name \"giant panda\" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.\nThe giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, but also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu. As a result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived, and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species. A 2007 report showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27 outside the country. As of December 2014, 49 giant pandas lived in captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 countries. Wild population estimates vary; one estimate shows that there are about 1,590 individuals living in the wild, while a 2006 study via DNA analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to 3,000. Some reports also show that the number of giant pandas in the wild is on the rise. In March 2015, conservation news site Mongabay stated that the wild giant panda population had increased by 268, or 16.8%, to 1,864. In 2016, the IUCN reclassified the species from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable\", affirming decade-long efforts to save the panda. In July 2021, Chinese authorities also reclassified the giant panda as vulnerable rather than endangered.\nWhile the dragon has often served as China's national symbol, internationally the giant panda has often filled this role. As such, it is often used within China in international contexts, for example, appearing since 1982 on gold panda bullion coins and as one of the five Fuwa mascots of the Beijing Olympics.\nTaxonomy\nClassification\nFor many decades, the precise taxonomic classification of the giant panda was under debate because it shares characteristics with both bears and raccoons. However, molecular studies indicate the giant panda is a true bear, part of the family Ursidae. These studies show it diverged about from the common ancestor of the Ursidae; it is the most basal member of this family and equidistant from all other extant bear species. The giant panda has been referred to as a living fossil.\nEtymology\nThe word panda was borrowed into English from French, but no conclusive explanation of the origin of the French word panda has been found. The closest candidate is the Nepali word ponya, possibly referring to the adapted wrist bone of the red panda, which is native to Nepal. The Western world originally applied this name to the red panda.\nPanda cubs\nIn many older sources, the name \"panda\" or \"common panda\" refers to the lesser-known red panda, thus necessitating the inclusion of \"giant\" and \"lesser/red\" prefixes in front of the names. Even in 2013, the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica still used \"giant panda\" or \"panda bear\" for the bear, and simply \"panda\" for the red panda, despite the popular usage of the word \"panda\" to refer to giant pandas.\nSince the earliest collection of Chinese writings, the Chinese language has given the bear 20 different names, such as m\u00f2 (\u8c98 ancient Chinese name for giant panda), hu\u0101xi\u00f3ng (\u82b1\u718a \"spotted bear\") and zh\u00faxi\u00f3ng (\u7af9\u718a \"bamboo bear\"). The most popular names in China today are d\u00e0xi\u00f3ngm\u0101o (\u5927\u718a\u8c93 literally \"giant bear cat\"), or simply xi\u00f3ngm\u0101o (\u718a\u8c93 \"bear cat\"). The name xi\u00f3ngm\u0101o (\u718a\u8c93 \"bear cat\") was originally used to describe the red panda (Ailurus fulgens), but since the giant panda was thought to be closely related to the red panda, d\u00e0xi\u00f3ngm\u0101o (\u5927\u718a\u8c93) was named relatively.\nIn Taiwan, another popular name for panda is the inverted d\u00e0m\u0101oxi\u00f3ng (\u5927\u8c93\u718a \"giant cat bear\"), though many encyclopediae and dictionaries in Taiwan still use the \"bear cat\" form as the correct name. Some linguists argue, in this construction, \"bear\" instead of \"cat\" is the base noun, making this name more grammatically and logically correct, which may have led to the popular choice despite official writings. This name did not gain its popularity until 1988, when a private zoo in Tainan painted a sun bear black and white and created the Tainan fake panda incident.\nSubspecies\nThe Qinling panda has a light brown and white pattern\nTwo subspecies of giant panda have been recognized on the basis of distinct cranial measurements, colour patterns, and population genetics.\nThe nominate subspecies, A. m. melanoleuca , consists of most extant populations of the giant panda. These animals are principally found in Sichuan and display the typical stark black and white contrasting colours.\n, consists of most extant populations of the giant panda. These animals are principally found in Sichuan and display the typical stark black and white contrasting colours. The Qinling panda, A. m. qinlingensis, is restricted to the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi at elevations of 1,300\u20133,000 m (4,300\u20139,800 ft). The typical black and white pattern of Sichuan giant pandas is replaced with a light brown and white pattern. The skull of A. m. qinlingensis is smaller than its relatives, and it has larger molars.\nA detailed study of the giant panda's genetic history from 2012 confirms that the separation of the Qinlin population occurred about 300,000 years ago, and reveals that the non-Qinlin population further diverged into two groups, named the Minshan and the Qionglai-Daxiangling-Xiaoxiangling-Liangshan group respectively, about 2,800 years ago.\nDescription\nAdults measure around 1.2 to 1.9 metres (3 feet 11 inches to 6 feet 3 inches) long, including a tail of about 10\u201315 cm (4\u20136 in), and 60 to 90 cm (24 to 35 in) tall at the shoulder. Males can weigh up to 160 kg (350 lb). Females (generally 10\u201320% smaller than males) can weigh as little as 70 kg (150 lb), but can also weigh up to 125 kg (276 lb). The average weight for adults is 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb).\nThe giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, limbs and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white. The bear's distinctive coat appears to serve as camouflage in both winter and summer environments. The white areas may serve as camouflage in snow, while the black shoulders and legs provide crypsis in shade. Studies in the wild have found that when viewed from a distance, the panda displays disruptive coloration while close up, they rely more on blending in. The black ears may signal aggressive intent, while the eye patches might facilitate them identifying one another. The giant panda's thick, woolly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat. The panda's skull shape is typical of durophagous carnivorans. It has evolved from previous ancestors to exhibit larger molars with increased complexity and expanded temporal fossa. A 110.45 kg (243.5 lb) giant panda has a 3D canine teeth bite force of 2603.47 newtons and bite force quotient of 292.[citation needed] Another study had a 117.5 kg (259 lb) giant panda bite of 1298.9 newtons (BFQ 151.4) at canine teeth and 1815.9 newtons (BFQ 141.8) at carnassial teeth.\nBones of the left forelimb\nThe giant panda's paw has a \"thumb\" and five fingers; the \"thumb\" \u2013 actually a modified sesamoid bone \u2013 helps it to hold bamboo while eating. Stephen Jay Gould discusses this feature in his book of essays on evolution and biology, The Panda's Thumb.\nThe giant panda's tail, measuring 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in), is the second-longest in the bear family, behind the sloth bear.\nThe giant panda typically lives around 20 years in the wild and up to 30 years in captivity. A female named Jia Jia was the oldest giant panda ever in captivity, born in 1978 and died at an age of 38 on 16 October 2016.\nPathology\nA seven-year-old female named Jin Yi died in 2014 in a zoo in Zhengzhou, China, after showing symptoms of gastroenteritis and respiratory disease. It was found that the cause of death was toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by an obligate intracellular parasitic protozoan known as Toxoplasma gondii that infects most warm-blooded animals, including humans.\nGenomics\nThe giant panda genome was sequenced in 2009 using Illumina dye sequencing. Its genome contains 20 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes.\nEcology\nDiet\nPandas eating bamboo.\nPandas eating, standing, playing\nDespite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant panda's diet is primarily herbivorous, consisting almost exclusively of bamboo. However, the giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes, and thus derives little energy and little protein from consumption of bamboo. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Pandas are born with sterile intestines and require bacteria obtained from their mother's feces to digest vegetation. The giant panda is a highly specialised animal with unique adaptations, and has lived in bamboo forests for millions of years.\nThe average giant panda eats as much as 9 to 14 kg (20 to 30 lb) of bamboo shoots a day to compensate for the limited energy content of its diet. Ingestion of such a large quantity of material is possible and necessary because of the rapid passage of large amounts of indigestible plant material through the short, straight digestive tract. It is also noted, however, that such rapid passage of digesta limits the potential of microbial digestion in the gastrointestinal tract, limiting alternative forms of digestion. Given this voluminous diet, the giant panda defecates up to 40 times a day. The limited energy input imposed on it by its diet has affected the panda's behavior. The giant panda tends to limit its social interactions and avoids steeply sloping terrain to limit its energy expenditures.\nTwo of the panda's most distinctive features, its large size and round face, are adaptations to its bamboo diet. Anthropologist Russell Ciochon observed: \"[much] like the vegetarian gorilla, the low body surface area to body volume [of the giant panda] is indicative of a lower metabolic rate. This lower metabolic rate and a more sedentary lifestyle allows the giant panda to subsist on nutrient poor resources such as bamboo.\" Similarly, the giant panda's round face is the result of powerful jaw muscles, which attach from the top of the head to the jaw. Large molars crush and grind fibrous plant material.\nThe morphological characteristics of extinct relatives of the giant panda suggest that while the ancient giant panda was omnivorous 7 million years ago (mya), it only became herbivorous some 2\u20132.4 mya with the emergence of A. microta. Genome sequencing of the giant panda suggests that the dietary switch could have initiated from the loss of the sole T1R1/T1R3 umami taste receptor, resulting from two frameshift mutations within the T1R1 exons. Umami taste corresponds to high levels of glutamate as found in meat and may have thus altered the food choice of the giant panda. Although the pseudogenisation of the umami taste receptor in Ailuropoda coincides with the dietary switch to herbivory, it is likely a result of, and not the reason for, the dietary change. The mutation time for the T1R1 gene in the giant panda is estimated to 4.2 mya while fossil evidence indicates bamboo consumption in the giant panda species at least 7 mya, signifying that although complete herbivory occurred around 2 mya, the dietary switch was initiated prior to T1R1 loss-of-function.\nPandas eat any of 25 bamboo species in the wild, such as Fargesia dracocephala and Fargesia rufa. Only a few bamboo species are widespread at the high altitudes pandas now inhabit. Bamboo leaves contain the highest protein levels; stems have less.\nBecause of the synchronous flowering, death, and regeneration of all bamboo within a species, the giant panda must have at least two different species available in its range to avoid starvation. While primarily herbivorous, the giant panda still retains decidedly ursine teeth and will eat meat, fish, and eggs when available. In captivity, zoos typically maintain the giant panda's bamboo diet, though some will provide specially formulated biscuits or other dietary supplements.\nPandas will travel between different habitats if they need to, so they can get the nutrients that they need and to balance their diet for reproduction. For six years, scientists studied six pandas tagged with GPS collars at the Foping Reserve in the Qinling Mountains. They took note of their foraging and mating habits and analyzed samples of their food and feces. The pandas would move from the valleys into the Qinling Mountains and would only return to the valleys in autumn. During the summer months, bamboo shoots rich in protein are only available at higher altitudes which causes low calcium rates in the pandas. During breeding season, the pandas would return to lower altitudes to eat bamboo leaves rich in calcium.\nPredators\nAlthough adult giant pandas have few natural predators other than humans, young cubs are vulnerable to attacks by snow leopards, yellow-throated martens, eagles, feral dogs, and the Asian black bear. Sub-adults weighing up to 50 kg (110 lb) may be vulnerable to predation by leopards.\nBehavior\nThe giant panda is a terrestrial animal and primarily spends its life roaming and feeding in the bamboo forests of the Qinling Mountains and in the hilly province of Sichuan. Giant pandas are generally solitary. Each adult has a defined territory and a female is not tolerant of other females in her range. Social encounters occur primarily during the brief breeding season in which pandas in proximity to one another will gather. After mating, the male leaves the female alone to raise the cub.\nPandas were thought to fall into the crepuscular category, those who are active twice a day, at dawn and dusk; however, Jindong Zhang found that pandas may belong to a category all of their own, with activity peaks in the morning, afternoon and midnight. Due to their sheer size, they can be active at any time of the day. Activity is highest in June and decreases in late summer to autumn with an increase from November through the following March. Activity is also directly related to the amount of sunlight during colder days.\nPandas communicate through vocalisation and scent marking such as clawing trees or spraying urine. They are able to climb and take shelter in hollow trees or rock crevices, but do not establish permanent dens. For this reason, pandas do not hibernate, which is similar to other subtropical mammals, and will instead move to elevations with warmer temperatures. Pandas rely primarily on spatial memory rather than visual memory.\nThough the panda is often assumed to be docile, it has been known to attack humans, presumably out of irritation rather than aggression.\nPandas have been known to cover themselves in horse manure to protect themselves against cold temperatures.\nReproduction\n3 + 1 \u2044 2 to 7 ounces) and measures 15 to 17 centimeters (6 to 7 inches) long. A giant panda cub. At birth, the giant panda typically weighs 100 to 200 grams (to 7 ounces) and measures 15 to 17 centimeters (6 to 7 inches) long.\nInitially, the primary method of breeding giant pandas in captivity was by artificial insemination, as they seemed to lose their interest in mating once they were captured. This led some scientists to try extreme methods, such as showing them videos of giant pandas mating and giving the males sildenafil (commonly known as Viagra). Only recently have researchers started having success with captive breeding programs, and they have now determined giant pandas have comparable breeding to some populations of the American black bear, a thriving bear species. The normal reproductive rate is considered to be one young every two years.\nPanda Research and Breeding Center in Chengdu\nGiant pandas reach sexual maturity between the ages of four and eight, and may be reproductive until age 20. The mating season is between March and May, when a female goes into estrus, which lasts for two or three days and only occurs once a year. When mating, the female is in a crouching, head-down position as the male mounts her from behind. Copulation time ranges from 30 seconds to five minutes, but the male may mount her repeatedly to ensure successful fertilisation. The gestation period is somewhere between 95 and 160 days - the variability is due to the fact that the fertilized egg may linger in the reproductive system for a while before implanting on the uterine wall.\nGiant pandas give birth to twins in about half of pregnancies. If twins are born, usually only one survives in the wild. The mother will select the stronger of the cubs, and the weaker cub will die due to starvation. The mother is thought to be unable to produce enough milk for two cubs since she does not store fat. The father has no part in helping raise the cub.\nWhen the cub is first born, it is pink, blind, and toothless, weighing only 90 to 130 g (3+1\u20444 to 4+1\u20442 oz), or about 1/800 of the mother's weight, proportionally the smallest baby of any placental mammal. It nurses from its mother's breast six to 14 times a day for up to 30 minutes at a time. For three to four hours, the mother may leave the den to feed, which leaves the cub defenseless. One to two weeks after birth, the cub's skin turns grey where its hair will eventually become black. Slight pink colour may appear on the cub's fur, as a result of a chemical reaction between the fur and its mother's saliva. A month after birth, the colour pattern of the cub's fur is fully developed. Its fur is very soft and coarsens with age. The cub begins to crawl at 75 to 80 days; mothers play with their cubs by rolling and wrestling with them. The cubs can eat small quantities of bamboo after six months, though mother's milk remains the primary food source for most of the first year. Giant panda cubs weigh 45 kg (100 pounds) at one year and live with their mothers until they are 18 months to two years old. The interval between births in the wild is generally two years.\nIn July 2009, Chinese scientists confirmed the birth of the first cub to be successfully conceived through artificial insemination using frozen sperm. The cub was born at 07:41 on 23 July that year in Sichuan as the third cub of You You, an 11-year-old. The technique for freezing the sperm in liquid nitrogen was first developed in 1980 and the first birth was hailed as a solution to the dwindling availability of giant panda semen, which had led to inbreeding. Panda semen, which can be frozen for decades, could be shared between different zoos to save the species. It is expected that zoos in destinations such as San Diego in the United States and Mexico City will now be able to provide their own semen to inseminate more giant pandas. In August 2014, a rare birth of panda triplets was announced in China; it was the fourth of such births ever reported.\nAttempts have also been made to reproduce giant pandas by interspecific pregnancy where cloned panda embryos were implanted into the uterus of an animal of another species. This has resulted in panda fetuses, but no live births.\nHuman use and interaction\nEarly references\nIn the past, pandas were thought to be rare and noble creatures \u2013 the Empress Dowager Bo was buried with a panda skull in her vault. The grandson of Emperor Taizong of Tang is said to have given Japan two pandas and a sheet of panda skin as a sign of goodwill. Unlike many other animals in Ancient China, pandas were rarely thought to have medical uses. The few known uses include the Sichuan tribal peoples' use of panda urine to melt accidentally swallowed needles, and the use of panda pelts to control menstruation as described in the Qin dynasty encyclopedia Erya.\nThe creature named mo (\u8c98) mentioned in some ancient books has been interpreted as giant panda. The dictionary Shuowen Jiezi (Eastern Han Dynasty) says that the mo, from Shu (Sichuan), is bear-like, but yellow-and-black, although the older Erya describes mo simply as a \"white leopard\". The interpretation of the legendary fierce creature pixiu (\u8c94\u8c85) as referring to the giant panda is also common.\nDuring the reign of the Yongle Emperor (early 15th century), his relative from Kaifeng sent him a captured zouyu (\u9a36\u865e), and another zouyu was sighted in Shandong. Zouyu is a legendary \"righteous\" animal, which, similarly to a qilin, only appears during the rule of a benevolent and sincere monarch. It is said to be fierce as a tiger, but gentle and strictly vegetarian, and described in some books as a white tiger with black spots. Puzzled about the real zoological identity of the creature captured during the Yongle era, J. J. L. Duyvendak exclaims, \"Can it possibly have been a Pandah?\"\nWestern discovery\nThe West first learned of the giant panda on 11 March 1869, when the French missionary Armand David received a skin from a hunter. The first Westerner known to have seen a living giant panda is the German zoologist Hugo Weigold, who purchased a cub in 1916. Kermit and Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., became the first Westerners to shoot a panda, on an expedition funded by the Field Museum of Natural History in the 1920s. In 1936, Ruth Harkness became the first Westerner to bring back a live giant panda, a cub named Su Lin who went to live at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago. In 1938, Floyd Tangier Smith captured and delivered five giant pandas to London, they arrived on 23 December aboard the SS Antenor. These five were the first on British soil and were transferred to London Zoo. One, named Grandma, only lasted a few days. She was taxidermized by E. Gerrard and Sons and sold to Leeds City Museum where she is currently on display to the public. Another, Ming, became London Zoo's first Giant Panda. Her skull is held by the Royal College of Surgeons of England.\nAdult male giant panda\nDiplomacy\nGifts of giant pandas to American and Japanese zoos formed an important part of the diplomacy of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in the 1970s, as it marked some of the first cultural exchanges between China and the West. This practice has been termed \"panda diplomacy\".\nBy 1984, however, pandas were no longer given as gifts. Instead, China began to offer pandas to other nations only on 10-year loans, under terms including a fee of up to US$1,000,000 per year and a provision that any cubs born during the loan are the property of China. Since 1998, because of a WWF lawsuit, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service only allows a US zoo to import a panda if the zoo can ensure that China will channel more than half of its loan fee into conservation efforts for the giant panda and its habitat.\nIn May 2005, China offered a breeding pair to Taiwan. The issue became embroiled in cross-Strait relations \u2013 both over the underlying symbolism, and over technical issues such as whether the transfer would be considered \"domestic\" or \"international\", or whether any true conservation purpose would be served by the exchange. A contest in 2006 to name the pandas was held in the mainland, resulting in the politically charged names Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan (from tuanyuan, meaning \"reunion\", i.e. \"reunification\"). China's offer was initially rejected by Chen Shui-bian, then President of Taiwan. However, when Ma Ying-jeou assumed the presidency in 2008, the offer was accepted, and the pandas arrived in December of that year.\nBiofuel\nMicrobes in panda waste are being investigated for their use in creating biofuels from bamboo and other plant materials.\nConservation\nThe giant panda is a vulnerable species, threatened by continued habitat loss and habitat fragmentation, and by a very low birthrate, both in the wild and in captivity. Its range is currently confined to a small portion on the western edge of its historical range, which stretched through southern and eastern China, northern Myanmar, and northern Vietnam.\nThe giant panda has been a target of poaching by locals since ancient times and by foreigners since it was introduced to the West. Starting in the 1930s, foreigners were unable to poach giant pandas in China because of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, but pandas remained a source of soft furs for the locals. The population boom in China after 1949 created stress on the pandas' habitat and the subsequent famines led to the increased hunting of wildlife, including pandas. During the Cultural Revolution, all studies and conservation activities on the pandas were stopped. After the Chinese economic reform, demand for panda skins from Hong Kong and Japan led to illegal poaching for the black market, acts generally ignored by the local officials at the time.\nCloseup of a seven-month-old panda cub\nIn 1963, the PRC government set up Wolong National Nature Reserve to save the declining panda population. However, few advances in the conservation of pandas were made at the time, owing to inexperience and insufficient knowledge of ecology. Many believed the best way to save the pandas was to cage them. Because of the destruction of their natural habitat, along with segregation caused by caging, reproduction of wild pandas was severely limited. In the 1990s, however, several laws (including gun control and the removal of resident humans from the reserves) helped their chances of survival. With these renewed efforts and improved conservation methods, wild pandas have started to increase in numbers in some areas, though they still are classified as a rare species.[citation needed]\nIn 2006, scientists reported that the number of pandas living in the wild may have been underestimated at about 1,000. Previous population surveys had used conventional methods to estimate the size of the wild panda population, but using a new method that analyzes DNA from panda droppings, scientists believe the wild population may be as large as 3,000. In 2006, there were 40 panda reserves in China, compared to just 13 reserves in 1998. As the species has been reclassified to \"vulnerable\" since 2016, the conservation efforts are thought to be working. Furthermore, in response to this reclassification, the State Forestry Administration of China announced that they would not accordingly lower the conservation level for panda, and would instead reinforce the conservation efforts.\nThe giant panda is among the world's most adored and protected rare animals, and is one of the few in the world whose natural inhabitant status was able to gain a UNESCO World Heritage Site designation. The Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, located in the southwest province of Sichuan and covering seven natural reserves, were inscribed onto the World Heritage List in 2006.\nNot all conservationists agree that the money spent on conserving pandas is well spent. Chris Packham has argued that the breeding of pandas in captivity is \"pointless\" because \"there is not enough habitat left to sustain them\". Packham argues that the money spent on pandas would be better spent elsewhere, and has said he would \"eat the last panda if I could have all the money we have spent on panda conservation put back on the table for me to do more sensible things with\". He also quoted, \"The panda is possibly one of the grossest wastes of conservation money in the last half century\", though he has apologised for upsetting people who like pandas. However, a 2015 paper found that the giant panda can serve as an umbrella species as the preservation of their habitat also helps other endemic species in China, including 70% of the country's forest birds, 70% of mammals and 31% of amphibians.\nIn 2012, Earthwatch Institute, a global nonprofit that teams volunteers with scientists to conduct important environmental research, launched a program called \"On the Trail of Giant Panda\". This program, based in the Wolong National Nature Reserve, allows volunteers to work up close with pandas cared for in captivity, and help them adapt to life in the wild, so that they may breed, and live longer and healthier lives. Efforts to preserve the panda bear populations in China have come at the expense of other animals in the region, including snow leopards, wolves, and dholes.\nIn order to improve living and mating conditions for the fragmented populations of pandas, nearly 70 natural reserves have been combined to form the Giant Panda National Park in 2020. With a size of 10,500 square miles, the park is roughly three times as large as Yellowstone National Park and incorporates the Wolong National Nature Reserve. The state-owned Bank of China helped to enable the project with US$1.5 billion. One major aim is to permanently keep the panda population stable enough to avoid a relapse to its former IUCN Red List \"endangered\" status. Especially small, isolated populations run the risk of inbreeding and smaller genetic variety makes the individuals more vulnerable to various defects and genetic mutation. Allowing a larger group of individuals to roam through a larger area freely and choose from a greater variety of mates, helps to enrich genetic diversity of their offspring.\nIn 2020, the panda population of the new national park was already above 1,800 individuals, which is roughly 80 percent of the entire panda population in China. Establishing the new protected area in the Sichuan Province also gives various other endangered or threatened species, like the Siberian tiger, the possibility to improve their living conditions by offering them a habitat. Other species who benefit from the protection of their habitat include the snow leopard, the golden snub-nosed monkey, the red panda and the complex-toothed flying squirrel.\nIn July 2021, Chinese conservation authorities announced that giant pandas are no longer endangered in the wild following years of conservation efforts, with a population in the wild exceeding 1,800.\nZoos\nPandas have been kept in zoos as early as the Western Han Dynasty in China, where the writer Sima Xiangru noted that the panda was the most treasured animal in the emperor's garden of exotic animals in the capital Chang'an (present Xi'an). Not until the 1950s were pandas again recorded to have been exhibited in China's zoos.\nChi Chi at the London Zoo became very popular. This influenced the World Wildlife Fund to use a panda as its symbol.\nA 2006 New York Times article outlined the economics of keeping pandas, which costs five times more than keeping the next most expensive animal, an elephant. American zoos generally pay the Chinese government $1 million a year in fees, as part of a typical ten-year contract. San Diego's contract with China was to expire in 2008, but got a five-year extension at about half of the previous yearly cost. The last contract, with the Memphis Zoo in Memphis, Tennessee, ended in 2013.\nPopulation chart\nYear Wild Change Captivity Change Total Change 1976 1,000 n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a 1985 800\u20131,200 n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a 1987 >1,000 n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a 1994 1,200 n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a 1995 1,000 \u2212200 n/a n/a n/a n/a 2003 1,596 +596 164 n/a 1,760 n/a 2012 n/a n/a 341 +178 n/a n/a 2013 1,864 +268 375 +34 2,239 +479\nSee also\nReferences\nNotes"}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "giant panda | Facts, Habitat, Population, & Diet | Britannica", "url": "https://www.britannica.com/animal/giant-panda", "text": "Summary\nLarge males may attain 1.8 metres (6 feet) in length and weigh more than 100 kg (220 pounds); females are usually smaller. Round black ears and black eye patches stand out against a white face and neck. Black limbs, tail, legs, and shoulders contrast with the white torso. The rear paws point inward, which gives pandas a waddling gait. Pandas can easily stand on their hind legs and are commonly observed somersaulting, rolling, and dust-bathing. Although somewhat awkward as climbers, pandas readily ascend trees and, on the basis of their resemblance to bears, are probably capable of swimming. An unusual anatomic characteristic is an enlarged wrist bone that functions somewhat like a thumb, enabling pandas to handle food with considerable dexterity .\nNatural history\nAs much as 90\u201398 percent of the panda\u2019s diet consists of the leaves, shoots, and stems of bamboo, a large grass available year-round in much of China\u2019s forested regions. Despite adaptations in the forepaws, teeth, and jaws for bamboo consumption, the giant panda has retained the digestive system of its carnivore ancestry and is therefore unable to digest cellulose, a main constituent of bamboo. Pandas solve this problem by rapidly passing prodigious quantities of the grass through their digestive tracts on a daily basis. As much as 16 out of every 24 hours is spent feeding, and elimination of wastes occurs up to 50 times per day. Fossilized dental remains indicate that the giant panda committed to bamboo as its principal food source at least three million years ago. Although unable to capture prey, pandas retain a taste for meat, which is used as bait to capture them for radio collaring and has made them pests in human camps on occasion. The species cannot naturally survive outside bamboo forests, though in captivity they have been maintained on cereals, milk, and garden fruits and vegetables. Bamboo is the healthier diet for captive pandas.\nGiant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) eating bamboo. \u00a9 Hemera/Thinkstock giant panda Giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) feeding on bamboo. \u00a9 Corbis\nThe giant panda\u2019s solitary nature is underscored by its reliance on its sense of smell (olfaction). Each animal confines its activities to a range of about 4 to 6 square km (1.5 to 2.3 square miles), but these home ranges often overlap substantially. Under this arrangement scent functions in regulating contact between individuals. A large scent gland located just below the tail and surrounding the anus is used to leave olfactory messages for other pandas. The gland is rubbed against trees, rocks, and clumps of grass, with scent conveying information on identity, sex, and possibly social status of the marking individual. Chemical analysis of marks is consistent with a difference in function for males and females. Males appear to use scent to identify the areas where they live, whereas females primarily use it for signaling estrus. Except for the mothers\u2019 care of infants, the only social activity of pandas takes place during females\u2019 estrus, which occurs annually during the spring and lasts one to three days. A spring mating season (March\u2013May) and a fall birth season (August\u2013September) are seen in both wild and captive populations. Males appear to locate females first by scent and ultimately by vocalizations. Assemblages of one to five males per female have been recorded. At this time males may become highly aggressive as they compete for the opportunity to mate.\npanda sleeping A sleeping giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) at a breeding centre in Chengdu, Sichuan province, China. \u00a9 Hung Chung Chih/Shutterstock.com\nLike bears, giant pandas undergo a delay in implantation of the fertilized ovum into the wall of the uterus, a period of two to three months after mating. Hormone levels in females\u2019 urine indicate that the period of embryonic/fetal growth and development lasts only about two months. Altogether, gestation averages 135 days (with a range of 90\u2013184 days), but, because of the short growth phase, a term fetus weighs only about 112 grams (4 ounces) on average. Relative to the mother, giant pandas produce the smallest offspring of any placental mammal (about 1/800 of the mother\u2019s weight). For the first two to three weeks of life, the mother uses her forepaws and her thumblike wrist bones to cuddle and position the infant against herself in a rather uncarnivore-like and almost human fashion. Nearly half of the 133 captive births recorded before 1998 were of twins, but panda mothers are typically unable to care for more than one infant. Reasons for the extremely small size of the offspring and the frequent production of twins are not understood, but both are traits shared with bears.\nGiant panda cub (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) sleeping on a branch. \u00a9 Kitch Bain/Shutterstock.com\nThe newborn panda is blind and covered with only a thin all-white coat. It is virtually helpless, being able only to suckle and vocalize. It depends on its mother for warmth, nourishment, positioning at the breast, and stimulating the passage of wastes. Development is slow during the early months. Eyes begin to open at about 45 days, and the first wobbly steps are taken at 75\u201380 days. Its helpless state mandates birth in a den, an environment in which it lives for the first 100\u2013120 days of life. By about 14 months, at which age the milk teeth have erupted, the infant readily consumes bamboo, and at 18\u201324 months weaning from the mother takes place. Separation from the mother must occur before a female can undertake the production of her next litter. Captive pandas may live beyond 30 years in captivity, but life span in the wild is estimated at about 20 years."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Amazing Facts About Pandas | OneKindPlanet Animal Education & Facts", "url": "https://onekindplanet.org/animal/panda-giant/", "text": "Amazing Facts About the Giant Panda\nGiant pandas have a bear like appearance. Their distinctive black and white colouring makes them one of the best-known species in the world. They can reach 6 ft (1.9 m) in height and in the wild weigh around 220\u2013250 lb (110\u2013115 kg), although adult males can weigh up to 350 lbs (160 kg).\nWhy are giant pandas black and white?\nThe reason behind the black and white coat is unknown, but it is thought that the colouring provides camouflage for giant pandas in their natural environment.\nWhere do giant pandas live?\nGiant pandas live in bamboo forests in remote mountainous regions of western China. The majority can be found in Sichuan province but they also inhabit areas in the neighbouring provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu.\nThe cool wet environment provides the perfect habitat for giant pandas that feed almost exclusively on bamboo.\nHow have giant pandas adapted to living in trees?\nGiant pandas have broad paws with furry undersides and long retractile claws that help them grip when climbing trees.\nWhat do giant pandas eat?\nGiant pandas are omnivores, which means their diet consists of both vegetation and meat. However, bamboo is by far their favourite food.\nBamboo is low in nutrients so giant pandas need to eat a lot to survive. In a single day, they can spend 12 to 16 hours eating, consuming up to 44 lb (20 kg) of bamboo. Shoots, when available, are eaten first as they have the most nutrients, followed by leaves and stems.\nHow have giant pandas adapted to eating bamboo?\nGiant pandas have an extra digit on their paws that functions like a thumb and helps them to tear bamboo. Strong jaws enable them to crush bamboo up to 1.6 in (4 cm) in diameter, and their molar and pre-molar teeth are adapted to slice and crush tough plant stems. Adaptation doesn\u2019t stop there though, as giant pandas throats have a special lining to protect it from splinters once the bamboo is swallowed.\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\nAre giant pandas social animals?\nGiant pandas are shy animals that prefer to live alone. Using their heightened sense of smell, giant pandas detect the scent of other giant pandas close by and avoid them. The only exception is during the breeding season (March to May) when males use their sense of smell to locate females.\nHow do giant pandas mark their territory?\nGiant panda tails, which are between 4\u20136 in (10\u201315 cm) in length, are the second longest of all species in the bear family. They are fluffy but have a fur free area at the root with scent glands. Scent is excreted from these glands and the brush like tail is used to spread the scent and mark territories.\nWhere do giant pandas sleep?\nWith few natural predators to be afraid of, giant pandas are not picky when it comes to sleeping locations. They will fall on asleep on the forest floor, cosying up next to a tree or balancing on a branch. Much of their time is spent eating, so giant pandas sleep for only 2\u20134 hours at a time.\nDo giant pandas hibernate?\nUnlike other bears, giant pandas do no hibernate during winter months, but instead may migrate short distances to lower elevations. The simple answer as to why pandas don\u2019t hibernate is that they cannot stop eating. The low nutritional value of bamboo prevents them from building fat reserves to last them through the winter.\nWhen do giant pandas give birth?\nFemale giant pandas start reproducing when they are 6\u20137 years old and generally have cubs every two years. They mate in spring (March to May) and give birth five months later in a nest of bamboo. In the wild, it is rare for giant pandas to give birth to twins, but it has been known in captivity.\nGiant pandas are born blind, and are approximately 1/900th of the size of their mothers. Babies remain with their mothers for 18 months, at which point they are independent enough to establish their own territory.\nWhat colour are giant pandas when they are born?\nGiant pandas are born white and develop their black and white colouring later.\nWhat is the biggest threat to giant pandas?\nWith only about 1,000 giant pandas left in the wild, they are considered endangered, and listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.\nGiant pandas were once hunted by the Chinese, who believed their pelts provided magical protection against evil spirits, but hunting now carries strict penalties in China, so is less of a conservation issue now.\nHumans and destruction of habitat now pose the biggest threat to giant pandas. This includes erosion of habitat due to clearing of areas for crop cultivation, and natural die-back of bamboo. The presence of built up areas prevent giant pandas from moving to new areas, so loss of bamboo forests mean many will starve.\nDo giant pandas have predators?\nGiant pandas are strong with powerful jaws and teeth so few animals will risk attacking them. However, young giant pandas are more venerable and thus at risk from predators, including jackals, snow leopards, and yellow throated martens.\nWhat is being done to help giant pandas?\nGiant panda conservation is high priority, and consequently many measures have been put in place to help increase the numbers. Scientists around the world are studying their ecology and behaviour and instituting conservation programs.\nAn example is the panda reserve system which was established as part The National Conservation Project for the Giant Panda and its Habitat of 1992. Today there are around 67 reserves. Human interaction within reserves is minimised, and infrastructure is limited as is removal of trees and thus giant panda habitat. The creation of bamboo corridors between built up areas also gives giant pandas more freedom and enables them to move between habitats to find food and mates.\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});"}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Facts about the Giant Panda | WWF", "url": "https://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?13589/Facts-about-the-Giant-Panda", "text": "Posted on 08 June 2004\nFacts about WWF's most symbolic flagship species - the Giant Panda\nGiant pandas are found only in China. They were once widespread in southern and eastern China and in neighbouring Myanmar and North Vietnam. Today there are confined to temperate forest scattered across six mountain ranges in southwestern China: Minshan, Qinling, Qionglai, Liangshan, Daxiangling, and Xiaoxiangling. These forests are some of the most biologically rich temperate areas on Earth.Giant pandas are biologically unique. They are closely related to bears and have the digestive system of a carnivore, but they have adapted to a vegetarian diet and depend almost exclusively on bamboo as a food source. Not designed to process plant matter, the panda's digestive system cannot easily break down the cellulose in bamboo, so pandas must eat huge amounts \u2013 as much as 83 pounds or about 40 kg, eating for up to 14 hours, each day.Pandas are erroneously believed to be poor breeders, an impression rooted in the disappointing reproductive performance of captive pandas. Wild panda populations involved in long-term studies are known to have reproductive rates comparable to those of some populations of American black bears, which are thriving.Unlike other bears, pandas do not hibernate.At birth, panda cubs weigh only about as much as a quarter-pound stick of butter (90-130 grams) and have little fur. Adults can weigh more than 220 pounds. A panda's average life span is 20-25 years in the wild and up to 30 in captivity.Habitat loss and fragmentation are the most pressing threats to the giant panda. Large areas of natural forest have been cleared for agriculture, timber and fuel wood.Because of China\u2019s dense human population, many panda populations are isolated in narrow belts of bamboo no more than 1,000-1,200 meters in width. Panda habitat is continuing to disappear as settlers push higher up the mountain slopes.Across the panda's range, habitat is fragmented into more than 20 isolated patches. Within these patches, a network of nature reserves provides protection for more than half of the panda population. Because pandas cannot migrate between these far-flung habitat blocks, they have less flexibility to find new feeding areas during periodic bamboo die-off episodes.Small, isolated populations also face a greater risk of inbreeding, which can lead to reduced resistance to disease, less adaptability to environmental changes and reproductive problems.Some poaching of pandas still occurs, and even low levels of poaching can have grave consequences for such an endangered species. In recent years, several panda pelts being sold for large sums have been confiscated, but there is little information about the dynamics and dimensions of this market. Pandas are also unintentionally injured or killed in traps and snares set for other animals, such as musk deer and black bears.In 1979, WWF was invited by the Chinese government to collaborate in panda conservation, becoming the first international conservation organization to work in China. In 1980, Dr. George Schaller began the first-ever intensive research program on wild panda ecology and behavior, carried out for WWF in collaboration with Chinese scientists.In 1997, WWF initiated a community-based conservation program in Pingwu County, Sichuan Province, home to the largest concentration of pandas in China. The program teaches local people how to protect panda habitat without compromising their economic livelihood, by training them in sustainable logging methods, introducing new income-generating activities like ecotourism and raising local awareness about conservation.In the past six years, WWF has trained more than 300 panda reserve staff and local government officials in nature reserve management, wildlife monitoring, anti-poaching patrolling and innovative community-based conservation approaches.One of the major milestones of the first decade of cooperation between WWF and China\u2019s State Forestry Administration was the creation of the \"National Conservation Management Plan for the Giant Panda and Its Habitat\" in 1992. The plan called for additional nature reserves, improvements in existing reserves and migratory corridors to reconnect isolated populations. By the end of 2003, the Chinese government had established 40 panda reserves, protecting 1,040,000 ha and about 45% of the total giant panda habitat."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant Panda - The Animal Facts", "url": "https://www.theanimalfacts.com/mammals/giant-panda/", "text": "Reproduction\nHow does the giant panda produce its young?\nPandas live a solitary lifestyle and come together when it is time to mate. When the female is coming in to oestrus she will leave scent marks to alert the male to this. He will then seek her out so they can mate. He must find her quickly as the female is only able to mate for 3 days a year in the spring. This window is between March and May.\nOnce the male finds the female he will stick near to her anticipating the start of this 3 days. He will regularly smell her to see if he she is ready to mate and make groans and bleats to make her become attracted to him. Once she is ready they mate a number of times in an attempt to ensure she becomes pregnant. After this the male leaves to find another female that he can mate with.\nIf she is successful a panda cub will be born 95-160 days after they mate. In some rare instances twins or triplets are born. These can\u2019t survive in most cases as the female can only take one out when she needs to leave the den on her back. When compared with the size of the mother, pandas have the smallest mammal baby that is not carried in a pouch. The blind, helpless pup measures about 15cm (5.9in) long and weighs only 100g (3.5oz).\nWhen the baby is not suckling it is carried in one of her paws. The mother will not eat or drink for several days after the birth. The eyes of the cub open after 50 to 60 days.\nAt 10 weeks of age the cub begins to crawl and at 14 weeks old the mother and cub begin to leave the den together. It is also at this time that its teeth begin to come through. When making their outings the baby will ride on the mothers back. This continues until they are 6 months old when they can begin to walk. Up until 7-9 months of age it is exists solely on milk. At this time they begin to taste bamboo. It will drink milk and eat bamboo up until 18 months of age when it moves solely to solid foods.\nAfter 18 months the mother looks to send the baby off on its own. It may remain with her for up to 3 years though. Once they leave they establish their own territory.\nThe females will not begin breeding till they are 5 or 6 years old. Giant pandas stop breeding around 22 years of age. In this time they may only have 5 cubs. This low reproductive ability is part of the reason that giant pandas are so endangered.\nBehavior\nWhat does the giant panda do with its day?\nThe panda is considered to be one of the most vocal bear species. Their most distinctive sound is their greeting which sounds like a bleat. Other vocalizations include honks, huffs, barks and growls while young cubs will croak and squeal.\nThe other method of communication used by pandas is scent marking. They have a gland under their short tails from which they secrete a waxy substance they place on most of the features of their environment. The scent is incredibly strong and can be smelt by a human up to a foot away. This mark provides information relating to the pandas gender, age, social status and if they are ready to mate. Pandas aim to place these marks as high as possible. Occasionally they will use \u2018handstands\u2019 to get higher up a tree.\nCurrently it is thought that pandas are solitary and never meet with other pandas. They are known to maintain a home range which they mark out and defend. Some new research though suggests that pandas tolerate each other in their home ranges and will occasionally meet. Much research still needs to be done into this."}

We also wanted an animal that had an impact in black and white to save money on printing costs.\"\n2. Historically speaking, pandas are one of the few animals whose parts have not been used in traditional Chinese medicine.\n1. Approximately 99 percent of a panda\u2019s diet\u2014bamboo leaves and shoots\u2014is void of much nutritional value. Its carnivore-adapted digestive system cannot digest cellulose well, thus it lives a low-energy, sedentary lifestyle but persists in eating some 60 species of bamboo. Pandas must eat upwards of 30 pounds of bamboo daily just to stay full.\nSee pandas during a WWF tour to China,"}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "15 Fun Pandas Facts You Didn't Know (#7 Will Impress You)", "url": "https://www.chinahighlights.com/giant-panda/interesting-facts.htm", "text": "When we think of giant pandas, we think of lovely black and white bears. They are cute and have many fans all over the world. But do you really know pandas? The following are 15 interesting giant panda facts to help you know more about them.\n1. A panda year is equivalent to three human years.\nA panda year is equivalent to about three human years in terms of life expectancy. Giant pandas live 18\u201320 years in the wild and 25 to 30 years in captivity. The world's oldest giant panda was Xinxing (\u2018New Star') in Chongqing Zoo at 38 years old and four months (1982\u20132020). That's the equivalent of 115 human years.\n2. Pandas have 6 \"fingers\"!\nA panda's 6th \"finger\" is like a human thumb. It has the same function as a thumb, but it is actually an unusual wrist bone or opposable paw heel with strong muscles but no movable joints, which allows it to grasp food.\nThey can press the bamboo into fat cigar shapes with their 6th digits for efficient eating.\n3. Pandas will abandon a child if she has twins.\nWild pandas usually have just one cub, while pandas in captivity are more likely to have twins. In the wild, If the mother panda has two cubs, she will only feed the one she thinks is stronger. The other one is left to fend for itself.\nThe reason for this is that a newborn cub is very weak. Cubs start eating bamboo at around 12 months of age, but until then they are completely dependent on their mother. So, in the wild, female pandas don't have sufficient milk or energy to care for two cubs.\nA cub stays with its mother until she is pregnant again, when the cub is about a year and a half old. If the mother does not become pregnant, the cub will stay with its mother until it is two and a half years old.\n4. Pandas like climbing trees and can swim.\nGiant pandas are good tree climbers. They can climb trees from 7 months old.\nIn the wild, giant pandas (particularly cubs) climb trees to avoid their enemies and survey their surroundings. As it is safer in a tree, many giant pandas like to sleep in trees.\nSometimes, they just climb to look at the scenery.\nGiant pandas are bears, and like other bears, they can swim.\n5. Eating and sleeping make up pandas' daily life.\nA typical 45-kilo (100-pound) adult spends as long as 12 hours eating 12 to 38 kilos (26\u201384 lb) of bamboo a day. Pandas can reach 150 kg (330 lb) in captivity and eat even more!\nWhen not eating and looking for food, pandas sleep most of the rest of the time. In the wild, giant pandas sleep for two to four hours between feeds.\n6. Pandas are loners.\nGiant pandas are solitary animals. In the wild, they have their own territory, and they do not allow it to be invaded by other pandas.\nThat's because giant pandas feed on bamboo and do not need to hunt cooperatively. They need to eat a lot of bamboo to meet their nutritional needs. If giant pandas lived in groups, there would be conflict over getting enough bamboo, which would negatively affect the survival of all.\nA panda usually needs its own 3\u20138 square kilometers (1\u20133 square miles) of bamboo forest to survive.\n7. A panda can poop 28 kilos (62 lb) per day!\n99% of a panda's diet consists of bamboo, but its digestive tract retains carnivorous characteristics. Giant pandas' ability to digest bamboo is low at less than 20 percent, and bamboo itself is low in nutrients. So, in order to keep up their energy, pandas have to eat a lot of bamboo and thus poop a lot!\nGiant pandas poop every 15\u201320 minutes. The vast majority of their feces is undigested bamboo.\nIn the past, locals made the undigested bamboo pieces in the poop into picture frames and bookmarks \u2014 remarkably they did not smell!\nRecommended Articles\n8. Pandas used to eat meat.\nWhen giant predators like sabre-tooth tigers were no longer around, pandas didn't need to be as fast and turned into baboo-eating specialists to avoid becoming extinct themselves.\nWe may know them as eating only bamboo, but they do like some fruit too, and can eat meat.\nRecommended Tours:\n9. Pandas have black and white coats.\nPandas' black and white coats are good camouflage. Pandas need to spend most of their time looking for bamboo to eat in their habitats, which are mainly forests and snowy mountains. Their black and white coloring helps them avoid unwanted attention.\nThe white of their coats helps pandas hide in the snow, and the black helps them blend into the shadows of the forest.\nRecommended Tours:\n10. Spring is the mating season for pandas.\nFemale giant pandas are in heat once a year for only two to three days each time, usually in March to May each year. A pregnancy lasts about 5 months.\nIn the wild, female giant pandas will emit special sounds such as baa, dog bark, or cow bark during their fertile period, while male giant pandas will leave scent markers as a sign to attract female giant pandas.\nFemales often mate with several competing males, while a male will also seek out different females to mate.\nAfter mating, male and female pandas live separately, and the work of den building and rearing young is completed by female pandas alone.\nRecommended Tours:\n11. Panda cubs are pink.\nA newborn panda cub weighs only 100 grams (3.5 oz). They are fur-less, pink, and blind. Their iconic black and white color coat grows after about three weeks.\nPandas are usually born in August. So, if you want to see cute panda cubs, come in August.\nWe have compiled more facts about baby pandas.\n12. Pandas do not hibernate.\nGiant pandas do not hibernate because their bamboo-based diet prevents them from storing enough fat to sleep through the winter.\nPandas are not afraid of the cold. Even in temperatures as low as -4\u00b0C (25\u00b0F), they can still be found walking in groves of bamboo with thick snow.\nRecommended Tours:\n13. Pandas use scent to mark their territory.\nGiant pandas mark their territory by leaving their scent on tree bark through urine, rubbing scent glands, and other ways. The higher they are able to mark their scent on a tree the stronger they are is a general rule in the panda community.\nTrying to pee higher and rub higher is a non-confrontational way of competing for mating rights.\n14. There are two giant panda subspecies.\nSichuan giant panda\nThere are Sichuan giant pandas and Qinling giant pandas. Qinling pandas make up only 18.5 percent of the total giant panda population.\nThe soil, climate, and vegetation of Sichuan are very different from that of the Qinling Mountains, so the appearance, colors, and body shape of the giant pandas in the two places are different.\nThe Sichuan giant panda's head is similar to that of a bear, while the Qinling giant panda's head is more cat-like, with a smaller skull and larger teeth.\nThe two pandas are of the same origin, but separated by a large river and mountains and further isolated by human activities. Paleontologists estimate that they broke off contact 50,000 years ago, and then began the process of independent reproduction and evolution.\n15. Giant pandas are no longer endangered!\nThanks to conservation efforts to save giant pandas, their population is now over 2,200. Their wild population has increased to 1,864, and the number of captive-bred giant pandas has reached 422. Therefore, their threat level has been reduced from \"endangered\" to \"vulnerable\".\nVisit the Cute Pandas with Us\nIf you want to see China's lovely giant pandas, we can tailor-make a tour for you to see pandas according to your particular requirements.\nSee our most-selected panda itineraries below for inspiration:"}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant Panda Facts - Animals of Asia - WorldAtlas", "url": "https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/giant-panda-facts-animals-of-asia.html", "text": "5. Physical Description\nThe Giant Panda is a member of the bear family. It has a black-and-white-colored, thick, wooly coat covering the torso of its body. Predominately black fur, meanwhile, covers its eyes, muzzle, legs, shoulders, and its long wrist bones. Adult giant pandas weigh up to 330 pounds. From their noses to the hind-parts, they are 150 centimeters (59 inches) long, accentuated by a 10 to 15 centimeter (4-6 inch) tail. Their height to the shoulder is around 90 centimeters (~3 feet). The giant panda is an omnivore, and it eats mainly plants, supplemented by a share of meat from birds and small rodents as well.\n4. Diet\nBamboo leaves, stems and shoots comprise 98 percent of the Giant Panda\u2019s diet. But, since pandas have digestive systems akin to those of a carnivore, they can and will also occasionally eat small rodents, birds, and the small mammals known as \"Pikas\". Daily, an adult Giant Panda will consume 26 to 84 pounds of bamboo to meet their energy needs. The Giant Pandas obtain food by foraging through bamboo thickets in their native habitats. Using their elongated wrists that act like thumbs, they pluck bamboo and feed upon its stems, shoots, and leaves. Over the course of a typical day, the Giant Panda will spend a remarkable 12 hours eating.\n3. Habitat and Range\nThe ideal habitat for the Giant Panda is that of a temperate broadleaf forest or mixed forest, especially those found in their native southwest China. The predominant Giant Panda population in the wild today is spread across 20 isolated patches of bamboo forest, themselves split between six mountain ranges of the Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces of China. Other, smaller groups are to be found in the Minshan and Qinling Mountains. Habitat loss to deforestation, expanding human populations, and poaching are the main threats the Giant Panda faces today. Due to these threats and others, the Giant Panda has been listed as \"Endangered\", and is one of the rarest bears in the world today. According to the WWF, who conducted the last Giant Panda census in 2014, 1,864 members of the species remain in the wild today.\n2. Behavior\nThe Giant Panda leads a solitary lifestyle. It is largely peaceful and avoids confrontation, but they will fiercely fight back if they or their cubs are threatened. The Giant Panda uses its physical strength and powerful jaws and teeth to fight back.Though bulky in appearance, the Giant Panda can climb trees and swim quite nimbly. At 6 months old, the Giant Panda cubs can already clamber up trees. Unlike other bear breeds, the Giant Panda does not hibernate during winters. When eating, they assume a sitting posture with their hind legs stretched out in front of them. The Giant Panda marks its territorial routes by spraying urine, clawing trees, and rubbing against objects.\n1. Reproduction\nThe Giant Panda is sexually active during the breeding season which lasts from March to May, and the reproductive rate is around one cub every two years. A typical cub reaches sexual maturity at between 5.5 and 6.5 years-old. Giant Pandas have a sharp sense of smell which males will use to avoid one another, as well as to locate females \"in heat\" (during their Estrous cycle) for mating. A female can mate with several males competing for her for 2 to 4 days. The gestation period last between 95 and 160 days, and they usually deliver only one cub. Twins, however, are more likely to be born in captivity, where artificial insemination is often used to impregnate them."}

This bear also has a special significance for WWF because it has been our logo since our founding in 1961.\nPandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending on what part of the bamboo they are eating. They use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs.\nA newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter\u2014about 1/900th the size of its mother\u2014but females can grow up to about 200 pounds, while males can grow up to about 300 pounds as adults. These bears are excellent tree climbers despite their bulk."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "10 Facts About Pandas - China's Most Famous Animal - GoEco", "url": "https://www.goeco.org/article/10-panda-facts-you-didnt-know", "text": "What is that beautiful animal hanging out in the Chinese forests? Why, the amazing giant panda, of course! Easily recognizable by their mix of black and white fur, these gentle giants have become quite the iconic species.\nLet me officially introduce to you the giant panda.\n\u201cGiant panda\u201d is actually just a nickname for a panda; they are no specifically larger than others. Pandas eat consistently for 12-14 hours a day! Adult panda bears can weigh as much as 45 kilos (100 pounds). Like other bears, pandas can swim! They do not, however, hibernate, as they are unable to store energy over long periods of time (hence their 12-hour eating routine). Pandas, although native to China, are one of the few indigenous wildlife species that were never hunted for use in traditional Chinese medicine. Newborn pandas are pink! Although pandas eat mostly bamboo and fruit, their teeth are carnivorous, meaning they would be able to chew and consume tough meat. Panda fossils have confirmed their extinct from one to two million years ago! Panda cubs can be as small as a stick of butter- they are approximately 1/900th the size of their mother at birth. Panda cubs can climb trees at just the young age of six months!\nAre giant pandas endangered?\nPandas are the face of the wildlife conservation organization, the World Wildlife Fund, but are they endangered?\nIn 1984, giant pandas were labeled as endangered, and faced a serious threat of extinction. Thanks to rigorous conservation efforts, however, they are no longer labeled as \u201cendangered\u201d by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, but they are still labeled as a \u201cvulnerable\u201d species. In 2014, less than 2,000 giant pandas were accounted for.\nHabitat loss is the number one threat to the giant panda population. According to the World Wildlife Fund, the panda\u2019s habitat has been destroyed due to being logged for timber and fuel wood, or cleared for agriculture and infrastructure to meet the needs of the area\u2019s booming population.China banned logging in these areas in 1998, but forest fragmentation has taken over as a threat. The building of roads and railways divides panda populations, and poses a threat to breeding and therefore the sustainability of the population. This isolation also makes it difficult for pandas to have easy access to bamboo.\nTheir habitats are further threatened by those who are searching for plants that are present in panda habitats, such as the Minshan Mountains. Around 75% of the plants in this area of panda habitat are used in traditional Chinese medicine.\nHere are a few tips on how you can help the panda on your trip in China:\nDon\u2019t travel into panda habitats. There are plenty of mountainous areas in China, and bustling cities to explore \u2013 try to avoid going off-course and into areas where pandas like to dwell. Partake in ecotourism excursions during your travels in China.\nDonate to a conservation program. There over 60 different conservation programs and sanctuaries in China that are focused on conserving the giant panda, but they need your help! If you have some cash left over from your eco travels, consider making a donation to help the organizations that are working hard every day to ensure the panda\u2019s survival. These organizations may be sanctuaries that take in injured pandas or centers that breed pandas.\nVolunteer at a panda sanctuary. To provide hands-on assistance in conserving the giant panda, sign up to volunteer at a giant panda sanctuary! There are many options, and they may include breeding programs. GoEco\u2019s Giant Panda Center panda population has risen from an initial 6 animals to over 70 pandas. In 2003 the first stage of a state-of-the-art panda base was completed: a veritable panda paradise. It is divided into 6 sections: panda raising and breeding area, scientific study area, food preparation and animal hospital area, staff living area, bamboo base area and tourist accommodation area.\nBut first, how do you spot a good panda sanctuary?\nAsk what the sanctuary goals are. To fully understand the purpose of an individual sanctuary, question what the sanctuary\u2019s goals are. Some sanctuaries may be providing care for injured animals, while some may focus on caring for pandas as a part of a breeding program. Other sanctuaries may provide pandas with care, while educating visitors about the importance of their conservation.\nEnclosure size. Check that the pandas are allowed to roam around, and are not confined to a cage 24/7. Some sanctuaries may put them inside during the nights, but be wary of \u201csanctuaries\u201d that have no outdoor area for free roaming.\nEnclosures are clean. If the sanctuary has enclosures, whether for feeding or sleeping purposes, take a look around to ensure that these areas are being properly maintained. Many sanctuaries that accept volunteers will require volunteers to assist heavily in the cleaning of these areas, and that is a good thing.\nThe pandas are being cared for properly. If volunteers are not allowed to feed the pandas, check if they have a steady supply of bamboo in their outdoor enclosure.\nWhat\u2019s your experience with pandas?

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant panda | Smithsonian's National Zoo", "url": "https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/giant-panda", "text": "As few as 1,864 giant pandas live in their native habitat, while another 600 pandas live in zoos and breeding centers around the world. The largest threat to giant panda survival is habitat destruction. People in need of food and income have cleared forests for agriculture and timber. This logging has fragmented a once continuous habitat, leaving small groups of pandas isolated from each other.\nWhen populations become small, they are extremely susceptible to extinction due to environmental or genetic influences, such as drought or inbreeding. Small populations cannot rebound the same way large populations do; as groups of pandas become more isolated, it is more likely that reproduction, disease resistance and population stability will be threatened.\nFor more than 40 years, the Zoo has celebrated these charismatic bears by creating and maintaining one of the world's foremost panda conservation programs. In that time, the Zoo's team \u2014 consisting of dozens of animal care staff, scientists, researchers, international collaborators and conservationists \u2014 has made great strides in saving this species from extinction by studying giant panda behavior, health, habitat and reproduction.\nSpecifically, it has allowed scientists at the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute to learn about panda estrus, breeding, pregnancy, pseudopregnancy and cub development \u2014 work that is shared around the world with other institutions that also care for and breed this vulnerable species.\nBreeding Giant Pandas\nSmithsonian's National Zoo scientists began giant panda research when Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing arrived at the Zoo in 1972. See a history and timeline of giant pandas at the Zoo here. Much has been learned since that time, but there still remains much more to learn. With the arrival of Tian Tian and Mei Xiang, the Zoo has developed a ten-year research plan that will hopefully culminate in a growing, thriving population of giant pandas.\nSome research areas will repeat behavioral observation studies on Tian Tian and Mei Xiang in order to increase sample size and determine whether a behavior pattern is common to giant pandas or particular to an individual. In other areas, such as reproductive biology, the advanced techniques scientists use today largely did not exist when Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing were alive. Also, opportunities for research and conservation initiatives in the wild, including the potential for increasing the wild giant panda population in China through reintroduction, are greater today than at any time in the past. However, these plans and initiatives will be costly to carry out, as will China's official National Plan for the Conservation of Giant Pandas and their Habitats.\nScientists from the Smithsonian Conservation and Biology Institute's Center for Conservation Genomics, have become adept at studying the genetic relatedness of pandas in human care. Chinese colleagues maintain an up-to-date studbook of these vulnerable animals. Zoo scientists developed the formula used to make breeding recommendations for the entire giant panda population in human care, ensuring that it is genetically healthy. Scientists are working to preserve 90 percent of the genetic diversity of the giant panda population in human care.\nPanda breeding season is a race against the biological clock. It only comes once a year, and the giant panda team, including scientists from the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute's Center for Species Survival, and vets, keepers and biologists from the Zoo's animal care teams, must be ready. Giant panda females, like Mei Xiang, ovulate for just 24 to 72 hours.\nTo identify the opening of that tiny window, animal keepers carefully watch Mei Xiang for any behavioral sign of estrus. At the same time, scientists monitor hormones in her urine to pinpoint the window when she is ready to breed. If attempts at natural breeding are not successful, scientists can step in, collect fresh or frozen-thawed semen from a male and use the genetic material collected to artificially inseminate a female. At the Zoo, four artificial inseminations have resulted in successful births: male Tai Shan in 2005, female Bao Bao in 2013, male Bei Bei in 2015 and male Xiao Qi Ji in 2020.\nSaving Pandas in the Wild\nUnder the terms of the Zoo's agreement with China, scientists at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute's Conservation Ecology Center have studied these bears both in the wild and in human care.\nSmithsonian Conservation Biology Institute ecologists spend months in China every year studying wild pandas and their neighbors, such as Asiatic black bears and takin. They teach colleagues in China how to conduct censuses and surveys of large mammals, including giant pandas that live in the wild, using geographic information systems (GIS) and other high-tech tools for tracking wildlife.\nThey are also working to identify new landscapes for giant panda reintroduction. Field research has revealed that wild pandas' habitat is highly fragmented, which means pandas have a difficult time finding a mate. To address that problem, Zoo scientists and colleagues have been exploring the possibility of creating \"corridors\" of forests that link isolated habitats. Such corridors would give giant pandas more options for movement and mate selection. They might also assist with the reintroduction of captive-born pandas into the wild.\nThe Zoo's pandas are part of Panda Watch behavior study. Each day, dedicated Friends of the National Zoo volunteers, called Panda Watchers, monitor the pandas' behavior via the Panda Cam. Over the years, they've amassed mountains of data on the species, which is notoriously difficult to study in the wild.\nThe Future\nIn December 2011, David M. Rubenstein donated $4.5 million to the Zoo to fund the giant panda program through 2016. In appreciation, the giant panda complex was named the David M. Rubenstein Family Giant Panda Habitat. In addition, young conservation biologists in the U.S. and in China who were awarded Smithsonian's National Zoo fellowships for their work to save this vulnerable species were named \"David M. Rubenstein Fellows.\" The gift was used to fund conservation efforts in China, reproductive science, professional training programs, giant panda care at the Zoo, upgrades to the Zoo habitats and public education. Mr. Rubenstein provided an additional $4.5 million donation in fall 2015.\nThe gift allowed the Zoo's animal care and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute's scientific team to proceed with the five-year science plan established with their Chinese colleagues from the China Wildlife Conservation Association. The science plan had specific goals: to examine the creation and impact of corridors to link fragmented habitats that will benefit giant pandas and other wildlife species, including promoting genetic diversity; examine how to restore habitats, especially those where pandas appear to be making a comeback; provide advice on giant panda reintroduction; examine the potential impact of transmissible diseases on giant pandas and other wildlife species, including providing advice on implementing new programs associated with a Wildlife Disease Control Center being built in Sichuan Province; and continue research on giant panda reproduction and management, because, although there has been major success in Chinese breeding centers, some pandas still experience reproductive challenges.\nIn 2020, Mr. Rubenstein pledged a $3 million gift to the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, funding its giant panda research and conservation program through the end of 2023. As per the Zoo's original agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association, any cub born to Mei and Tian would be sent to a breeding center in one of the panda reserves in China sometime after the cub turned two years old. In April 2007, it was determined that Tai Shan would remain at the Zoo an additional two years past his second birthday, which was July 9, 2007. This extension allowed Tai Shan to become an adolescent bear in front of his fans. What's more, Zoo scientists were able to continue their studies of his growth and development to document changes during this little-known stage of a panda's life.\nOn February 2010, Tai Shan was sent back to China, per the loan agreement, to a breeding center in Bifengxia, China. The new loan, which was agreed upon in 2010, states that any cub born at Zoo will stay for four years. Bao Bao, Mei Xiang's second surviving cub born Aug. 23, 2013, departed for China on Feb. 21, 2017. Bei Bei, Mei Xiang's cub born Aug. 22, 2015, departed the Zoo for China Nov. 19, 2019."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Giant Panda Bear images!\nGiant Panda Bear Classification and Evolution\nThe Giant Panda is a species of bear that is found in the mountains of central and western China. One of the most famous and easily identifiable animals in the world, the Giant Panda is also one of the rarest and is under immense threat in its natural environment, primarily from habitat loss. The Giant Panda is unique among bears as they do not hibernate, have very small babies at birth and survive on a diet that is almost entirely vegetarian. Since the Giant Panda was first discovered by a French naturalist in 1869, it has become a global symbol for conservation with the World Wildlife Fund using it as their logo. The Chinese people also see the Giant Panda as a symbol of peace and numerous efforts have been made to try and protect the remaining populations in their native habitats.\nGiant Panda Bear Anatomy and Appearance\nThe Giant Panda is a medium to large sized bear that like other species has a large head, short tail and a long muzzle with a large nose, which gives them an excellent sense of smell. The thick fur of the Giant Panda is creamy-white in colour with large patches of black on the limbs, shoulders, ears and nose, and distinctive black patches around their small eyes. The Giant Panda eats almost only bamboo and so has a number of physical adaptations to help with its consumption including an extension of their wrist bone which acts a bit like a thumb, allowing the Giant Panda to grip onto bamboo stems. They also have large jaws with strong jaw muscles that along with their flat molars, allow the Giant Panda to crush bamboo stems and leaves in order to extract the nutrients.\nGiant Panda Bear Distribution and Habitat\nHistorically, the Giant Panda would have been found throughout the lowlands of the Yangtze River Basin but increased Human activity in these areas has pushed the Giant Pandas high up into the mountains. Remote populations are still found in six different mountain ranges in central and western China, where they inhabit broadleaf and coniferous forests with a thick bamboo under-storey at elevations between 5,000 and 13,000 feet. These high-altitude forests are cool, cloudy and moist and are generally subjected to a high level of rainfall. It is thought that the unique colouration of the Giant Panda may help them to blend into these misty forests when they are foraging for food. It is however, the loss of these habitats to deforestation that is the biggest threat to the Giant Panda today as they rely almost solely on bamboo to survive.\nGiant Panda Bear Behaviour and Lifestyle\nThe Giant Panda is a solitary animal that occupies a territory marked with secretions from scent glands and scratch marks on trees. Male Giant Pandas roam home ranges more than double the size of a female\u2019s, with his territory overlapping those of several female Giant Pandas with which he holds breeding rights. As bamboo is not particularly nutritious, the Giant Panda must eat lots of bamboo every day and can consume up to 30kg of bamboo leaves, shoots and stems which is roughly 40% of its body weight. Giant Pandas therefore dedicate between 12 and 15 hours a day to munching bamboo which they do by sitting down, allowing their front paws to grip onto the plants. Even though the Giant Panda appears to spend its whole day either eating or sleeping, they are also known to be good at climbing trees and can even swim well when needed.\nGiant Panda Bear Reproduction and Life Cycles\nGiant Pandas breed between March and May when the female begins to indicate her want to mate by making a series of groans and bleats to attract a male. After a gestation period that lasts for around five months, the female Giant Panda gives birth to one or two cubs in the base of a hollow tree or cave. Panda Bear cubs are very underdeveloped at birth measuring as little as 15cm and weighing only 100g, they are made even more vulnerable by the fact that they are also blind and hairless and don\u2019t begin to crawl until they are nearly three months old. Even if a female gives birth to twins she can only care for one that rides on her back until it is 6 months old and is then able to precariously trot beside her. Panda Bear cubs are weaned when they are around a year old but don\u2019t leave their mother until they are 18 months old. Some cubs may stay with their mother for a few years until she becomes pregnant again and they leave to establish a territory of their own.\nGiant Panda Bear Diet and Prey\nDespite being classified as a carnivorous animal (not to mention a species of bear), the Giant Panda eats almost exclusively bamboo in the forest surrounding it. Known to consume more than 30 different species of bamboo plant, Giant Pandas feed on different parts of the plant at different times of year in order to get the most out of it. Capable of eating up to 30kg of bamboo a day, the Giant Panda uses its strong jaws to crush the various plant parts into a more easily digestible paste. Spending more than half of their day eating, Giant Pandas also supplement their diet with other plants including grasses and fruits, as well as rodents and birds on occasion. Even though they can eat nearly half of their body weight in bamboo parts in just one day, the Giant Panda still needs to drink water and does so from mountain streams that are supplied by the melting ice and snow higher up the slopes. For a complete list of foods red pandas eat, check out out \u201cWhat Do Pandas Eat?\u201d page.\nGiant Panda Bear Predators and Threats\nDue to the large size and unique habitat of the Giant Panda, adults have no natural predators within their cool, bamboo-filled world. Cubs however are completely helpless until they are at least a year old and are preyed upon by larger predators such as Leopards and Birds of Prey. Humans however are the biggest threat to Giant Pandas in the Chinese mountains as they have hunted these remarkable animals for their unique fur, almost to extinction in some areas. Although harsh punishments for poaching have now slowed hunting down, Giant Pandas are under extreme threat from habitat loss in the form of deforestation for timber and land clearance for agriculture. They have therefore been forced into small and isolated pockets of their once vast natural range, and have been subjected to severe declines in their population numbers.\nGiant Panda Bear Interesting Facts and Features\nThe Giant Panda has always fascinated people and therefore goes by a number of different names with its scientific name meaning \u201ccat-foot black and white\u201d and its Chinese name translates literally to \u201cGiant Bear Cat\u201d, as the Giant Panda has slits for pupils in their eyes much like a cat. They are also known as the Bamboo Bear by locals due to the enormous amount that they consume. Giant Panda cubs are so small at birth that they weigh about the same as an average mouse and at 100g are roughly 0.001% of their mother\u2019s weight. In the Qinling Mountains in China\u2019s Shaanxi Province, a small population of brown and white Giant Pandas can be found existing amongst the standard black and white ones. Giant Pandas communicate between one another using a series of calls, with 11 different Giant Panda noises having been identified.\nGiant Panda Bear Relationship with Humans\nThe Giant Panda has been admired by people for hundreds of years but more for their beautiful black and white pelts in the past. Since their discovery by the western world and the realisation of their rareness in the wild, Giant Pandas have become one of the most well-known of the world\u2019s large animals with increasing projects and efforts being put in place to try and save them from extinction. They have however been drastically affected by increasing Human activity in their native habitats which has ultimately led to vast population declines and the isolation of the remaining populations. Despite their seemingly cuddly appearance though, the Giant Panda is a species of bear and although attacks on Humans are rare, it is not unheard of for harm to be caused to people (particularly those who attempt to enter captive enclosures).\nGiant Panda Bear Conservation Status and Life Today\nFor decades the Giant Panda was listed by the IUCN as an animal species that was Endangered in the wild. It was strongly believed that the Giant Panda was facing extinction in wild in the near future if more was not done to protect it. The Chinese government has created 33 Giant Panda reserves and more than 50% of its natural habitat is now protected by law. Extensive research has also gone into preventing the Giant Panda from becoming extinct but it simply cannot survive without its unique bamboo forests. However, after 10 years of increasing population numbers to around 2,000 adult individuals, the Giant Panda has now been removed from the endangered species list and is instead classed as Vulnerable by the IUCN mainly thanks to efforts by the Chinese government to not only protect their natural habitats but also by successful reproduction programs.\nView all 111 animals that start with G"}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "30 Interesting and Fun Facts about Giant Pandas", "url": "https://www.giantpandastuff.com/30-interesting-and-fun-panda-facts/", "text": "There are many panda lovers around the world, all fancy about their cute looks, slow moves, and eat-sleep-play lifestyle. But do you know where do they live? What kind of bamboos do they like? How big and heavy they can get? \u2026 Here at Giant Panda Stuff, we give you the top 30 fun and interesting facts about pandas you don\u2019t know, and they will make your day.\n1. Pandas have been living on earth for 2-3 million years.\nFossils of pandas have been dated back to 2 million years old. But there are only around 2000 giant pandas in the world, 400 in captivity in panda centers, and wildlife parks, therefore giant pandas are an easily endangered animal that we should all protect jointly.\n2. The giant panda is member of the bear family, not cat or raccoon\nThe Chinese name for giant panda is \u201cdaxiongmao\u201d, meaning \u201cbig bear cat\u201d. After years of research, scientists have proved that it is a member of the bear family. It was once thought they might be of the raccoon family. The scientific name of the giant panda is \u201cAiluropoda Melanoleuca\u201d which means \u201cblack and white cat-foot\u201d.\n3. The panda is considered a \u201cNational Treasure\u201d by the people of China.\nAlthough once giant pandas were spread in China, Vietnam, and Myanmar. Now they are only found living in a small area in Southwestern China. All pandas in the world are on loan from China. Zoos outside of China must lease the animals from the Chinese government. This money is used for the preservation of the wild Giant Pandas.\n4. Although a carnivore, bamboo counts for 99% of Giant Panda\u2019s diet.\nThese magnificent big panda bears are carnivores, but they really love bamboos! They eat from 25 to 40 pounds per day. In spring this number can even max to 100 pounds. Panda eats bamboo partly because they have no umami taste receptors, so meat tastes bland to them; another possible reason is that they cannot run fast, not easy to catch prey.\nThey will occasionally eat fish and small animals, pandas in captivity also get milk, eggs, and specially made nutritious bun.\n5. A panda poops more than 20 kg a day\nPandas keep regular poops. They can poop up to 40 times a day, as much as 28 kg. Traditionally in ancient China, their poop is collected to make paper, because much of the bamboo that a giant panda eats is not digested. The bamboo fibers make the poop a good source for traditional papermaking.\n6. Pandas spend 55% of its lifetime on bamboo\nGiant pandas spend a lot of their day eating. They spend 10-16 hours a day collecting, preparing and eating bamboo. Although the time they spend on feeding bamboo is long, they can peel and eat a bamboo shoot quick, in about 40 seconds.\n7. Pandas have their type of bamboos.\nPandas need at least 2 different bamboo species in their range to avoid starvation. There are about 164 different types of bamboo in Southwest China and pandas live on about 25 different kinds in the mountains. They especially like an umbrella, arrow, and golden bamboos.\n8. Giant pandas are certainly larger than you think\nAdult giant pandas can grow to 5 feet (1.5 m) long, and weigh up to300 pounds (135 kg). What we see from pictures on the internet, they all look cute and adorable, but don\u2019t forget that they are really big \u201ccat bears\u201d. Males are about 10% larger than females. Giant pandas are far bigger than teddy bears.\n9. Female pandas are fertile only up to 3 days a year.\nGiant Pandas tend to have a low reproductive rate. Female pandas ovulate only once a year, and they are fertile only two or three days. These two or three days are all they have for panda\u2019s entire mating process. Once they have mated, females chase the males out of their territory and raise their cubs on their own.\n10. Females give birth to one or two cubs a time.\nFemale pandas give birth to one or two cubs every two years. If twins are born, usually only the stronger one survives in the wild. It is thought that the mother cannot produce enough milk for two cubs since she does not store fat eating mainly bamboo. Cubs stay with their mothers for about two years before adventuring on their own. For pandas in captivity, usually, the other twin is hand-raised and swapped regularly with the mother so she can raise two cubs.\n11. Most pandas are Virgo.\nPandas are usually born in August or September, as a result of panda\u2019s mating months in March to May and gestation for 3 to 5 months. This is the only season that you get to see newborn cubs. Come and check out our panda volunteering program if you want to participate in baby panda observation at China panda bases!\n12. Black-and-white giant pandas give birth to cubs in pink\nA newborn cub has pink skin, a thin coat of white fur and blind. The iconic black and white color start to develop about one to three weeks after birth, and they only open their eyes between five to seven weeks. The eyespots of a cub are initially light like a circle; as it grows, the circle becomes gradually like a teardrop.\n13. The size of a cub is only similar to a pencil.\nNewborn cubs weigh 4 to 8 ounces and are about 6 to 8 inches long, In size, cubs are about 100 times smaller compared to their mothers. It is almost the smallest mammal newborn relative to its mother\u2019s size. When a baby panda grows to the size similar to a human newborn, it\u2019s almost 2 months old.\n14. Cubs are well protected in the first month\nCubs are taken good care of by the mother when they are born. Mother pandas hold the cub to her chest as a human does. They keep contact with the cub nearly 100% of the time in the first month, using her pay, arm and head to make the cover and walking cradle for the cub.\n15. Panda families don\u2019t live together.\nGiant pandas are solitary and enjoy being alone. Each female having a well-defined range. One giant panda usually needs between 2.5 to 4 square miles (10 million m2) of land to survive. Males and females only meeting briefly to mate (March to May). Then females raise the cubs alone. Recent research, however, suggests that giant pandas occasionally meet outside of the mating season.\n16. Panda knows where and who just by the smell\nGiant pandas have a weak sense of sight but a very good sense of smell. They can know their paths and find the best bamboo stalks by scent, even at night. In the wild, giant Pandas use scent to mark its home region, keep away from others\u2019 living paths, and also use it to locate a mate during the mating period.\n17. Male pandas handstand to wee.\nMale pandas do a handstand while peeing to mark trees. By climbing a tree backward with hindfeet to a full handstand, they can leave the scent higher up.\n18. The giant panda is the slowest walking bear\nUnlike other members of the bear family, giant pandas are slow-moving and barely move faster than a slow walk, and they appear clumsy in the movement. The fastest bear is the black bear, which can run 35 miles per hour. That\u2019s about as fast as a horse or deer.\n19. Giant pandas are pigeon-toed\nGiant pandas walk with their front paws turned inward, looking clumsily cuter than they already are.\nThey have plantigrade feet, which means their entire feet (toes and heel) touches the ground when walking, similar to the way humans do. Differently, we see many other animals, such as dogs and cats walk with their weight on toes.\n20. Pandas have 6 toes to grasp bamboo.\nThe front paws of a giant panda are different from other bears. Giant pandas have a special bone in their wrists, like a sixth \u201ctoe\u201d on the heels of their fore-paws, which is an opposable thumb. Giant pandas use it to grasp and maneuver bamboo more easily.\n21. Pandas do not hibernate\nUnlike most other bears or other animals, pandas do not hibernate during winter. In winter, they head lower down mountains for warmer temperatures where there\u2019s still enough bamboo. One reason is that they mostly eat bamboo and their bamboo diet does not allow them to build up enough fat reserves for the hibernation.\n22. Giant pandas do not only climb trees but also swim across rivers.\nYou may know that giant panda is good at climbing trees, they start to learn climbing from about 5 months old by practicing climbing on their mum\u2019s body. Surprisingly, pandas are also good at swimming. They can swim in mountain streams and rivers. They enjoy life in the mountains in their habitat.\n23. Giant panda keepers role play to look after cubs\nPanda researchers have to wear panda costumes to work with cubs, especially when a giant panda gives birth to a twin. Researchers need to take care of one cub when the mother panda is looking after another.\n24. You can only recognize the gender of adult giant pandas\nMale and female pandas all look the same. Unlike other animals, their genitals are hidden and it\u2019s only possible to distinguish when they grow up to adults.\nThe ratio between male and female pandas are 1:1.\n25. Pandas have one of the highest bite forces of any carnivore.\nPandas are cute and cuddly, but it remains the powerful strength of a carnivore. In fact, giant pandas\u2019 jaw and cheek muscles are so powerful that they can easily chew an aluminum plate into pieces. They can easily bite through a thick bamboo stalk. Humans have trouble cutting the same stalk with an ax.\n26. Giant pandas have four life stages\nThey grow from neonates (0\u2013365 days) to juveniles (12- 18 months), to subadults (19 months-4.5 years), and to adults (over 4.5 years).\n27. Giant pandas live up to 30 years.\nThe life span of giant pandas in the wild is approximately 20 years, but those in captivity may live up to 30 years.\n30. Giant pandas keep a continuous molting\nTo keep warm in winter and cool in summer, giant pandas undergo molting. But unlike other animals experiencing sharp \u201cseasonal molting\u201d, giant panda cannot afford so much energy for a seasonal molting because of its bamboo diet. They take continuous molting to maintain stable energy consumption.\n29. Giant pandas do not use facial expressions to communicate\nThis is very different from other bears of the family. When one panda wants to threaten another, it stares at its opponent with its head down. Researchers believe a panda may do that so that its black ears will look like another pair of eyes against the white fur of its neck.\n30. Giant pandas make 11 kinds of sounds\nThe most often heard words panda cubs say are \u201cGee-Gee\u201d (I\u2019m hungry), \u201cWow-Wow\u201d (Not happy!) or \u201cCoo-Coo\u201d (Nice!). As they grow, cubs learn more how to express by roaring, barking, shouting, squeaking, bleating and chirping.\nPandas can be as gentle as a lamb when they are \u201cin love\u201d. Male pandas baa all the time and females respond with a constant warble.\nPanda researchers have counted 11 different panda calls\u2014and four of them are used only when searching for a mate.\nWant to hear these fascinating sounds and calls of giant pandas?

These striking animals are now confined to fragmented forest patches high in the mountains of southwestern China. These same mountains form the watershed for China's Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, whose basins are the economic heart of China and home to over 500 million people.As China's economy continues its rapid development, it is more important than ever to conserve the forest home of the giant panda - not just to safeguard this well-loved species, but to maintain the subsistence fisheries, agriculture, and water resources essential for nearly 40 per cent of China\u2019s people.WWF considers the giant panda as a 'flagship' species: that is, a charismatic representative of the biologically rich temperate forest it inhabits. By conserving the giant panda and its habitat, many other species will also be conserved - as will water resources that are essential for the future of hundreds of millions of people.WWF has been active in giant panda conservation since 1980, and was the first international conservation organization to work in China at the Chinese government's invitation. Early work included the first-ever intensive field studies of wild panda ecology and behaviour."}

They live in China where they inhabit mainly mountainsides with dense bamboo forests.\nA Vegetarian Animal of Prey\nScientifically, Pandas have the anatomy of carnivores and are predators. However, they almost exclusively feed on bamboo. Yet, they also take some tasty fish or a small rodent for a snack in between sometimes.\nAnatomy and Appearance\nWhy Does the Panda Get Have Black and White Fur?\nScientists are not quite sure. They believe pandas might have developed a black and white fur in order to stand out against the colors of the jungle and to be able to find each other more easily.\nBehavior\nHuge Panda? Huge Appetite!\nGiant pandas spend at least twelve hours a day munching away bamboo. They use their sharp teeth and strong jaws to remove the hard bark and then feed on the juicy inside. They eat 22-66 lb (10-30 kg) which is about 40 % of its own body weight! The reason for this is not their love for food:\nBamboo is not very nutritious, and this means that pandas need lots and lots of it. And eating so much is not even worth the trouble. The panda can digest only 20 % of the food. 80 % are excreted undigested \u2013 more than 12 times a day ... stink alarm!\nEnemies and Threats\nDo Giant Pandas Have Enemies?\nIts natural predators include snow leopards and eagles. To cubs, martens, red dogs and weasel pose a threat.\nNo Bamboo, No Panda\nThe Panda needs lots of bamboo, but it eats only about 25 of 100 species. In general, the panda changes its \u201crestaurant\u201d if there is no more bamboo available and moves on to another region. Unfortunately this is a problem, as humans take over more and more of the panda\u2019s habitat and chop down the bamboo forests.\nThe panda is right on top of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as a vulnerable species (luckily, since 2016 it is not threatened anymore but \u201conly\u201d endangered). The nature conservation organization WWF estimates that there are only about 1,800 pandas left worldwide.\nAre Giant Pandas Dangerous?\nGiant pandas are considered gentle and peaceful. They avoid fighting and prefer to back off. But if they can not escape, they can become dangerous - for enemies, rivals and for humans.\nSenses and Abilities\nCan Giant Pandas Swim?\nYou might tink that Giant Pandas are too large and heavy to swim and would rather drown. Don't worry ;) Giant Pandas can swim!\nCan Giant Pandas Climb Up Trees?\nYes, they can. Even a few months old panda cubs can already climb very well.\nReproduction\nGiant Panda Babies\nThe birth of a panda is always a extraordinary event, because captive pandas only very rarely give birth. Yet, according to the Guinness Book of Records 2009, 30 (!) pandas were born in 2006, most of them in the Wolong Panda Research Centre, Southwest China.\nFun Facts\nGiant Pandas Make Funny Sounds\nPandas seem to quietly munch away at their bamboo. Surprisingly enough, they are not as quiet as you might think. Sometimes you can hear them bleat in a friendly manner or blat like baby goats or lambs. They bark, growl and hiss, too. Baby pandas also quack and squeak.\nThe Giant Panda Is Related To:\nAnimals in the Same Biome:"}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant Panda Bear Facts | Endangered Animals", "url": "https://animalfactguide.com/animal-facts/giant-panda/", "text": "Native to the mountain forests of southwest China, the giant panda is one of the most beloved animals in the world.\nGiant pandas are identified by their distinctive black and white coloring. Their ears, muzzle, eyes, shoulders and legs are black while the rest of their body is white. Their thick hair keeps them warm in the cool, wet mountain zones. When on all fours, giant pandas average between 60-100 cm (2-3 ft.) tall at the shoulder and between 1-2 m (4-6 ft.) long. They can weigh between 100-115 kg (220-250 lb.), with males being larger than females.\nOne of the interesting evolutionary traits of the panda is their protruding wrist bone that acts like a thumb. This helps the pandas hold bamboo while they munch on it with their strong molar teeth. Bamboo makes up nearly the entire diet of the panda. Due to the low nutritional value of bamboo, pandas need to eat 10-20 kg (20-40 lb.) a day. Occasionally pandas will eat other available food, including small rodents, eggs, fish and other flora. Bamboo provides a good amount of water, but pandas need to supplement this with fresh water daily.\nWhen pandas are between 4-8 years of age, they reach maturity and can reproduce. However, female pandas are only able to become pregnant for 2-3 days each spring! In this small window of time, male and female pandas find each other through scents and calls similar to that of goats or sheep. They do not roar like other bears.\nBetween 95 and 160 days of becoming pregnant, the female panda will give birth. The newborn cub is blind, hairless, and tiny, weighing only 85-140 g (3-5 oz.). Completely helpless, the cub cannot move much on its own for nearly 3 months. In turn, the mother is very protective and careful in tending to her cub during this time.\nConservation Status\nWith only around 2060 pandas living in the wild, the giant panda is considered vulnerable of extinction by the IUCN Red List. Due to the fact that pandas reproduce so infrequently, it is very difficult for their population to recover from such a low point.\nOne the main reasons that panda populations have declined is habitat destruction. As the human population in China continues to grow, pandas\u2019 habitat gets taken over by development, pushing them into smaller and less livable areas. Habitat destruction also leads to food shortages. Pandas feed on several varieties of bamboo that bloom at different times of the year. If one type of bamboo is destroyed by development, it can leave the pandas with nothing to eat during the time it normally blooms, increasing the risk of starvation.\nTo combat this issue, the Chinese government has actively worked to restore and protect bamboo habitat, and these measures have shown positive results. State Forestry Administration surveys have concluded that the panda population has increased since the Chinese government\u2019s actions, and in 2016, the IUCN upgraded the giant panda\u2019s status from Endangered to Vulnerable.\nWhile an increasing panda population is good news for now, it is predicted that climate change will eliminate over 35% of the panda\u2019s bamboo habitat in the next 80 years.\nWhat You Can Do to Help\nWildlife reserves have been set up in parts of China to make sure the pandas have a home, and care is taken to make sure they survive in the wild. Researchers continue to study how pandas breed in an effort to increase the population. You can help by donating or adopting a panda through the World Wildlife Fund.\nGiant Panda Distribution\nPanda Resources\nMore Panda Stuff from Animal Fact Guide\nBlog Posts about the Giant Panda"}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant Panda - Facts, Diet, Habitat & Pictures on Animalia.bio", "url": "https://animalia.bio/giant-panda", "text": "Habits and Lifestyle\nGiant pandas are terrestrial animals although they are able to climb and take shelter in hollow trees or rock crevices, but do not establish permanent dens. For this reason, pandas do not hibernate. They are solitary, occupying a territory which they mark with secretions from their scent glands and by scratch marks on trees. They spend 12 to 15 hours a day chewing bamboo while sitting down with their front paws holding onto the plants. Giant pandas are crepuscular, being active twice a day, at dawn and dusk. They eat as much as 9 to 14 kg (20 to 30 lb) of bamboo shoots a day and will travel between different habitats if they need to, so they can get the nutrients that they need and to balance their diet for reproduction. Pandas communicate through vocalization and can swim."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant panda Fun Facts for Kids - Animals A to Z for Kids", "url": "https://www.animalsatozforkids.com/giant-panda/", "text": "Giant panda Introduction\nThe giant panda also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a large bear native to south central China. The Giant Panda is a medium to large sized bear that like other species has a large head, short tail and a long muzzle with a large nose, which gives them an excellent sense of smell. The thick fur of the Giant Panda is creamy-white in colour with large patches of black on the limbs, shoulders, ears and nose, and distinctive black patches around their small eyes. The Giant Panda eats almost only bamboo and so has a number of physical adaptations to help with its consumption including an extension of their wrist bone which acts a bit like a thumb, allowing the Giant Panda to grip onto bamboo stems. They also have large jaws with strong jaw muscles that along with their flat molars, allow the Giant Panda to crush bamboo stems and leaves in order to extract the nutrients.\nHistorically, the Giant Panda would have been found throughout the lowlands of the Yangtze River Basin but increased Human activity in these areas has pushed the Giant Pandas high up into the mountains. Remote populations are still found in six different mountain ranges in central and western China, where they inhabit broadleaf and coniferous forests with a thick bamboo under-storey at elevations between 5,000 and 13,000 feet. These high-altitude forests are cool, cloudy and moist and are generally subjected to a high level of rainfall."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant Panda Facts - Animal Facts Encyclopedia", "url": "https://www.animalfactsencyclopedia.com/Giant-Panda-facts.html", "text": "Giant Panda Facts\nThe giant panda is one of the world's eight species of true bears.\nAlthough for a number of decades there was some controversy over whether the panda was actually a bear at all, the recent consensus is that the panda is, in fact, all bear.\n.Some scientists argued that the giant panda and the red panda which share many characteristics were both more closely related to raccoons than bears. Closer study of the giant pandas molecular structure, however, puts them in the family ursidae - the true bears.\nGiant pandas live in the densely vegetated mountains of central China, where mist, heavy rains, and high humidity promote thick forests.\nThe panda dines almost exclusively on one type of plant material, bamboo, which makes up over 95% of its diet. On rare occasions pandas will consume other types of plants, small animals, or insects, but the bamboo diet is so dominant, and has been consumed by the panda for so many thousands of years, that it has evolved into a bamboo eating machine, and has even evolved special paws with bony \"pseudo thumbs\" for handling bamboo shoots.\nThe giant panda lives a solitary life and each individual marks, patrols and maintains its own territory. Giant pandas will actively avoid each other upon seeing or hearing another nearby, and females in particular will chase strangers out of their range and then actively and agitatedly re-mark the boundary lines with claw scratches, sprays of urine and strategic droppings.\nPandas will occasionally enter caves or hollowed out trees to sleep or den for a few days but do not have permanent living arrangements. They do not hibernate as some other bear species do, but they will make short migratory moves to warmer climates depending on the season.\nAlthough not officially the national symbol of China, (the dragon is) the giant panda can be found on many Chinese coins and its likeness even appears on many of the nations official government documents. -Giant Panda Facts\nthe giant panda bear club\nWith such a limited diet and such high dependence on the delicate ecosystem of the bamboo forests, the Giant Panda has been critically endangered for many decades, but vigorous efforts by the Chinese government have managed to maintain the wild population.\nIn fact, the punishment for killing a wild Giant Panda is twenty years hard labor. The lesson here? Cute counts! - Giant Panda Facts\ngiant panda reproduction\nPanda mother and cub\nThe giant panda reaches sexual maturity at 4 to 7 years. The female ovulates once a year and there is only a 2 to 3 day period during which she can conceive.\nThe pair will only remain together a matter of days. The pregnancy will last about 4 1/2 months. The newborn baby panda is a writhing, red, hairless creature the size of a cell phone bearing very little resemblance to its mother.\nWith the exception of kangaroos and some other marsupials, a brand new baby panda is the smallest new-born in relation to it's mother's body - only about 1/1000th of her size! It is extremely difficult for the mother without the benefit of a marsupials pouch, to protect the precious offspring, and though twins are often born, perhaps in anticipation of difficulties in the early months of life, it is very rare that both siblings survive.\nThe giant panda, like all bears, has a very slow reproductive rate, so the survival of the remaining cub is critical, and panda mothers are vigilant parents who will defend their cub with great ferocity and fearlessness. Close and cuddly, the young giant panda will stay with its mother for about 3 years before heading out on its own. - Giant Panda Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

It dines on bamboo, also has a false thumb, and lives in territory that overlaps that of the giant panda, but this is the result of \"concurrent\" or\" convergent\" evolution not because the animals are related species. - Giant Panda Facts\nwhat do pandas eat?\nAll bears were true carnivores at one point in their evolution, but all bear species except the polar bear have turned to different diets to survive. Teeth in the back of the jaw that were once sharp cutting and tearing instruments developed into flat- molar type grinders to process once inedible materials.\nThe pandas switch to bamboo as the staple of its diet happened thousands of years ago for reasons one can only theorize, but it most probably saved it from extinction. Its teeth have slowly changed, and its stomach acids and saliva have evolved a new chemistry that breaks down the woody plants, but much of its body remains unchanged.\nBecause it originally evolved as a carnivore, the giant panda is now a meat-eater surviving by ingesting plants. The giant panda spends most of its waking hours eating bamboo, often in a fully reclined position.\nThey consume about 30 different species of bamboo so there is at least some variety in taste. And there are different edible parts of the plant as well. Giant pandas can be found munching on fresh new bamboo shoots in the spring, bitter green bamboo leaves in the summer, and tough and chewy bamboo stems in the winter.\nDriven to consume as much as 50 pounds of raw bamboo a day to sustain it's massive body, but without the furnace-like stomach of a horse, cow or rhino to burn the limited nutrients that bamboo provides, the panda is a lethargic, slow-moving animal, and even cubs are more likely to just tumble around on the ground than lift their bodies up into a run or a jump. Ultimately, the life of a giant panda has one giant theme: lie down and eat! - Giant Panda Facts\nthe pandas pseudo-thumb\nThe panda dines almost exclusively on one type of plant material, bamboo, which makes up over 95% of the diet. However, if you look at the teeth, stomach and digestive system of the panda, it would appear to be designed to consume a mostly meat diet. Large sharp teeth for tearing flesh, and the stomach chamber required to digest a deer, not a stalk of bamboo.\nWhat evolutionary crossroad caused the panda to alter it's diet so drastically? We do know that this once carnivorous bear has been eating bamboo for so long that it evolved a small knob of bone at the perimeter of each paw that allows it to maneuver the sometimes unruly stalks of bamboo.\nCalled the \"false thumb\" or \"pseudo thumb\" it developed on the front paw which is large and flat with five digits all facing in the same direction- no opposable thumb. The knob is an extension of the small sesamoid bone in the wrist. Located at the bottom corner of the paw, opposite the five digits, it allows the panda to grasp slim bits of bamboo almost as if it had hands.

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant Panda - Facts, Description, Range, Habitat, Behavior, Diet and ...", "url": "https://www.vedantu.com/animal/giant-panda", "text": "Panda Facts: Important Details about the Animal\nPandas or more commonly known as giant pandas basically resemble the physical appearance of a bear. These organisms are basically known for their distinctive features and they also have a very obvious black and white coloration due to the presence of fur in their bodies. The limbs, shoulders, and ears of pandas are coated with black fur. Also, the belly, face, and the middle portion of their back are coated mostly with white fur. Not to mention that their eyes are also coated with black fur. This is exactly what provides the complexion to the pandas in the best way.\nResearchers have several panda facts that make better mention of the use of the fur but they have not yet figured out the reason for this distinctive fur type in pandas. However, it has been suggested that the color helps in providing some camouflage protection to the pandas that reside in the forest areas. With the help of our notes, students will be able to learn more about pandas such as where do pandas eat and where are pandas found along with some other information as well.\nCommon Panda Facts and Details\nScientific Name: Ailuropoda melanoleuca\nBasic Animal Group: Mammal\nLifespan: 20 years (in the wild)\nCommon Names: Giant panda\nWeight: 150\u2013300 pounds\nSize: 2\u20133 feet tall right at the shoulder when they are standing on four legs and about 5-feet tall when standing erect\nHabitat: Broadleaf forests and mixed forests, locations where bamboo might be present, mainly found in southeast China\nConservation Status: Vulnerable\nWhat do pandas eat: Omnivore\nPopulation: About 1,600\nDescription of a Panda\nPandas have a very distinctive body shape that is identifiable to the human eyes. There is a striking resemblance to the body shape of a bear. However, the size of a panda is almost equal to that of an American black bear. There is a very obvious coating of black and white fur present on the body of the bear and along with their ears as well. However, there are some areas of the body that are white in color. This is something that gives the distinctive look to a panda\u2019s body.\nThe molars in Giant pandas are flat and have a broad surface as well. This is something that comes in handy when the animals feel the need to crush certain tough bamboo shoots and several types of leaves as well as stems that they need to eat. Along with that, pandas also have a very large wrist which serves a very important purpose. The wrist bone is often used as an opposable thumb and that helps the pandas in grabbing the bamboo shoots and stems as well. It is a known fact about pandas that they do not need to hibernate. Pandas are also considered to be the rarest of the species in the entire bear family.\nThese are some of the details which are really important when it comes to gathering panda information. Students can use this information to know more about the species and learn interesting facts about it as well. We are pretty sure that these notes are going to be extremely useful in that process.\nRange and Habitat of Pandas\nWhen it comes to the question of where do pandas live, there are several examples that can be given with regards to their habitat. For example, pandas often tend to have their habitat in the mixed forests as well as the broadleaf forests as well. These are some of the main areas where there might be a presence of bamboo shoots which is a staple diet of pandas. These details would sufficiently answer all the questions about where pandas are found.\nThese forests are mostly a part of Southeast China and hence pandas often like to reside there. These animals often have a call which they use in order to communicate with one another. A very different type of communication that they use is scent marks. One of the most important panda facts is that they tend to have a very sophisticated sense of smell and hence these scent markings prove to be very useful during communication and it also helps in defining their territories.\nBehavior and Diet of Pandas\nOne of the most common things that people ask about pandas is what do pandas eat. Well, to be completely honest, pandas have a highly specialized diet as they are very particular about what to include in their diet. Pandas love to live in areas that have bamboo shoots. This is a food source that consumes about 99% of their entire diet. However, there are also several species of pandas that tend to hunt for small rodents and pikas as well. Bamboo might not be that great of a source when it comes to nutrition and hence they need to make sure that there is enough compensation when it comes to food. That is one of the main reasons why they consume large amounts of plants as well. We hope that these details are able to answer the questions about what do pandas eat.\nPandas often tend to stay in smaller areas so that they can conserve their energy in the best way. In order to have sufficient consumption, they need to make sure that they are consuming as much food as they can. Hence, pandas take about 10 to 12 hours a day in order to feed themselves properly.\nIt is a very important thing to notice that there are some types of pandas that have jaws that are very powerful. Along with that, the molar teeth are also pretty flat and large. This is a particular structure that ensures that pandas are able to properly grind their food in the best way. Since bamboo and stems are pretty hard, the presence of strong teeth in pandas is clearly justified in the best way. One pattern that pandas follow when they are eating is that they tend to do that sitting in an upright position. The reason behind using this particular position is that it helps the pandas in grabbing the different bamboo stems in the best way.\nWhen we are talking about panda information, it is also essential to know about the digestive system of a panda. Now the digestive system of several pandas is pretty much insufficient and there aren\u2019t many adaptations that are required in herbivorous mammals. So, most of the bamboo and stems that they tend to consume get transferred through their system and are commonly excreted as waste. For water consumption, pandas have bamboo again. Also, they tend to have a drink of water from forest streams that are situated in their habitats.\nReproduction and Offspring\nApart from knowing where pandas are found, people also need to know about the reproduction process in pandas so that they can gather as much information as necessary. Our notes are helpful in describing that aspect as well. When it comes to the mating season in giant pandas, the months between March and May are simply the best. So, going by that data, the younger generation of baby pandas is born in the month of August or September. When it comes to breeding, giant pandas are unable to do so when they are held captive.\nThe babies or the younger giant pandas, when born, are pretty helpless. The eyes of the babies are not fully opened as it takes some time. The eyes take about 8 weeks to open fully and till then the babies need to have all the care and attention of their mother. Even after the eyes have opened, it is important that the baby pandas get all the care for about 1 year so that they can become self-sufficient after that. This time period when baby pandas need to have the utmost care is known as weaning. Pandas take about 3 years in total to mature and hence till then they need to have attention and motherly care for sure. It is also one of the biggest giant panda facts that these animals are declared as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In fact, there are just about 1600 different giant pandas that are left on the entire planet. Most pandas that are held captive are done so in countries such as China.\nSome Interesting Giant Panda Facts\nHere we are going to present some of the most interesting panda facts that people might need to know about.\nGiant Pandas Tend To Be Really Great At Swimming and Climbing Trees\nWhile giant pandas might not be able to stand tall for a very long time, it is a known fact that they are really good swimmers. Apart from that, there is also a fact that pandas are really good tree climbers for sure. From the age of 7 months, pandas are able to climb trees. Since they feed on bamboo and stems, they need to perch themselves high on the trees and hence they are very good at doing so without any trouble for sure.\nPandas Change Color\nThis is another very interesting fact about pandas that most people might not know about. Pandas tend to be in different colors when they are at different stages of their life. For example, pandas, when born maintain the color pink and they are completely hairless as well. They actually retain the color and looks of baby badgers. Also, pandas are mostly blind when they are brown. The iconic color of black and white skin in pandas actually comes a lot later in life. It takes about 3 weeks for them to change the color to black and white. However, there are some pandas that don\u2019t even turn black and white. There are some pandas that tend to retain the color of brown and white after some time of their birth.\nPandas Can Be Very Lazy\nWhile there are many organisms that often like to run around and socialize and remain active throughout the days and nights, pandas don\u2019t seem to choose that lifestyle. In fact, it is a known fact that pandas are pretty lazy as they come. Pandas choose to spend their entire life eating and sleeping on lands and trees. They are not really active when they are not eating as well. Even in some species, breeding is not really that high on their priority list as well. That could be one of the main reasons why pandas are considered to be a species that is endangered.\nAn Adult Panda can Eat a Lot of Bamboo\nThis might be a bit surprising to know about a panda that is an adult that can eat about 12-38 kilos of Bamboo in a single day. That might be quite a lot for some other animals but it is hardly anything for a panda. Bamboo tends to constitute about 99% of the entire diet of a panda. Hence, for a 45-kilo weighing panda, it is actually a balanced diet. A panda spends about 12 hours every single day eating. So, there is simply not a single speck of doubt that they can eat a lot of bamboo. The main reason behind this is that bamboo doesn\u2019t really fulfill the criterion of nutrition when they consume it in smaller amounts."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant Panda | San Diego Zoo Animals & Plants", "url": "https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/animals/giant-panda", "text": "Giant pandas face big problems: Today, only over 1,800 giant pandas survive on Earth. Until 2016, they were categorized as Endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species. They are currently listed as Vulnerable, thanks to numerous conservation efforts that have helped to increase their population. However they, still face many serious threats:\nHabitat destruction: Unfortunately for pandas, China\u2019s forests have changed. The country has more than a billion people. Just as in the US, with more people have come more roads, homes, cities, and farms. They mine, harvest trees, and use other natural resources. The giant panda\u2019s range shrunk as trees were removed in logging operations and land was cleared for farming. In fact, panda-suitable habitat decreased by half between 1974 and 1985.\nPopulations of pandas have become small and isolated, hemmed in by cultivation. Some panda habitat has literally been encircled by farms, villages, and business sites\u2014creating \u201cislands\u201d between which pandas can\u2019t safely move without coming upon human communities or crossing dangerous highways. In some pockets, very few pandas are found. They are isolated and cut off from other sources of bamboo\u2014and from other pandas.\nIn some areas, forest clear-cutting has completely removed all large trees\u2014and all appropriate tree and rock den sites. Without a protective den, panda cubs are more susceptible to cold, disease, and predators.\nLow reproductive rate: Pandas like to be by themselves most of the year, and they have a very short breeding season, when a male looks for a female to mate with. Females give birth to one or two cubs, which are very dependent on their mother during the first few years of life. Mother pandas care for only one of the young. In panda facilities in China, wildlife care specialists help to hand raise any twin cubs; one baby is left with the mother and the wildlife care specialists switch the twins every few days so each one gets care and milk directly from the mother.\nBamboo shortages: When bamboo plants reach maturity, they flower and produce seeds before the mature plant dies. The seeds grow slowly into plants large enough for pandas to eat. Giant pandas can eat 25 different types of bamboo, but they usually eat only the 4 or 5 kinds that grow in their home range. The unusual thing about bamboo is that all of the plants of one type growing in an area bloom and die at the same time. When those plants die, pandas must move to another area. This is why good panda habitat should have several different varieties of bamboo.\nHunting: When hunters set snares for other wildlife, like musk deer, the traps can kill pandas instead.\nProtecting pandas: Panda protection efforts in China began back in 1957, and in 1989, the Chinese Ministry of Forestry and the World Wildlife Fund formulated a management plan for the giant panda and its habitat. It called for reducing human activities in panda habitat, managing bamboo habitat, extending the panda reserve system, and maintaining populations of pandas in human care.\nChina's Natural Forest Conservation Program of 1998 provides protection to all remaining forests throughout the panda\u2019s range, which covers about 5.7 million acres (2.3 million hectares).\nChina has set up 65 panda reserves that protect panda habitats from further development. Some are off limits to people completely, while others are shared-use areas like our national forests. Natural corridors connect some reserves to help keep panda populations together.\nToday, China is currently gaining forestland. The government has started policies like the \u201cGrain-to-Green\u201d program, which gives grain and cash to farmers who abandon farming on steep slopes and replant these areas for natural forests and grasslands. But we\u2019re still not sure if these newly forested areas are suitable for pandas.\nIt takes an international effort: Back in the 1990s, biologists didn't know if they could save pandas from extinction. Little was known of their behavior, and pandas did not reproduce well in zoos. Then, San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance partnered with Chinese colleagues at panda preserves to create a conservation strategy. We developed early-detection pregnancy tests, as well as a milk formula for panda cubs that raised survival rates from zero to 100 percent. We also began using GPS technology to track pandas and learn how far they range. In 2010, we reached the milestone number of 300 pandas in zoos worldwide and breeding centers in China, which scientists believe will ensure a self-sustaining population. We are definitely boosting panda survival rates!\nThere is still much that we don't know about pandas. Our conservation scientists have learned a lot about basic panda care techniques, veterinary care, and nutrition; panda reproduction; the importance of environmental enrichment; and the significance of chemical communication, or how pandas\u2019 respond to the odors of other pandas. By gathering more than 20 years' worth of data at the San Diego Zoo, where the pandas were easy to observe, we gained a better understanding of what they needed to thrive in their natural habitat.\nWorking together with Chinese panda experts may help increase the number of giant pandas and ensure the future survival of the giant panda population. A giant panda milk formula created by the Zoo's nutritionist, and a hand-rearing technique developed by the Chinese called \"twin swapping,\" have transformed the survival rate of nursery-reared panda cubs in China from 0 to 95 percent. The giant panda breeding rate at the Wolong Breeding Center in China increased dramatically following multiyear collaborations with the San Diego Zoo. Work by our scientists has advanced pregnancy diagnosis, and the population of pandas in human care has reached the milestone of 300 bears, the minimum necessary to sustain genetic diversity for the next 100 years.\nIn 2012, we were honored to receive the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' International Conservation Award along with the Smithsonian National Zoological Park, Memphis Zoo, and Zoo Atlanta for our \"Scientific Approaches to Conservation of Giant Pandas and Their Habitat.\"\nWhat YOU can do to help pandas: People ask us every day how they can help save pandas. You can make a big impact by making some simple changes in your daily lifestyle, like knowing where the products you purchase come from, choosing accordingly, and buying fewer things or items with minimal packaging. You can help by choosing wood products that are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), an independent, non-governmental, not-for-profit organization that promotes the responsible management of the world\u2019s forests.

They have black fur on their limbs, ears, and shoulders. Their face, belly, and the middle of their back is white and they have black fur around their eyes. The reason for this unusual color pattern is not fully understood, although some scientists have suggested it provides camouflage in the dappled, shady environments of the forests in which they live.\nFast Facts: Giant Pandas Scientific Name: Ailuropoda melanoleuca\nAiluropoda melanoleuca Common Names: Giant panda\nGiant panda Basic Animal Group: Mammal\nMammal Size: 2\u20133 feet tall at the shoulder when on four legs, about 5-feet tall standing erect\n2\u20133 feet tall at the shoulder when on four legs, about 5-feet tall standing erect Weight: 150\u2013300 pounds\n150\u2013300 pounds Lifespan: 20 years (in the wild)\n20 years (in the wild) Diet: Omnivore\nOmnivore Habitat: Broadleaf and mixed forests, where bamboo is present, in southeast China\nBroadleaf and mixed forests, where bamboo is present, in southeast China Population: About 1,600\nAbout 1,600 Conservation Status: Vulnerable\nDescription\nGiant pandas have a body shape and build that is typical of most bears and are roughly the size of an American black bear. They have a distinctive black-and-white coat with black fur covering their ears, arms and legs, and part of their chest and back. The rest of their fur is white.\nGiant pandas' molars are very broad and flat, which helps the animals crush the bamboo shoots, leaves, and stems that they eat. They also have an enlarged wrist bone that functions as an opposable thumb, which helps them grasp the bamboo. Giant pandas do not hibernate and are the rarest species in the bear family.\nHabitat and Range\nGiant pandas inhabit the broadleaf and mixed forests where bamboo is present, in southeast China. They usually communicate using calls or scent marks. Giant pandas have a sophisticated sense of smell and they use scent marking to recognize and define their territories.\nDiet and Behavior\nGiant pandas are highly specialized in terms of their diet. Bamboo accounts for over 99 percent of the giant pandas' diet, though they sometimes hunt for pikas and other small rodents. Since bamboo is a poor source of nutrition, the bears must make up for this by consuming vast amounts of the plant. Another strategy they use to compensate for their bamboo diet is to conserve their energy by remaining within a small area. To consume sufficient bamboo to provide all the energy they need, it takes giant pandas as long as 10 and 12 hours of feeding every day.\nGiant pandas have powerful jaws and their molar teeth are large and flat, a structure that makes them well suited for grinding up the fibrous bamboo they eat. Pandas feed while sitting upright, a posture that enables them to grab onto bamboo steams.\nThe digestive system of a giant panda is inefficient and lacks the adaptations that many other herbivorous mammals possess. Much of the bamboo they eat passes through their system and is expelled as waste. Giant pandas obtain most of the water they need from the bamboo they eat. To supplement this water intake, they also drink out of streams that are common in their forest habitat.\nReproduction and Offspring\nThe giant panda mating season is between March and May and young are usually born in August or September. Giant pandas are reluctant to breed in captivity.\nYoung giant pandas are born quite helpless. Their eyes remain closed for the first eight weeks of their life. For the next nine months, the cubs nurse from their mother and they are weaned at one year.\nThey still require a long period of maternal care after weaning, and for this reason, remain with their mother for a one-and-a-half to three years, as they mature.\nyesfoto/Getty Images\nConservation Status\nGiant pandas are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. There are only about 1,600 giant pandas that remain in the wild. Most captive pandas are kept in China.\nClassification Debate\nThe classification of giant pandas was once a subject of intense debate. At one time they were thought to be of a close relation to raccoons, but molecular studies have revealed they belong within the bear family. Giant pandas diverged from other bears early in the family's evolution.\nSources"}

They do not hibernate.\nThe giant panda is so loved around the world that China has shared some of its animals with zoos. This has been a great help in also expanding the population.\nGiant pandas are very endangered. One of the reasons is that they have difficulty mating and only mate once per year. They have a low birth rate and typically only give birth to one baby.\nGiant pandas have an extra digit on their hand. This helps to tear away at the bamboo shoot. They have a thick layer of mucus in their gut to protect their stomachs from the bamboo splinters.\nWhile giant pandas typically eat over twenty different types of bamboo, it is very low in nutrition and they have to eat 20 kg every day to get the nutrition that they need. That is why it can take a giant panda up to 16 hours in their feeding process.\nWhy do pandas eat bamboo?\nThey eat bamboo because it is a food source that is available all throughout the year. They have digestive systems that are made so that they can break down meat and plants but Pandas are not good hunters so they take bamboo because it is easy to get a hold of.\nThey choose to eat bamboo stalk over any type of meat which isn\u2019t always good for them because they only get around 20% of the mins and minerals that are needed from foods when they eat bamboo.\nA panda that is large will need to eat around 40 pounds of bamboo each day in order to survive and to build up energy in order to make it through their day. This means that a typical panda will spend around 16 hours eating just to get enough energy to fuel their bodies.\nSince it doesn\u2019t give them a lot of energy, they are not able to last very long or to build up enough fat in order to have long periods of sleep or hibernation. The panda also cannot go for a long period of days or months without eating and therefore, they will eat bamboo and spend much time sleeping in order to conserve some of their energy.\nWhat do pandas eat and drink?\nAlmost all of their diet is bamboo. They will eat around 20 different species of bamboos and they eat the root, bamboo leaves, and the shoots. They eat different bamboo based on where they live and what season it is. For example, in the spring they eat different varieties of shoots while in the fall, they will eat the leaves of the bamboo.\nThe roots provide most of the nutrition, even though it is still very little, and so most of their diet depends on the roots in order to survive.\nFacts for Kids x To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Facts for Kids\nAbout 1% of their diet is other foods, but this mostly applies to pandas that are in captivity for example in the zoo they will sometimes eat apples and other fruits.\nSome in the zoo are fed cornbread. Most of the food that is fed in the zoo is carefully chosen to make sure that they are getting the right nutrition that they need to survive. About 1% of their diet in the wild is meat.\nSome hunt small rodents, fish, small birds and even insects that they find close to where they are living. They are not considered to be very quick animals, so if they hunt meat, it is not something that they are very good at.\nA panda that is held in a zoo does not spend as much time eating as a wild one because they don\u2019t have to look for their food and they have a variety other than bamboo. This means that they sleep less and eat less compared to ones that are in the wild and have to find their own food sources.\nWhere do pandas live?\nThey are native to China and they are very loved there. This is where most originated but now, they live all over the world in different zoos. There are less than 2,000 that are found in the wild and there are only around 250 pandas that live in zoos around the world.\nThey are found in regions that are mountainous and can be found in Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi Chinese provinces between 5,000 and 10,000 feet in elevation. These wild pandas live in areas that are cool and wet and they are found in bamboo forests. These forests allow them to make homes out of stumps of trees or logs. These dens are made inside of the forests.\nIt is important that they live close to the bamboo forests because bamboo is the biggest part of their daily intake of food.\nHow long do pandas sleep?\nThey sleep for 2 to 4 hours each day and they sleep by laying on their backs, sides or stomachs. They love to stretch and to roll in a ball when they are sleeping. They can sleep almost anywhere because they don\u2019t really have many natural predators to worry about. They can also take a small nap in between their feedings.\nSome sleep on the forest ground while others sleep in trees. Since they can climb very well, they will often times climb up a tree when they are sleeping.\nThe ones that live in the zoo will usually be put on the same schedule that a wild panda would be on. The zoo does this so that it can copy their natural instincts and their body rhythms of activity and rest that they need.\nHow long do pandas live?\nMost that live in the wild will live between 15-20 years. They are considered to be teenagers until they are five years of age and then between 5-18 years of age they are called youth pandas.\nMost that live in the zoo usually live longer. They can live up to 30 years of age, and the oldest lived to be 38 years old. The ones that live in the zoo usually live longer because they don\u2019t have to face the threats such as weather and other environmental problems.\nWhy are giant pandas endangered?\nThe ones that live in the wild will sometimes lose their habitat and when this happens, they die because they don\u2019t have enough food to eat. Since they mostly eat bamboo to live, when their forests are taken down, they are not able to survive.\nThey only only give birth every two years.\nThey have a hard time breeding because they are very choosy about their mates and because the females are only in heat for up to 25 days and only fertile up to 36 hours. This has caused them to become endangered.\nThey also have to face the chance of being hunted. Many have been killed by poachers in the wild. They only live in the wild in bamboo forests in China and in the past, they lived in other places such as Vietnam and Burma.\nIt is estimated that there are only around 1,900 that live in the wild today.\nNatural Habitat loss can cause them to lose their home and to face starvation. Much of the habitat loss happens due to deforestation. This is when the forest is cleared away.\nSince they rely so much on bamboo, when their bamboo forests are destroyed or cut down, they lack the food and often have a hard time relocating.\nOther animals have spent their whole lives adapting but this is not true for the panda.\nEven though their body is set up to be able to eat meat, they are not a very good hunter and will spend their day eating around 40 pounds of bamboo just to survive.\nAre pandas dangerous?\nThey can be a dangerous animal because they are carnivores, even though they spend much of their time only eating bamboo.\nThey have a large bone features and they are very strong and have a very powerful bite. This bite is useful because it allows them to eat through the root of the bamboo so that they can survive.\nAnother thing is they can climb fast and can swim well if they need to and they can be very aggressive if they feel threatened.\nThey can get up to 1.5 meters long and weigh up to 50 kilograms and they have extremely strong jaw muscles and long, sharp teeth. This allows them to bite through most things.\nEven the ones in the zoo can be aggressive if they feel threatened and they can bite and cause a deadly situation.\nWhy are pandas so playful?\nPandas spend the majority of their day eating. Since the bamboo is close to them, they don\u2019t have to go on long hunts or spend long periods of the day hunting or looking for food.\nThey are considered one of the most vocal bears that live and they make voice sounds such as barking and squealing when they are being fun and playful.\nMost love to be curious and to explore their area, as long as it is close to their bamboo forest, where they live. They also like to be playful and restful because they don\u2019t spend a lot of time going far or moving much.\nPandas that are in the zoo are sometimes given toys to play with. They seem to love puzzles and other mind engaging activities. Some love to do tricks such as somersaults.\nAre pandas smart?\nThey are considered to be very smart. Some have been known to break out of places when they are held in zoos or other places. They love to explore their area and know how to work together with other pandas if there is a problem.\nSome scientists talk about how they use their senses to know when they are being tricked or trapped. They figure out how to solve problems such as climbing over things or reaching lower in order to get to their food.\nSome appear in the circus and ride bikes or play ball games. One panda could even take herself to the bathroom and use the toilet when needed. This proves that they are very smart and can be trained.\nWhy are pandas so clumsy?\nPandas are so clumsy because they eat so much bamboo. Since their diet is basically bamboo, they have very low nutrition and vitamins. This diet causes them to have a slow metabolic rate.\nSince bamboo doesn\u2019t give them much energy, many of the pandas have low thyroid levels. These different levels cause them to be slower and to seem to be clumsy. Sometimes they sleep for hours between feeding and sometimes will take extra naps.\nThe way that they move their bodies can often times make them look like they are rolling around or being clumsy and they are very docile in their sleeping positions.\nHow long do pandas live in captivity?\nThere are around 250-300 pandas that live in zoos around the world.\nThere have only been two successful reintroductions into the wild after being held in the zoo for some many years.\nThe problem with reintroducing them into the wild is that they have a hard time of being accepted by other pandas because they like to live alone and do not want to give up their area.\nMany that are introduced into the wild are beaten up and attacked by other pandas and releasing them strictly into the wild means that they might have a hard time finding food and being able to sustain themselves.\nSome zoologists and conservation areas will make giant panda conservation habitats for them and sometimes they are released to these so that they can have enough food to sustain them.\nWhat do pandas do for fun?\nThey are considered to be very playful animals. They are also very curious and they like to look around the areas that they live in.\nPandas that live in the zoo are often given toys such as puzzles that they can figure out and play with. This helps to keep them entertained and to give them something to do so that they don\u2019t get bored. They also like to be active and like to show off so sometimes if you watch them at the zoo, you will see them doing somersaults or other fun tricks.\nWhat are pandas\u2019 predators?\nThey don\u2019t not have a lot of predators that they have to face in the wild. Most of the predators include snow leopards, yellow-throated martens and jackals. The reason that the snow leopard is one of the biggest predators is because the panda and the snow leopard often share many of the same habitats so these predators can be dangerous for the panda bear cubs.\nSince they are considered fairly peaceful, they try to not have confrontation with other animals but when they do have to fight back, they use their teeth and jaws to bite their predators. They can also climb and swim very quickly and since they are not hibernating animals, they are always there and ready to protect their area if they have to.\nWhat is pandas habitat?\nMost that live in the wild are found in China in the regions of Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu. They usually are found in elevated areas between 5,000 to 10,000 feet in elevation. They live in the bamboo forest that is cool and wet. This allows them to be close to their food source since 99% of their diet is bamboo.\nThere are only around 20 different bamboo forests in China and most of the wild pandas live in Qinling and Minshan mountains. There are also many conservation areas that are supported by the Chinese to help keep them from going completely extinct.\nLiving in the mountains and in the bamboo forest provides them with good weather that is warm and cool and is rich in plenty of bamboo and water sources. This allows them to thrive in the wild and provides protection from the predators.\nThere are close to 300 different pandas found in zoos across the world.\nWhy are pandas hard to breed?\nThey are hard to breed because it is hard for the them to find a mate. Since the average panda gives birth only once every two years, it makes them endangered species and that means that they have a hard time finding a mate to breed with.\nIn order for a male panda to breed with a female panda, he must find a mate and compete against others that are also looking for mates.\nWhen the dominate male finds a female, he will mate with her many different times to ensure that she gets pregnant and this normally works.\nIn a zoo, breeding can be even harder for the panda.\nSometimes, when a panda is held in captivity, they either lose interest in mating or they are not sure how to mate.\nSome scientists feel that this happens because a baby panda can be taken from their mothers too quickly and therefore they have never seen others mate.\nSome speculate that the ones in the zoo might not have interest in mating with a female panda because there is no challenge or competition form another\u2019s to mate with.\nAnother problem is that a female only goes into heat one time a year and it lasts only up to 25 days, but sometimes much shorter. She only will mate with a male for 2-7 days while she is in heat and she is only fertile up to 36 hours once she is in heat.\nWhen a male does not mate with the female in these allotted times, the female becomes uninterested and she will not mate and the male will have to wait for a whole year until she is in heat again.\nA Panda cub is super fun to see and hopefully we\u2019ll see more in the future\nWhy are Pandas black and white?\nThe giant panda has black and white fur and this fur is important for them because they need to be protected when they are in the wild. The black and white fur is used as a camouflage and these colorings make them seem to disappear when they are in a thick patch of bamboo. This gives them protection from their predators.\nThe white part of the panda helps them to hide when the weather is snowy. The dark part (arms and legs) help them to hide in shadows so that they are not seen by their prey.\nThe dark circles under their eyes and their black ears are thought to help them to recognize other pandas and can be used as a sign of aggression when they are facing their predators.\nSome scientists believe they have such low coloration due to their diet of bamboo and the fact that bamboo does not provide them with very much nutrition."}

The giant panda belongs to the bear species and is native to south-central China. It can be recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the years, and across its round body. The giant panda is a rare member of the bear family. It is among the world\u2019s most threatened animals. Giant pandas are cute and harmless and have an amusing habit of sneezing.\nFacts about Giant Pandas\n1. They have a great appetite\nThe giant panda has an insatiable appetite for bamboo. A typical Giant Panda eats half the day, which is a full 12 out of every 24 hours. It relieves itself dozens of times a day. A giant panda\u2019s daily dietary needs are very high. It has elongated wrist bones that function like thumbs and it hungrily plucks the bamboo stalks with them. Pandas can eat birds or rodents as well. They can devour 14-28 kg of bamboo per day.\nAlso Read: Top 10 Facts about Snakes\n2. Giant Pandas are lazy creatures\nThe giant pandas spend as long as 14 hours of eating per day. A giant panda needs food in a quantity that is approximately 40% of its weight per day. They eat for about half a day and spend the rest of their time in sleeping. In the wild forests, the giant pandas need to sleep for 2 to 4 hours between its two meals. Its favourite sleeping poses include lying flat on their backs. They follow a low-energy diet and avoid stressful situations and exertion, preferring solitary living.\nAlso Read: Top 10 Facts about Giraffes\n3. Giant Pandas are efficient Climbers\nWild pandas are only found in the remote, mountainous regions in Central China. They love to dwell in the cool and high bamboo forests. They may climb very high, as much as 13,000 feet, to feed on higher slopes in the summer season. Pandas love to eat in a relaxed sitting posture, with their hind legs stretched out before them. They may appear lazy but they are skilled tree-climbers and efficient swimmers. They can climb trees from 7 months old.\nAlso Read: Top 10 Calmest Animals In The World\n4. Giant Pandas are solitary creatures\nThey are solitary creatures and love to stay alone. Panda families don\u2019t live together. They are solitary, and each female panda stays in a well-defined range. Males generally do not live together, except for in the short breeding season. This season lasts from March to May, when they compete for female attention. Females raise the cubs alone.\nAlso Read: Top 10 Most Affectionate Wild Animals Towards Humans\n5. They do not hibernate, like other bears\nUnlike most other bears, pandas do not hibernate during winter. In winter, they move down to lower mountains for warmer weather. One reason is that they mostly eat bamboo which doesn\u2019t have much nutritional value and does not make them fat enough.\nAlso Read: Top 10 Bear Species and Subspecies\n6. Pandas have 6 toes to hold bamboo\nThese animals have an unusual foot structure. A panda\u2019s paw has six toes\u2014five fingers and an opposable pseudo-thumb. This is an enlarged wrist bone it uses, which is used to hold bamboo while eating. The hind feet of the giant panda does not have a heel pad found in the other seven bear species. Their paws also have a heel or a carpal bone. This is what makes a panda unique from other bears.\nAlso Read: Top 10 Cutest Zoo Animals\n7. Giant Pandas were on WWF\u2019s endangered species list\nGiant pandas became endangered in 1990 due to excessive poaching in the 80s. Excessive deforestation depleted their bamboo food source. Sadly, these beautiful bears have now become endangered. It is estimated that only around 1,800 remain in the wild. We should put in our efforts to keep them safe and secure. WWF is committed to conserving the species and its habitat and has increased the number of panda reserves. In 2016, because of their consistent efforts, the giant panda was removed from the endangered list. It is now on the \u201cvulnerable\u201d list of animals. This is one of the saddest facts about giant pandas.\n8. They are emblems of the global diversity\nThe giant panda was selected and used as the symbol of the WWF since its formation in 1961. The WWF logo has been inspired by Chi-Chi, a giant panda brought to the London Zoo in 1961. WWF in collaboration with the Chinese Government has focused on improving panda habitat by striking a conservation balance conservation with local sustainable development.\n9. Baby Pandas are very small in size\nAll pandas are born very small. The average weight is 100g, which is only 1/900 of their mother\u2019s weight. Newborn giant pandas are pink and furless. The typical black and white coloring comes later, after about 3 weeks. Cubs are very weak and vulnerable at birth. They are born furless and blind. The limbs of newborn pandas are very weak and they are not able to stand at all.\nAlso Read: 9 Interesting Facts about Fish\n10. Giant Pandas communicate through smells and sounds\nGiant Pandas leave scent markings on the habitat, as a means of communication. By using these scents, they can find their previous partners during the mating season. After finding their partners, they communicate with a different sound, which is barely understood by humans. The giant pandas also leave their glandular secretions on trees or the ground in their habitats. They use it to mark their territory and gather together or stay away from stronger competitors. Otherwise, pandas remain silent when playing. We can predict their behaviours simply by their sounds.\nThese are the top facts about Giant Pandas. Overall, they are shy and quiet creatures and are adorable, solitary animals."}

As March 16 is National Panda Day, it\u2019s the ideal opportunity to celebrate and increase more awareness about the adorable yet vulnerable species. Here are some of the most interesting facts about pandas.\n\u2014\nInteresting Facts about Pandas\n1. 99% of Giant Pandas\u2019 Diet Consists of Bamboo\nPandas eat almost exclusively bamboo shoots and leaves. Despite their vegetarian diet, the animal\u2019s digestive system resembles more like a carnivore\u2019s. On the rare occasion that they forgo bamboo, pandas will likely turn to other vegetation such as pumpkin, kidney beans, wheat, as well as other foods like eggs, fish, and even small mammals.\n2. Pandas Spend About 12 Hours A Day Eating\nEven though the giant panda depends entirely on bamboo for its survival, the plant itself is a severely poor food source. Bamboos are low in protein and high in lignin and cellulose, combined with the fact that giant pandas are only able to digest about an average of 17% of dry matter, this means that pandas need to consume up to 15% of their body weight in 12 hours to survive and stay healthy.\n3. Pandas Defecate More than 100 Times A Day\nSince the giant panda eats about 15% of their body weight, this translates into about an average of 12.5kg of bamboo every single day. Based on significant amounts of fibre in their diets, giant pandas as a result, defecate regularly throughout the day. The species is also required to ingest at least two different species of bamboo within its habitat range or faces starvation. A scarcity in bamboo therefore threatens the vulnerable panda population.\n4. Adult Pandas Weigh Up to 125 Kilograms\nA male giant panda in the wild weighs about 85-125kg while females range between 70-100kg. Despite its large size and weight when it reaches maturity, a panda cub when born, weighs a mere 85-140g.\n5. Pandas Have \u201cPseudo-thumbs\u201d\nA giant panda\u2019s front paw has six digits; which is made up of an extended and enlarged wrist bone that they use like an opposable thumb to help them grip food and hold bamboo stems as it eats. Its dexterity makes them good climbers and swimmers; some pandas have been recorded to climb as high as 13,000 feet.\nIf you enjoyed these interesting facts about pandas, you might also like: What are the Biggest Causes of Biodiversity Loss?\n6. Pandas Communicate via Scent Marking\nGiant Pandas make use of a system of traditional communal scent mark stations. They scent to learn and discover reliable locations they can visit to deposit signals and investigate signals left by other individuals. Pandas urinate to mark their scent, often climbing a tree backwards with their hind feet \u2013 effectively doing a handstand \u2013 enabling them to leave marks at higher locations.\n7. Giant Pandas Don\u2019t Hibernate\nMost bear species including the black and brown bear go through hibernation with varying lengths of time, but giant pandas are one of the few that don\u2019t. Pandas are mostly solitary creatures, with individuals only coming together during the breeding season between March and May, where females may hide away in rock caves or tree cavities to rear offspring that are produced every two to three years. Pandas also differ from most other bear species in that they have vertical slits for pupils, meaning their eyes are much more similar to domestic cats.\n8. Giant Pandas are National Treasures in China\nAs the giant panda is endemic to China, found only in a few mountain ranges in central China and mainly in Sichuan, the species is regarded as a national treasure and is often served as a national symbol at international events. The animal is often gifted to countries on a 10-year loan basis as part of diplomatic exchanges.\n9. Habitat Loss Remains to be the Biggest Threat to Giant Pandas\nMuch like most threatened species around the world, the loss and fragmentation of habitats have severely impacted the population and overall survival of the giant panda. The habitat changes stem from human activities such as the building of roads, hydroelectric dams, mining, and other infrastructure projects, resulting in many panda populations to shrink and become isolated. Once widely spread, giant pandas are now limited to six small areas in Sichuan, Gansu, and Shaanxi provinces, totaling only 14,000 sq km.\n10. Giant Pandas are No Longer Critically Endangered in the Wild\nOnce at the brink of extinction, giant pandas have become one of the most successful conservation examples in the world thanks to China\u2019s stringent ecological restoration efforts and extensive resources in repopulating bamboo forests. Giant panda population in the wild has increased up to 1,800, and with the species successfully downgraded from its status as a \u2018critically endangered\u2019 to \u2018vulnerable\u2019 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, the effects of climate change could threaten to reverse conservation efforts and severely impact giant panda habitats. Several models estimate extreme climate conditions could result in the loss of bamboo habitat ranging from 37% to 100% by the end of the century."}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant Panda: Why Is It Endangered? - Our Endangered World", "url": "https://www.ourendangeredworld.com/species/giant-panda/", "text": "The Giant Panda (ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a mammal that can be found in North-Eastern China and Southern Siberia. For many years, the low reproductive rate of the pandas has made them a \u201cvulnerable\u201d species on the IUCN Red Listing.\nStatus: Endangered\nEndangered Known as: Giant Panda, Panda, Panda Bear\nGiant Panda, Panda, Panda Bear Estimated numbers left in the wild: 1,000 (possibly as many as 3,000).\nThe Panda is famous around the world! It has become something of a cultural icon.\nWith its adorable black-and-white face and bamboo diet that makes it seem like it\u2019s just begging to be saved by humans who want nothing more than to give it all the love and attention that this wonderful creature deserves. The Panda is also known as Ailuropoda melanoleuca.\nThese fascinating species are threatened by a number of things, chief among them being their low reproductive rate. Pandas have difficulty breeding and often give birth to only one or two cubs at a time.\nDescription\nWeighing in at 136 kilograms and measuring 1.2 to 1.5 meters long, the panda is a black and white bear of China whose unique image is perhaps the most recognizable in today\u2019s animal kingdom.\nThese solitary, territorial bears live in cool, wet bamboo filled forests at several thousand meters and are currently confined to central China.\nThe giant panda and the bamboo plant are inseparable \u2013 in fact, one of the panda\u2019s wrist bones has elongated to provide a sixth toe on each fore paw, which serves as a thumb while grasping stalks of bamboo.\nDue to the low nutritive value of bamboo, a panda spends around twelve hours daily eating, consuming up to 14 kilograms of the vegetation to sate its appetite. Pandas remain omnivorous and eat a few rodents and birds, but these are only occasional supplements to their daily bamboo salad.\nThough pandas can climb and swim, they tend to avoid steep slopes because of the high energy demands these impose. Each panda needs at least two bamboo species in its home range so that it does not starve when one species reaches the end of its yearly cycle and dies back.\nThe panda\u2019s rounded, friendly-looking face is due to huge jaw muscles and enlarged molars needed to grind bamboo into a digestible pulp. A wild panda usually lives for around two decades, though those in captivity can live for up to 30 years.\nThough they are actual bears and display some bear-like behaviors, such as clawing the bark of trees to mark territorial boundaries, these fascinating species do not hibernate or even establish a permanent den.\nIn cooler months, they move lower down the slopes to areas with warmer temperatures. Hollow trees and rock crevices are both favored as temporary resting spots.\nThey are nocturnal, solitary creatures except during the breeding season, when they may couple for up to 24 hours a day. they typically live up to 25 years in the wild, but if born in captivity they typically live between 30-40 years of age.\nWestern discovery\nThese fascinating species have been around for millennia, but it wasn\u2019t until 1869 that French missionary Armand David first discovered and documented the species as a western discovery. His work in the field is known for spotting animals such as pandas and monkeys in his native Germany, which was his first real-life encounter.\nThe first West Indian to kill the Pandas came during World War One when they were killed at Fort Washington. Ruth Harbness restored the original pandas to Chicago in 1936. John Tangi\u00e8re Smith captured five huge pandas which were transported and put into London.\nGrandma has gotten some sleep recently. A second man named Yang became the lion panda at the London Zoo. Her head is a member of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons, and her neck is being publicly displayed here.\nAnatomy and Appearance\nThe Giant Panda is a black and white bear that has a distinctive black eye patch around its eyes.\nThese fascinating species have very thick fur coats that keep them warm in their cold habitats. They are the size of a large dog and they weigh around 100-115 pounds.\nPandas have very strong jaws that help them eat bamboo stems and shoots. They have small rounded ears and a tail that is about half the length of their body.\nGiant Pandas live in bamboo forests and eat mostly bamboo shoots. They are solitary animals and only come together to mate. These species have a low reproductive rate and typically give birth to one or two young cubs every two years.\nThey are a species of bear that is found in China and Southern Siberia. These species are notable for their black and white coloring.\nThey are monotypic species, which means that it only has one known subspecies. The Giant Panda is also the only living species in the genus Ailuropoda. Female Pandas are typically smaller than male Pandas. Panda cubs are born without fur and are completely white.\nLocation\nThe Giant Panda is found only in China in the wild. This scarce bear lives only in mountainous bamboo forests, where its favorite food is abundant.\nThe panda has a wide range, but the scattered distribution of bamboo-filled forests means that few pandas live in any one place.\nGiant Panda Habitat\nThey are found in bamboo forests at high altitudes.\nThey inhabit elevations of 5,000 to 10,000 feet and live in a few mountain ranges in central China. The Chengdu Plain and the Qinling Mountains are two of their major habitats.\nThese species are threatened by several factors including habitat loss, poaching, and a low reproductive rate.\nGiant Panda Diet and Nutrition\nThe Giant Panda is a carnivore but its diet is almost exclusively bamboo.\nGiant Panda Mating Habits\nThese threatened species are known for their low reproductive rate, and while there isn\u2019t a lot of information out there about their mating habits, we can make some guesses.\nGiant Pandas are solitary animals, so it\u2019s likely that they only come together to mate. They\u2019re also very picky eaters, so the male and female Giant Panda may have to spend a lot of time looking for the right food before they can mate.\nThey have a very low reproductive rate because the female Giant Panda only ovulates once a year and the fertilized egg divides slowly. The cubs are also very small and vulnerable at birth.\nGiant Panda Cub\nGiant Panda cubs are born blind and without fur. They nurse for up to a year and a half and stay with their mother pandas for two to three years.\nPanda cubs are a major tourist attraction in China.\nIn order to help conserve the Giant Panda population, the Chinese government has begun to limit the amount of Panda cubs that can be bred in captivity. This is because Panda cubs are not able to survive on their own in the wild and must be cared for by humans.\nThey are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. TThese fascinating species\u2019 natural habitat has been reduced by more than 50% in the last 50 years. This is due to deforestation, development, and climate change.\nGiant Panda vs Other Bears\nThe Giant Panda is a member of the bear family, which also includes the American Black Bear, Brown Bear, Polar Bear, and Sloth Bear.\nThey are less well-known than other bears. Unlike other bears, these species live in mountainous areas. Pandas spend up to 14 hours a day eating bamboo.\nGiant Pandas have been living for approximately three million years. Pandas are endangered because people have killed them and they live in small areas.\nPandas are different from other bears because these pandas are the only bears that like to eat plants. They also have a very low reproductive rate and this is one of the reasons why pandas are endangered.\nThey do not normally mate until they are five years old and Pandas only have one baby on an average of every two years.\nPandas cannot reproduce unless the Giant Panda female is in heat. They also keep their babies for around 2-3 years which is long when compared to other bears because these species are so slow reproducing.\nGiant Panda vs Red Panda vs Qinling Panda\nGiant Panda and red panda are often confused with one another, but they are two very different animals.\nGiant pandas are bears while red pandas are raccoons. These species are much larger than red pandas. Giant pandas live in bamboo-filled forests while red pandas live in trees. Giant pandas eat mostly bamboo while red pandas eat a variety of things, including bamboo.\nQinling is a large Giant Panda in central China. Giant Pandas, in contrast to Qinlings, live in the south part of North-Eastern China and Southern Siberia.\nGiant Pandas also differ in appearance and diet from Qinlings: Giant Pandas like cool and humid places with long periods of snow cover whereas Qinlings like dry areas with short snow cover. Pandas eat bamboo shoots; they eat tens of pounds of bamboo shoots per day.\nThese pandas can not digest cellulose like other animals, Giant Pandas make their own food by digesting the carbohydrate-rich material in their bamboo diet.\nGiant Panda and Human Relationship\nThe Giant Panda is one of the most popular animals in the world.\nThey\u2019re loved for their gentle nature and big, round eyes.\nPandas have been known to humans for centuries, but it wasn\u2019t until 1869 that the Western world first got a glimpse of these black and white creatures. Charles Darwin was one of the first people to write about Pandas, describing them as \u201ca kind of bear\u201d.\nDespite their popularity, Pandas are one of the most endangered animals in the world due to human intervention. There are only about 1,864 of these fascinating species left in the wild.\nChina is trying to increase the Panda population by building more reserves and sanctuaries for them, but it\u2019s an uphill battle.\nPopulation\nThe Giant Panda has been around for centuries, and its population has fluctuated through the years.\nThey were once widespread throughout China, but their population decreased significantly due to hunting and deforestation.\nThese species have made a comeback in recent years, and their population is slowly increasing, but they are still considered to be vulnerable species.\nThere are an estimated 1,864 Pandas remaining in the wild as of 2016. Habitat fragmentation, deforestation, and poaching are the main threats to their survival. Pandas are also threatened by climate change.\nRole in Ecosystem\nGiant pandas play a key role in the natural ecosystem, they feed on bamboo shoots that grow only in the mountain regions where Pandas live.\nThey have been suffering from deforestation and habitat loss which is likely to put them at risk of extinction within a few decades without any help from humans.\nPredator\nGiant panda\u2019s natural predators are leopards, birds of prey, and humans.\nThe Panda is threatened by many different predators, the most common of which are humans. Hunters kill these giants for their fur and other body parts, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine. Other predators of these Panda include golden jackals and wild dogs.\nFacts\nHere are the interesting facts about Giant Pandas\nThey are visible only for about 12-14 hours each day.\nThese species spend most of their time eating bamboo shoots, but also eat other things like small animals, wild fruit, roots, and grasses.\nThey have a slow metabolism which is why they hibernate for up to 10 months at a time.\nThey can stand on their hind legs for less than one minute before growing too tired to continue.\nThey are used in gardening because they are strong enough to do some low-level work with very little effort.\nThey are unique species of bear that are found in certain parts of China and Siberia.\nThis species has been around for centuries, but it wasn\u2019t until 1869 that the Giant Panda was first discovered and documented by French missionary Armand David as a western discovery.\nThey are one of the most endangered species in the world because the Wild Giant Panda Population population is so low, but Pandas continue to flourish despite all odds.\nThey have two long, sharp claws that they use for defense and to strip bamboo.\nThey also have a unique thumb on each paw that has an extra bone in it which gives Pandas the ability to grip things better than most animals.\nSee Related: Types of Bears From Around The World\nConservation Status\nGiant Pandas are an endangered species.\nPandas are at the top of the food chain and there is not much else that can keep Giant Pandas in check, which is why pandas conservation is difficult. These species conservation requires that habitat be maintained and protected so Pandas can survive.\nGiant Panda conservation also includes providing these giants with enough bamboo so they do not need to go out looking for food. Pandas population continues to decline due to poaching, loss of natural habitat, and low reproductive rates.\nThreats\nThe Giant panda is very vulnerable to modern-day threats because of its limited range, exacting dietary needs, and prolonged breeding rate. They are also threatened by poaching. Poachers kill Pandas for their fur and meat.\nHabitat Loss\nOne of the main threats these fascinating species are facing is habitat loss. Habitat loss can come in many forms, including deforestation and reforestation.\nThey also lose their habitat when they\u2019re moved for breeding programs. They are especially threatened by habitat loss because they mainly eat bamboo which is concentrated in one area of their habitat.\nHabitat destruction and pollution have caused major damage to the panda population, but poaching was the most serious threat to the species. Early, ham-handed efforts at conservation also contributed to the species\u2019 decline.\nThese wonderful species are found in bamboo forests high in the mountains of China mostly in Sichuan Province.\nThese forests are being cleared to make way for farmland and development. Giant Pandas need a lot of space to live and roam, and with their habitat shrinking, they are forced into smaller and smaller areas.\nPoaching\nPoaching has been a major threat to Giant Pandas for many years.\nPoachers kill Pandas for their fur and other body parts, which are then sold on the black market. Panda cubs are also sometimes kidnapped from the wild and sold as pets.\nPanda pelts are naturally valuable on the black market, giving an incentive for poaching these unique animals.\nDemand for these panda skin was particularly strong in Japan and Hong Kong.\nPandas are hunted more often because they are on the Chinese and Asia\u2019s \u201cbig-five\u201d list which means hunters can make a lot of money from selling Giant Panda parts on the black market.\nLow Productive Rate\nThe Giant Panda is one of the world\u2019s most endangered creatures.\nOne of the major reasons for this is their poor reproductive rate. These species have difficulty reproducing, and when they do, the cubs are often not able to survive.\nThis is due to a number of factors, including the fact that Giant Pandas are very selective about their mates and often don\u2019t mate at all.\nSee Related: Conservation vs. Preservation\nConservation efforts\nThe Giant Panda is one of the most endangered animals in the world, but there are many organizations and people who are dedicated to helping preserve these creatures.\nConservation efforts for Pandas include building more reserves and sanctuaries for them, increasing awareness about the plight of the Panda, and working to keep their native habitat intact.\nPanda conservation is an ongoing effort that requires the cooperation of many different people and organizations. Habitat loss is the biggest threat to the Giant pandas, so preserving their natural habitat is essential to their survival.\nDeforestation and pollution are also major threats to these Pandas, so increasing awareness about these issues is also important.\nHeavy conservation efforts, including wholesale removal of humans from the panda\u2019s remaining panda habitat, appear to be paying off with a slowly increasing population.\nThere may be as many as 3,000 of these species are in the wild today, and vigorous international conservation programs continue. Gun control in the regions where wild pandas are found has also proven effective at reducing the numbers that fall to poaching and other forms of illegal hunting.\nCaptive Breeding\nGiant Panda captive breeding has been a focus of zoos and researchers for many years now.\nThe Panda is one of the most beloved animals in the world, and efforts have been made to keep them from going extinct.\nWhile Pandas are found in the wild, their population has dwindled to such a point where they are considered \u201cendangered\u201c. Captive breeding offers some hope for the future of the Giant Panda.\nThe Giant Panda Breeding and Research Center is an institution and among the breeding centers located in Chengdu, China, to protect Pandas and help them increase their numbers.\nThese species are one of the rarest animals on earth because they can only mate once a year and have a baby every two years.\nThe breeding center looks for Pandas that live in the wild that need help, like pandas that may not be able to find enough food. Pandas at this center are cared for by humans who provide them with things like bedding and food to make sure they stay alive.\nSee Related: Best Conservation Poster\nOrganizations\nThere are a number of organizations that help Pandas by protecting their natural habitats, promoting Giant pandas conservation, and working with pandas in captivity.\nThey are endangered because of many factors, including habitat destruction and fragmentation, poaching, and lack of genetic diversity. These factors threaten Giant Pandas\u2019 future as they make it difficult for the Giant Panda to survive.\nBear Trust International\nBear Trust International is an American organization that protects different bear species around the world and their habitats through education, research, management, and habitat conservation.\nIt is established to help and rescue these species and reduce the number of endangered species. It is one of the most successful charities in the world which has rescued over 60 Pandas.\nHauser Bears\nHauser Bears is a UK-based charity with a mission to change people\u2019s attitudes towards bears. Their main work revolves around research and education to ensure a future for all bear species.\nPDXWildlife\nPDXWidlife collaborates with local organizations on three different continents to conserve endangered species like the Giant Panda and its habitat through research and outreach programs.\nPDX Wildlife is a non-profit organization that helps to rescue and rehabilitate injured and orphaned animals.\nOne of the main goals of PDX Wildlife is to educate the public about how to properly interact with wild animals. The organization provides information about what to do if you encounter an animal in need, as well as how to properly construct a wildlife-friendly habitat in your backyard.\nWorld Wildlife Fund\nThe World Wildlife Fund (WWF )is one of the largest and most well-known conservation organizations in the world.\nThey work with governments and other NGO\u2019s to help protect, deter, and recover threatened wildlife populations around the world. To do this they focus on four areas:\nFocusing on government policy and governance; Supporting investment for conservation; Ensuring sustainable livelihoods for people living in or near protected areas; Working with communities to manage protected areas and wildlife.\nOne of the main creatures that WWF helps protect is the Giant Panda.\nWWF works throughout the world with governments and local communities to protect the Panda\u2019s natural habitats. They also offer advice on how to adapt farming practices to protect wild Pandas and collaborate closely with local communities to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development.\nFinal Thoughts\nGiant Pandas are one of the most endangered animals in the world, but why?\nGiant Pandas are found in North-Eastern China and Southern Siberia. Giant Pandas have been classified as a \u201cvulnerable\u201d species from an IUCN Red Listing for many years now due to their low reproductive rate.\nHabitat destruction and pollution have caused major damage to the wild panda population, but poaching was the most serious threat to this species. Early, ham-handed efforts at conservation also contributed to its decline.\nThese fascinating species are very vulnerable to modern-day threats because of their limited range, exacting dietary needs, and prolonged breeding rate. Heavy conservation efforts including wholesale removal of humans from Giant Panda habitat seem like it\u2019s paying off with a slowly increasing population.\nFAQ\nWhat is Giant Panda? Giant Pandas are a Giant Chinese Giant Panda Giant Pandas have been classified as a \u201cvulnerable\u201d species from an IUCN Red Listing for many years now due to their low reproductive rate. Where do Giant Pandas live? Giant Pandas live in Northeastern China and Southern Siberia. Giant Pandas are found mostly in North-Eastern China, but an increasing number wander into other parts of the country, where they share a habitat with humans. Why are Giant Pandas endangered? Giant Pandas are endangered because today\u2019s human society has a negative effect on Giant Pandas. They also have a low reproductive rate, which means it would take a lot of Panda babies to help grow their population back up. Giant pandas live in off-limits areas for places like mining and timber harvesting as well as poaching. In the 1990s the Chinese government started making Panda preserves to provide better care for Giant Pandas and make them safer from humans. The number of Giant Panda poachers is now declining after years of China cracking down hard on those who hunt them illegally. Has a giant panda ever killed a human? No, Giant Pandas are actually very sweet. They use their sharp teeth to eat bamboo, which is what Giant Pandas are made for! Giant pandas do not bother humans because they are wild animals with no natural enemies in the wild. Who can I donate to if I want to help Giant Pandas? There are a number of charities that help Giant Pandas including WWF and World Wildlife Fund M\u00e9xico, Indonesia, and China. If you\u2019re interested in helping other threatened animals as well as ecosystems threatened by change or wildlife trade please consider donating to Hauser Bears, World Wildlife Fund, PDXWildlife, or a number of other charities whose work revolves around Giant Pandas and other endangered species.\nOther Species Profile\nRelated Resources"}

Before, red pandas are classified as a relative of raccoons and even to the giant panda. However, according to National Geographic, red pandas are placed to their own unique family\u2014the Ailuridae.\nRed pandas are the last Ailuridae. Ailuridae is a family in the mammal order Carnivora, an order of placental mammals that eats flesh.

When red pandas go down from a tree, it goes head-first and rotates its ankle to perform its descent, making them one of the few climbing species on earth to do so.\nRed pandas like to stay in mountainous mixed deciduous and conifer forests. Red pandas prefer to live in mountainous places where trees and shrubs that seasonally shed leaves. They also like conifer forests that have long winters and moderate to high annual precipitation, most especially if it\u2019s filled with bamboos.\nThe snow leopard is its main predator.

Although jumping is not the main strength of the red pandas, they have an excellent climbing ability. They\u2019re good at looking for trees as a shelter to escape predators. They also love sunbathing on a very cold day. On top of that, red pandas are also good swimmers.\nRed pandas reproduce around the age of 18 months. They are sexually mature and can start reproducing at the age of 18 months. They become fully mature at around two to three years. During the breeding season, male and female red pandas usually mate with more than one partner. Their mating season occurs in mid-January to early March.\nFemale red panda prepares the nest before giving birth. The mother gets ready and builds a nest for her baby a few days before birth. It collects grass, leaves, moss, and tree branches and arranged it in a tree stump or a hollow tree. The female panda gives birth around 112 days up to 158 days after the gestation period.\nRed pandas can bore up to 4 cubs. Female red pandas typically give birth in mid-June to late July and bore one to four cubs. Each cub can weigh about 110 to 130 g.\nRead also: 40 Sea Urchin Facts About These Spiky Creatures\nFemale red panda becomes a busy mom after giving birth. The mother cleans her newly born cubs right after giving birth. By doing so, she can identify each cub by its smell. During the first week, the mother will spend around 60% to 90% of her time in the nest with the cubs. She will start to leave the nest and return every few hours to feed and clean the cubs. The mother may often transfer the cubs to several nests and ensures to keep her cubs all clean.\nThe red panda has other names. Aside from its other name, \u201clesser panda,\u201d it\u2019s also called the \u201cred cat-bear,\u201d or \u201cred bear-cat,\u201d and the \u201cfirefox.\u201d\nThe Firefox browser's logo is a red panda. The logo of Firefox, Mozilla\u2019s flagship browser, is a red panda. Initially, the company wanted the name \u201cFirebird\u201d to their browser but later found out that it was already taken by another company. So they chose Firefox instead!"}

The question of a real pregnancy always remains unanswered until either the keepers detect something in an ultrasound, or she gives birth.\nFor reader edification on this iconic animal, we present our list of 14 Fun Facts About the Zoo\u2019s Giant Pandas.\n1. What other behaviors do female pandas show when they are experiencing hormonal changes?\nIn her den, Mei Xiang also began building a small nest of shredded bamboo. Keepers expect her to start showing less interest in food in the coming weeks. She might also cradle her toys and exhibit body-licking.\n2. How many giant pandas are there in the world today?\nThere are only 1,864 giant pandas living in their native habitat in central China's provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu. Another 500 pandas live in zoos and breeding centers around the globe. For more about at-risk panda populations, check out our story \u201cPanda Habitat is Severely Fragmented, Placing Pandas at Risk.\u201d The Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo is one of the top leaders in conservation. Working closely with experts in China, researchers at the Zoo are leading efforts to better understand giant panda ecology, biology, breeding, reproduction, disease and proper animal care.\n3. What do the names of the three pandas at the National Zoo mean?\nMei Xiang, who was born on July 22, 1998 at the China Research and Conservation Center, is an adult female with a pale black band across the bridge of her nose and oval eye patches. Her name means \u201cbeautiful fragrance.\u201d The male Tian Tian, who was also born at the China Conservation Center on August 27, 1997, has eye patches shaped like kidney beans and two black dots across his nose. His name means \u201cmore and more.\u201d Bei Bei is the male cub of Mei Xiang and was born at the Zoo on August 22, 2015. His name means \u201cprecious treasure.\u201d\n4. How many times has Mei Xiang given birth?\nSix times. On July 9, 2005, she delivered Tai Shan, who stayed four years at the Zoo and then, by agreement, left for China on February 4, 2010. Another cub was born September 16, 2012, but died a week later from liver damage. Bao Bao was born August 23, 2013 and left for China on February 21, 2017. A stillborn cub was delivered a day after Bao Bao\u2019s birth. Two years later Mei Xiang again delivered two cubs on August 22, one was Bei Bei, the other cub died.\n5. Why must the panda cubs leave Washington, D.C. for China?\nGiant pandas are on loan to the Zoo and by agreement, when the cub reaches the age of four, the animals are sent to China to become part of the breeding population. To learn more about the breeding center, check out our story \u201cThe Science Behind the Unbearably Cute IMAX Movie Panda.\u201d The four-year-old Bei Bei is soon to leave for China, as well. Bao Bao\u2019s departure in 2017 was delightfully reported in this piece \u201cHow to FedEx a Giant Panda.\u201d The adult pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian will continue to live in Washington, D.C. through 2020.\n6. How long is a panda pregnancy?\nIt takes 90 to 180 days, with the average gestation lasting 135 days. Ovulation for a female panda occurs only once a year in the spring and it lasts just two to three days. Panda breeding is a specialized science, for much on that, see our story \u201cHow Does Science Help Pandas Make More Panda Babies?\u201d\n7. How are the pandas cared for at the Zoo?\nThey are fed bamboo, sweet potatoes, pears, carrots and apples and biscuits, all carefully monitored for proper nutrition requirements. The bamboo is grown by the Zoo\u2019s nutritionists at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia. Keeping the panda\u2019s busy with fun activities is also a key to their proper care. This video shows the way keepers keep the animals entertained. Keepers are especially attuned to the animals\u2019 needs, but are always mindful that the creatures are dangerous and are much stronger than humans. So, they never enter into the animals\u2019 spaces.\n8. Do the pandas like living in Washington, D.C.?\nBecause pandas are adapted to the high-altitude forests in the mountainous central regions of China, snow is their happy place. Take a look at the Zoo\u2019s \u201cPanda\u2019s Play in the Snow\u201d videos to see how much the animals love the city\u2019s winter weather. But for hot, humid summer days, the Zoo keeps air-conditioned spaces with misting sprays where the animals can go to remain comfortable.\n9. What does a giant panda sound like?\nThe Zoo\u2019s popular Giant Panda Cam is one of the best ways to listen in for the chirps, honks, bleats, barks and squeals. According to the Zoo, the vocalizations can indicate distress (chirps and honks), pain (squeals), a friendly gesture (bleats), a defensive threat (chomp\u2014a teeth clattering rapid opening and closing of the mouth), or a bark to scare off an enemy.\n10. Why are the animals black and white?\nThere is really not a certain science for this question. The Zoo tells visitors that when a giant panda is sitting quietly without moving in a patch of dense bamboo, they are nearly invisible. On snow-covered rocky outcrops in their mountainous habitat, they are also quite hard to find. So likely their characteristic black and white patches are a very effective form of camouflage. The black and white patterns might also be a way for giant pandas to see and identify each other. They are solitary creatures. So a panda might use the patterns to identify other pandas in order to keep their distance. The black and white markings could also help with temperature regulation\u2014black absorbs heat and white reflects it.\n11. Do pandas have thumbs?\nThey have a \u201cpseudo thumb\u201d that helps them hold onto bamboo stems. It is formed from an elongated and large wrist bone that is covered by a fleshy pad of skin.\n12. How long do pandas live?\nThe National Zoo\u2019s Hsing-Hsing lived until the age of 28. Pandas in the wild likely have shorter lifespans than zoo animals, but some pandas have reportedly lived to the age of 38.\n13. Whats\u2019 the best time to visit the pandas?\nMornings are best, if only to avoid long lines. The panda house is currently closed for Mei Xiang\u2019s comfort, but the outdoor yards are open all day from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., during the summer. One cautionary item is that the pandas get to make the decision about when they want to see you. All of the animals at the Zoo have spaces where they can go to get away from the crowds. In the summer, the giant pandas prefer the cool air conditioning indoors.\n14. Where else are pandas represented at the Smithsonian?\nThere\u2019s a large taxidermy specimen at the entrance to the mammal hall at the National Museum of Natural History on the National Mall. Near the Luce Foundation Center on the third floor of the Smithsonian American Art Museum at 7th and F Streets, muralist Kelsey Montague created a cheeky panda bearing posies and perfectly poised for Instagram poseurs."}

But behind those cute little black eye patches, there are a lot of interesting facts to know about giant pandas. For instance, they are actually a kind of bear, like grizzly bears and polar bears. And there's a reason they're called giant: these bears are big! A grown-up giant panda can weigh over 200 pounds, more than the average weight for an adult man.\nGrown-up pandas are big, but baby pandas are tiny. When they're born, pandas are around the size of a stick of butter. Newborn pandas don't have any fur and they can't even see. But after a few weeks, they open their eyes, and after a few months, they start walking around and exploring.\nA baby panda\nBaby pandas stay with their mother for a few years, and then they go off on their own. Except for mothers with their newborn babies, pandas usually live alone, not in groups. Pandas can live to be around 30 in a zoo and around 20 in the wild.\nHow Do Giant Pandas Live?\nThe light green area is the country of China. The dark green areas show where pandas live in China.\nWild giant pandas live in China. They live in a special type of forest where a plant called bamboo grows under the trees. Bamboo is the main food that giant pandas eat. In fact, a panda can eat 20 to 40 pounds of bamboo every day. So if you've ever wondered what real-life teddy bears do all day, now you know: they eat.\nPandas are very good at eating bamboo. You'd probably get tired chewing bamboo all day, but pandas have very strong jaws so they don't get tired. They also have special bones in their wrists that they can use like thumbs to help them hold the bamboo. They don't have real thumbs like people do, but the special wrist bones help them hold the bamboo almost like a thumb would."}

Who can resist that cute, cuddly looking animal with its big black eyes? But remember, the Giant Panda is still a bear, which means that they can be dangerous or aggressive when they need to be. Pandas are very fast on foot and kind of lumber, or trot, along. They are really good climbers and can swim to escape danger. Pandas are very shy and because of their markings they are difficult to see in the forest.\nThere is only one sub-species of panda, and it is found only in China. The black and white bear is considered endangered. There are only about 1000 giant pandas left in the wild. Its habitat is continually shrinking because of the growing Chinese population spreading into the forested areas and cutting down trees (especially bamboo trees) for more farmland. With it\u2019s habitat getting smaller and farms cropping up all over it has a very difficult time migrating, or traveling, to another area of bamboo forest. The giant panda is also hunted for it\u2019s beautiful fur.\nPandas main food source is bamboo. This stumps scientists since bamboo is not high in nutrients and is not easily digested by the bear. That means that the panda has to eat an awful lot of it to get the nutrition it needs to live. Pandas will eat 50 \u2013 60 pounds of bamboo a day, so obviously they spend most of their day eating! They will eat meat, berries, flowers, grass and nuts if necessary. The pandas front paws have adapted to its love of bamboo, too. Along with its five 'fingers', the panda has grown a \u2018thumb\u2019. Part of the wrist bone has developed into a thumb that faces opposite to the rest of the fingers. This allows the panda to hold onto bamboo more tightly.\nFemale pandas will give birth to 1 or 2 babies but will only look after one of them. She will be a very attentive mother to that one cub but the other will die. After about a year the young panda will be ready to live on its own.\nKaitlyn and her friend did a school project about pandas. They talked about the pandas appearance, how pandas came to be endangered, the behavior of pandas, where pandas live and what their habitat is like and last but not least interesting facts about pandas.

Of all captive-born males, only two are reported to have ever mated and only 12 percent of captive-born pandas survive to one yearWWF started conservation and development projects mainly focused on the giant panda and its habitat in the Qinling Mountains, the northernmost part of the species' existing range. WWF worked with the Department of Forestry of Shaanxi Province to gradually establish a giant panda and habitat protection network, covering over 70% of giant panda habitat in the Qinling MountainsThe biodiversity monitoring work in the giant panda reserves were initiated by WWF in the Qinling Mountain range, the northernmost panda distribution areaAn agreement is signed between WWF and the Shaanxi Forestry Department to establish 13 new reserves and create the first habitat corridors in the Qinling mountains. The project aims to reconnect the fragmented giant panda populations in this mountain range.WWF began the Forest Landscape-based Conservation Project in the Minshan Mountains, based on the lessons from the Pingwu Integrated Conservation and Development Project (ICDP) and mainly working on giant panda habitat and regional ecosystem protection.With the support of WWF, the Conservation Newsletter of Giant Panda Reserves in Sichuan Province was created and has became an effective platform for information exchange among giant panda reserves in the province.The Chinese government announces a new Wildlife and Protected Areas Programme that will invest \u00a310 million over the next 10 years in 15 flagship species, including the giant panda. Eighteen new panda reserves will be created under this programme.Facilitated by WWF\u2019s Qinling Project, the Shaanxi Provincial Government officially sanctioned five new panda reserves and five ecological corridors for the giant panda, increasing protected area for the giant pandas in Qinling by over 150,000 ha. WWF recognized this exciting initative as a major \"Gift to the Earth.\".Regular biodiversity monitoring work has been carried out in all the 17 giant panda reserves in the Minshan mountain range.The result of the Third National Survey on the Giant Panda and its habitat released by the State Council of China, showing there were 1596 giant pandas in the wild.Mount Minshan was listed as the 103th Gift to Earth. Minshan Mountains cross Sichuan and Gansu Provinces, and both provincial governments promised to collaborate in further in enhancing the management and protection of giant panda habitat.WWF launched the Green Heart of China Project, which expanded the integrated conservation and development project in the Qinling Mountains and Mount Minshan to the entire giant panda range. Then WWF began landscape-based protection work in six mountain areas, which resembled a beating heart on the map of China.With the support of WWF, the national Technical Specification for Giant Panda and its Habitat Monitoring was released by the State Forestry Administration, setting technical standards for future monitoring work and survey.sThe State Forestry Administration conducted the Fourth National Giant Panda Survey. WWF participated in the preparation work for the survey in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu Province, as well as supporting the development of the survey plan and periodical evaluations.The State Forestry Administration released the results of the Fourth National Giant Panda Survey, showing that the population of wild giant pandas had increased by 268 to 1864 over the last decade.The 2015-2025 Giant Panda Protection Strategy was announced. It targets the giant panda as a flagship species and involves comprehensive and landscaped-based protection for giant panda habitats."}

In this article, we'll be taking a closer look at their cultural significance in their native country of China.\nLast update: 10 March, 2020\nPandas are adorable animals that never fail to bring a smile to our faces. More than that, however, they also represent an important symbol in China. They form part of their culture, history and tradition, and hold a special place in people\u2019s hearts. Today, we want to tell you what makes the giant panda so special.\nThe symbolic meaning of the giant panda\nIn the Chinese language, the panda\u2019s name translates to \u201cbear-cat\u201d. With the strength of a bear, the gentleness of a cat, and those characteristic black spots on their faces, these wonderful creatures simply melt our hearts.\nThe panda symbolizes fragility, extinction, family ruptures, breaking with the past, and lateral thinking, among many other things. In fact, everything about this animal takes on a symbolic meaning within Chinese culture and tradition.\nFor example, their black and white fur is said to represent yin and yang, and the importance of balance between energies. Despite their seemingly sweet and gentle nature, they\u2019re also incredibly strong, and have come to be seen as a symbol of strength. The gift of a panda \u2013 whether it be a figurine or a necklace \u2013 is said to bring balance to your life.\nChina is known for using pandas in its diplomatic relations with other countries, and often gives pandas as gifts to places they visit. In doing so, they show that China is a country that is open to other cultures, and interested in maintaining good relationships with other nations.\nPandas and symbolism\nDespite their laid-back exterior, pandas are expert tree-climbers, and highly intelligent animals, often serving as a symbol of great knowledge. A panda amulet is said to have the power to boost your intelligence and nourish your soul.\nNo matter what they do and no matter how old they get, giant pandas retain their sweet and gentle appearance. As a result, they\u2019re a symbol of eternal youth, something which people all over the world have sought for millennia.\nHaving an amulet, figurine, pendant or any other object inspired by the giant panda will act as a source of good fortune both in life and in work (including the mind, the soul and even your health).\nNeedless to say, a lot of people will be skeptical of the symbolic power of pandas. But hey, it doesn\u2019t hurt to give it a shot, right? China is one of the healthiest places in the world, and one of the countries where life expectancy is highest. Who knows, maybe pandas have something to do with it\u2026\nInteresting facts about the giant panda\nBesides their cultural significance, these animals are widely considered one of the most adorable and charming creatures on the planet. In this final section, we want to tell you about some of the characteristics that make pandas so special.\nAlthough they do eat meat, they mostly feed on bamboo . It\u2019s weird to think that these enormous carnivores would prefer to eat a plant than meat. But believe it or not, they can eat up to 26 lbs of bamboo a day, which helps them to stay incredibly strong.\n.

New Born Pandas\n3-month old panda babies 3-month old panda babies\nGiant pandas are born tiny (about 100g or 4 ounces), blind, white and helpless.\nThe mother cradles her tiny cub in a paw and doesn't leave the den for several days after giving birth, even to drink.\nCubs soon develop soft gray fur, which becomes coarser and develops its black and white pattern in a month.\nThe new born panda doesn't move from the den in the first two months. After three months baby pandas begin to crawl.\nLearn more on Baby Pandas \u2014 Their Growing Process.\n2. Cubhood \u2014 Eating Bamboo at Around 6 Months\nCubs start to eat bamboo around six months and are fully weaned at nine months.\nCubs easily die in the wild because they are so small and defenseless. The mother has to leave them alone in the den to eat for four hours a day.\nGiant pandas weigh about 45 kg (100 lb) at one year.\nRecommended Tours:\n3. Living Independently \u2014 Leaving Their Mothers at Around 2 Years Old\nTwo barely mature giant pandas climbing a tree Two barely mature giant pandas climbing a tree\nPanda cubs grow quickly. They stay with their mother for one and a half to two years. When cubs leave their mother depends on if she conceives. They are fully grown in four years (up to 150 kg or 330 lb).\n4. Maturity \u2014 Breeding at 4\u20136 Years Old\nGiant pandas are fully mature and able to breed at four to six years old (females at four, males at six), while captive giant pandas mature two to three years earlier.\nYoung male pandas have a lower priority in the wild, and barely have any opportunity to mate until 7 or 8 years old.\nFemale giant pandas are only fertile once for two to three days a year, sometime in the spring (March to May). They leave their partners after mating and rear their cubs alone. Female pandas normally bear one cub every 2 or 3 years from 4 to 18 years old.\n5. Reproduction \u2014 Giving Birth\nPanda cub and its mother Panda cub and its mother\nGiant panda gestation is 3 to 5 months, and cubs are usually born in late summer (August mostly) in hidden hollow trees or natural dens, where branches, dry grass, etc. are made into a kind of nest.\nNormally giant pandas give birth to a single cub. Even if a female has two cubs, she would normally choose to take care of one and abandon the other.\nRecommended Tours:\nHow Long Does A Panda Live\nGiant pandas can live up to 30 years in captivity. Wild pandas live up to 20 years in the wild.\nWith medical and nutritional help in captivity, pandas can live more than 30 years. The oldest recorded panda was Jiajia in Hong Kong's Ocean Park. She died at 38 in 2016.\nFragility of the Population\nIn the wild, the cub-bearing period for female giant pandas lasts for around 10 years. Therefore, a female panda is able to bear four to six cubs in her life at most.\nDue to the low birth rate and vulnerability of cubs, it is little wonder that pandas are on the verge of extinction.\nA wild panda raises around five cubs in a lifetime, of which perhaps half die before reaching maturity, making the rate of pandas reaching adulthood just above the two needed to sustain the population.\nSee Giant Pandas with China Highlights\nIf you are interested in a panda tour, we can help you tailor-make your own unique tour."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "What Do Pandas Eat? And Other Fun Eating Facts", "url": "https://www.chinahighlights.com/giant-panda/giantpanda-diet.htm", "text": "Bamboo is pandas\u2019 favorite food: more than 99% of their diet is bamboo.\nBut how much bamboo do pandas eat every day? Apart from bamboo, what do pandas eat? Do pandas eat meat? All the secrets about pandas' diet are revealed in this article.\nContent Preview\nPandas Eat LOTS of Bamboo\nPandas like eating arrow bamboo, black bamboo, and 'water bamboo', along with about 20 other species. They prefer bamboo roots, shoots, and leaves, especially shoots.\nPandas eat different types and parts of bamboo according to the season. In spring and summer, they like eating different kinds of shoots; in autumn, they enjoy the leaves of bamboo; in winter, their main diet is bamboo roots.\nWith very little nutritional value in bamboo, pandas must eat 23\u201340 kg (50\u201390 lb) every day to meet their energy needs.\nWhat Do Pandas Eat Besides Bamboo?\nOur panda volunteers are making panda cakes.\nPandas also eat fruits (they love apples the most), meat (small mammals), vegetables like carrots and ginseng, and fungus.\nCaptive pandas are also fed nutritious \"panda cakes\" and steamed corn bread. In the hot summer, they are fed ice with apples inside it to cool them down. The food is strictly selected, going through several rounds of examination before being fed to pandas, to make sure the pandas get enough nutrition and that it is healthy for the pandas.\nWild pandas prefer hunting for pikas (small mountain rabbits), bamboo rats, and other small rodents as the last part of their diet. Though pandas are not very fast, injured and wounded animals are catchable by pandas.\nThe Eating Timetable of Pandas\nGiant pandas spend over 10 hours a day eating and foraging. Because they have a shorter gut (typical of carnivores), which is not efficient at processing vegetation, they need to keep eating that long to ensure they have enough energy. A typical panda day goes like this:\n2\u20138am: eating/foraging (6 hours)\n8\u201310:30am: sleeping\n10:30\u201311am: playing\n11am\u201312pm: eating (1 hour)\n12\u20132:30pm: sleeping\n2:30\u20139pm: eating/foraging (6\u00bd hours)\n9pm\u20132am: sleeping\nCaptive pandas are fed a richer diet and don't have to look for food, so spend less time eating and more time sleeping. Normally, captive pandas are fed at 8\u20139am and 3\u20134pm every day. To avoid visiting the pandas when they're asleep, you are suggested to visit around feeding time.\nWhat Do Baby Pandas Eat?\nOne-year-old baby pandas\nBaby pandas drink their mother\u2019s milk until they are six months old and then they start eating bamboo.\nPandas have very little breast milk. So captive panda cubs are fed milk made from a mixture of milk, powdered milk, and various vitamins.\nWhat Do Red Pandas Eat?\nRed pandas are eating pumpkins\nRed pandas, more similar to raccoons than bears, are a totally different species to giant pandas. They also like to eat arrow bamboo, but also wild fruits, tree leaves, moss, and prey on birds or bird eggs, and other small animals and insects.\nThey especially like to eat sweet foods, such as apples and pumpkins. Red pandas are currently the only non-primates that can taste sweeteners.\nFAQs about Giant Pandas\u2019 Diet\n1. Why Do Pandas Like to Eat Bamboo? Bamboo is widely distributed and easily available in the wild. It is available all year around. Bamboo is rich in starch and can provide pandas with enough energy\u2026 if they eat a lot. That\u2019s why pandas like to eat bamboo. 2. Do Pandas Eat Meat? Yes, pandas can eat meat though now they are recognized as vegetarian. Pandas occasionally eat meat (usually carcasses, and sometimes bamboo rats). 3. Why Pandas' Diet Changed \u2014 from Meat to Bamboo It is the result of environmental and genetic changes. Pandas have canine teeth and possess the digestive system of a carnivore. Fossil evidence, or lack thereof, suggests that about 7 million years ago, environmental changes killed off most of giant pandas' predecessors\u2019 prey. Without any other choice, they became more and more vegetarian. Fossilized panda skulls and paws and radio carbon dating show giant pandas had completely evolved to being bamboo eaters from 2 million years ago. 4. What Do Pandas Drink? Pandas drink fresh water from rivers and streams. Pandas drink water once or twice a day. Because bamboo shoots are more than 60 percent water, pandas can get water while eating bamboo shoots. In spring, when bamboo shoots are plentiful, they can go without drinking water for a day or two.\nWant to Make a Meal for Pandas?\nIn our Panda Volunteer Program, you can make cakes in different shapes for the pandas and feed a panda with your own hands.

What is a newborn panda's size?\nA baby panda at 6-8 weeks\nAll pandas are born very small. The average weight is 100 grams (0.2 pounds), which is only 1/900 of their mother's weight (compared to about 1/20 for human babies).\nThe lightest one on record was only 36 grams (0.1 pounds) and the heaviest one was 210 grams (0.5 pounds).\n2. Why are baby pandas so tiny?\nBaby pandas are \u201cpremature\u201d. Due to pandas\u2019 special physiological structure, the embryo will \u201cwander\u201d in the mother panda's womb for three months after conception so that it is unable to be implanted.\nThis leads to delayed development in their mother's womb (development lasts only one and a half to two months) and the inability to absorb adequate nutrients for what would normally be considered full development by the end of a typical gestation of five months.\nAccording to expert Dr Wang Dajun, the tiny birth size is \u201cdefinitely a result of evolution over millions of years \u2026 It is a kind of breeding strategy.\u201d He explained that pandas subsist almost entirely on bamboo, and, \u201cIt is easier for the animal to convert bamboo into milk than to convert bamboo into animal tissue.\u201d Hence shorter gestation and longer nursing.\nRecommended Tours:\n3. What color is a newborn panda?\nNewborn giant pandas are pink and furless. The iconic black and white coloring comes later, after about 3 weeks.\n4. How long is a panda pregnant for?\nA baby panda at 3 months\nThe mating season is in spring between March and May. Males and females usually associate for no more than 2 to 4 days. Pregnancy lasts from 95 to 160 days.\n5. When are baby pandas born?\nJuly to September is the period during which mother pandas give birth.\nMarch to May is the \"falling in love\" period for pandas. A baby panda stays in its mother's uterus for just 3 to 5 months.\n6. How baby pandas grow up?\nA baby panda's growing process is interesting, but very difficult, because they are extremely fragile and can easily get sick and die. At breeding centers 90% of baby pandas survive nowadays, compared to no more than 30% in the 1960s. Read on to see how baby pandas grow up:\nAfter 1 week : Blackish hairs start to grow on their ears and around their eyes and shoulders.\n: Blackish hairs start to grow on their ears and around their eyes and shoulders. After 1 month : Black hairs grow all over the neck and chest, and they have bigger dark circles around their eyes.

How are panda babies born?\nPandas give birth to young, just like other mammals. The birth of a giant panda can be quite painful. The mother panda\u2019s birth orifice is so narrow that the baby panda is ejected like a cannonball!\nWhen a panda cub is born, its mother picks it up in her mouth and holds it in her arms.\nSome giant panda mothers can't bear the pain and stop giving birth, and their cubs get stuck in their reproductive tracts and suffocate to death. It sounds crazy, but it's still happening.\n8. Do panda mothers kill their babies?\nA Baby Panda with Panda Mother\nNo, a panda mother won\u2019t kill her baby directly. But if she has twins in the wild, she will leave the weaker one to perish and choose to raise the stronger cub. The reason for this is that they don't have sufficient milk or energy to care for two cubs.\nIn a panda breeding center, the staff will rotate the two babies between their mother and the incubator every few hours so that two can be raised.\nRecommended Tours:\n9. The survival rate of baby pandas is 60% in the wild.\nBaby Pandas\nWhy are the survival rates of infant pandas so low? Here are some reasons:\n1. Cubs are very needy and vulnerable at birth. They are born furless and blind. The limbs of newborn pandas are so weak that they are not able to stand for 3 months.\nFor 6 months after birth, baby pandas rely entirely on the mother's warmth, milk, and protection.\n2. Cubs can be accidentally crushed by their mothers.\n3. Decrease in habitat can mean the mother panda has insufficient food to gestate and nurse her cub.\n4. In the wild, half of all panda births are twins; however, it is very rare for both cubs to survive as panda mothers are usually only able to raise one at a time and abandon the other twin.\n10. Can I hold a baby panda?\nGiant Panda Volunteer Program\nThe best place to see baby pandas is Chengdu Panda Base, which is very close to the downtown area.\nIf you visit between late August and December, you will have a greater chance of seeing tiny newborns and cuddly babies. The Baby Panda Volunteer Program is currently suspended [October 2021].\nBut you can take part in one of our Giant Panda volunteer programs. During the program, you can get close to the cute pandas, make their food, and feed them.\nAll our tours can be customized. Just Contact us. We will create a trip for your summer vacation according to your group size, time, budget, interests, and other requirements.\nMore Giant Pandas Related Articles"}

This isolates panda populations and prevents them from breeding.\nIt also leaves them more vulnerable to bamboo die-offs. Bamboo naturally dies off every 40-120 years, depending on the type.

This includes some of the most asked, fun, surprising and crazy animal facts from across the animal kingdom. The loudest, deadliest, fastest, largest, most bizarre and random, are all here in our big animal fact list.\n1. The loudest animal in the world is a mere 2cm long, prawn. The Pistol Shrimp is capable of snapping its claw shut so rapidly, that it creates a bubble which collapses to produce a sonic blast, louder than a Concorde\u2019s sonic boom.\nThe shock wave can reach 230 decibels, also louder than the sound of a gunshot. The imploding bubble for split seconds also generates temperates of 4,400C, nearly as hot as the sun, killing its prey.\n2. Flamingos are not pink. They are born grey, their diet of brine shrimp and blue green algae contains a natural pink dye called canthaxanthin that makes their feathers pink.\nFlamingos in zoos often lost their colouring, until zoo keepers supplemented their diets.\n3. Otters \u201chold hands\u201d while sleeping, so they don\u2019t float away from each other.\nAnd it\u2019s super-cute. Look.\n4. Hummingbirds are the only known birds that can also fly backwards.\nThey often do this when retreating away from flowers.\n5. Dolphins use toxic pufferfish to \u2018get high\u2019.\nDolphins deliberately handle pufferfish causing them to release toxins as a defence mechanism. These toxins can be deadly in high doses, but also have a narcotic effect \u2013 and are a powerful hallucinogenic, which dolphins appear to enjoy.\n\ufeff\nA documentary witnessed them passing around pufferfish in a pod, before floating just underneath the water\u2019s surface, apparently \u2018mesmerised by their own reflections\u2019 afterwards.\n6. The Inland Taipan (also known as, the Western Taipan) is the most venomous snake in the world. A single bite contains enough venom to kill at least 100 fully grown men, and can kill within just 30 minutes, if left untreated.\nThey very rarely ever come in contact with humans, however. Every reliable identification of a snake bite victim from an Inland Taipan have been herpetologists, when handling or studying the snakes. They have all survived, due to successful treatment with antivenom.\n7. The worlds deadliest animal isn\u2019t a shark, bear or tiger, but something far smaller \u2013 the mosquito. According to the World Health Organization, 725,000 people are killed each year from mosquito-borne diseases, such as Malaria, dengue fever and yellow fever.\nThey outnumber every other animal in the world, apart from ants and termites. They can also be found in nearly every part of the world, which all add up in the risk they pose to humans.\n8. There are more than 1.4 billion insects for EACH HUMAN on the planet, according to recent estimates.\nAnts have colonised almost every landmass on Earth. Their population is estimated as 107\u2013108 billion alone, in comparison to approx. 7 billion humans on the planet.\n9. The shortest living animal in the world is the Mayfly. Its entire lifespan is just 24hrs.\nThe Mayfly reproduces and then dies, during that short 24hr period of life. Some species of Mayfly only live for 8-10 hours.\n10. The horned lizard is able to shoot blood from its own eyes, up to a distance of 3 feet away. The rather bizarre and disgusting act is a defensive mechanism to confuse predators.\nTheir blood contains a chemical that is noxious to predators, and this isn\u2019t its only trick \u2013 short-horned lizards are also capable of inflating their bodies up to twice their size to scare anything away.\n\ufeff\ufeff\n11. Roosters prevent themselves from going deaf due to their own loud crowing, by tilting their head backs when they crow, which covers their ear canal completely, serving as a built-in ear-plug.\nA study showed that their crowing averages over 100 decibels, which is roughly the same as running a chainsaw.\n12. Little is known about the elusive Giant squid, however the largest squid ever found measured over 50 feet and weighed nearly a tonne.\nTo put that in perspective, that\u2019s bigger than a bus.\n13. The pangolin is able to roll up into an armour-plated ball, so lions can\u2019t eat them.\nIf only this worked for poachers, who simply pick them up when they roll into a ball.\n\ufeff\n14. Koalas can sleep for up to 22 hours a day.\nKoala need more sleep than most animals, because their diet of eucalyptus leaves contain toxins, are very low in nutrition, and high in fibrous matter \u2013 so they take a large amount of energy to digest!\n15. Swifts spend most of their lives flying in the air, and can fly for almost an entire year, without ever landing.\nA study showed that over a 10-month period, a swift stopped for just 2 hours.\n16. Even after having its head cut off, a cockroach can still live for weeks .\nEven stranger, a cockroach\u2019s head can actually survive by itself for a few hours, too.\n17. A group of parrots is known as a pandemonium.\nAnd the collective noun for porcupines, is a prickle.\n18. Cows poo up to 15 times a day, which can be as much as 115 pounds of manure per day, or approximately 21 tons per year.\nThe large quantities are often put to good use, though \u2013 manure, to fertilizer, to fuel, or biogas to create electricity and heat for developing parts of the world.\n19. Panda\u2019s must eat 25 \u2013 90 pounds (12-38 kg) of bamboo every day to meet their energy needs.\nThis is because bamboo contains very little nutritional value, so they have to eat it in vast quantities to survive. Although the giant panda possess the digestive system of a carnivore, they have evolved to depend almost entirely on bamboo.\n20. A Blue Whales tongue can weigh as much as a car, or a small adult elephant.\nA Blue Whales tongue can weigh approx. 2.7 tonnes, or 6,000 \u2013 8,000 pounds (2,720 \u2013 3,630 kg).\n21. The longest living, verified animal is a Madagascar radiated tortoise, which died at an age of 188 years in May 1965.\nHowever, there might be even older. Adwaita, an Aldabra giant tortoise, died at an estimated age of 255 in March 2006 in Alipore Zoo, Kolkata, India. If verified, it will have been the oldest terrestrial animal in the world.\n22. The fastest land animal on the planet is a cheetah. It can reach speeds of up to 75 mph (120 kph).\nWhile the Peregrine Falcon is the fastest bird, with a diving speed of 242 mph (389 kph). The Black Marlin is the fastest sea animal, and can swim up to 80 mph (130 kph).\n23. Baby elephants suck their trunks for comfort.\nJust like babies and young children suck their thumbs, awwww.\nPhoto courtesy of Darkroomillusions.\n24. The Nile crocodiles jaws can apply 5,000 pounds of pressure per square inch \u2013 the strongest bite of any animal in the world.\nA human\u2019s jaw produces 100 pounds of pressure per square inch in comparison. A crocodiles bite is 10 times more powerful than that of a great white shark\n25. Axolotl are able to regenerate lost limbs and body organs.\nMexican walking fish can regrow the same limb up to 5 times, and even regenerate parts of its brain.\n26. The Giant Pacific Octopus has 3 hearts, 9 brains and blue blood.\nThey are also able to change their colour and texture to camouflage themselves in a blink of an eye.\n27. A flea can jump distances 200 times their body length.\nThey are able to jump 10 inches (25cm) vertically and up to 18 inches (45 cm) horizontally, making them one of the planets best jumpers relative to its size. It\u2019s equal to a human jumping as high as the Empire State Building in New York.\n28. The male seahorse goes through pregnancy and gives birth to babies. They are the only animal on earth where the male carries the baby rather than the female.\nThe male seahorse has a pouch on its stomach in which to carry babies\u2014as many as 2,000 at a time.\n29. Pufferfish can contain a tetrodoxin, a toxin that is up to 1,200 times more deadly than cyanide to humans. There is enough toxin in one pufferfish to kill 30 adult humans, and there is no known antidote.\nAmazingly despite this, some pufferfish meat is considered a delicacy in Japan. The meat called Fugu, is expensive and only prepared by licenced chefs with over 3 years of rigorous training who remove toxic parts of the meat for diners.\n30. The loudest animal relative to size is the Water Boatman, which measures at just 12mm long, but can produce 99 dB of sound by rubbing its genitalia across its abdomen.\nThis is the equivalent noise level of operating a circular saw, or a drill.\n31. The howler monkey is the loudest land animal. Its calls can be heard from 3 miles (5 km) away.\nAt its peak, the howler monkey can produce sounds that reach 140 decibels. That\u2019s as noisy as a jet engine, on take off!\n32. There is an average of 50,000 spiders per acre in green areas.\nThere\u2019s over 45,000 known spider species, with the venom of a few only known to be dangerous to humans.\n33. The aptly named colossal squids eyes are as large as a basketball.\nThis allows them to detect the faint light of a predator from over 400 feet (120 metres).\n34. White-tailed jackrabbits are the greatest land jumpers, having been recorded leaping an astonishing 21ft (6.4m) vertically.\nThat\u2019s higher than 3 average sized men all stood on top of each other. This large species of hare can also run up to 35mph (55kph) when escaping predators.\n35. Grey-headed Albatross can circle the globe in only 46 days.\nThe incredible round-the-world journey covers 14,000 miles over the 46 day period at a steady 13mph. They perform this feat by making various pit-stops along the way.\n36. Giraffes are the tallest land animal in the world, reaching heights of 19ft (5.8 m). The ostrich is the world\u2019s tallest bird. It can grow up to 9 feet (2.7m) tall.\nOver 2 metres (7ft) of a giraffes total size is its famously long neck, which helps it reach leaves in tall trees.\n37. An ostrich legs are so powerful that their kicks can kill a lion.\nOr a human! Each two-toed foot has a long, sharp claw \u2013 making them formidable weapons. Animals often end up running away from the large bird.\n38. The dementor wasp paralyses cockroaches with venom to its head, turning them into a zombie-like state. The toxins leave the cockroach unable to control its own movements, which incredibly makes it run into the wasps nest to meet its demise.\nThe venom is thought to cut brain activity that makes cockroaches sense fear and run away to safety. The dementor wasp will then lay eggs on the cockroach to act as an incubator for its young.\n39. More than half of all pigs in the world are kept by farmers in China.\nThere are over 440 million pigs in China. United States in comparison has a mere 73 million pigs.\n40. Polar bears have jet black skin under their white fur coats.\nIt helps them absorb heat to keep warm, while the white fur helps provides camouflage in the snowy and icy environment they live.\n41. Giant anteaters consume up to 35,000 ants and termites in a single day.\nThey use their long sticky tongues to slurp up hundreds of ants per minute. Interestingly, anteaters purposefully never destroy an ant nest, preferring to leave some ants alive to rebuild, so it can return and feed again in the future.\n42. The little known pangolin is the worlds most poached and trafficked animal.\nThis is due to the high demand of their scales and meat in Asian cultures. 70% of Chinese citizens believe pangolin products have medicinal value, when its been scientifically proven to be false.\n43. Great white sharks can detect a drop of blood in 25 gallons (100 litres) of water and can even sense tiny amounts of blood from 3 miles (5 km) away.\nThey use their acute sense of smell to detect blood using an organ called the \u2018olfactory bulb\u2019.\n44. The Naked Mole-Rat can live in an almost zero oxygen atmosphere.\nIncredibly, in a zero oxygen environment, the Naked Mole-Rat can still survive for up to 20-minutes without suffering any harm at all.\n45. The smell of a skunk is powerful enough for a human to smell it up to 3.5 miles (5.6 km) away.\nThe foul smelling spray from a skunk can also cause skin irritation and even temporary blindness.\n46. The most venonmous fish in the world is the 30cm Stonefish.\nStonefish have 13 sharp fin spines on their back, each with two venom glands. Their stings are extremely painful, can be lethal to humans, and mostly occur as a result of stepping on the creature.\n47. Only 5% of cheetah cubs survive to adulthood.\nA study in the 90\u2019s in the Serengeti found that 95% of cheetah cubs died before reaching adulthood. Many deaths were due to Lions, but also other predators and disease.\n48. A tigers rear legs are so powerful, that they have been found remaining to stand even after death.\nTigers have been witnessed to have been shot, bled out, and died \u2013 and remained standing throughout.\n49. A Rhinoceros\u2018s horns are made of \u2018keratin\u2019, the same type of protein that makes up hair and fingernails.\nSome species of Rhinos have two horns, while others just have a single horn.\n50. The Alpine Swift is able to stay airborne for over 6 months without touching down.\nIt holds the world record for the longest recorded uninterrupted flight by a bird, at over 200 days in the air as it hunted flying insects on its wintering range in the skies over West Africa.\n51. The Edible Dormouse (Glis glis) is able to hibernate the longest \u2013 up to 11-months of the year when food availability is low.\nTo be able to pull of this feat, they double or even triple their body weight before hibernation. During hibernation they are able to reduce their metabolic rate and the animal may stop breathing for periods of up to an hour at a time.\n52. Japanese Macaques play with snowballs for fun.\nThese snow monkeys have been observed rolling up snowballs, then pushing them down hills just for the heck of it. Others gather lumps of snow in a ball and carry them around, proudly sometimes to the envy of other monkeys who try to steal it.\n53. Sperm whales are the world\u2019s largest predator.\nThey can be up to 18m long and weigh up to 53 tonnes. These giant whales dive down to almost 3000m below the surface where they hunt giant squid. Giant squid can be the same size or bigger than sperm whales and will fight viciously with them. Adult whales can be seen with scars on their heads from the beaks of giant squid.\n54. The largest insect to ever live was a \u201cdragonfly\u201d with a wingspan of over 75cm (2 and a half feet) across.\nThey are called Meganeuropsis and were around 247 million years ago. They were proficient predators, with large mandibles that they used to capture fish, amphibians and insects.\n55. Koala\u2019s have fingerprints almost identical to human.\nIt is so hard to distinguish between the fingerprints of koalas and humans that even under a microscope it is hard to tell. There are even reported cases of a koala\u2019s fingerprints confusing forensics at crime scenes.\n56. Greenland sharks are the longest living vertebrates on earth, with one individual thought to be over 400 years old\nGreenland sharks are giant, reaching up to 5m in length, and live in the cold deep waters of the North Atlantic. They are rarely seen, and little is known about them.\n57. The blood \u2018Dracula ant\u2019 has the fastest recorded animal movement when it snaps its mandible.\nThis cannibalistic ant can go from zero to 200mph in 0.000015 seconds when it snaps its mandibles, that\u2019s roughly 5,000 times faster than humans blink. 5 This is the fastest recorded movement in the animal kingdom.\n58. The box jellyfish is considered the most venomous marine species in the world.\nThese cube shaped jellyfish have long tentacles and can be over 3m in length. Their toxin, delivered via stinging cells in their tentacles, is so potent that many die before they can even reach the shore.\n59. The Japanese Spider Crab has the longest leg span of any arthropod.\nFrom the tip of one claw to the other can be as long as almost 4m! Japanese spider crabs have 10 legs stretching out from a central body, giving it its spider like appearance. They live deep in the oceans south of Japan.\n60. Some albatrosses are lesbians.\nAlbatrosses form bonds for life, returning to the same place every year to raise their young. Some of these bonds are between two female albatrosses, with a study finding that in one breeding area 31% of pairs were two females.\n61. Some corvids (crows, rooks, ravens etc,) can understand physics.\nCorvids are highly intelligent. They can use tools, solve puzzles, recognise faces, and even understand physics. Tests show that rooks have the same level of understanding of physics as a 6-month-old baby, which is higher than some apes.\n62. Sheep can recognise faces.\nAs social animals, sheep are capable of recognising familiar and unfamiliar faces. Studies even suggest that they miss other sheep when they are taken away for a long time afterwards.\n63. Tardigrades can survive in space and go without eating for more than 10 years.\nTardigrades are microscopic animals with crazy endurance abilities. They can survive in temperatures as high as 149oC or as low as -272oC and pressures 6 times more intense than the bottom of the ocean. They also look like tiny bears!\n64. Hoatzin\u2019s are the only bird species with a ruminant digestive system, and they smell like cow-dung.\nA ruminant digestive system is one that uses fermentation to digest food, cows being a well- known example of this. It\u2019s this digestive system that gives it it\u2019s lovely cow-dung smell. These birds are found in the amazon and have a dinosaur like appearance to them.\n65. Echidna\u2019s are relatives of duck-billed platypuses and have a beak, spikes, a kangaroo-like pouch, and lays eggs.\nThey are small at just 30\u201345cm and are known as spiny anteaters. One of the few egg-laying mammals, echidna lay a tiny egg which is then transferred into a kangaroo-like pouch where it then hatches.\n66. The desperate leaf chameleon is less than 3cm long.\nOne of the tiniest reptiles in the world, this tiny chameleon is native only to Madagascar. It can change colour to match its environment and lays huge eggs compared to its body size. They are named \u201cdesperate\u201d due to their status as critically endangered.\n67. The Yangtze giant softshell turtle is the biggest freshwater turtle in the world.\nIt weighs between 150 to 220 kilograms (330 to 485 pounds) and is over 100cm (39in) in length. They are found primarily in the area of the Yangtze River in China.\n68. The Mariana snailfish is the deepest fish in the ocean, living up to around 8,000m below the surface.\nThey live down in the deepest trenches of the ocean where they hunt invertebrates, such as crustaceans and shrimp.\n69. Pea Crabs are miniature crabs that spend their whole lives inside oysters, clams, and mussels.\nNames so because it is the size of a pea, this tiny crab relies entirely on its host for food.\n70. The shoebill stork can swallow baby crocodiles whole.\nThese huge birds are over a meter tall (up to 5 feet) and have a wingspan of more than 2 m (almost 8 feet!). Its name comes from its huge beak which is over 20cm long and almost that wide. Along with lungfish, it also eats baby turtles and baby crocodiles whole.\n71. Lungfish are the only fish that have both lungs and gills.\nThis allows them to survive when the water in their ponds/lakes dries up.\n72. Electric eels are in fact not eels, and give a shock strong enough to knock out a horse.\nIn the Tennessee Aquarium an electric eel\u2019s tank has been hooked up to a computer programmed to send out a tweet whenever the eel produces enough electricity.\n73. The yellowhead jawfish incubates its eggs in its mouth.\nThe male gathers up all of the eggs once they\u2019ve been fertilised and stores them in his mouth until they hatch.\n74. The patu digua is thought to be this smallest spider in the world at just 0.37 mm.\nThis Colombian spider is about one fifth the size of the head of a pin.\n75. Vampire bats share blood with their friends.\nVampire bats need to eat blood at least every 48 hours to survive. Bats will share blood after a good meal with another bat that\u2019s fed them in the past.\n76. The U.S. military trained bottlenose dolphins.\nBottlenose dolphins were used in both the Vietnam and the Gulf to detect enemy swimmers trying to plant explosives on ships.\n77. Wojtek the bear was a corporal in the polish military during WWII.\nWojtek was brought by polish shoulders while in Iran. He was made an officer so that he was allowed rations and eventually was promoted to corporal. He helped out by carrying boxes of ammunition.\n78. Horned lizards shoot blood out of their eyes.\nTo scare of predators, this lizard shoots blood out of its eyes.\n79. Cuckoo birds hide their eggs in the nests of other species.\nThe other bird species then raises the cuckoo chick as if it were its own, and the cuckoo mother doesn\u2019t have to do any of the work.\n80. Elephants mourn their dead.\nElephants will return to the place where family members died and stand in silence over the bones, sometimes bowing their heads.\n81. Meerkat parents train their offspring to hunt scorpions.\nThey will bring back dead or almost dead scorpions back to the younger ones so that they can practice killing them without getting stung.\n82. Only 3-5% of mammals are monogamous.\nThe majority of mammals are not monogamous, making humans unusual.\n83. Gorilla\u2019s have been seen dismantling traps set by poachers.\nPoaching is a big problem for gorillas, but young gorillas have learnt how to trap and dismantle snares.\n84. The earliest found depictions of dogs come from 8,000 years ago.\nDogs have been human-kinds best friend for a long time, with a carving in a rock face in Saudi Arabia showing a man hunting with 13 dogs. Two of them even have leads!\n85. Cat\u2019s were domesticated 9,500 years ago in Ancient Egypt.\nThey were worshiped in Ancient Egypt and some historians report that it was illegal to kill a cat.\n86. Emperor penguins are the world\u2019s biggest penguins, and they trek 50\u2013120 km (31\u201375 m) across the Antarctic to reach breeding colonies.\nThese impressive penguins reach 100 cm (39 in) in length and weigh 22 to 45 kg (49 to 99 lb). They breed during winter, when they emerge from their more natural habitat in the ocean to trek long distances over treacherous ice.\n87. Yaks are specially adapted to high altitudes, with a huge lung capacity and small red blood cells.\nNative originally to Tibet, these giant oxen-like animals live at high altitudes in the Himalayas (4,000\u20136,000 metres). They are specifically adapted to the low oxygen levels with a lung capacity that is ~3 times that of normal cattle, and have smaller red blood cells to improve oxygen transport.\n88. Cuvier\u2019s Beaked whales are one of the deepest diving mammals and can collapse their lungs to survive the high pressure.\nOne of the deepest diving mammals, one individual was recorded diving down to 2,992 m (9,816ft) below the surface. The pressure at these depths is so high that in order to survive it they have to collapse their lungs.\n89. Orangutans are the heaviest tree-dwelling animals.\nThere are three species of orangutan and adult males of all three typically weigh around 75kg (165lb) while females are ~37 kg (82 lb). They are ~1.5m(5ft) tall and have a huge arm span of ~2m (6ft). They spend most of their time up in the canopy, making them the heaviest tree-dwelling animal.\n90. Chimpanzees are very intelligent and make all kinds of tools.\nFor example, some use long sticks to fish out termites from their mounds. Others have been recorded creating \u201cspears\u201d to hunt bushbabies!\n91. Shrike\u2019s impale their prey on sticks to save them for later.\nAlso known as \u201cbutcherbirds\u201d they are famous for being fairly brutal songbirds. They catch all kinds of animals, including crickets, lizards, and small birds, and impale them on sticks to save them for later.\n92. Atlantic wolffish are terrifying predators reaching up to 5 feet in length.\nThey have very sharp teeth and a powerful bite, making them powerful predators. Atlantic wolffish use this bite force to crush the hard shells of molluscs and crustaceans.\n93. The wood frog spends 7 months of the year frozen.\nThese Alaskan frogs freeze almost completely at the start of winter, with two-thirds of their body water turning into ice. To all intents and purposes, they seem dead; their heart stops beating, and their blood flow stops. However, once winter starts to thaw so do they and they hop back to life.\n94. Certain animals have anti-freeze proteins that allow them to survive extreme temperatures.\nThese anti-freeze proteins prevent water in the cells of the animals from crystalising and forming ice. Examples of animals with this superpower include the winter flounder and the eelpout.\n95. Honeypot ants swell up to a huge size with food.\nHoneypot ants have to be seen to be believed. During wet season, certain ants consume huge amounts of nectar, making their abdomens swell up to the size of a grape. Then, during dry season, they provide the other ants with food by throwing the nectar back up again. Yum!\n96. The lesula, discovered in 2007, has giant human like eyes and a blue bottom.\nThis relatively newly discovered monkey lives in the Congo. Their eyes are very distinctive because of their human-like appearance, as are their bright blue bums.\n97. The Donald Trump caterpillar looks identical to the ex-president\u2019s hair.\nThis species of caterpillar, prior to 2016, was known as the Flannel Moth Caterpillar (Megalopyge opercularis). It gained popularity as it is very furry and bright orange, giving it an uncanny resemblance to Trump\u2019s hair (wig?). This \u2018fur\u2019 however, is actually composed of multiple venomous \u2018hairs\u2019. Grabbing hold of one of these caterpillars is a painful experience.\n98. Frilled sharks are 2-meter-long living fossils that eat their prey whole.\nFrilled sharks are considered living fossils, meaning they\u2019ve gone unchanged for a long period of time and most of their closest relatives can only be found in the form of fossils. They get their names from their \u201cfrilly\u201d gills and they are predators, which swallow their prey whole.\n99. Giant vampire bats lived 100,000 years ago and had a wingspan of 50cm (20 inches).\nThese giant bats were roughly 30% larger than the modern vampire bats. The remains of one were recently found in a cave in Argentina.\n100. There are an estimated 8.7 million species on earth and more than 80% of them are undiscovered.\nBased on current data, complex statistics, and models we can predict how many species there are on Earth, telling us how many are still left to be found. It will likely take another 500 years to find them all."}

They are well known for looking like giant guinea pigs.\nThey are from South America, where they live both in dense forests and savannas, typically near bodies of water. They are well known inhabitants of the Amazon, where they can be spotted on river edges.\nCapybara Facts Overview\nHabitat: Near lakes, rivers, swamps & tropical rivers Location: South America (Except Chile), North America Lifespan: 8 \u2013 10 years Size: 106 \u2013 134cm Weight: 35 \u2013 66kg Color: Brown Diet: Grasses, aquatic plants, fruits, and tree bark Predators: Jaguars, caimans, green anacondas, pumas Top Speed: 35 kph No. of Species:\n1 Conservation Status:\nLow concern\nThey are herbivores, munching on grasses and aquatic plants, fruit and tree bark.\nThey are semi-aquatic and are well-adapted for both land and water. They have webbed toes and fast drying fur, but they can also run at 35km/h on land.\nThey are highly social, with groups potentially as big as 100 members, however the average group size is 10-20 individuals. They live for 8-10 years.\nInteresting Capybara Facts\n1. They are the world\u2019s biggest rodent.\nThe biggest Capybara ever recorded was 91kg (201lb)! They are 106-134cm in length and usually weigh 35 \u2013 66kg, similar to a small dog.\n2. Capybara are closely related to guinea pigs.\nSeeing them in the wild you might be shocked at first because they look like giant guinea pigs, which are in fact one of their closest relatives. They belong to the Cavy family (Caviidae) which contains 14 rodent species native to South America.\n3. They are semi-aquatic mammals.\nThey live in and around lakes, rivers, swamps, and tropical rivers. They are excellent at swimming and can hold their breath for 5 minutes at a time. They are well adapted for this, with partially webbed toes for swimming. Also, their eyes, ears and nose are high on their heads to watch out for predators when they are underwater.\n4. Capybara can sleep in water.\nThey will submerge themselves underwater for a nap, leaving their noses out on the edges of riverbanks so they can breathe.\n5. They can run as fast as 35 kph.\nThey are also extremely agile, which helps them run away from predators.\n6. Their teeth grow constantly.\nThis is a common feature of rodents, as constantly chewing on plants grinds down teeth. Capybaras teeth continually grow throughout their lives to replace what they lose.\n7. Capybara are extremely picky eaters.\nThey will tend to focus all their efforts on one species of grass, avoiding any other species around it.\n8. They can get scurvy.\nLike humans, they are unable to produce their own vitamin c, so they have to consume enough of it in their diet. Capybara\u2019s bred in captivity have been known to get scurvy due to insufficient diets.\n9. Capybara eat their own poop.\nThis is called being autocoprophagous. They do this as their faeces contains bacteria which helps them to digest cellulose in plant matter.\n10. Other animals love sitting on them.\nCapybaras are so chill about other animals sitting on them, that they\u2019ve been called \u201cmoving chairs\u201d. Birds, rabbits and even monkeys have been spotted taking a ride.\nThis is often reciprocal, as birds will eat pests in the capybaras fur.\n11. They are eaten by the jungle\u2019s biggest predators.\nJaguars, ocelots, pumas, caimans, and anacondas all love to eat capybaras. Check out this incredible footage of a green anaconda hunting a capybara!\n12. In some places Capybara are threatened.\nIn some areas they are hunted for their meat and skin, leading to entire local populations being eradicated. However, their population as a whole is thought to be stable.\n13. They are occasionally kept as pets.\nCapybaras are sometimes kept as pets in the United States, although it\u2019s illegal in some states. However capybara are social creatures, and shouldn\u2019t be kept alone.\nCapybara Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification"}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Why Are Pandas Endangered Animals? - Sciencing", "url": "https://sciencing.com/pandas-endangered-animals-5176027.html", "text": "Pandas are one of the most easily recognized animals on Earth, thanks to their bold black and white coloration. Since almost all other bears have just one solid coat color, pandas are highly unusual-looking. They are also unique in other ways. For example, the diets of most bears are comprised of plant material, such as berries, and other animals, such as fish or insects. Pandas exclusively eat bamboo. Unfortunately, these fascinating bears are highly endangered due to habitat loss and other issues.\nTL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) Pandas are endangered mainly due to habitat loss. Humans have cleared much of the bamboo forests that pandas need to survive. Because pandas eat only bamboo, they cannot adapt to live outside of those forests the way other animals do, unless the pandas are provided with bamboo. Pandas also have difficulty reproducing, even in captivity, due to their extreme choosiness about their mates, their low-nutrient milk and the fact that they usually only have one viable cub at a time. Poaching is also an issue for pandas, since panda skins and pelts are valuable on the black market.\nHabitat Loss\nBy far, the greatest threat facing wild pandas, and the biggest reason they are critically endangered today, is deforestation on the part of humans, which has led to permanent habitat loss in some areas. Wild pandas once roamed bamboo forests in China, Vietnam, Laos and Burma. Today, wild pandas are found only in China, and in far fewer numbers than ever before. Scientists estimate that there are only around 1,800 wild pandas alive today.\nHabitat loss spells certain doom for pandas. If a bamboo forest is cleared away, then the pandas' food source is gone. Relocating to another forest is often impossible, as forests today have become separated from one another, thanks to human cities and towns. Without access to a steady source of bamboo, pandas whose forests are cleared will perish from starvation.\nDifficulties Adapting\nSome animals have found ways to adapt to human activity in areas that were once wild. For example, raccoons once lived primarily in forests but now inhabit many cities and towns, eating discarded food left behind by people. Raccoons are able to adapt in this way because of their physical attributes, such as their digestive systems, which can digest nearly any kind of food, and their small size, which allows them to hide easily. There are other animals, such as pigeons and rats, that have adapted in similar ways to live alongside humans.\nPandas have no such adaptations. They cannot simply move into cities and towns when their forests are destroyed, mainly because they are so specifically adapted to a life of eating bamboo. Pandas' digestive systems can't properly digest anything else. Because bamboo shoots and leaves don't contain many nutrients, pandas also must consume vast quantities of it \u2013 around 20 to 40 pounds a day. Even if pandas could eat something other than bamboo, pandas could never blend in safely in cities or towns, due to their large size. For pandas, the environment they originally adapted to is the only environment where they can thrive.\nDifficulties Reproducing\nEven in captivity, breeding pandas is notoriously difficult. Pandas are extremely selective about choosing their mates, which means that even if a male and female panda are kept in the same enclosure for years, there is no guarantee the pair will mate. If pandas do mate in captivity, the cubs often need to be hand-raised by people, since captivity seems to throw off the maternal instincts of many panda mothers, causing them to abandon or even harm their cubs.

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "23 Astonishing Pangolin Facts - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/pangolins/", "text": "Pangolin Profile\nPangolins are shy, nocturnal mammals that are completely covered in plate-like scales, and often referred to as \u2018scaly anteaters\u2019.\nThey inhabit woodlands and savannas in Southern, Central and East Africa, and Asia.\nThe majority of the population have never heard of the pangolin, but they are the world\u2019s most trafficked mammal, due to the high demand of their scales, and meat. Their meat is considered a delicacy, while their scales are said to \u2018cure\u2019 illnesses in traditional Asian medicine.\nPangolin Facts Overview\nHabitat: Woodlands, Thick Brush & Savannas Location: Africa & Asia Lifespan: 20 Years Size: 30 cm (12 in) \u2013 4.6 ft (1.4 m) Weight: 3.5 lbs (1.6 kg) \u2013 73 lbs (33 kg) Color: Olive & Brown Diet: Insects (Ants & Termites) Predators:\nHumans, Lions, Tigers, Leopards, Hyenas & Pythons. Top Speed: 5 kph (3 mph) No. of Species:\n8 Conservation Status:\n2 Species Critically Endangered \u2013 Chinese pangolin, Sunda pangolin. 2 Species Endangered \u2013 Indian pangolin, Philippine pangolan. 4 Species Vulnerable \u2013 Giant pangolin, White-bellied pangolin, Temminck\u2019s Ground pangolin, Long-tailed pangolin.\nThere are a total of 8 living species of Pangolin, which either live in trees or burrows, differ in colour between dark brown to olive, and range in size, depending on their species.\nThey are members of the order Pholidota, and family Manidae, which includes Manis, consisting of 4 species living in Asia, and Phataginus and Smutsia, which both have 2 species each, which inhabit Africa.\nThe smallest, the long-tailed pangolin (also known as the African black-bellied pangolin) grows to around 30\u201340 cm (12\u201316 in) in length, and weigh 3.5 \u2013 5.5 pounds (1.6 \u2013 2.5 kg). The largest pangolin is the giant pangolin, which can grow up to 4.6 ft (1.4 meters) in length, weighing up to 73 lb (33 kg).\nPangolins are insectivorous, which means they eat insects \u2013 and their diet mainly consists of ants and termites, which they capture with their extremely long sticky tongues.\nAll eight species of pangolin are on the IUCN red list of threatened species, mainly due to illegal poaching for their meat and scales and destruction of their natural forest habitat.\nInteresting Pangolin Facts\n1. The Pangolin is the only known mammal in the world to have hard overlapping scales, that cover their entire body.\n20% of a pangolins weight is made up of hard scales. Their scales are very different to those of a reptile, and are more like a pine cone in appearance.\nThey are hard and overlap, protecting the pangolin from predators.\n2. Their scales are made of keratin, the same protein that forms human nails, hair and animals claws, or birds talons.\nWhen first born they are soft, they grow hard as a Pangolin matures.\n3. When threatened, the pangolin rolls itself up into an armour-plated ball that protects it from predators.\nSimilar to a hedgehog, the pangolin will roll up, protecting their soft furry bellies. Its face is also tucked under its tail.\nIts scales are sharp, for extra protection against predators. Sadly, this doesn\u2019t protect them from humans, who can merely pick them up.\n4. Even big cats can struggle to bite their way through a pangolins armour.\nTheir curling into a tight ball defence confuses big cats, and their sharp scales cut into the mouths.\n\ufeff\nPredators often give up and leave the pangolin alone.\n5. Pangolins are bipedal, meaning they can walk on their hind legs with the front limbs and tail held off the ground, and used as a counter-balance.\nThis is because they have long, curved powerful claws on their forelimbs, which are not as efficient to walk on.\nThey often rise on their hind legs to sniff the air.\n6. The pangolin is thought to be prehistoric and is estimated to have lived on earth for nearly 80 million years.\nThey were originally thought to be a member of the Xenarthra family, which includes the similar-looking anteaters, sloths and armadillos. However, new studies suggest they are closer to the Carnivora, which consists of hyenas, bears and wolves.\n7. A pangolins tongue can be as long as its body.\nTheir tongues are extremely long and thin like anteaters, and when extended can be as long as 40cm (14 in).\nThey are also very sticky, which allow pangolins to collect ants and termites with precision when probing inside insect tunnels.\n8. They have no teeth!\nA pangolin has no teeth, as they simply don\u2019t need them to consume small insects, such as ants and termites. They have powerful front legs and sharp claws to help them disturb termite mounds, or burrow and climb trees.\n9. The name pangolin means \u2018something that rolls up\u2019.\nThe ground pangolin got its name from the Malay word \u2018pengguling\u2019, meaning \u2018rolling up\u2019, in reference to how they can roll into a ball, when threatened.\n10. They can emit a noxious-smelling chemical, similar to skunks.\nWhile they are unable to spray the liquid at predators, they do release the stinky fluid from their glands when defending themselves, and use it to mark their territory.\n11. Some species have prehensile tails that allow them to hang from branches, and help them climb trees.\nThe long-tailed pangolin in particular spend much of their time in trees.\n12. Pangolins swallow small stones to improve digestion. These stones help grind up the food in their stomachs.\nSwallowing stones (known as \u2018gastroliths\u2019) help grind up ants and termites. This is similar to how some reptiles, such as crocodiles improve digestion.\n13. They can constrict their ears and nostrils while feeding to help keep insects out.\nThis allows them to stick their faces deep into termite mounds, without having to worry about insects crawling inside them.\n14. A pangolin is estimated to consume more than 70 million insects per year.\nResearchers estimate that a full grown pangolin will eat about 200,000 insects per day on average. They have been hailed with the title of \u2018pest controllers\u2019, due to their ability to regulate the insect population numbers, which is particularly beneficial for crops.\n15. Pangolins have small eyes and poor vision, so they rely heavily on their sense of smell, and hearing.\nThis allows them to sense both their prey, and when predators are in close proximity.\n16. Pangolin babies ride on their mother\u2019s back by clinging onto her scales.\nBurrowing species babies first venture into the outside world at around 4 weeks by clinging to their mother for a ride.\n17. Asian pangolins can be distinguished from the African species by the presence of bristles, which emerge from between the scales.\nAfrican pangolins don\u2019t have bristles between their hard plated scales.\n17. The sunda pangolin can have over 1,000 scales.\nThe number of scales varies between species, due to their sizes, but some species are estimated to have over 1k of their hard plated scale armour.\n18. Pangolins are the most illegally traded wild animal in the world. One is poached every 5 mins.\nThe IUCN say that over a million pangolins were caught in the last decade. This illegal poaching and trade is driven largely by increasing demand from the Far East, mostly notably by China, and Vietnam. Their meat is considered a delicacy, and their scales are used in traditional medicine.\n19. The illegal trade in pangolins is estimated to be worth about $19bn (\u00a312.7bn) a year.\nThe Guardian found that the average monthly wage for an Indonesian working full-time on a plantation is $47, and poaching pangolin can earn 10 times as much.\nAn average pangolin will be sold by poachers for between $168 \u2013 $217 to shady middlemen. They will then sell this on for between $1,500 \u2013 $2,500. The scales of will sell for between $600 \u2013 $1,000 per kilo.\n20. 70% of Chinese citizens believe pangolin products have medicinal value.\nHowever, there\u2019s no scientific evidence that pangolin scales or meat, has any medicinal properties. In traditional Chinese medicine the pangolins blood and body parts have been used to treat anything from stomach disorders, to cancer and asthma. The Chinese government has even permitted some hospitals to use pangolin medicines as treatment for patients.\n21. In Nigerian traditional Yorubic medicine, pangolins are used to \u2018enable invisibility\u2019.\nA study found they are used to cure 42 conditions, from infertility, to stomach ulcers, to removing bad luck, or warding off evil forces.\n22. 70% of pangolins do not live for more than a year in captivity.\nCommercial breeding has proven to be difficult, as pangolins do not fair well in captivity, due to their highly specialized diets and extreme sensitivity to capture enduced stress.\n23. Sadly, all eight species may be on the brink of extinction.\nDue to the illegal hunting and poaching, the numbers of wild pangolin have dramatically declined. While their exact numbers are not known, the rarity of sightings in the wild, coupled with the massive volume illegal trade suggests they are rapidly close to extinction.\nPangolin Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification\nKingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Pholidota Family: Manidae Genera: Manis, Phataginus & Smutsia\nSpecies & Habitat List\nSpecies Name Habitat Chinese pangolin Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Hong Kong, India, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.

With their furry black and white coat and dark black patches, giant pandas get a lot of attention. Here are 5 important facts that you need to know about giant pandas.\nGiant pandas are known for their laziness and rest. They spend two thirds of their day eating and about a third sleeping and resting. It may not be a very exciting life, but it sure is a happy one! Giant pandas are omnivores, meaning that they only eat plant matter. About 1% of their diet includes fish, while the remaining 99% is made up of bamboo. However, their digestive systems are designed for carnivores and they can only absorb 20-30% of bamboo nutrients, giant pandas must eat up to about 44 pounds (20 kilograms) in bamboo to make up for poor nutrition. It usually takes a giant panda about 16 hours to eat that amount of bamboo. Even though they eat a lot, much of what giant pandas eat isn\u2019t digested properly. An adult giant panda, for example, can produce up to 62 pounds (28 kilograms) of droppings in just 24 hours! That\u2019s a lot to clean up for one panda. Don\u2019t be fooled by the fact that they\u2019re called bears; giant pandas don\u201dt hibernate! In cold weather, giant pandas do find shelter in caves or hollow trees, but don\u2019t fall asleep for the winter. This is because their digestive system is not build up of the fat reserves needed for hibernation since their diet consists mostly of bamboo. Giant pandas have a very good sense of smell that allows them to find bamboo easily by scent. However, male giant pandas also use this developed sense to avoid other males and find females to mate with in the spring.\nNow you know 5 amazing facts about these amazing animals!\nBibliography:\nEvanson, Tim. \u201cPanda \u2013 San Diego Zoo.\u201d https://www.flickr.com Flickr, a Yahoo Company, 8 August 2012.

A majority of these pandas live on a series of 62 reserves which, with help from The Nature Conservancy, China is attempting to weave together into a \u201cGiant Panda National Park.\u201d\nThe Chinese government has established more than 2,500 nature reserves throughout the country, but most aren\u2019t well funded or actively managed. And, until recently, China\u2019s strict landownership laws made it difficult for non-governmental organizations to play a significant role in land protection. But in 2008\u2014while maintaining ownership of all land\u2014the government opened the door for Chinese private entities to hold forestland use rights.\nNow, The Nature Conservancy is testing a model that will enable Chinese land trusts to protect and sustainably manage China\u2019s most important lands and waters, provide livelihood solutions for communities living near reserves, and create a mechanism to finance long-term reserve management through private contributions.\nOur goal is to create 10 land trust reserves together with our partners by the end of 2020. Over time, we aim to mobilize the private sector to protect China\u2019s land through voluntary action.\nThe Conservancy and others are also working to tie nearby villages into a sustainable economy so people won\u2019t have to venture into the reserves to hunt, fish or gather resources. To start, TNC is helping jump-start a guesthouse and an agriculture program that connects farmers to high-end markets for sustainable food products. It has already generated $300,000 through catalog orders for things like honey, eggs, chickens, sausage and persimmons.\nThis is just one of many ways that TNC is working with people to protect wildlife."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant Panda: The National Animal of China", "url": "https://helonational.com/national-animal-of-china/", "text": "The national animal of China is Giant Panda. The binomial nomenclature for Giant panda is Ailuropoda melanoleuca. It belongs to the family Ursidae which is actually the bear family.\nGiant Panda Facts:\nGiant Pandas now live in a few mountainous range in central China, in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and the Gansu provinces. The Pandas once lived in lower altitude regions, but population, forest clearing for farming, and other heavy development pushed Giant Pandas to mountainous regions only. The Giant Panda is a typical black and white bear, however, looks cuter than typical bears. The entire body of a panda is white while the eyes have the black patch of fur, the muzzle, legs, and shoulders are covered with black fur too. Giant Pandas possess quite large molar teeth along with strong jaws to crush bamboo easily. As like all other bears Giant Panda can be brutal even though they look cute. The average adult Panda male can attain a weight of 120 KG, on the other hands, females rarely reach 100 KG. Astonishing thing here is that the Pandas really sit in human position while eating something.\nWhy is the Giant Panda the national animal of China ?\nAs per a global conservation report in 2007, there were just 249 Giant Pandas in China under captivity while only a small count of 27 around the world. The endangered Pandas opt as national animal of China solely for the sake of its conservation. The black and white bears are very near to extinction, however, China holds about 90% of the population of the animal."}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Are Giant Pandas Endangered? \u2013 Fauna Facts", "url": "https://faunafacts.com/bears/are-giant-pandas-endangered/", "text": "Giant pandas are currently considered to be vulnerable species threatened by constant habitat loss, negative birth rate, poaching, and habitat fragmentation. Today, strong conservational efforts are being made to save the giant panda.\nGiant pandas are considered to be a national treasure in China, but they\u2019re also very popular in Vietnam and Myanmar. Since the 1960s, there have been conscious efforts to save the panda from the authorities. These efforts have proven to be successful and since 2016, pandas are no longer endangered but only vulnerable in China.\nAre Giant Pandas Still Endangered?\nPandas are currently considered to be vulnerable, but they used to be considered endangered until 2016. This changed with the IUCN 3.1 red list of endangered animals where pandas moved from endangered to vulnerable.\nThis change was made because the number of pandas in the wild and zoos has stabilized to an extent. This means that there are around 1800 pandas around the world, while this number used to be much lower in the past. It took a long-term effort to stabilize the number of pandas around the world.\nPandas became endangered primarily because of human interaction with pandas. Since the early 20th century, giant pandas used to be poached by locals in China and Myanmar. The goal of these poachers was to get the fur of pandas which was considered to be highly valuable and then sell the fur to foreigners or for the domestic market.\nThe problem was that this poaching continued for many decades, causing the panda populations to rapidly decrease in the coming decades. The authorities and nature conservation organizations only became aware of this after the 1960s when panda populations became critically low.\nLuckily, the conservation efforts are working. Today, pandas are considered to still be vulnerable, but that is an improvement from a few years ago when they were still endangered. This means that the populations of pandas are now stable and we\u2019ll luckily see the number of pandas increase.\nRelated Article: Do Giant Pandas Go Through Metamorphosis?\nWhy are Pandas Vulnerable?\nPandas are still vulnerable because of different reasons. The main ones include habitat loss and fragmentation, low birth rates, and poaching.\nThere are several reasons why pandas are still considered to be vulnerable nowadays. Even though there have been efforts to decrease the number of pandas that die and increase the number of pandas that are born, they are still vulnerable if these efforts don\u2019t continue in the future.\nHere are the main reasons why pandas are still considered vulnerable today.\n1. Habitat Loss and Fragmentation\nPerhaps the biggest and main reason why pandas are still considered to be vulnerable nowadays is because of habitat destruction. This might happen for several reasons \u2013 the most common one being deforestation, which the authorities do to increase the profits they get from selling the wood harvested where pandas live.\nPandas mainly live in bamboo forests and in the past, these forests were usually cut down because the authorities wanted to sell bamboo and other woods that were available in these forests.\nThis was a shortsighted tactic that hurt the panda populations around China and Myanmar. They lost their habitat or it got fragmented because of poor forest management tactics by the authorities that preferred industrialization as well as profits. It also caused a great decline in panda populations.\nRead Also: Are Giant Pandas White?\n2. Poaching\nAnother huge reason why pandas are today vulnerable is panda poaching. This was one of the primary reasons why panda populations started declining in the past. It was uncontrolled and brutal, as panda poachers looked to make great profits from selling panda fur and the products that were made of panda fur.\nThis was a phenomenon that happened mainly in the early 20th century and continued up until the 1960s. That\u2019s when the authorities started paying more attention to the declining numbers of this popular gentle bear in the wild.\nPerhaps the most important development to stop panda poaching came in 1988 when the Wildlife Protection Act was introduced worldwide, prohibiting panda poaching. This act brought bans and severe punishment to those who poached pandas, which stopped the hunting to a great extent.\nToday, panda poaching is not such a huge problem as it used to be, but it is still present. It is mainly illegal today, and if poachers are caught, they pay huge prices for their acts.\nRelated Article: What is the Color of Giant Panda?\n3. Negative Birth Rate\nAll three types of pandas also suffer from low birth rates since some panda populations are not as fertile as they used to be. The mortality started exceeding the birth rates, which caused the panda populations to decline rapidly around the world.\nThis problem was solved by actively breeding the pandas and allowing them the proper conditions to enable them to breed. This was seen both in zoos as well as in the wild, but it was far more successful in controlled environments such as the zoo where the breeders can easily control the conditions where pandas breed.\nAre Pandas Kept in Zoos?\nToday, giant pandas can be seen in many zoos around the world. In the past, this was not possible because of the low numbers of pandas around the world.\nGiant pandas were always popular animals among locals, especially in China. They have been kept in captivity since many hundred years ago. The keeping of pandas in zoos can be traced back to the Western Han Dynasty when pandas were first kept in zoos \u2013 since then, this trend has continued to be popular.\nToday, pandas can be found in zoos around the world. They are kept in zoos in France, Belgium, the UK, Austria, Finland, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands, China, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, the US, Mexico, and Canada.\nConservation Status Comparison with Other Bears\nGo Deeper: Are Bears Endangered?\nConclusion\nThe giant panda continues to be one of the most popular animals in the world. However, it is still considered to be a vulnerable animal because of many external reasons, and also because of low birth rates.\nLuckily, this animal is being saved by strong conservation efforts. Hopefully, we\u2019ll continue to see an increase in the number of pandas living around the world."}

The mountains are about 1200 \u2013 3500 meters above sea level and are covered with dense bamboo forest which is the giant panda\u2019s food.\nContact us via WeChat for any inquiry Scan ChinaTravel QR Code\nThe giant panda\u2019s natural habitat is a narrow corridor covering some mountain ranges including the Min mountains, the Qionglai Mountains, and the Qinling Mountains. There, the pandas enjoy the cool and moist climate they prefer. The areas cover an area of 20,000 square kilometers.\n80% of the pandas live in Sichuan province.\nTop panda\u2019s habitat Areas in China\nThe giant panda lives today on the eastern rim of the mountainous Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in Southwestern China, specifically in the areas of the Minshan and Qinling Mountains (the provinces of Gansu-Sichuan and Shaanxi, respectively). There, giant pandas enjoy the cool, moist climate they prefer, since perennially dense (thick as clouds) mists are interrupted only by the occasional torrential rain in summer, while winters are snowy, with the occasional hailstorm.\nCurrent Panda Habitat\nMinshan Mountains\nAlthough the giant panda habitats in the Minshan Mountains area (Sichuan and Gansu Provinces) are larger, viewed collectively, fewer giant pandas live in these habitats \u2013 only about 45% of the total population of giant pandas living in the wild, in fact, live in the Minshan Mountains area. There are 27 giant panda reserves in the mountains area to protect them.\nQinling Mountains\nThe remainder lives in the much smaller geographical area of the Qinling Mountains of Shaanxi Province. The mountains channel rainwater into the Yangtze River and Yellow River which are China\u2019s mother rivers. The warm rains support a variety of animals and plants. This area is home to a few hundred pandas and some other endangered species, like the golden monkey.\nGiant pandas that live in Qinling Mountains are called Qinling pandas, which is a subspecies of giant pandas of the Giant Panda.\nFoping and Changqing Nature Reserves have been established to protect them.\nGiant Pandas\u2019 Habitats are Shrinking\nThe giant panda once occupied almost all of southwestern to southeastern China as well as parts of neighboring Burma (Myanmar) and Vietnam. But their habitats are dramatically reduced because of over-farming.\nToday, the giant panda mainly lives on the eastern rim of the mountainous Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in Southwestern China, specifically in the areas of the Minshan and Qinling Mountains (the provinces of Gansu-Sichuan and Shaanxi, respectively).\nUnfortunately, neither of these two mountainous areas forms a single, contiguous panda habitat. Instead, it is broken up into small patches, with human-related patches in between them. A phenomenon referred to by panda experts as \"habitat fragmentation\".\nThe Best Climate For Giant Pandas\nGiant Pandas prefer cool and wet weather. Wild panda lives in the dense bamboo forest about 2600 -3500 meters above sea level. The mountains are covered with mists all year round, and the temperature is below 20 centigrade.\nThey like to move in the valleys and mountain slopes where bamboo grows well and they can easily hide from potential enemies. They may climb as high as 13,000 feet to feed on higher slopes in the summer season.\nGiant Panda Protection\nPandas are multiplying in captivity and are being released into the wild (the giant panda population of the Shaanxi Province/ Qinling Mountains area has increased by more than 10% in the past 20 years, according to WWF figures). More and more patches of human-related habitat are being reclaimed by the panda.\nThe most recent initiative in this regard is the creation of corridors, also known as Green Corridors, which connect the otherwise isolated patches of panda habitat. The total giant panda habitat of the Shaanxi Province/ Qinling Mountains area, including the Green Corridors, has increased by 80%, according to WWF figures.\nBest Places to See Giant Pandas in China\nThe best place to see the giant panda is in Sichuan. There are four panda bases in Sichuan which open to travelers.

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "What Are Giant Panda Habitats? (The 2 Types of Habitat)", "url": "https://bestofpanda.com/what-are-giant-panda-habitats/", "text": "Looking at rolling and playing cuddly giant pandas in a zoo is priceless. It shows how happy and comfortable they are in their surroundings. However, we are fully aware that zoos are not their natural homes. So in terms of the natural environment, what are giant panda habitats?\nHabitats are known to be the places where the animals like giant pandas live and reproduce. Knowing that factor, we can say that the natural habitats of the giant pandas are the forests. However, knowing only that is not enough to distinguish giant panda habitat from the others.\nNonetheless, we are here to help you with all the things that you need to know. You will learn about their shelter, their habitat map, and the temperature of their habitat. You will also know the reasons behind the loss of the giant panda habitat.\nWhat is a giant panda\u2019s shelter?\nWe can classify giant panda shelters into two: the natural habitats and the artificial habitats.\nNatural Habitats\nThese are the temperate rainforests of Min and Qin mountain ranges located in Central China. Inside these rainforests lie patches of thick understories of bamboo, which we call bamboo forests. Here, wild giant pandas live freely in their tree dens near the bamboo forests.\nArtificial Habitats\nThese include animal captivities like zoos and breeding centers. These types of accommodation for giant pandas exist in some countries around the world. Here, they live in close quarters and under human care. They use the pandas for tourist attractions and breed them in captivity.\nThe Giant Panda Habitat Map\nPhoto Source: ScienceDirect\nChina is the land of the giant pandas. In Central China, we can locate the Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. The Min (Minshan) and Qin (Qinling) mountain ranges lie in those provinces.\nMoreover, we can find the most popular giant panda captivities in Sichuan province. It is also the place with the most number of giant pandas. And those are the main reasons why they consider it as the Home of Giant Pandas.\nFurthermore, we can find different artificial habitats of the giant pandas across the globe. Some countries rent giant pandas from China and place them in their captivity. They take good care of them in a zoo to increase the number of visitors. Most importantly, to help them improve their conservation status.\nGiant Pandas Habitat Temperature\nGiant pandas prefer to live in cold places. For them to stay healthy, they have to live in places with temperatures below 25 degrees Celsius. If the temperature went higher than 25 degrees, it can cause heat stress.\nIn the wild, they live in a temperate rainforest. It has a cool temperature, not too hot and not too cold. Moreover, the giant pandas go up in the higher elevations of the mountain when it is getting hotter to feel the cooler temperatures. When it is too cold, they tend to go down the mountain to feel the balance temperature that they need.\n7 Facts About Giant Pandas Habitat\nThe giant panda habitat is commonly known as the bamboo forest. The preferred habitat temperature is no higher than 25 degrees Celsius. The giant panda den is usually made from hollowed-out logs or stumps of conifer trees. The giant natural habitats are only found in the temperate forest of Central China. The province of Sichuan is also known as the Home of the Giant Pandas. The habitat has an elevation of between 1,200 to 3,100 meters above sea level. The habitat is more likely shrouded by heavy clouds with torrential rain or dense mist.\nThe Giant Panda Habitat Loss\nPhoto Source: Green Matters\nHuman beings are the main cause of the loss of giant panda habitat. These include illegal logging, human invasion, and global warming.\nIllegal Logging\nIt is a problem in several rainforests. The trees and bamboo that serve as the natural habitat of the animals like pandas are cut down to make expensive furniture and more. The saddening part is that the trees will not grow instantly and it will take years for them to be a good shelter for the animals again.\nHuman Invasion\nModernization brought a lot of changes in the world, that includes the wildlife space invasion. Humans are using the space to build infrastructures for housing, business, and many others. Due to the human demand for space, wildlife space is taken for granted. And it destroys the natural habitat of the wild animals.\nGlobal Warming\nHumans keep on using different materials that contain harmful chemicals for the atmosphere. The continuous accumulation of harmful chemicals causes the depletion of the ozone layer. This results in abnormalities in the climate, such as the warming of the planet. This may result in a drought that is very dangerous to the natural habitat.\nHow can we help to preserve the giant panda habitat?\nPhoto Source: Intelligent Living\nWe should undo the things that harm the natural environment. If we cannot stop doing it due to important demand, we should at least compensate for the actions that we do. Here are the things that we should do to preserve the giant panda environment.\nReforestation\nWe can replant trees in different abused and damaged forests. In this way, the cut trees will have replacements. Then, the wildlife will continue to exist.\nClean and Green\nIf we stop using harmful or toxic materials, we can contribute to the prevention of pollution. Without pollution, we can avoid climate change. The environment will be good enough to support wildlife in the long run.\nDonation Drive\nWe can donate financial support to different existing and legal organizations. These organizations aim to protect wildlife and their environment. So even in the comfort of our homes, we can still contribute to nature conservation.\nConclusion\nIn this article, you had an overview of the giant panda habitat. You learned the facts that you need to know about the ideal panda habitat. Then you also learned the reasons why there is a loss of giant panda habitat.\nIf humans need space, animals need it the same way. For them, forests are so important. Without the forest, they will move away and will eventually die due to their inability to survive in a completely different environment.\nLet us show more care towards wildlife because they exist in this world to play their roles. We all have something to do for the improvement of this world. May we not endanger wildlife, just to get our satisfaction.\nWhat is your take on this article?

Enjoy these 50 fun facts in honor of the occasion.\nThe Zoo\u2019s first pandas, Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, were a gift from Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai to the American people in 1972 after First Lady Patricia Nixon mentioned how much she loved them at a dinner in Beijing, China, earlier that year. Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, the Zoo\u2019s adult panda pair, arrived in 2000. The pair and their cub will stay at the Zoo until 2023 through an agreement with China Wildlife Conservation Association. As few as 1,864 giant pandas live in their native habitat, while another 600 pandas live in zoos and breeding centers around the world. Pandas are no longer an endangered species, thanks in part to Smithsonian research! Scientists and conservationists have worked to restore the giant panda\u2019s habitat and increase breeding in human care. Giant pandas are still considered a \u201cvulnerable\u201d species. Though there are many theories, scientists are not certain why giant pandas have their distinctive black-and-white markings. Pandas are solitary animals but will vocalize during social interactions. They sometimes chirp, honk, bleat, chomp and bark. Pandas communicate through scent marking throughout their habitat and territory. Giant pandas have a \"pseudo thumb,\" formed by an elongated and enlarged wrist bone covered with a fleshy pad of skin, which helps them grasp bamboo. A giant panda's digestive system is more similar to that of a carnivore than an herbivore, and much of what pandas eat is passed as waste. To make up for their inefficient digestion, pandas need to consume a comparatively large amount of food \u2014 from 70 to 100 pounds of bamboo each day \u2014 to get all their nutrients. The Zoo's Department of Nutrition grows bamboo at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute. It also cuts bamboo from 20 stands located in the greater Washington, D.C., area. In the past, the Zoo accepted donations of bamboo from the public \u2014 but not anymore. A lot of science goes into feeding pandas and other animals! At the Zoo, giant pandas eat specially formulated nutritious biscuits, carrots, sweet potatoes and apples. Sweet potatoes are a favorite. Mei Xiang and Tian Tian\u2019s favorite treat is an apple juice-flavored fruitsicle. Xiao Qi Ji\u2019s favorite treat is a grape-flavored fruitsicle. On special occasions, such as birthdays, the pandas receive a huge frozen cake. Watch how one is made! Zoo staff never enter an enclosure with an adult giant panda. Like all bears, pandas are potentially dangerous. A panda\u2019s jaws are so strong, they have a bite strength similar to that of a lion! Giant pandas reach breeding maturity between 4 and 8 years old. They can have offspring until their early 20s. Mei Xiang gave birth to Xiao Ji QI at age 22, making her the oldest panda to give birth in the United States \u2014 and probably the second oldest in the world (that we know of). Giant pandas are fertile for less than three days each year. Smithsonian scientists developed ways to predict that window of time to improve chances for pregnancy. Mei Xiang and Tian Tian have never successfully mated. All their cubs were born via artificial insemination. Giant pandas can experience pseudopregnancy. A pseudopregnancy mimics a real pregnancy, but instead of giving birth at the end of it, a giant panda's hormones and behaviors return to normal. Mei Xiang is believed to have had at least six pseudopregnancies. Mei Xiang has given birth to four cubs that survived to adulthood: Tai Shan (male born in 2005), Bao Bao (female born in 2013), Bei Bei (male born in 2015), and Xiao Qi Ji (male born in 2020). Panda pregnancies last between 90 and 180 days, with an average pregnancy lasting 135 days. This wide variation in gestation occurs because the fertilized egg usually floats freely in the mother's uterus before it implants and begins developing. Bears in the wild, including giant pandas, give birth in dens on a bedding of twigs, often in hollows of large logs or trees, or in caves. At the Zoo, keepers provide a small enclosure for pandas to \u201cnest\u201d in. Although females may give birth to twins, usually only one cub survives. Newborn giant panda cubs are born pink, hairless and blind. They weigh 3-5 ounces and are about the size of a stick of butter. At 1/900th the size of its mother, a giant panda baby is the smallest mammal newborn relative to its mother's size, except for a marsupial, such as a kangaroo or opossum. Giant panda mothers lick their cubs to help them urinate and defecate in their first weeks of life. Giant panda mothers gently pick up cubs with their mouths to move them. Giant panda mothers will breathe heavily on their cubs to keep them warm and humid. After giving birth, giant panda mothers don\u2019t eat for a very long time! Their focus during this time is nurturing and protecting their cubs, rather than eating. Scientists have observed giant panda mothers in the wild go as long as one month without eating or drinking. After Xiao Qi Ji was born, Mei Xiang didn\u2019t eat for 12 days. External genitalia in bears doesn't develop until the bear is several months old. The best, and most reliable, way to determine a bear cub's sex is through DNA analysis. Scientists from the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute's Center for Conservation Genomics obtain the DNA from a gentle cheek swab during a cub\u2019s veterinary exam. Giant panda cubs may stay with their mothers for up to three years before striking out on their own. This means that a wild female, at best, can produce young only every other year. All giant panda cubs born at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo depart at around 4 years old to join breeding programs in China. Male pandas are not involved in the care of their cubs. Fathers and their cubs may never encounter each other in the wild. Scientists are not sure how long giant pandas live in the wild, but it is shorter than panda lifespan in zoos. They estimate that lifespan is about 15-20 years for wild pandas and about 30 years for those in human care. Chinese scientists have reported zoo pandas as old as 38. The Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo's giant panda Hsing-Hsing died at age 28 in 1999. The giant pandas at the Zoo have air-conditioned grottos and misting sprays in their outdoor enclosure so the pandas can stay outside all summer long, if they choose to. Giant pandas and red pandas are not as closely related as their names suggest. Red pandas are actually more closely related to raccoons than to giant pandas! The Smithsonian National Zoo's Giant Panda Cams have been viewed more than 100 million times. The Zoo\u2019s Giant Panda Cam program launched in 1999 and continues to this day, with about 40 cameras operating at any given time. Volunteers operate these cameras and choose the two best views to share with the public via the Giant Panda Cam. Smithsonian scientists have trained more than 1,500 students and professionals in China on techniques for studying and conserving giant pandas and their habitat. Smithsonian scientists have produced more than 150 papers on groundbreaking biological and ecological discoveries related to giant pandas. Smithsonian scientists created the framework for how pandas are bred to improve breeding success and genetic diversity. Zoos across the globe now use this same tool for other animals! The greatest threat to wild giant pandas is habitat loss. Smithsonian scientists and colleagues are working to restore bamboo forests in the Qinling mountains of China. Climate change threatens the giant panda\u2019s habitat. Everyone can help make a difference by using water and energy more efficiently."}

Most people in the world are able to recognise a panda. However, despite its popularity, the panda is an endangered animal, and rare in the wild.\nThis article has been written to help you find out more about these gentle giants. At the end of the article you\u2019ll also find out 10 amazing panda facts for kids.\nYou can find out more about bears here: Bears: The Ultimate Guide\nBe sure to watch the video of giant pandas in the wild!\n(Read about more endangered animals here.)\nGiant Panda, Panda Bear, Or Just Panda?\nAll three names are used to refer to the same species of animal; the giant panda can also be called a \u2018panda bear\u2019, or just \u2018panda\u2019.\nIt\u2019s up to you which name to use!\nThe \u2018giant\u2019 part can be added to differentiate between giant pandas and red pandas. (Red pandas are cat-sized animals, and are not members of the bear family).\nAre Pandas Bears?\nPandas are bears. They are members of the Ursidae family, which also includes polar bears and grizzly bears. Pandas are the least common type of bear.\nLike all other bears, pandas are mammals. This means that they have fur and they give birth to live babies. Being a mammal also means that pandas take care of their young and feed them until they\u2019re strong enough to take care of themselves.\nMother pandas look after their young until they are around 1 and a half to 2 years old.\nQinling Pandas\nA subspecies of giant panda, called Qinling pandas, have contrasting dark and light brown coats, rather than the black and white coats of their giant panda relatives.\nWhere Do Pandas Live?\nPandas live in bamboo forests on the hills and mountains of central China. They used to live in lowland areas of China too, but the spread of humans caused pandas to move to higher ground.\nTypical panda habitat is high up in the mountains, where the climate is cold, wet and misty.\nWhat Do Pandas Eat?\nPandas differ from other bears in that they are largely herbivorous. Their diet consists almost entirely of bamboo stalks.\nBamboo is not rich in nutrients, and pandas have to eat large quantities of bamboo every day. They can spend 12 hours a day just eating!\nPandas have specially adapted wrist bones for holding bamboo stalks, and strong jaw muscles for grinding up the fibrous plant. (The panda\u2019s round face is due to the size of their jaw muscles.) Pandas also have large molars to help them chew bamboo, and their throats have a special lining to prevent bamboo splinters getting stuck. Pandas don\u2019t need to drink water because the bamboo shoots provide them with all that they need.\nHow Big Are Pandas?\nFull grown pandas are 2-3 feet tall (1.2metres) when on all fours, and around 4-6 feet long. Male pandas weigh about 250 pounds, females are smaller and weigh around 220 pounds.\nPanda Behaviour\nPandas are territorial, and use scent and claw marks on trees to define their territory. Pandas only come together during the breeding season. The males pay no part in raising the young.\nDespite their size, pandas are good climbers and can also swim well. Although not aggressive creatures, pandas have been known to occasionally attack humans.\nWhy Are Pandas Endangered?\nPandas have been an endangered species for a many years. This is because much of the panda\u2019s natural habitat has been cleared to make way for farms and other development. Once there were wild pandas living throughout China, but now they are restricted to the mountains.\nHow Many Pandas Are Left In The Wild?\nIt is difficult to know exactly how many pandas are left in the wild, but the number is very small. It is estimated that there are only between 1,500 and 3,000 pandas living in the wild.\nHappily, conservation efforts seem to be paying off. Numbers of wild pandas are said to be increasing.\nYou can watch a film of pandas in the wild below.\n10 Amazing Panda Facts For Kids\nPandas have dark skin patches and pink skin patches, which relate to the black and white areas of fur. Pandas have an extremely good sense of smell. The Chinese name for panda is \u2018Da Xiong Mao\u2019, which means \u201cgiant bear cat\u201d. There are two subspecies of giant panda: the giant panda, and the brown and grey Qinling panda. Pandas don\u2019t hibernate in winter. Pandas are endangered because their habitat has been cleared for development and farms. Pandas eat bamboo and live in bamboo forests. Pandas can climb trees and swim. Pandas live to be about 15-20 years old in the wild, and can live about 30 years in captivity. The panda is a symbol of peace in Chinese culture.\nImagine Seeing A Panda In The Wild\u2026\n\u201cYou are a zoologist (an animal expert), and you have been invited to study pandas in the wild. You have walked far into the Chinese jungle. It is hard work pushing through the tall, tough bamboo plants. Bamboo is the main food of the panda, so you know you are in the right place. Suddenly you hear something. You duck down behind a bush. Moving slowly between the bamboo stalks is a large creature. It stops, and looks around. Although you have never seen one in the wild before, it is very familiar. The panda, with its black and white body and black eye patches, is unmistakeable. Although there are only very few pandas left in the wild, people all around the world know what they look like. You hope that your studies will help this beautiful animal.\u201d\nPandas In Chinese Legend\nThere is a special story about pandas in Chinese history. Legend says that pandas used to be only white, without any black on them. Once there was a small girl who tried to save a baby panda from a leopard. So the leopard attacked the girl instead and killed her. The baby panda was saved, but the pandas were really sad. When they went to the girl\u2019s funeral, the pandas wore armbands of black ashes. When they wiped their eyes and hugged each other, they left smears of black ashes. This is where the black on their faces and bodies comes from.\nDiscover More with Active Wild\nEndangered Animals\nYou can find out more about endangered animals on this page: Endangered Animals List with Pictures & Facts\nBear Pages\nRelated Animal Pages"}

(The 5 Deadliest Predators)", "url": "https://bestofpanda.com/do-giant-pandas-have-predators/", "text": "Normally, giant pandas are gentle and peaceful animals. It might make you wonder, \u201cDo such adorable animals have predators?\u201d After all, who would want to hurt a cute little panda right?\nDue to their large size, fully grown giant pandas have very few predators. To name a few, we have jackals, snow leopards, jaguars, and wild dogs as their potential predators.\nHave you ever wondered, if there are other predators besides these animals? And who is their greatest enemy?\nIn this article, we\u2019ll carefully examine each of their predators and how do pandas defend themselves against them. Keep reading to find out!\nWho are the Predators of Giant Pandas?\nThere are not many natural predators of giant pandas. However, they can be attacked by humans, jackals, leopards, wild dogs, yellow-throated martens, and jaguars for various reasons. It is usually the cubs of giant panda cubs that are in the most vulnerable situation.\nBelow is the list of major predators of giant pandas.\n\u25cf Humans:\nImage Source: Blogpost\nHumans are considered the most dangerous predators of giant pandas. The illegal hunting of giant pandas by humans for their fur and meat has been a great threat to the population of giant pandas. Apart from that, human activities such as deforestation and land encroachment are also responsible for the declining numbers of giant pandas.\n\u25cf Wild Dogs:\nWild dogs are known for attacking the cubs of giant pandas. They are even capable of killing adult giant pandas for food.\n\u25cf Snow Leopards:\nSnow leopards are animals with great strength and power. They usually attack panda cubs with the help of their sharp teeth and sharp claws. Mostly active, snow leopards feed on their preys for several days. They are a danger to pandas mostly because they reside in the same mountainous region of central China.\n\u25cf Jackals:\nJackals are scavengers that are well adapted for hunting because of their long legs and curved canine teeth. They usually hunt large prey such as antelope, gazelles and livestock, but are also known to hunt baby giant pandas.\n\u25cf Yellow-throated Martens:\nImage Source: Zoo Chat\nNative to Asia, yellow-throated martens are muscular and strong animals. There are many cases where panda cubs are either wounded or killed by the yellow-throated martens.\nWho is the Greatest Enemy of Pandas and Why?\nGiant pandas have very few enemies due to their massive size. They cannot be easily attacked by other animals. However, human beings are the biggest enemies of pandas. Although hunting is banned, humans indulge in the illegal hunting of pandas for their own greed. The pelt (fur) of pandas and their meat is sold in the market for money by people.\nBesides that, the destruction of the natural habitat of giant pandas also affects their population. Destruction of the bamboo forests results in both the loss of habitat and the food of pandas. Hence, human beings are the biggest threat to giant pandas.\nHow Do Giant Pandas Fight their Predators?\nAlthough giant pandas are gentle animals, they can definitely fight back if attacked by their predators to protect themselves. Below are the significant ways in which giant pandas defend themselves.\n\u25cf Climbing:\nImage Source: Science News\nGiant pandas are excellent climbers. They use their climbing skills to save themselves from their enemies. Do you know that giant pandas are also rapid runners? Although lazy, they run rapidly in case of any danger.\n\u25cf Swimming:\nImage Source: The Cuteness Code\nSwimming is another technique used by giant pandas to escape their predators. Despite weighing approximately 150 pounds, pandas can easily swim to save themselves from their foes.\n\u25cf Physical Strength:\nImage Source: Reader\u2019s Digest Canada\nPandas are massive animals with incredible physical strength. They have powerful jaws and sharp teeth to give a deadly bite to their predators. Therefore, predators usually attack panda cubs as they are easy to catch.\nDo Pandas have Prey?\nPandas\u2019 diet mainly consists of bamboos and grass. However, they do occasionally eat meat. Therefore, giant pandas do have a few preys like insects, birds, rodents, and carrion.\nInterestingly, it\u2019s because of the shortage of prey that giant pandas lost their taste for meat. Therefore, despite being carnivorous, pandas feed primarily on plants.\nDo Giant Pandas Eat Other Animals?\nThe ancestors of giant pandas were mainly meat-eaters. It is only some million years ago that pandas turned vegetarian. One of the main reasons for this shift is the growth of massive bamboo forests in central China.\nGiant pandas are plant-eaters to a great extent. They love eating bamboos and can eat 20 to 40 pounds of bamboo every day. You will be amazed to know that bamboo stalks amount to 99% of their diet. However, the digestive systems of giant pandas are like that of carnivorous animals. Therefore, they find it challenging to digest bamboos.\nIt is occasionally that giant pandas feed on insects, birds, and rodents despite having sharp teeth and an excellent capacity to digest meat.\nHas a panda ever killed a human?\nPandas are capable of attacking and killing humans. However, the chances of a panda killing a human are very low. They are likely to attack people only when they feel threatened by them. They can also attack humans out of frustration. For example, there are possibilities of a panda attacking you if you try to disturb them while they are sleeping.\nThere are also some instances of zoos where pandas grab people\u2019s legs or their jackets through the bars. However, the chances of causing harm on purpose are rare.\nNevertheless, you should not tease pandas unnecessarily as they are wild animals. Make sure you don\u2019t approach unsupervised pandas for your safety.\nConclusion\nTo sum up, giant pandas do not have many predators. There are many reasons why giant pandas have a few natural predators. The first and foremost reason is their large size, making it difficult for their predators to attack them. However, the cubs of giant pandas are vulnerable to attacks from lions, snow leopards, and wild dogs.\nNonetheless, human beings are a significant threat to giant pandas. In fact, humans are said to be the biggest enemies of giant pandas. Destructive human activities such as illegal hunting and deforestation are dangerous for giant pandas.\nBut giant pandas have their own mechanism of dealing with their enemies. There is no doubt that pandas love sleeping and leading a peaceful life, but they can fight back their enemies when in danger. They use their physical strength as well as their climbing and swimming skills to escape their predators. Don\u2019t be fooled by their weight, as pandas are also great runners.\nAlthough giant pandas mainly feed on bamboo, they can prey on insects, birds such as peacocks, and rodents occasionally. In other words, you can say that giant pandas have both predators and prey. With this, we hope that this article answers all your questions related to giant pandas and their predators. Don\u2019t forget to share your feedback in the comments. Thank You!"}

Pandas can be spotted in other regions of the globe as well. However, they have been declining to almost extinction status.\nPandas also named as big bear cat in Chinese, is one of the most amazing animals on the face of the earth. With absolute cuteness and adorability, the panda is the most endearing wildlife across the globe today.\nGiant pandas given the name based on their exceptionally massive girth as compared to other bears. Panda possesses a characteristic white and black hue which provides a camouflaging feature under its natural habitat.\nAs a stellar attracted animal species, pandas have amazingly exciting specifics that make it the most magnificent treasured animal of all times. We will explore the top 31 fun facts about pandas in this article.\n31 Interesting Facts About Pandas\nHere are the top interesting facts about pandas covering all aspects of their lives:\n1. Massive Panda Size Damp and dewy thickly populated forests are the best residing place for this scarce mammal. According to the National Geographic, the humongous girth of giant pandas owes to their size weighing about 136 kg with 5-6 feet in height.\n2. Endangered Panda The next fact about pandas is that there has been a significant drop of species of panda all over the earth, which pushed this bamboo bear a near extinction status (currently Vulnerable as per IUCN classification), with just 1600 pandas in the world alive to date. A minority of giant pandas are held in reserves in safari parks of the Western Domain.\n3. Gobbler Panda It is estimated that an average panda eats for about half a time during 24 hours in a day (almost 16 hours). The chubby pandas are usually found eating most of the times. Since pandas keep bamboos as their primary source of nutrition; which lacks the high calories content? So, they eat a lot to fulfil the nourishment of their huge body.\n4. Panda in Olympics Another interesting fact about panda is that in Olympics of 2008, Panda was one of the animals represented and designated as mascots of Olympics among other four animals namely Fish, Fuwa, Tibetian Antelope, and Sand Martin.\n5. Controversial Classification The matter of putting pandas under appropriate classification has been quite disagreeable among biologists. Though relatively similar to bears, they have been classified with raccoons also. However, they were finalized to be grouped along with bears specifically closely related to bears of the South American region.\n6. Bamboo Digesting Stomach Big bamboo eaters need a big bamboo digesting stomach to grasp hard bamboo. The stomach of pandas is correctly able to digest the tough bamboo wood with possessing more muscles than a normal animal stomach. The inner surface of the stomach has the superficial protection of mucus layer to prevent the stomach lining from rupture by the sharp fragments of bamboos.\n7. Pandas Are Loners The song \u201cI\u2019m so lonely I have nobody\u201d is the best fit for pandas. Panda likes to live alone. According to the National Geographic, the presence of another panda is strongly disliked in the territory by the owner panda. However, it would end up in hitting dispute if the two get into a close encounter.\n8. Marking Territory Pandas like to mark their land of ownership by accentuating the limits through a sticky, waxy secretion. The secretion acts as a marker for territory identification even recognized by other pandas. This secretion is used by pandas for identification of gender and purpose of recognizing the social status of other giant pandas.\n9. Presence of Pseudo-Bones Pandas have an enhanced ability to grasp the food with their paws due to enlarged wrist bones that act as an extra thumb for handling the bamboos. This extra bone of their wrist is termed as pseudo-bone as not being an original thumb but an extension of the wrist of front paws.\n10. Maximum Bite Potency Being carnivores, pandas can exhibit extreme bite power more than any other carnivore. This extreme bite force in pandas owes to the presence of strong muscles meant for chewing hard bamboo layers. Panda has an opposing thumbs like Gorillas which helps them to grip bamboo stalks efficiently.\n11. Carnivore That Eats Plants Though carnivorous, pandas primarily like to feed on bamboo sprouts and leaves. Since bamboo does not run away as foods of most carnivores do, it suits the lazy, sluggish nature of pandas. The other panda diet consists of eating other small animals, fish and other vegetation but eating bamboo always remains the all-time favorite.\n12. Fertility Period In Female Pandas Naturally, female pandas ovulate just once a year and give birth to two panda cubs after an incubation period of almost five months. In the uninhabited environment, only the stronger baby pandas survive. However, in relief centres of panda\u2019s rehabilitation, the survival chances for both the cubs are increased.\n13. Panda\u2019s Reproductive Potential Though being considered extinct, pandas bear a fantastic reproductive potential. It could be evidenced by their presence on the earth for more than 20 million years. Now being confined to just certain parts of Cental China, earlier they were supposed to be present all across the Chinese territory.\n14. Panda\u2019s Broad Teeth The carnivorous pandas bear wide and horizontal molar teeth. This makes them able to chop down the shoots and wood of the bamboo tree. In a total of possessing 42 teeth that arrive in two sets in their lifespan (similar to humans), giant pandas can easily peel off the bamboo in less than a minute!\n15. Panda & Bamboo Love Pandas have a massive crush on bamboos. It could starve out in the absence of bamboo trees. The life cycle of bamboos is quite long extending over a span of almost 120 years. This makes it difficult for pandas to survive without bamboos.\n16. Hydrophilic Nature Apart from bamboos, pandas also have a strong fondness to live in close vicinity of water. Pandas are remarkable swimmers and live delightfully in the presence of water. That is the reason they are found in dense, bamboo forests of Chinese wild making it an ideal habitat for their survival.\n17. I\u2019m A Shy Buddy Pandas are introvert buddies! They do not like mingling up quickly and require time to come at ease. This makes them a shy and resilient animal usually confided from other species and humans.\n18. The Best Climbers Pandas are very good at climbing heights. With an ability to climb heights of about 12000-13000 feet, giant pandas love to make their homes on slopes of mountains for feeding purposes, during the summer seasons.\n19. Panda Captivity Birth Under confinement, female pandas give birth to more panda cubs as compared to when living in the wild environment. Panda mothers give birth to twins at an increased rate under stay in rehabilitation centres.\n20. Panda Loves Metals Panda is believed to be fond of licking metals like iron and copper. Under captivity, any food given to them in utensils of metals like iron or copper, they seem to relish it by cleaning it up with the help of tongue.\n21. Panda Rule: More Food & More Dumps! Since pandas are big eaters, it is expected that they would produce a lot of waste material. About 10- 30 kg of waste is produced by an average panda, in a single day. Scientists have been using the smell of wastes to track down pandas in the wild areas.\n22. Panda\u2019s Lined Neck Pandas feed on sharp bamboo parts. Naturally, pandas possess a distinctive covering over their throat for protection against sharp edges and splinters of bamboo trees.\n23. Why Panda Fur Black & White? Pandas possess alternative colored skin with superficial fur black and white. The white fur blends in snowy habitats and black fur create a masking impact in forests along with heat retaining capability during the winter season. This adaptation is very similar to how tigers camouflage with their stripes.\n24. Reliance On Spatial Memory Pandas are believed to rely more the memory regarding the judgment of location somewhat depending on visual memory. Pandas do not have a strong vision, and their memory is primarily based upon relying on spatial memory ( i.e., judgement by the ability to remember the location)\n25. Expensive For Zoos About 100 pandas are believed to be living in different zoos of the world today. Pandas may cost up to millions of dollar to be retained in zoos which is 2-5 times more expensive than keeping elephants in zoos. Giant pandas are found in only scare numbers in zoos of the US having retaining fees of almost million dollars per annum.\n26. Penalty For Panda Carnage Being regarded as a national treasure in China, regulations are firmly followed in case of any killing and slaying of panda species. About 20 years ago, the penalty for killing pandas was a death sentence. However, nowadays the punishment has been reduced to an imprisonment of 20 years.\n27. Types of Pandas According to biological classification, there are 3 types of pandas namely the red panda (Ailurus fulgens), the black and white giant panda, and the smaller brown and fawn sub-species the Qinling panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca qinlingensis). Some argue that the red panda is loosely related to raccoons.\n28. Panda\u2019s Walking Fact Pandas are similar to bears and human beings when it comes to the walking style. The soles of their feet touch ground wholly in contrast to other animals like horses, dogs and cats which usually walk on the tips of their feet. They are termed as plantigrade mammals.\n29. Do Panda Hibernate? Pandas do not hibernate unlike the most other types of bears in the bear family. Before the winter months start, pandas typically migrate from their mountain caves to places where warmer temperatures prevail. That is where they would find pounds of bamboo to chomp all winter long!\n30. Why Panda in WWF Logo? In 1961, the British natural history expert and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) founder Sir. Peter Scott got an idea of using female panda from the London Zoo as the logo for WWF. As the black-patched eyes of the panda looked very appealing and easy to draw with just black and white colors, the WWF decided to keep panda in their logo since then.\n31. Panda Cub Facts Interestingly at birth, panda cubs are hairless and typically a size of a stick of butter. The mother panda carries the cub with her paws and cradles it on her chest.\nPandas are an amazingly adaptive animal with excellent evolutionary potential. They have been surviving the odds of the earth for billions of years. Their struggle for existence always intrigues that whether the decline in their species owes to man-made interventions or it is just a part and process of natural phenomena?\nProbably, time would reveal the tale, but this beautifully innocent creature need to be seen on the face of the earth!\nOut of all these interesting facts about pandas, which one do you like the most?

As for weight, they can range from 220-330 pounds (100-150kg). Like most animals though, the males are usually larger than the females.\nFun Fact: A newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter.\nFur:\nGiant Pandas typically have black fur around around their eyes and on their ears, legs, shoulders, and around their muzzle somewhat , while he remaining parts of their body are coated in white fur. Their thick and wooly coat helps keep them warm when needed, especially when they live in their cool mountain homes.\nDiet:\nGiant Pandas are omnivorous, meaning they eat plants and animals (usually smaller). Its diet mainly consist of eating bamboo. In fact, they eat bamboo for about 12 hours each day. This adds up to about 28 pounds (12.5kg) of bamboo per day. However, they do occasionally eat small rodents, fish, and even eggs.\nTypical Lifespan:\nThis mammal typically live 14 to 20 years in the wild. In captivity, it is possible for a giant panda to live up to 35 years.\nReproduction:\nMating Season: March-May (Generally Spring)\nGestation Period: 95-160 days\nLitter Size: 1-2 cubs\nFun Fact: Female Pandas are only able to become pregnant for 2-3 days each mating season.\nCommunication and Behavior:\nPandas may be part of the bear family, but they definitely don\u2019t roar the way most bears do. They actually \u201cbleat,\u201d similar to how a lamb or goat would \u201cbleat.\u201d This is a friendly sound. Pandas also honk, huff, bark, growl, and more. These pandas also use scent glands to communicate. They even do \u201chandstands\u201d so that the scent mark can reach farther up a tree.\nGiant Pandas are relatively lonesome creatures. They spend most of the day simply eating and sleeping. They are often seen eating in a relaxed sitting posture, or simply sleeping up in a tree. These pandas can also be very territorial over their bamboo forest and also tend to avoid other pandas, so when two pandas happen to cross paths, the confrontation is very friendly to say the least. They\u2019ll usually growl and sweat, lunge at each other, and perhaps even bite each other. There are exceptions when it comes to mating season, and when it\u2019s between a mother and her cubs.\nHabitat and Range:\nWild pandas live only in remote mountainous regions in central China. They usually live in old-growth conifer forests containing the high and small bamboo forests that are usually cool and wet, just as they like it.\nConservation Status:\nThe Giant Panda population is currently considered to be vulnerable of extinction. On a positive note though, this is better than before, when they were considered endangered. They are still at risk with their populations being so low though. One of the main reasons that the panda populations are as low as they are is due to habitat destruction. It\u2019s also predicted that climate change will eliminate over 35% of the panda\u2019s bamboo habitat in the next 80 years. However, the Chinese government has actively worked to restore and protect bamboo habitat, and it has shown positive results, hence the reason their conservation status is now \u201cVulnerable\u201d rather than \u201cEndangered.\u201d\nResources:\nGiant Panda \u2013 Wikipedia\nThe IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\nGiant Panda | WWF\nLife Span of a Giant Panda | Animals\nGiant Panda | National Geographic\nGiant Panda | San Diego Zoo Animals & Plants\nPandas: Facts & Information | Giant Panda Images \u2013 Live Science\nGiant Panda Bear Facts | Animal Fact Guide\nGiant Panda | Species | WWF"}

[Must Read]", "url": "https://bestofpanda.com/what-are-the-body-parts-of-a-giant-panda/", "text": "When it\u2019s something as cute as a giant panda bear, you can\u2019t just stop until you know everything, right? You\u2019re wanting to know almost everything about them, from their food, hobby, and even their body parts.\nHave you ever wondered, what are the body parts of a panda bear?\nHere\u2019s a short answer \u2013 A giant panda has all the body parts of a typical mammal such as eyes, mouth, teeth, nose, snouts, ears, legs, arms, fingers, and tails.\nNow that you know a little about it, maybe your next question now is \u2013 Why do pandas need this body parts for survival? Let\u2019s dive in to know more!\nWhat Are The Body Parts of the Panda?\nThe giant panda has all body parts that any animal would generally have. Their body parts have evolved through times. Moreover, these body modification were brought by their chosen life style. which is to change their diet from carnivorous to herbivorous state.\nThe giant pandas are known to be giant. But, are they really that giant? Well, let\u2019s look into this.\nPhoto Source: LINE\nTypically, the giant panda\u2019s body is 120 to 180 cm long. However, they are only 54 to 81 cm tall \u2013 which is half of the average human height. They are not as small as cats and not as large as elephants, too. But, they have the perfect size to cuddle with.\nMoreover, the giant pandas have different body parts with particular functions to make them live and survive the life they are living. They also have adapted a more sluggish and lazy lifestyle.\nA major reason behind this lifestyle is their dietary modifications. They could have gained higher amount of energy if they would fed on meat, but they chose not to do so. Therefore, to live and survive with sufficient amount of energy, they have to eat more bamboo and develop a more idle lifestyle.\nOn the latter part, we will have a broader look at all body parts and physical features. We will also talk about their significance for the lifestyle of a giant panda. So, let\u2019s dig deeper.\nWhat Are the Physical Features of the Giant Panda?\nIf we have a look at the physical features of a giant panda, we will find the following important parts:\nI. Giant Pandas Have Tail\nPhoto Source: Flickr\nDo giant pandas even have tails? It\u2019s a question that might take you by surprise. But it is important and imperative to be answered. So, let\u2019s see if they actually have tails, and if they have, why didn\u2019t we notice it before?\nThe giant panda tail is often overlooked because of the fact that it is very small in size as compared to the overall size of the giant panda body. It is around 4 to 6 inches in length, while the giant panda body weighs around 331 lbs.\nHence, on such a heavy body, a few inches long tail is very likely to be hidden out. Moreover, the fur on the giant panda\u2019s body makes it more camouflaged.\nIf we speak of the color and how it looks like, the giant panda tail is white in color, which makes it somewhat visible and distinct on a black and white patterned body fur. In shape, it is essentially round and sticks close to the body to protect the gland that is responsible for the production of panda scent.\nWhy Do Giant Pandas Need A Tail?\nThe purpose of the giant panda tail is to cover the circumanal glands that are present near the anal region of the giant panda body. Nature has made everything for a purpose. No part of this animal body is futile or meant for nothing at all.\nFurthermore, the purpose of these glands is to produce urine and excrete harmful substances. The same gland is very important to help giant pandas mate with their partners by finding them by their scent that is released by this gland. Also, the small tail tends to stay close to the body, and offers full protection to the glands.\nII. Giant Pandas Have Thumbs\nPhoto Source: Explore\nThe next important body part that is obvious in any mammal\u2019s body is the thumb. It can be one thumb or more. But what does a giant panda have in store for us in regards to its thumbs?\nTo break it to you, giant pandas definitely have thumbs to hold stuff, particularly bamboo and other eatables. A careful look at the giant panda hands indicates that they have opposable thumbs, much like humans.\nHow Many Thumbs Does A Giant Panda Have?\nThe giant pandas have two thumbs that are essentially opposite to each other. They have a natural thumb, five digits, and another pseudo thumb \u2013 or a sesamoid wrist bone that is grown to act as a thumb.\nTypically, the sesamoid bone present in the giant panda wrists is considered as the second thumb. This is the evolution that makes the giant panda bears hold bamboo and other things quite easily.\nWhy Do Panda Bears Need A Thumb?\nAlthough giant pandas were carnivores, in the beginning, they evolved out to be bamboo-eating animals. Considering it is bamboo, they needed strong gripping abilities to allow them to hold it.\nHence, to make it easier for them, they were evolved with opposable thumbs that can hold the stalks, fruits, vegetables, and other food items quite strongly. Since the digits are small, the two opposable thumbs play a very vital role in holding things.\nIII. Giant Pandas Don\u2019t Have Whiskers\nPhoto Source: ORIGO\nWhiskers look good on cats or red pandas. Have you ever wonder, if do giant pandas have whiskers too? Well, this doesn\u2019t sound very comfortable on such fluffy and adorable animals.\nIf you are not comfortable with this notion, well, you are a true panda lover. Giant pandas actually don\u2019t have whiskers \u2013 just as you were wondering. Instead, they have hair on their snouts, but they are non-sensory.\nThe fact that the snout hair has no sensory capabilities, we cannot quite call them whiskers. Because for whiskers, it is essential that they show some sensory or navigating activity. But the point is, do mammals have whiskers? Well, I don\u2019t thinks so.\nHence, we can\u2019t really call the giant panda snout hairs as whiskers but simple hair. Isn\u2019t it make them more adorable?\nWhy Panda Bears Don\u2019t Need Whiskers?\nThe point here is that since they don\u2019t have whiskers, consequently, they don\u2019t have the sensory capabilities to move around and protect themselves, then what is the alternative for them to protect themselves and move around?\nWell, there are quite a few reasons as to why don\u2019t they need whiskers. First things first, whiskers are sensory body parts that are meant to help in navigation and safety. Mostly the animals that have fast movements, such as cats, etc., need whiskers.\nHowever, giant panda bears are very indolent and slow-paced animals. Even if they can sense something as close as to their snouts, it is impossible that they run away from their predator.\nTherefore, they need a mechanism that could help them sense danger from afar. This would allow them to make way for their protection before the danger is so near that they are unable to fight it off. Smart work, dear pandas!\nWhat Do Pandas Use To Sense Their Environment?\nNow that\u2019s something we call concern. And your concern is a hundred and ten percent, right. But to ease out anxiety, giant pandas have a full-fledged mechanism to protect themselves from any danger in the surrounding environment.\nThe panda bears have a very good sense of smell that plays a very important role in protecting them from harm and dangers. It allows giant pandas smell things from a very large distance. Therefore, if they smell danger or any other animals in the vicinity, they tend to change their direction and hide somewhere else.\nMoreover, they use the same ability to express emotions. The fellow panda bears are able to recognize and sense each other presence through this same mechanism. The circumanal gland that the tail protects has the property of producing a particular scent along with the excreta.\nWhen the fellow panda bears sense the smell, they try to navigate closer to it until they reach and meet with another. This same process allows the giant panda bears to mate for the continuity of their species. How cute and lovely!\nIV. Giant Pandas Have Belly Buttons\nOne of the common features of a mammal is their belly button. And it is very evident among giant pandas. You might have seen many giant panda stuff toys bearing belly buttons. Let\u2019s know what these are for!\nThe giant pandas have belly buttons that mostly remain veiled inside their thick fluffy black and white fur. However, the point of significance is that they have bellybuttons like all mammals. It means that giant pandas are placental animals, and they supply food and nutrients to their babies in the womb through the umbilical cord.\nThe belly buttons are only the remains of the umbilical cords. Physiologically and anatomically, the giant panda belly buttons are quite insignificant. However, they have been quite vital in designating and determining the giant pandas as mammals due to the fact that, like other mammals, they also possess belly buttons.\nHow Do Pandas Break Their Umbilical Cord?\nThe panda cubs have umbilical cords in place of bellybuttons when they are born. However, soon after their birth, the panda mothers bite off their cords that make a scar for a while, and later we term it as the belly button.\nMoreover, the reason for biting off is that the babies are very small, tiny, and fragile. Therefore, it is essential at that point to bite off any extra things of the body. Otherwise, they might get infected and cause trouble for the babies.\nV. Giant Pandas Have Sharp Teeth\nOne of the fascinating facts about giant pandas is definitely their sharp teeth. At first, it sounds and seems like a shock and might upset you for a while. But when you research and study it, I am pretty sure you won\u2019t get to hate the cute panda bears.\nThere is no denying the fact that the teeth might be quite intimidating to look at the giant panda jaws, but they don\u2019t make them any less adorable. Or do they? Well, they never did in y case.\nProvided that they are peace-loving animals, it really doesn\u2019t matter if they have sharp teeth or they are teeth less. So, how many teeth do they have \u2013 32 like humans? Let\u2019s find out.\nThe giant pandas typically have 42 teeth (definitely more than humans) that consist of incisors, very sharp canines, large surfaced premolars, and molars. But do they need so many teeth just to chew on some tree stalks?\nDefinitely no. They have these teeth because of the fact that anatomically and metabolically, they are carnivorous animals. The fact that it is all controlled by genes, environmental factors don\u2019t seem to do much in this case.\nFurthermore, their teeth are essentially in the same way as other carnivorous mammals. The upper and lower jaws essentially follow the same patterns and contain all pairs of incisors, canines, premolars, and molars.\nWhat Does A Giant Panda Teeth Look Like?\nA one-word and straightforward answer that would do justice with the look of giant panda teeth will be \u201cscary.\u201d However, there is nothing exactly to be scared of. After all, they are cute, adorable, friendly, and very peaceful.\nIf we talk about what the giant panda jaws look like, they have very small incisors in the middle. Then there are two canines that are very sharp and strong. Next to the canines, they have premolars and molars.\nMoreover, the purpose of all this set of teeth both on the upper and lower jaws, is to make sure that the giant pandas chew the food (bamboo) properly. Since their bodies are metabolically carnivorous, they need to chew the bamboo properly to help them digest it.\nWhy Do Panda Bears Have Canine Teeth?\nWhat are carnivorous typically recognized from? They are canines, of course! As we all know that giant pandas are carnivores, and the carnivores feed on other animals \u2013 mainly by preying onto them. Hence, they have canines to hunt down their prey, crack its bones, and tear its flesh.\nBut since the giant pandas have moved to a more peaceful lifestyle out of fear of ferocious animals like lions and tigers, they don\u2019t use their canines for that purpose anymore.\nNow their sharp canines help them to break bamboo stalks and eat them by grinding properly between the upper and lower premolars and molars. See, there is nothing that we should be scared of. They are only eating their favorite food from the sharp canines \u2013 and that is bamboo.\nHow Strong Are Giant Pandas Teeth?\nAs far as the strength of giant panda teeth is concerned, they are so strong that they can easily crack the bones of other animals. You might often find a giant panda hunting on rats, rodents, and squirrels.\nAlthough they don\u2019t use strong teeth against other animals, if they wish to do so, they can very effectively utilize them against other ferocious animals to keep themselves safe from any attacks.\nVI. Giant Pandas DON\u2019T Have Pouches\nPhoto Source: Discovery Wildlife\nWhen we think of pouches, the first animal that comes to our mind is a kangaroo. Giant pandas do not have pouches, but kangaroos have. Let\u2019s see why it is so!\nKangaroos are marsupial animals that keep their babies in their pouches until they fully grow and become independent. However, giant pandas are mammals, and they don\u2019t possess pouches. Instead, they are placental animals that feed their babies within their placenta and umbilical cord.\nThey don\u2019t essentially give birth to their babies. Until, they are fully developed and are able to live independently.\nWhy Do Panda Bears Don\u2019t Have Pouches?\nPouched animals or marsupials essentially require pouches or \u201cmarsupium\u201d for animals that have a short gestational period. The gestational period is when the baby remains within the mother\u2019s body for the purpose of development and nourishment.\nMoreover, the animals that have a short gestation period do not develop their babies properly. This is the case with marsupials or pouched animals. Since their babies are not fully developed, they need to carry them around even after their births.\nOn the other hand, giant pandas have a fairly long gestation period of 112 to 160 days which gives them sufficient time for their babies\u2019 developmental steps. Hence, despite the giant panda babies\u2019 small and tiny bodies, they are fully developed physiologically.\nHow Do Pandas Carry Their Babies?\nYou might have seen pictures of giant panda bears carrying their babies from the back. That\u2019s true, and that\u2019s definitely not cruel but a way of carrying their babies.\nGiant panda mothers tend to keep their babies very close to their bodies. Since they are fully grown, the mothers don\u2019t have to carry them in pouches. Sometimes, it may happen that the giant panda mother would carry their babies from their back with the help of its strong teeth.\nEven though, the panda mother does it doesn\u2019t hurt her baby. The giant panda mothers are very considerate, kind, and affectionate towards their cubs. They don\u2019t let them out of their sight until they are independent and are able to get their food by themselves.\nWhat Type Of Animals Have Pouches?\nThe animals that have short gestational periods have pouches. The reason is that their babies are underdeveloped when born. Therefore, they have to keep them in pouches until their development is completed.\nMoreover, it is an effective way of protecting their babies. Such animals are known as pouched animals or marsupials. Some of these animals include kangaroos, koalas, wombats, and others.\nVII. Giant Pandas Have Arms And Legs\nPhoto Source: Reddit\nLike most mammals, giants pandas have four arms and legs. The two of them can be called arms, but essentially they are legs, and all four of them are involved in the movements. The arms and legs are essentially black in color to camouflage them in shadows. The average length of a giant panda\u2019s arms and legs is 5 to 8 inches (12 to 20 cm).\nDoes A Panda Have 4 Legs?\nGiant pandas typically have four limbs, and all four are used in the movement of giant panda bears. They are unable to stand on their hind legs. Hence, we can consider their arms as legs as well that help them to move around or stand. They look so adorable and cute while walking on all four of their legs.\nVIII. Giant Panda Have Fingers\nGiant pandas are mammals and have quite a lot of features similar to humans. However, when it comes to paws or hands, they are a bit different in numbers as well as in structure. This can be attributed to the fact that humans don\u2019t essentially have to hunt or get their food by hands. Let\u2019s see how the fingers or digits are developed in the giant panda bodies.\nHow Many Fingers Does a Giant Panda have?\nGiant pandas essentially have six fingers or digits. However, one of these six is a pseudo thumb or an overgrown sesamoid bone. This thumb is opposable to the other thumb in the giant panda paws. The giant panda digits are covered from the fur on the upper part, but the inside shows the clear hierarchy of the digits.\nThe fingers have joints that allow the panda bears to fold them and hold anything with as much ease as possible.\nWhy Do Panda Bears Need Fingers?\nGiant panda bears mostly rely on bamboo stalks and their leaves. Therefore, they need to make a firm holding of the stalks. The opposable thumbs and fingers allow them to hold the stalks as well as get them from the trees.\nMoreover, they can move past bushes and trees by using their fingers. The fingers also let them have a firm grip on the ground. The fact that the joints allow them to adjust fingers on any surface, the giant pandas have very significant gripping abilities.\nWhat Body Parts Do Giant Pandas Use for Survival?\nAs far as the giant panda survival is concerned, they essentially survive by using different physical features. The way giant pandas are physical says a lot about their survival. Although giant pandas are carnivorous animals, they are very peace-loving and try to avoid any fight as much as they can. However, for their survival, they have adapted their bodies in the following ways:\nFurs to Keep them Camouflage from Predators\nThe thick, velvety fur keeps the giant pandas warm during very extreme weather conditions. Moreover, it prevents them from any forceful impact. Moreover, the black and white fur helps to keep them hidden within the atmosphere and environment of the forest. Therefore, fur plays a very important role in the survival of giant pandas, in addition to providing them a cute adorable look.\nTeeth to Attack in case of Emergency\nAfter fur, the most obvious body part that ensures giant panda survival is their teeth. The teeth are undoubtedly dangerous and can effectively kill the predator if any other animal tries to attack panda bears. It\u2019s a different story, however, that the giant pandas would never initiate the attack.\nOn top of that, the premolar and molars have very large surface areas for proper grinding of bamboo stalks and leaves. This makes them easier to digest without the presence of any enzymatic or metabolic activity. Without these teeth, the giant pandas wouldn\u2019t have been able to get the little amount of energy from bamboo that they are able to extract now.\nTail to Protect the Scent Producing Gland\nAlthough tail does not actively take part in the survival of giant pandas, it is quite important. The fact that it covers the circumanal glands, which produce a particular scent to help giant pandas navigate around, is enough evidence to accept it as a body part ensuring survival. Had it not been for the tail and circumanal glands, the giant pandas wouldn\u2019t have been able to mate and increase their species count.\nConclusion:\nIn this article, you have learned the different body parts of the giant panda, as well as, their functions and importance. Just like all the other animals, the body parts of giant pandas are very useful for them in one way or the other.\nIt is undeniable that giant pandas are very cute animals. They are not only adorable to look at but also adorable to spend time with. They require very high food maintenance of their favorite food, which is bamboo.\nTheir bamboo eating characteristics have affected their body structures quite significantly. That is why, they have a lazy behavior. On the other hand, other body parts such as circumanal glands, furs, and teeth play a very important role in their survival.\nWhat do you think of this article? Did you find it very informative?

Recognizable by its black eye markings, the giant panda is the symbol of World Wildlife Fund and represents endangered species conservation around the world. Here are four Giant Panda facts:\nA Bear With a \u201cThumb\u201d\nAt first glance, a Giant Panda\u2019s front feet appear to have an astonishing six toes: five toes pointing forward and one thumb. However, on closer examination, it was determined that the \u201cpseudo-thumb\u201d is actually a modified wrist bone.\nIt allows a panda to securely grasp a bamboo stalk while feeding.\nStomach of a Carnivore\nEven though giant pandas are mainly herbivorous, their digestive system, like that of other bears, is that of a meat eater. 95% of their diet consists of bamboo, while the rest is made up of roots, leaves, and grasses.\nHaving a stomach designed for a carnivore is a great disadvantage for the giant panda. It means that they can digest a very low percentage of the plant matter they eat. Therefore, they need to consume up to 40 pounds of bamboo every day to meet their daily energy requirements. Pandas may feed for up to 14 hours a day in the wild and consume up to 40% of their body weight each day! That would be like a 150 pound human eating 60 pounds of food in one day (approximately 120 Big Macs)\nGiant Pandas do not Hibernate\nThe giant panda, unlike other bears, does not hibernate. Instead, when severe weather approaches, they descend to lower altitudes of their mountainous habitat. This means they have food available all year round.\nGiving Birth to a Stick of Butter?\nBaby giant pandas are quite helpless when born. They are tiny and pink and blind, not opening their eyes until at least six weeks of age. In fact, they are only 0.001% of the mother\u2019s weight when born. That would be like a human mother giving birth to a half stick of butter! Sounds like a much more sensible system doesn\u2019t it?\nLove it?

They are good climbers and can also swim. They don\u2019t build dens (except to put cubs in) or hibernate. They prefer shallow slopes and solitary living. If it is too cold up in the mountains they head down to the valleys where it is warmer.\nLow-Stress Lifestyle\nBecause of their low-energy diet they avoid stressful situations and exertion, preferring shallow slopes and solitary living. They use scent markers to avoid one another. Giant pandas don\u2019t roar like other bears, but bleat like goats, or or honk, growl and bark to communicate. Cubs whine and croak for attention.\nEating Habits \u2014 14 Hours a Day\nA giant panda eating bamboo\nThe giant pandas spend as long as 14 hours eating per day. A giant panda needs about 12 to 38 kilograms of food per day, approximately 40% of its own weight. The giant pandas prefer eating tender stems, shoots and leaves of bamboo, all of which are richer in nutrition and lower in fibrins.\nPandas eat golden bamboo. Each season they eat the best bits. In April the best bit is the woody part. At other times they eat the tips and disguard the wood.\nWild giant pandas eat grasses, wild fruits, insects, mice, even lambs in the surrounding villages and leftovers in rubbish dumps as well.\nSleeping Habits \u2014 2\u20134 Hours\u2019 Sleep Between Meals\nYoung pandas sleeping\nIn addition to eating for about half a day, the giant pandas spend the rest of their time in sleeping.\nIn the wild, the giant pandas sleep for 2 to 4 hours between its two meals, whose favorite sleeping poses include lying flat on their backs, lying on their sides, lying on their stomachs, stretching their paws and rolling themselves up into balls.\nThe keepers feed giant pandas twice a day at regular times in the zoo, therefore, the giant pandas spend most of their spare time in rest, and they seem very lovely even during their sleeping time.\nFond of Climbing Trees \u2014 to Protect Themselves\nThe pandas are very nimble in climbing trees and run rapidly in danger. They propose to their partners, run away from danger and evade stronger competitors by climbing trees.\nThe giant pandas also walk into the valley, sneak into mountain villages or residences, which play with round-shaped utensils as toys and later abandon them in the wild.\nOnce in a while, the giant pandas also show their kindness to sheep and pigs by sharing food and rooms with them.\nSolitariness \u2014 They Like Being Alone\nPanda families don\u2019t live together. They are solitary, each female having a well-defined range. Males generally live apart, except for in the short breeding season (March to May), when they compete for female attention. Females raise the cubs alone.\nWith an uncommunicative and eccentric temperament, the giant pandas prefer freedom of being alone, and sleep in the daytime and look for food in the night. In addition to one month spent with their partners during mating season, most of their time is spent alone.\nDocile Temperament \u2014 Seldom Attacking Men or Other Animals\nThe giant pandas have a very docile temperament in most cases, and they often lower their heads or shade their faces with front paws to conceal their true appearances when they come across a man for the first time. Seldom actively attacking men or other animals, the giant pandas always evade them when coming across them.\nHowever, the giant pandas consider their cubs holy and untouchable once they give birth, and they will burst into rage at such small things as their cubs being watched by visitors. The giant pandas can stretch their paws and open their mouths wide like cats to make themselves more comfortable. They can also shake water off themselves like dogs after a heavy rain.\nCommunication \u2014 Scent Markings and Sounds\nMost communication among giant pandas is reached by scent markings left on the habitat, by which they can find their previous partners during mating season.\nAfter finding their partners, they will communicate with sound, which is barely understood by humans, and they will remain silent when simply but playing. Therefore, we could predicate their behaviors simply by their sounds.\nScent Markings for Dividing Territory\nThe secret to keeping peace in the habitat is dividing territory by scent markings. The giant pandas leaves their glandular secretions on tree stumps, walls and ground in their habitats, by which they gather together or evade stronger competitors.\nIn the non-mating season, the giant pandas would walk away as soon as they smell scents of newcomers. In the mating season, the scent of a female giant panda means that she is ready for male pandas to mate.\nIn addition to glandular secretions, urine is also employed by pandas for scent markings. While making markings, the giant pandas usually shake their heads with mouths half open, and then strip the barks from trees where they urine to attract attention of other pandas.\nReproduction\nMating from March to May\nThe female giant pandas are monestrous, which usually falls in March to May and only lasts 2 to 3 days each time. The female giant pandas will leave their partners after mating and rear their cubs alone.\nGiving Birth from July to September\nA baby panda A baby panda\nGiant panda gestation is about 83 to 200 days, and usually give birth from July to September. Cubs usually were born in hidden hollow trees or natural dens, where the branches and dry hays well-prepared by mother pandas are available. Normally, the giant pandas are monotocous and rarely multiparous. Even the female giant pandas have two cubs at one birth in the wild, they would choose to take care of one and abandon the other.\nOwing to feeding on bamboos, the giant pandas need to spend long time in eating to get enough energy each day, and they will leave their cubs to hunt for food for 2 to 4 hours each day even in their child-care periods.\nRead more about Giant Pandas Life Cycle."}

The Chinese word for Panda is Da Xiong Mao meaning Giant Bear Cat.\nWhat do Giant Pandas Look Like?\nPandas are black and white with black circles around their eyes. A Panda\u2019s skin is two different colors. The skin under their black fur is dark while the skin under the white fur is pink!\nThey have a strong jaw bone and teeth to help them crunch on the bamboo. Pandas have five fingers on each hand and a wrist bone that acts like a thumb to help them hold and eat the bamboo. A male Panda is called a boar and can weigh 175-250 pounds. Female Pandas are called sows and can weigh 150-230 ponds. Pandas are 2-3 feet tall and 5-6 feet long. A baby is called a cub\nGiant Panda Characteristics\nPanda\u2019s are shy and often keep to themselves. They stay away from people. Pandas have great eyes sight. Pandas like to climb trees.\nGiant Panda Habitat\nYou may see a panda in a zoo, but there is only one place in the entire world where pandas live and that is in China. Giant Pandas live in the bamboo forests located in the high mountains of Southwest China.\nWhat do Panda\u2019s Eat?\nPandas eat bamboo, it is their main food source They will also eat bamboo shoots, leaves, stalks and berries.

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant Panda Bear - Animal Facts and Information", "url": "https://www.bioexpedition.com/giant-panda-bear/", "text": "Giant Panda Bear Facts and Information\nAiluropoda melanoleuca\nGiant Panda Bear Description\nThe Panda Bear certainly is very different in appearance than the other species of bears. It features both black and white on the body. The head is white with black around the eyes. The limbs are black as is the band around the back of the neck that extends from both of the front limbs. The back and the stomach of them are white in color, while the ears are black.\nGiant Pandas do not portray the same image of a mean bear as the larger species often do. The males are slightly bigger than the females. A full grown Panda Bear will be about 170 pounds in females and 350 pounds in males and from 4 to 6 feet long.\nClass Mammalia Order Carnivora Family Ursidae Genus Ailuropoda Conservation status Endangered\nGiant Panda Bear Anatomy\nJust like all bears, this one has a very large head. However, the Panda Bear has a very round look to it. As they mature they often get more round in appearance. This is due to the development of the powerful jaws that are used for eating. The Giant Panda has large molar teeth and strong jaw muscles to help them crushing tough bamboo that makes up almost all of their diet.\nTheir coat is very thick which helps them to keep their body temperature regulated. Unless you look at one very close you won\u2019t know that their paw has a kind of thumb and five fingers. The purpose of them is the same as opposable thumbs for humans and for apes. They will mainly use them to hold bamboo and get to the shoots inside.\nUnlike other bear species, the pandas do not have heel pads on their hind feet.\nGiant Panda Bear Evolution\nMany people are quite interested in the evolution of the Panda Bear. How did they become so different from other types of bears? For years the taxonomic classification of the Giant Pandas was under debate, until DNA testing confirmed it, there were many that didn\u2019t even believe this was actually a type of bear and part of the Ursidae family.\nSome research indicates that Pandas has evolved for more than 3 million years as a separate evolutionary line than that of other bear species.\nIt is also believed that due to shortages of food they became dependent almost completely on the bamboo and plant life. They weren\u2019t able to find enough animals to thrive on. The movement into trees could account for a survival instinct. Since Panda Bears can\u2019t move fast they could become prey for other animals if they remain on the ground.\nThere are many stories and legends of the Panda Bear in the Chinese history. It was regarded as having magic powers. Many writings indicate that it helped to keep bad spirits away. The various Emperors of China also had them as pets.\nGiant Panda Bear Behavior\nIn a zoo setting Panda Bears are generally in pairs. However, in the wild they tend to spend their time alone. The exception is when the females are caring for their young. They aren\u2019t very territorial though so they are tolerant of each other eating in the same areas. They can often be boring to watch though as they mainly eat and sleep for most of the day and night.\nGiant Pandas do not hibernate and do not establish permanent dens. They take shelter in trees and caves.\nGiant Panda \u2013 Ailuropoda melanoleuca\nGiant Panda Bear Habitat and Distribution\nSmall patches of mountain regions of central China are the places where Panda Bears reside. The Minshan Mountains and the Qinling Mountains in China are the home for nearly the 65% of the wild population.\nThey live in temperate montane forests where bamboo stands are present. They can be found in the elevations from 4,000 to 11,000 feet. Through careful observations six different areas where they are known to live in the forests of China have been identified.\nThey will change the elevation of where they happen to reside based on the growth season of the bamboo. They are able to determine when it will be at its best in a given area. This type of movement in their habitat also prevents them from completely depleting that resource from any given area. Evidence of where these bears were once living in the trees has been found throughout those six regions of China.\nGiant Panda Bear Diet and Feeding Habits\nWhile Giant Pandas are classified as carnivores, their main source of food is bamboo, up to 99%. Many people assume that bamboo shoots are the only types of food that these bears eat. They also consume stems, leaves and in rare occasions small mammals. Panda bears can spend up to 10 to 12 hours a day feeding.\nThe amount of bamboo that these bears can consume per day is unbelievable. In all, they can eat from 20 to 30 pounds of bamboo every day, due to the fact that bamboo has a very little nutritional value.\nThe bamboo is often left for them because other types of animals can\u2019t chew through it. Bamboo has splinters that can get into the throat and be very uncomfortable. However, the Panda Bear has a thick esophagus that allows them to swallow it without any problems.\nGiant Panda Bear Reproduction\nReproduction is a very serious concern when it comes to the Panda Bears. Although they are able to mate at a very early age, most of them don\u2019t seem to have any interest in it until much later. Even when they do mate there isn\u2019t always the success of offspring creation.\nLater research shows that this behavior occurs only at captivity as wild Pandas have reproductive rates comparable to other bear species.\nThe males will fight with each other for the right to mate with females in the area. It is common for the males to mate with several females during a given season. This spans from the months of March through May. The pair may spend 2 to 4 days with each other before going their own ways.\nThe offspring will be born from 95 to 160 days later. Usually only one cub is born at a time but twins are possible. The reproductive rate is about 1 young every 2 years.\nPanda cubs will spend about 18-24 months with their mother in the wild before they go out on their own. Generally they will take up residence within a close proximity of their mother as long as enough food is available.\nPanda Bear moms can be stressed out when it comes to caring for their young. Part of the efforts to increase their numbers has to do with artificial means of conception. They also include the young being cared for by humans when the natural mother isn\u2019t able to do so. In the wild Pandas can live to be about 14 to 20 years of age and 30 years old in captivity.\nGiant Panda and Cub \u2013 Panda Reproduction\nGiant Panda Bear Predators\nAdult Pandas have very few natural enemies. Only jackals and leopards prey on pandas. The yellow-throated martens feed on panda cubs.\nWith only about 1,600 Pandas remaining in the wild, you would think that hunters would leave them alone. However, the low numbers often fuels their desire to kill them or capture them.\nEven though this type of hunting is illegal in China it continues to take place. There are instances where poachers have been given the death penalty though for killing Panda Bears. Those types of penalties can only be implemented though if the people responsible for the actions are actually caught. The Panda bear is one of the most endangered animals on the planet.\nGiant Panda Bear Related Articles\n(Visited 2,156 times, 1 visits today)"}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "All About Nature at Risk - Species Profile: Giant Panda - SeaWorld", "url": "https://seaworld.org/animals/all-about/nature-at-risk/species-profile-giant-panda/", "text": "A Message in Black and White\nUpon its arrival in the Western world in 1936, the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) quickly captured everyone's heart and interest. With the advent of the environmental movement in the '60s, the world's most adorable mammal became an international ambassador for wildlife conservation. Unfortunately, even its fame has not kept the appealing black and white panda from traveling down the road to extinction. Probably less than 1,000 giant pandas remain in the wild. This species' decline demonstrates how a vulnerable animal can become rare through climatic changes and endangered from human impact.\nDiminishing Ranges\nHistorically the giant panda ranged over an extended area of southeastern Asia. Today they survive only along the eastern front of the Tibetan plateau of China in three neighboring provinces. Climatic changes during the last 2,000 years caused the temperate deciduous forests, suitable for the bamboo that pandas depend on, to retreat to these remote highlands. However, it is the dramatically increasing human population that has so drastically reduced the number of pandas and threatens to consume the last of their habitat. China is the world's third largest country and is home to one quarter of the world's population! More than one billion men, women and children require more and more land for fields, pastures, and timber. Even panda refuges succumb to an ever-growing demand for space and natural resources. And still, poachers pursue the giant panda. As this Chinese national treasure becomes more rare, its hide becomes more valuable. The panda's pelt has been a status symbol of power and wealth for many centuries and now one hide is worth thousands of dollars on the black-market. Since the average annual income per person in China is only about US $360, unlawful hunting of pandas is potentially lucrative, even though the penalty may be death.\nPanda Preserves...Opening Corridors\nMany of the preserves are widely separated by inhabited or cultivated regions that pandas cannot cross. Isolated habitats decrease genetic diversity because unrelated animals no longer have the opportunity to travel and find new mates outside of their community. Fewer breeding animals contributing to a species' gene pool mean fewer genetic variations are available to enhance that species' survival chances in the future.\nExpanding existing preserves or adding new ones so that habitats can be interconnected will allow pandas as well as other species to find unrelated mates and enrich their genetic health. These extensions are called corridors or greenways.\nThe Ambassador\nThe giant panda is truly a representative endangered species because of the classic problems it epitomizes - large, slow-breeding, specialized vegetarian - that will not survive human impact without human assistance. We, the people, must take strong measures to protect not only this animal but every species and the habitat each depends upon. Everyone of us can make a difference by accepting the challenge to save all plants or animals at risk, whether in our hometown or around the world."}

But just what's involved in panda-bear mating, both in and out of the wild?\nGiant pandas are solitary bears that live in rather fixed home ranges. They generally come together only during the mating season, which occurs between mid-February and mid-May. \"Most females go into estrus mid-March through mid-April,\" said Meghan Martin-Wintle, an applied ecologist and director of PDX Wildlife, a nonprofit conservation and research organization based in Portland, Oregon.\nThe China natives communicate with one another through vocalizations and scent markings, and these behaviors ramp up about two weeks prior to females entering estrus, Martin-Wintle told Live Science. At this time, females will go to the outskirts of their ranges and rub their anal area on trees and rocks to deposit smelly secretions from their anogenital glands. [How to Flirt in Panda: Bears' Squeaks Decoded]\nMales home in on females' auditory and olfactory cues, and three to four of them will congregate on a single female. However, females ovulate and are receptive to mating only a few days a year. \"They have just this one day that is the best and they have a day or two on either side,\" Martin-Wintle said.\nPosturing and positioning\nAs females near ovulation, they will hang out in trees while males compete for dominance on the ground.\n\"It's a lot of posturing \u2014 they do these barks, like a dog, and they do these growls, \" Martin-Wintle explained. And though it may be hard to imagine, male giant pandas do get into physical altercations. \"They do lunges and they will come together and do swats and even try to grab onto the nape of each other's necks.\"\nDominance is usually established pretty quickly. The champion male will then stay close to the female and charge at any intruders, until the female comes down from the tree ready to mate.\nGiven that researchers rarely observe panda bears mating in the wild, it's unclear what's involved in sexual selection or if females always mate with the dominant male in her home range, Martin-Wintle said. But females in captivity, at the very least, are known to sometimes completely reject males.\nFor giant pandas, mating is a difficult affair, in part, because male giant pandas have one of the smallest penises relative to body size in the animal kingdom, Martin-Wintle said. A willing female must get into the lordosis posture, in which she lowers her front end, arches her back down and raises her tail end up, putting her vaginal cavity in the right position for the male to enter her from behind. \"And once he obtains the position, she has to shove on to him,\" she said. [The Weirdest Penises in the Animal Kingdom]\nAfter orgasm, both male and female giant pandas bleat, or let out a goat-like cry. The male will then do a \"roll back,\" in which he sits on his butt and lower pelvic area and pulls the female so that she's sitting on him \u2014 and holds on as long as he possibly can. It's unknown why the male does this.\nAfter mating, the male will stick around and possibly mate with the female a few more times, until she's no longer ovulating.\nSex in captivity\nWhen captive breeding programs for giant pandas first got started in the 1950s through 1970s, the projects had a very low success rate. There were a few reasons for this failure, Martin-Wintle said.\nFor instance, scientists didn't understand the bears' communication system or how important it was for mating. The animals were kept separate and only brought together when it was time to mate, so mating pairs weren't able to exchange scent and vocal cues as they normally would in the wild.\nAdditionally, \"we weren't really successful at getting the mothers to raise their cubs, and we weren't good at hand-raisingthem either,\" Martin-Wintle said, adding that one problem was that cubs must be physically stimulated to defecate.\nToday, panda bear captive breeding programs have much higher success rates, but they could still be better. Though these programs make sure to pair adult giant pandas that are genetically separated, they don't take into consideration behavior and mate choice. \"We are removing many of the things we know about Darwin and sexual selection,\" Martin-Wintle said.\nIn a study published late 2015, Martin-Wintle and her colleagues found that pandas paired with mates they preferred were much more likely to successfully have sex, produce cubs and adequately care for their young. The researchers are now looking at whether allowing males to compete for a female also improves reproductive success, possibly by increasing testosterone and sexual motivation.\nOriginal article on Live Science."}

Take the zebra and its stripes. Why does a zebra have stripes? As it turns out, the stripes help deter biting flies like horseflies and tsetse flies. Genius!\nMost often, animals and their colors or patterns make sense \u2013 there\u2019s not much mystery behind why an Arctic fox is white. But where does the beloved giant panda fit into this scheme? Aside from turning grown-ups into cooing blubbering mushes, what purpose do those cartoon-animal black and white patches serve?\nThis was the question put forth in a study by scientists from the University of California, Davis, and California State University, Long Beach, who determined that the giant panda's distinct black-and-white markings have two functions: camouflage and communication.\n\"Understanding why the giant panda has such striking coloration has been a long-standing problem in biology that has been difficult to tackle because virtually no other mammal has this appearance, making analogies difficult,\" says lead author Tim Caro from the UC Davis Department of Wildlife, Fish and Conservation Biology. \"The breakthrough in the study was treating each part of the body as an independent area.\"\nThe team compared the giant panda\u2019s different areas of fur with the dark and light coloring of 195 other carnivore species and 39 bear subspecies. With that, they matched the dark regions to various ecological and behavioral variables to determine their function.\nCamouflage\nTim Davis / Corbis / VCG / Getty Images\nWhat they found is that the panda\u2019s face, neck, belly, and rump \u2013 the white parts \u2013 help it hide in snowy habitats. Well, that makes sense, but what about the bold back parts? They help it hide in the shade.\nWhat\u2019s fascinating is that the giant panda requires this convertible camouflage in the first place \u2013 for which we can thank the bear\u2019s taste for bamboo. Since giant pandas are unable to digest a wide variety of plants, they\u2019re stuck with bamboo. Bamboo is a relatively poor food source that doesn\u2019t allow for the storage of enough fat for the pandas to go dormant during the winter like other of their bear brethren do. Instead, the panda is active year-round and traverses many miles and habitat types, from snowy mountains to tropical forests.\nCommunication\noversnap / Getty Images\nWhich still doesn\u2019t account for those giant panda giant eyes. We swoon for those panda faces because of \u201cneoteny\u201d \u2013 the retention of juvenile features (big eyes, big head, roly-poly demeanor), which we are programmed to adore. But since giant pandas\u2019 survival isn't dependent on making humans go weak in the knees, the team looked further into the function of the markings on the head.\nThey concluded that the marking is used to communicate. \u201cDark ears may help convey a sense of ferocity, a warning to predators,\u201d the study notes. \u201cTheir dark eye patches may help them recognize each other or signal aggression toward panda competitors.\u201d\n\"This really was a Herculean effort by our team, finding and scoring thousands of images and scoring more than 10 areas per picture from over 20 possible colors,\" says co-author Ted Stankowich, a professor at CSU Long Beach. \"Sometimes it takes hundreds of hours of hard work to answer what seems like the simplest of questions: Why is the panda black and white?\""}

All the bear species are massive animals with the smallest, the sun bear, also known as the \"honey bear\", still weighing in at over 100 pounds.\nThe bear family is within the order of carnivores, and their impressive canine teeth would definitely indicate a propensity for meat, but with the exception of the polar bear, which is almost 100% carnivorous, all the bear species eat a substantial amount of vegetable matter.\nThe giant panda in particular eats about 95% bamboo as its diet, occasionally ingesting insects, small rodents, or other vegetation.\nThe brown bear (which includes the famed \"grizzly bear\" sub-species), is the second largest land carnivore, smaller on average only to the polar bear, yet it hunts some of the smallest prey including mice, voles, and thousands of moths in any given year, and it uses its massive jaws to collect tiny blueberries and blackberries by the dozens with amazingly delicate and dexterous lips!\nBears have extraordinary noses and their sense of smell is said to be seven times that of a bloodhound! Their eyesight and hearing, however, are probably not much better than ours.\nAll eight of the bear species are basically solitary animals with simple social lives, however they are considered to be some of the worlds most intelligent animals, surpassed perhaps only by the great apes, the elephants and the whales. - Bear Facts\ncheck out our youtube channel!\nthe polar bear\nThe polar bear is the largest of the eight bear species, but is probably the most recent evolutionary addition.\nDiverging from the brown bear only about 100,000 years ago, the polar bear quickly evolved numerous unique physical adaptations in order to cope with its harsh arctic environment.\nPolar bears have translucent fur to help trap heat, eyesight adapted to underwater viewing, and massive paws that allow them to paddle for dozens of miles in icy seas.\nthe brown bear\nAlaskan Kodiak bear\nBrown bears can be found in most heavily forested regions of the Northern hemisphere including North America, where the infamous grizzly bear resides.\nThere are approximately 16 subspecies of brown bear in existence, varying in size and color, and living as far south as Italy and Mexico.\nOf these, the Kodiak bear of Alaska is the largest. Adult male Kodiak bears are usually just as big as adult male polar bears.\nThis subspecies lives on the Kodiak islands of South-West Alaska, where its reputation for enormous size is legendary.\nThe grizzly bear, or silver-tip bear, named so for it's grey-tipped guard hairs which give its fur a \"grizzled\" look, is a subspecies of brown bear. Even though all North American brown bears are sometimes referred to as grizzly bears, the fact is, all grizzly bears are brown bears, but not all brown bears are grizzly bears.\nJust ask the extremely rare Marsican brown bear from central Italy!. -Bear Facts\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

These lighter color patterns occur as you head farther west across the united states, and represent the fact that this species was named the \"black\" bear by the first settlers to arrive on the eastern shores.\nAs humans proceeded west, they believed that they were encountering different species of bear, but the colorful group all turn out to be the same species, with several regional sub-species.\nThe brown bear and the black bear occur simultaneously in the west and mid-western United States, and even though they may be the same color and often close to the same size (especially adult male black bears compared to adult female brown bears) but can be differentiated by the brown bears shoulder hump, dished facial profile and much larger light or even white colored claws, even though they may be the same general size and color. - Bear Facts\nThe asian black bear\nThe Asian black bear is most closely related to the American black bear.\nThese two species diverged over 3 million years ago, but they are still more closely related than any other bear species, not having developed any special physical traits that significantly changed their DNA as the polar bears did.\nThe Asian black bear is slightly smaller than the American black bear, has very large (for a bear) wide-spaced ears, and a broad yellowish white mark across its chest that resembles a half moon.\nAlso known as the \"moon bear\" because of this, the Asian or Asiatic black bear is largely arboreal, spending the majority of its life on low tree branches where it forages for leaves, fruits and insects.\nIt ranges from the Himalayas, to Japan, and is native to Korea and most of Northeastern China and Eastern Russia.\nThis bear is considered to be a threatened species not only because its habitat is being destroyed, but because their body parts - especially the gall-bladder- are highly prized in Eastern medicine.\nthe giant panda\nMost popular of all the bear species, the large and adorable giant panda has forgone its carnivorous history and become almost exclusively herbivorous.\nIts diet is so specialized and so restricted that at any given moment a pandas stomach will never contain less than 95% of one item - bamboo!\nAlthough there are a few different types of bamboo that pandas can enjoy, and also different parts of the plant that they may sample in season, it is still a very limited choice.\nSimilar to the polar bear, which may eat nothing but one species of seal for three months straight, the pandas body makes up for the nutritional limits with somewhat unusual blood chemistry, and organs such as the stomach, liver and gall bladder that work to extract as much nutrients as possible from the limited fare.\nthe spectacled bear\nThe spectacled bear is also known as the Andean bear. It is a medium size arboreal bear that inhabits the Andes mountain range of South America.\nThese bears are amazingly good climbers for their size, and will often build primitive nests as the great apes do, by bending over branches high in the Andes forests.\nThe spectacled bear is nocturnal in some parts of their range, and their diet includes flowers, tree bark and even some species of cactus!\nthe sloth bear\nThe very unusual sloth bear or Stickney bear, native to India, is probably the least known and most unique species of bear.\nNocturnal, for the most part, and also mostly insectivorous, it is most closely related to the European brown bears.\nThe sloth bear is medium sized but less bulky than other bear species with considerably longer limbs. It fills an ecological niche similar to that of anteaters and aardvarks, and hunts just like they do.\nWith long, curved claws they rip open termite and ant mounds. Then they use their specially designed lower lip to vacuum the insects up.\nSloth bears are more social than other bears with males often staying with females in dedicated pairs and even sticking around to help raise the cubs.\nLike anteaters, sloth bears carry their young on their backs which is also unique among the bears.\nThese animals are also remarkably vocal with a number of different calls and barks, and very intelligent. They are commonly seen throughout India being used in roadside shows as dancing and performing bears. - Bear Facts\nthe sun bear\nThe sun bear, also called the Malaysian sun bear and the honey bear, is a unique looking creature that locally is often referred to as a \"dog-bear\" or \"bear-dog\".\nThe sun bear has a similar mark on its chest as the sloth bear and Asian black bear, which often takes the shape of a yellow half-moon.They are most easily distinguishable from the other bear species by the light fur color that extends to the entire face and forehead.\nThese are the smallest of all the eight bear species, with the largest males topping out at no more than 200 pounds and averaging more like 150 pounds.\nSun bears have the strongest sense of smell of all the bears, and tremendously strong claws and forelegs. They climb trees and forage for insects by ripping open old logs and tree trunks.\nTheir favorite food - not surprisingly- is honey, and they can withstand the stings of bees because their thick black fur is remarkable dense, even on the face.\nSun bears eat not only honey and honey comb, but bees, termites, grubs and caterpillars. They have a very varied diet and round it out with various fruits and plant materials.\nThese are strong climbing, active, and noisy animals native to tropical Southeast Asian forests, and particularly Malaysia. They range from India to Vietnam, but have difficulty adapting as their range is deforested. This is a vulnerable species in the wild, which, if the pattern of deforestation throughout their range continues, will be seriously endangered in the years to come.\nA lovely, playful, and comical animal, the Malayan sun bear is also one of the most intelligent bear species. Although \"Winnie the Poo\" was often referred to as a \"Honey bear\" he clearly did not resemble the true Malaysian bear - Winnie the Poo may have been a Grizzly!.\na few more bear facts\nThe bears are the 8 members of the order Ursidae.\nThe smallest bear species - the sun bear - is over 100 pounds\nThe polar bear and the brown bear are the largest carnivores on land\nA bears sense of smell is seven times greater than a bloodhound\nThe panda is a bear - the red panda (or firefox) is more closely related to a raccoon.\nThe Bears are considered to be one of the most intelligent animal families behind only the great apes, the elephants and the whales.\nAs one of the largest carnivores on land, the brown bear eats some of the smallest prey.\n\"Dancing Bears\" are common in many cultures where bears are tamed to perform in street side shows or circuses.\nBears can walk upright and sit upright in a posture very similar to human beings. - Amazing Bear Facts"}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Intriguing Facts About Pandas Everyone Should Know - Animal Sake", "url": "https://animalsake.com/facts-on-pandas", "text": "Pandas are unique species of bear that can be found in China. Pandas are carnivores, yet 99% of them feed on bamboos. They can eat for 16 hours at a stretch. Isn\u2019t that amazing? Here are more intriguing facts about this black and white bear.\nThe panda, also known as the Giant Panda, is a species of Chinese bear, black and white in color, which is almost on the brink of extinction. Although it is difficult to take a census of their numbers in the wild, it is thought that there are around 1000 of them existing in the wild, and one hundred of them in captivity. It\u2019s an endangered species struggling for existence. Let\u2019s look at the basic facts about the panda.\nPanda Mania\n\u00bb Panda has a typical bear-like body; however, it has unique coloring on its coat that marks it out quite distinctively. The fur on its legs, shoulders, eyes, ears, as well as its muzzle is black, while the rest of the fur on its body is snowy-white. Although the exact reason for this unusual coloring of its coat is not known, it is speculated that it provides a very good camouflage for the animal in its snowy and rocky habitat dappled with the shadows of the trees and plants.\n\u00bb These seemingly cuddly large bears have a short tail, round-shaped ears, a heavy-set physique, and a big head.\n\u00bb In Chinese, the Panda is called \u2018Da Xiong Mao\u2019, meaning \u2018giant bear cat\u2019. This is because, unlike other bears which have eyes with round pupils, the pupils of panda\u2019s eyes have cat-like vertical slits.\n\u00bb Pandas sit in an upright position while eating. This frees their front paws, with which they grasp their food. As a matter of fact, they have unique front paws, with five fingers and claws along with another appendage, which they use as an opposable thumb, which is not really like the human thumb, but is an extra long growth of their wrist bone.\n\u00bb Similar in size to the American Black Bear, the panda is about 2-3 feet in height, at the shoulder, when it stands on all its four legs, and is about 4-6 feet in length. The males weigh around 250 lbs, while the females are about 220 lbs.\n\u00bb Once upon a time, the giant pandas ranged all over eastern and southern China, North Vietnam, and Myanmar. These days, however, they occur only in a small area of China. This is because, logging has caused a drastic shrinkage of its habitat, which is also one of the main threats to the survival of these unique creatures.\n\u00bb Pandas live at heights ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 feet, in coniferous and broad-leaved forests, which have a dense undergrowth of bamboo. These forests are filled with heavy mist and rains around the year, and are usually cloaked in thick clouds.\n\u00bb Among all the species of bears, the diet of the pandas is the most specialized, comprising almost entirely of bamboo. In fact, in the wild, the panda survives on just two types of bamboo: the umbrella bamboo and arrow bamboo. It also eats small amounts of other types of grasses and sometimes, the fawns of musk deer and small rodents. In captivity, pandas have a wider variety in their diet, eating rice gruel, sugarcane, specially made high-fiber biscuits, sweet potatoes, apples, and carrots.\n\u00bb Unlike other bears that live in temperate regions and go for hibernation, pandas do not go into hibernation because their food is available throughout the year. Another reason for this is that their diet of bamboo does not provide them with enough nourishment for hibernating in the winter.\n\u00bb Although adult pandas are usually solitary, meeting only to mate, they are known to communicate with each other at other times, too, by calling, meeting occasionally in groups, and leaving scent marks.\n\u00bb Though female pandas give birth to two offspring, only one of them survives. Panda cubs remain with their mother from 1\u00bd to 3 years.\nOther Riveting Facts\n\u00bb A strange fact about pandas is that they smell through ears and hear through nose.\n\u00bb Due to the high content of iron in their liver, pandas have this slight magnetic force; and because of this, they head towards north when blind-folded.\n\u00bb They rely on a recorded memory that is spatial memory and not on the visual memory.\n\u00bb Pandas are considered to be the most affable bears. They have often helped troubled people in jungle.\n\u00bb The pandas are always found in groups.\n\u00bb The logo of World Wide Fund (WWF) for nature features a giant panda on it.\nIt is sad to know that such an amazing creation of God is on the verge of extinction. Man is the main enemy of the giant panda, with them still being hunted for their pelts. Yet, ironically, they are regarded as a symbol of peace in their homeland, China."}

It has long been classified in the raccoon family as a distant relative of the little panda, but genetic studies have shown that the giant panda is related to the bears from which it split off in the early development of the bear (Ursidae) family. Its closest relative is the Andean bear / spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus).\nCharacteristic\nGiant pandas are medium-sized bears with a very strong build. Giant pandas are limited to a few mountainous areas in southwest China with bamboo forests growing there.\nPandas are vegetarians\nGiant pandas are vegetarians, feeding mainly on young canes of a variety of bamboo. It does not bloom all year round, so at certain times the pandas do not have food and often starve. That is why they sometimes eat birds and snakes tangled in the bushes.\nA loner by choice\nGiant pandas live alone and spend most of their time eating bamboo shoots. They live in dense thickets, so observing their lives is not easy. Pandas produce offspring extremely rarely, which, apart from poaching, is the main reason for their extinction.\nFur\nPanda has thick fur with a characteristic white and black coloration with yellow, brown or red patches. Such colors provide the bear with good camouflage against predators in the environment of bamboo thickets and leaves of tree branches.\nPopulation\nGiant pandas, despite being protected \u2013 due to their fur \u2013 often fall prey to poachers. Despite the efforts made for this species, its population is declining every year. It is estimated that only 1,800-1,900 of these animals are currently living in the wild.\nThe original range of the giant pandas covered large parts of eastern China and Myanmar. The decline began in the late Pleistocene, for which both climatic changes and the spread of humans are responsible. Hunting for the fur and for zoos, continued to decimate the populations until they were placed under protection in 1939.\nPoaching and fur trade are subject to draconian penalties in China, and there have even been death sentences for these offenses. Reasons for the decline in populations were also the progressive settlement of their habitat, which split the range into three parts, and the associated genetic narrowing.\nAnother factor is the periodic death of large bamboo forest areas every 15\u2013120 years (most recently at the beginning of the 1980s). Areas with blooming bamboo forests could then often not be reached by the pandas, because large human settlements and cultivated land lay in between. However, the distribution areas of the giant pandas have been protected since 1998. Another reason is the slow reproduction rate.\nGiant panda \u2013 interesting facts\nThere is also a red panda (Ailurus fulgens), that is related to raccoons.\nUntil recently, it was believed that the giant panda belongs to the raccoon family. Only by using modern laboratory methods, it turned out that, the panda is related to bears.\nThe giant panda is a very mysterious animal. It is still unknown whether they are nocturnal or daytime animals. It is also a mystery how many years they live in the wild and whether they hibernate.\nThe panda has an extra thumb on its front legs, which it only serves for grasping bamboo shoots and removing leaves.\nIn Europe, the existence of a giant panda was not found out until 1869.\nPandas are usually active at dawn and dusk, but are also found at night and during the day.\nPandas usually live alone. They occupy a small territory with an area of \u200b\u200b4-6 km\u00b2\nPandas are unlikely to be in contact with each other.\nPanda eats about 38 kg of plants per day.\nThe giant panda lives in bamboo forests at an altitude of 1600-3500 m above sea level. (in winter it goes down to 800 m above sea level).\nAlthough pandas are predators, in practice they mainly eat bamboo shoots.\nThe male of the panda is heavier than the female, but it is very difficult to tell both sexes apart.\nPanda likes to climb trees.\nThe giant panda J\u012bngjing was one of the five mascots of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\nIn the US, National Panda Day is celebrated on March 16.\nDetailed data / size\nThe giant panda, bamboo bear (Ailuropoda melanoleuca)\nHeight at the withers: 60 to 90 cm (24 to 35 in)\n60 to 90 cm (24 to 35 in) Body Length: 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 feet 11 inches to 6 feet 3 inches)\n1.2 to 1.9 m (3 feet 11 inches to 6 feet 3 inches) Tail length: 10\u201315 cm (4\u20136 in)\n10\u201315 cm (4\u20136 in) Weight: males: up to 160 kg (350 lb)) females: 70 kg \u2013 125 kg (150 \u2013 276 lb)\nSexual maturity is reached at the age of 5-6\nMating season: from March to May\nfrom March to May Number of pups in a litter: 1-3, usually only one survives\n1-3, usually only one survives Life expectancy: 20-30 years\n20-30 years Population: about 1800-1900 individuals\nClassification\nKingdom: Animalia\nPhylum: Chordata\nClass: Mammalia\nOrder: Carnivora\nFamily: Ursidae\nGenus: Ailuropoda\nSpecies: A. melanoleuca\nRecommended"}

The twins are alternating between mother and incubator, as the mother can only care for one at a time.\nThe Smithsonian National Zoo has detected a possible fetus in an ultrasound of its giant panda , Mei Xiang . This is a first for the zoo\u2019s panda breeding efforts.\nThe discovery of what veterinarians think is a 1.5 inch (4-centimeter) long fetus means Mei could give birth as early as next week, according to a statement released after the August 19 ultrasound.\n\"Our success at identifying a fetus during this week\u2019s ultrasound procedure was really the result of preparation and hard work colliding with opportunity,\" Don Neiffer, the zoo's chief veterinarian, says in an email.\nMei has rarely cooperated with past ultrasounds, and when the zoo staff called Mei to participate in the August 19 examination, \"we were not expecting her to hold for us,\" Neiffer says. \"When the keeper staff performed their magic, it made my job much easier.\"\nAn ultrasound only shows a panda fetus within the last 20 days of a pregnancy, and even then, \"it\u2019s just not easy to hit a moving target with the ultrasound probe,\" Neiffer says. \"Thank you, Mei Xiang!\"\nThe zoo's reproductive team artificially inseminated Mei Xiang in late April with semen from two males: The other National Zoo panda, Tian Tian, and a Chinese panda named Hui Hui, which was determined to be a good genetic match for Mei. If there is a cub, DNA analysis will determine the father.\nBreeding the endangered animals in captivity is fraught with challenges. We talked to three experts to find out exactly what's so tricky about pandas' reproductive biology.\nFemale pandas ovulate just once a year, in the spring.\nWhat's more, the female can only conceive for about two or three days around ovulation, which means she has to mate with a male during that period. Females can be fertile between the ages of about 4 to 20. (See \u201cIs Breeding Pandas in Captivity Worth It?\u201d)\nGenerally solitary creatures, panda partners find each other in the wild via calls and scents, according to the National Zoo. Luckily for captive panda pairs, the male's nearby, but that doesn't mean mating is easy. Which is why ...\nThe pair has to be compatible.\nNot only do they need to get along, the couple has to be \"behaviorally competent\"\u2014meaning males need to know how to mount a female, San Diego Zoo panda veterinarian Meg Sutherland-Smith said in a previous email interview. But sometimes pandas just aren't sure what to do. ( Read about a Thai zoo that turned to \"panda porn\" to get its bears in the mood .)\nThe San Diego Zoo's panda pair, Bai Yun and Gao Gao, have mated naturally and are parents to several cubs.\nAt the National Zoo, Tian Tian and Mei have had trouble mating naturally, but Mei has conceived before via artificial insemination. Tai Shan, born in 2005, was affectionately nicknamed Butterstick among D.C. fans due to a newborn panda's tiny size, and now lives in China. ( Watch a video of Mei's first baby, Tai Shan .)\nZoo Atlanta's pandas Lun Lun and Yang Yang have also failed to mate naturally, \"probably because both lack an experienced partner,\" Rebecca Snyder, formerly Zoo Atlanta's curator of mammals, said previously by email.\nArtificial insemination at Zoo Atlanta has produced several cubs.\nChinese breeding centers have also been successful at using artificial insemination, Snyder noted.\nIn China, panda bloodlines are also filed so that experts can pair pandas that are unrelated, which increases their chances of breeding and producing healthy offspring.\nPandas have pseudopregnancies.\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\nA hormone spike in a female panda tells scientists that one of two things will happen in 40 to 55 days: She'll either give birth, or experience the end of a pseudopregnancy. ( Read about the costs of breeding pandas in National Geographic magazine .)\nAccording to the San Diego Zoo blog , \"a pseudopregnancy occurs when a female exhibits the signs and symptoms of pregnancy when in fact she is not experiencing one.\"\nThe phenomenon\u2014still not completely explained\u2014has been observed in mice, dogs, and even people.\nA panda fetus is extremely slow-growing, making it hard to detect pregnancy.\nGiant pandas undergo what's called \"delayed implantation,\" which means that once the egg is fertilized, everything gets puts on hold. The future fetus \"virtually stops growing in the uterus and instead free-floats without growth until the time is right for it to implant in the uterine wall,\" the San Diego Zoo\u2019s blog explains.\nThat's usually within the last weeks of gestation, so zoo veterinarians often don't know if a panda is pregnant until the little girl or guy pops out.\nNot to mention giant pandas sometimes resorb, or absorb, a fetus\u2014a biological process that's still a mystery to scientists.\nHowever, ultrasound technology has improved in recent years, Sutherland-Smith noted, and her team has been able to both detect pregnancies and predict roughly when Bai Yun will give birth.\nCubs are very needy and vulnerable at birth.\nAt three to five ounces, the hairless, blind newborn panda is 1/900th the size of its mother. According to the National Zoo, that makes it one of the smallest mammal newborns relative to its mother's size, trumped only by marsupials. Unable to move, the infant is reliant on the mother's warmth, milk, and protection to survive.\nMei's second cub, a female, was born in September 2012, but died a week later due to lung and liver damage, according to the zoo. Poorly developed lungs likely prevented the cub from getting enough oxygen.\nSaving Wild Pandas\nUltimately, \"captive breeding can only take us so far, and its greatest contribution isn't the birth of a single panda but the arousal of interest and support for panda conservation at large,\" Marc Brody, senior adviser for conservation and sustainable development at China\u2019s Wolong Nature Reserve, said in a previous interview. (Also see \" Wild Panda Population Up Dramatically in China, Government Says .\")\nPossibly as few as 1,600 giant pandas still roam the mountainous forests of central China, according to the National Zoo, and more than 300 live in breeding centers around the world. (See more panda pictures.)\nSome of the captive pandas in China have been reintroduced into their native habitat, \"but the bigger question is not can we breed an animal in captivity, but can we give him a home in the wild\u2014and that means restoring degraded and fragmented habitat,\" said Brody, who is also a National Geographic grantee.\nZoo Atlanta's Snyder agreed.\n\"Captive breeding is just one tool to help conserve giant pandas,\" Snyder emphasized. \"The wild population and its habitat must also be protected. I don't want pandas to only be found in zoos in the future.\""}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Panda Bear - Description, Habitat, Image, Diet, and Interesting Facts", "url": "https://animals.net/panda-bear/", "text": "The Panda bear is a large mammal native to central China. These bears are also known as giant pandas, or simply pandas. Though they famously dine on bamboo, pandas are bears, and scientists still classify them as carnivores. While they will occasionally feed on eggs, rodents, or birds, over 99% of this bear\u2019s diet comes from bamboo plants. Read on to learn about the panda bear.\nDescription of the Panda Bear\nPandas are probably the most easily recognized bear in the world. Their fur is starkly contrasting patches of black and white, with black ears and black eye patches. Their legs, shoulders, and tail are also black, and the rest of their body is white.\nPandas, like most bears, have short tails, measuring between 4 and 6 inches long. They are moderately large bears, and males can weigh up to 350 lbs. or more. However, most pandas average between 220 and 254 pounds or so.\nInteresting Facts About the Panda Bear\nThese bears are possibly the most famous icons for endangered species. Despite this, most people have very limited basic information of pandas past \u201ceats bamboo.\u201d\nSix Toes \u2013 Panda bear paws have five fingers, plus a \u201cthumb.\u201d However, this thumb is actually not a digit at all, but a modified bone. The bears use this fake thumb to grip bamboo while they eat.\n\u2013 Panda bear paws have five fingers, plus a \u201cthumb.\u201d However, this thumb is actually not a digit at all, but a modified bone. The bears use this fake thumb to grip bamboo while they eat. Bamboo \u2013 Everyone knows that pandas eat bamboo. In fact, in a single day, a panda can eat between 20 and 30 pounds. of bamboo! Though they will sometimes feed on small mammals and other protein sources, 99% of their diet consists of bamboo. However, these bears are not built for an herbivorous lifestyle.\n\u2013 Everyone knows that pandas eat bamboo. In fact, in a single day, a panda can eat between 20 and 30 pounds. of bamboo!

Bad Diet \u2013 In fact, pandas have the digestive system of a carnivore, and cannot properly digest bamboo. Their main diet does not provide them with very much energy or protein. The only reason that they can digest the bamboo in the first place is because they have special bacteria in their digestive system.\n\u2013 In fact, pandas have the digestive system of a carnivore, and cannot properly digest bamboo. Their main diet does not provide them with very much energy or protein. The only reason that they can digest the bamboo in the first place is because they have special bacteria in their digestive system. Baby Pandas \u2013 Unfortunately, pandas are not born with these beneficial bacteria in their stomachs and intestines. This means that they must acquire bacteria as they grow. Their mother\u2019s feces contain all the microbes necessary to begin this process. While eating poop might seem gross, it is immensely important for the survival of the youngster.\nHabitat of the Panda Bear\nPandas must live in habitats with plenty of bamboo forest to feed from. In addition to high volumes of bamboo, they must also have more than one species of bamboo to survive.\nIn their natural range, most bears live in mountainous regions or valleys. They will also move to various habitats to follow the growth of bamboo shoots, because leaves are much more nutritious, and grow at different altitudes in different seasons.\nDistribution of the Panda Bear\nIn the wild, humans have restricted pandas to a few tiny ranges of habitat. There are populations across a few mountain ranges in central China, but these populations are fragmented. This means that they are far enough apart to prevent breeding between two populations, resulting in lower genetic diversity and increased inbreeding.\nMost pandas reside in the Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu Mountains. Historically, they also inhabited the surrounding lowland areas, but habitat loss has driven them out of these areas.\nDiet of the Panda Bear\nUnlike other bears, and other animals in the taxonomic order Carnivora, pandas are primarily herbivores. The vast majority of their diet consists of bamboo. Because it is so low in nutritional value, they must eat lots of bamboo to avoid starvation.\nThey will feed on 25 different species of bamboo, and prefer to eat leaves rather than stems. Pandas do, however, feed on fish, meat, or eggs when they are easily accessible.\nPanda Bear and Human Interaction\nThe primary dangers to panda survival are habitat loss, poaching, and fragmented populations. Hunting of these bears has occurred for hundreds of years, primarily because their fur is so soft and strikingly colored.\nAs human populations increased, people began to develop more and more land. This reduced the usable habitat for pandas, causing additional decline. Conservation efforts were poorly conducted until the 1990s, and to this day pandas are still threatened with extinction. The IUCN Red List classifies pandas as Vulnerable.\nDomestication\nHumans have not domesticated pandas in any way.\nDoes the Panda Bear Make a Good Pet\nNo, pandas do not make good pets. Even though they are herbivores, they still have carnivore teeth and carnivore jaws. If angered, they could easily injure or kill. Additionally, it is highly illegal to own a panda as a pet.\nPanda Bear Care\nPanda care in zoos has been perfected since the 1950s and earlier. Breeding programs, both within China and in zoos across the world, are essential for the survival of the species. These bears have very low birth rates, and only raise a single cub in the wild, even if twins are born. In zoos, zookeepers can swap out the cubs, or hand rear them, so that both have a chance at survival and future reproduction.\nIn their day-to-day lives, pandas are slow moving and somewhat lazy. Their diet is very low in nutrition, and their behavior reflects this. Because of this, they do not need excessively large enclosures, but still receive environmental enrichment to keep them mentally stimulated.\nBehavior of the Panda Bear\nPandas are lethargic creatures. They do not consume foods that provide high levels of energy, and because of this, are not particularly active. They wander in search of choice bamboo, and will avoid areas where they have to climb steep slopes or burn energy. These bears are solitary, and will maintain a territory to secure the best feeding places. Neither males, nor females, will tolerate other pandas in their territory.\nReproduction of the Panda Bear\nMost panda bears only breed once every two years. Females will only begin to reproduce once they reach the age of four, but sometimes will not produce a cub until they are eight years old. Gestation periods range individually, and can last anywhere from three to five months or more.\nThey sometimes give birth to twins, but only one cub will survive. The surviving cub will not begin to eat bamboo until it is six months old, and will not be fully weaned until it is a year old. It will remain with its mother for up to two years before striking out on its own.\nBeliefs, Superstitions, and Phobias About the Panda Bear\nPandas have been an important part of Chinese culture for centuries. These bears were always regarded as noble creatures, and were even given to other countries as peace offerings. A number of different emperors and empresses have had pandas as pets, or held them in private zoos. One empress even requested a burial with a panda skull!"}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Red Pandas | Cute Red Panda Photos - Animal Facts for Kids", "url": "https://animalfactguide.com/animal-facts/red-panda/", "text": "Sometimes people call red pandas \u201clesser pandas\u201d or \u201cfirefoxes\u201d. But red pandas are actually not closely related to giant pandas, foxes, or even raccoons. Instead, the red panda, with its distinctive round face, red and black fur, and bushy ringed tail, is in a family of its own, Ailuridae.\nWhen red pandas were discovered in 1825 by French zoologist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cuvier, he gave them the name Ailurus fulgens, which means fire-colored, or shining, cat. And with their cinnamon-red and black markings, \u201cfire-colored\u201d is an apt description. Red pandas are about the size of a house cat, with bodies about 56-63cm (22-25 in.) in length and tails about 37-47cm (15-19 in) in length.\nFossils found in North America show that red pandas once lived there five million years ago. But today, their range is limited to the mountain forests of Nepal, India, Bhutan, China and Myanmar. The word \u201cpanda\u201d is thought to come from the Nepali word, \u201cponya\u201d, which means bamboo eater or bamboo-footed.\nRed pandas are one of the few animals that consume bamboo as their main source of nutrition, and they have a few special adaptations for this specialized diet. (Other bamboo eaters include giant pandas, bamboo lemurs and bamboo rats.)\nSimilar to the giant panda, the red panda has a protruding wrist bone that acts like a thumb. This false thumb helps the red panda grip bamboo stalks and tree branches. Red pandas also have powerful molars to gnaw on the tough, fibrous bamboo.\nA red panda must eat 1-2 kg (2-4 lb.) of bamboo per day in order to get enough nutrition. Unlike the giant panda, red pandas prefer nibbling on bamboo leaves and fresh shoots as opposed to the stalks. A female red panda was once recorded as having eaten 20,000 bamboo leaves in one day! Red pandas need to eat so much bamboo because they can only digest about 24% of it.\nThough their diet is made up of mostly bamboo, red pandas sometimes also eat grass, fruit, eggs, insects and small animals. Interestingly, they are classified as carnivores (meat eaters), even though they mainly eat plants.\nRed pandas spend most of the day resting or sleeping. They are crepuscular, meaning they are most active in the early morning and late afternoon. When it\u2019s cold, red pandas wrap themselves up in their bushy tail and go into a deep sleep called torpor. In torpor, their body temperature lowers and their respiration rate goes down. This helps them conserve energy.\nRed pandas are arboreal, meaning they spend most of their time in trees. They have certain physical characteristics that make them well-suited for this environment. Sharp, retractable claws allow them to grip branches and climb down tree trunks head first. Long tails help them keep their balance.\nTheir red coats blend in well with the reddish moss that grows on the tree trunks in their habitat, while their black undersides make it difficult to see them from below. This camouflage helps protect them from predators such as snow leopards and dholes (Asian canids related to dogs and foxes).\nThe soles of their feet do not have paw pads and instead are covered in fur. This keeps their feet insulated in the cold weather and covers the scent glands in their paws, which they use to mark their territory. Like raccoons, red pandas use their paws to scoop up water to drink. Like cats, they wash themselves by licking their paws and then wiping their faces and bodies.\nRed pandas have a few ways of communicating. When threatened, they stare, bob their heads, arch their tails and stand up on their hind legs. They can also scratch and release a foul odor from scent glands at the base of their tail. Though usually quiet, they can produce a range of sounds including \u201chuff-quacks\u201d, warning whistles, bleats, and high pitch twitters.\nFamily Life\nThough normally solitary animals, red pandas pair up during the breeding season from January to April. A female red panda is only fertile for 1-2 days a year. Once pregnant, it takes three months for her to give birth to a litter of cubs. Litters generally consist of 2 cubs, but their size can range anywhere from 1-4.\nA few days before she gives birth, a red panda creates a nest out of twigs, leaves, moss and grass in a tree hollow, rock crevice or under a stump. Cubs are born with thick gray fur. Their eyes and ears are shut. To ensure their safety, their mother moves them around to different dens, carrying them in her mouth.\nAfter about 2-3 weeks, the cubs open their eyes and ears. They nurse for about 3-5 months, and then start eating solid food. At this time, their gray fur changes to red. The cubs fully mature and leave the den after about 18-20 months.\nIn the wild, red pandas live around 8-10 years.\nConservation Status\nAccording to the IUCN Red List, the red panda is considered endangered, and their population is fragmented and decreasing. Threats to the red panda include habitat loss and poaching.\nHow You Can Help\nYou can help red pandas by donating to organizations like WWF and Red Panda Network, which work with local communities to protect red panda habitat and ban the hunting and poaching of red pandas. You can also participate in eco tourism.\nRed Panda Range\nRed Panda Resources\nBlog Posts about the Red Panda"}

During the battles in the past, Chinese would raise a flags with panda if they wanted to call a truce or to stop a battle. Panda is also a symbol of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), international agency that works on the protection of endangered animals.\nBamboo represents 99% of panda's diet. Panda spends 14-16 hours per day in eating.\nPanda can peel and eat bamboo stick in 40 seconds. They sit during the meal.\nPandas have seven time bigger teeth than humans. Big teeth facilitate chewing of bamboo.\nPanda uses 11 different sounds to communicate. Four of them are used during a mating season.\nFemales ovulate once per year and have just a couple of days to make a baby. After mating is completed, female will chase the male from her territory.\nFemale take care of cub on her own. Usually one baby is born. In the case of twins, mother will ignore weaker cub due to lack of energy needed for care of two babies.\nWhen it is born, panda cub weighs only 5 ounces. Mother is 900 times heavier than the cub and it can crush the cub accidentally.\nPandas are solitary animals (live on their own). They demand large portion of the forest just for themselves because they don't have enough energy to compete with other pandas for food, territory and mates.\nAround 240 pandas in the world live in captivity. Pandas are the most expensive zoo animals. They are 5 times more expensive than elephants, because of the huge amount of bamboo they demand on a daily basis.\nScientists are not sure why panda's fur is colored in such a unique way. Color of the skin is specific also. Skin is black under the black fur and pink under the white fur.\nDue to their large size, panda don't have natural enemies. Only small cubs and old pandas can be potential meal of the snow leopard.\nPandas will begin to climb the trees at very young age (before their first birthday). They will become proficient in time.\nPandas don't hibernate like other bears."}

Since 1961, when WWF was first formed, the panda has been the symbol of the organisation and its work to protect biodiversity.\nGiant pandas are recognised around the world for their distinctive black and white coats. They have evolved to feed primarily on bamboo, and consume up to 12.5 kg every day in order to meet their energy requirements. Pandas are also excellent climbers, with cubs able to clamber up tree trunks when they are just six months old.\nToday, giant pandas are only found in the Qinling, Minshan, Qionglai Shan, Liangshan, Daxiangling, and Xiaoxiang Mountains of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu Provinces. They inhabit deciduous broadleaf, mixed conifer, and subalpine coniferous forests between elevations of 1200-1300 metres above sea level.\nOngoing conservation work has improved the number of pandas in the wild, providing hope that it is possible to reverse the decline of species populations through sustained action and political will. The results of China\u2019s Fourth National Giant Panda Survey, conducted with help from WWF and released in 2015, estimated that there were 1,864 wild pandas - a 17% increase in just a decade. However, the long-term survival of these charismatic animals continues to be threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, so ongoing commitment is critical."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Top 10 Fascinating Facts About Pandas - Listverse", "url": "https://listverse.com/2020/07/29/top-10-fascinating-facts-about-pandas/", "text": "WhatsApp Pin Share Email 12 Shares\nLegend has it that a young girl once tried to save a panda from being attacked by a leopard. Giant pandas were all-white at that time and the girl saw the leopard stalking a snow-white panda cub. She jumped in front of the leopard to distract it and give the panda time to escape. The leopard in turn attacked the girl and killed her.\nMany pandas came to the girl\u2019s funeral to honor her memory and commemorate her brave act. The pandas had black ashes smeared around their paws and as they hugged one another in grief and wiped their eyes the ashes smeared, creating the iconic white and black pandas we know and love today.\nAs demonstrated by the above tale and the fact that there are actual panda-hugging job opportunities out there, it is clear giant pandas are beloved animals, but sadly they are also a vulnerable species. It is believed that there are just fewer than 1,900 wild pandas left in the world and an estimated 600 in breeding centres and zoos worldwide.\nOn this list are just a few awesome reasons the world needs to do everything it its power to save the panda from extinction.\nTop 10 Great Nature Mysteries To Puzzle Over Today\n10 Oldest known panda relative\nA study published in 2012 reported that a prehistoric relative of the giant panda had been discovered in Spain after fossil teeth were found near the city of Zaragoza. It is believed that the species, named Agriarctos beatrix, is the oldest known panda relative and palaeontologists have stated that it is over 11 million years old. They also speculated that the prehistoric bears may have had similar black-and-white patterns but was a lot smaller than the pandas we know today. They likely weighed around 60 kilograms and also would have climbed trees to escape predators.\nExperts also suggested that the panda may have originated in Europe and not Asia as previously accepted. However, not everyone was on board with this claim and palaeontologist, Blaine Schubert, said a lot more evidence was needed to support such claims.\nThen, in 2017, it was reported that the fossilized teeth of a \u2018bear similar to a panda\u2019 was found in Hungary. It was found that this species lived on a diet similar to that of modern pandas and added to the evidence that pandas originated in Europe.\n9 Solid food\nWhen a baby panda is born, it is completely fur-less, pink, and blind. It starts growing black hair after one week and after about a month, white hair also begins to grow, giving the little panda its distinctive look. While a panda baby starts walking a lot earlier than a human baby (around 3 months after birth), they start eating solid food at around the same time (around 6 months after birth). At this point they can eat bamboo and start growing faster.\nPanda cubs can also be fed with dog milk as it is similar to panda milk. A panda who lived in a Beijing zoo in 2000, had twin cubs and was unable to produce enough milk for both her babies. This led to her nursing one and abandoning the other. The zoo then ran an advert in a local newspaper for a nursing dog and they soon found a surrogate doggy mom for the abandoned panda cub. Even red pandas can survive on dog\u2019s milk as is evidenced by two red panda cubs that were nursed by a dog in 2009 after their mother rejected them.\n8 Digestive system of a carnivore\nPandas mainly eat bamboo, but it contains very little nutritional value, they must eat up to 38kg every day to sustain their energy requirements. Sometimes wild pandas look for other options, such as small rodents and other plants, which then make up around 1% of their diet.\nAlthough giant pandas are herbivores, they are a member of the bear family and therefore possess the digestive system of a carnivore. They have however evolved to depend almost solely on bamboo which leaves them vulnerable to any form of loss of their habitat. Pandas favour bamboo roots and shoots and enjoy up to 20 different species of bamboo including arrow bamboo, black bamboo, and water bamboo.\nPandas who live in captivity also eat fruit and seem to love apples the most. Some also like steamed corn bread.\n7 Symbol of friendship and peace\nWhile poaching does happen, most Chinese revere the panda bear and consider them not only a symbol of good luck but also of friendship and peace. When someone encounters a panda, they often take to feeding them and if they are found to be injured, local authorities are alerted immediately.\nThe panda is sometimes compared to the symbolic yin and yang because of its distinctive black and white coloring and placid nature which is said to be a demonstration of a balanced, harmonious yin yang. The beloved bear is important in Chinese history with the Shangshu describing it as being invincible and \u2018as strong as a tiger.\u2019\nA panda\u2019s pelt was once considered a magnificent gift for kings and emperors and, during the Ming dynasty, many believed that the panda had medical powers and could repel tumors and plagues.\n6 Pandas don\u2019t roar\nWhile pandas certainly resemble their bear counterparts in shape and size, they don\u2019t roar like normal bears. They do however bleat, making a sound similar to that of goats, especially when mating. They can also honk, growl, or bark and cubs make croaking and whining sounds when they are hungry or want attention. All in all, pandas make about 13 different sounds.\nPandas don\u2019t have the ability to communicate their feelings with facial expressions. They are also unable to wag their short stubby tails and cannot cock their ears. Instead, they communicate with each other by secreting a dark, sticky substance from their anal glands and rubbing it onto rocks and trees. This behavior lets other pandas know whether a female is in heat or whether a particular panda is marking their territory. A panda can glean a lot of information from the \u2018scent marks\u2019 of another panda including age, current mood, gender and reproductive status.\nSometimes pandas also mark their scent by climbing a tree backwards with their hindfeet and urinating in a handstand position. This enables them to leave their scent higher up on the tree.\n10 First Images Of Rare Or Unique Things\n5 Physical traits\nWhile their most distinctive trait is obviously their black and white markings, a panda\u2019s fur does a lot more than just make them look cute. A panda\u2019s face, neck, belly, and rump are mostly white to enable the animal to hide in snowy habitats. Its arms and legs are black to help it camouflage itself in shady spots. Their coat is thick and woolly to ensure protection against cold weather.\nPandas can grow up to 150 cm in height and weigh up to 150kg. Males are usually around 10% bigger and 20% heavier than females. To sustain their bamboo diets, pandas have flat molar teeth that assists them in crushing the bamboo. They also have enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs which aids them in holding bamboo shoots.\nWhat\u2019s more, a panda\u2019s eyes are different to those of other bears and not only because they have black patches of fur surrounding them. Pandas have vertical slits for pupils, the same as domestic cats. The dark patches aid in reducing daytime glare.\n4 Pandas can become irritated and attack\nWhile a lot of time can be spent writing about the docile and adorable nature of pandas, it is a well-documented fact that they can quickly become irritated and launch attacks on humans who bother them.\nGu Gu the Beijing zoo panda had already bitten two people when Zhang Jiao fell into his enclosure after trying to catch a toy that his son had launched into it. Zhang and his son had been playing with a panda doll, throwing it back and forth, when his son threw the toy back a little too hard. When Zhang lunged at the toy, both he and it went flying into Gu Gu\u2019s pen.\nGu Gu bit into Zhang\u2019s left leg, chewed his way through it and then moved on to the right leg. The panda locked his jaws around Zhang\u2019s leg and zookeepers had to make use of various tools to pry the bear\u2019s jaws open. Zhang later said during an interview that he didn\u2019t try to fight back because the panda is a national treasure and he loved and respected him.\nIn 2017, Gu Gu attacked a 15-year-old boy who climbed into the pen to \u2018get a closer look.\u2019 Gu Gu also bit a drunken tourist who tried to hug him. Bizarrely, the tourist bit back.\n3 Low birth rate\nEvery time a panda gives birth, especially to twins, zookeepers are ecstatic. Panda breeding is exceptionally difficult and so it becomes a major, global event whenever a baby panda is born. In 2015, a giant panda named Mei Xiang gave birth to two cubs at the Smithsonian National Zoo. The excitement was palpable and nearly 900,000 people tuned into the \u2018Panda Cam\u2019 during and after the event.\nFemale pandas only ovulate once a year, giving a male panda a tiny 40-hour window to inseminate the female. Should the male panda fail in doing so, zookeepers have to monitor the female for a full year before another opportunity arises. Sometimes males are clueless as to how to mount the females, which also means a missed opportunity. For this reason, many zookeepers opt to artificially inseminate female pandas. However, in most cases, it is impossible for zookeepers to tell whether a female is pregnant until just before she delivers her baby. Some female pandas produce \u2018pregnancy hormones\u2019, build nests and sleep more often even when they are not pregnant. It is also extremely difficult for experts to locate a foetus by means of an ultrasound as they are so small. So small in fact, that sometimes the female\u2019s stool is mistaken for a baby.\n2 Discovery of the giant panda\nAs recently as 150 years ago, only a few people had set eyes upon or even knew that the giant panda existed. The first Westerner to become aware of the existence of pandas was a French missionary named Armand David, who received the skin of a panda from a hunter in Sichuan on 11 March 1869. David is believed to have seen a live panda on 1 April 1869, making him the first Westerner to have encountered one. He attempted to send the animal to Paris, but sadly the panda died in transit. David proceeded to send a specimen to a Paris museum where a zoologist examined it. The zoologist, Alphonse Milne-Edwards, published a paper in 1870, declaring the panda a new species named \u201cAiluropoda melanoleuca.\u201d\nThe first Westerner to \u2018own\u2019 a live panda was German zoologist, Hugo Weigold, who bought a panda cub in 1916. Kermit and Theodore Roosevelt Jr. became known as the first Westerners to shoot a panda, which they did in the 1920s.\n1 Future of giant pandas\nA national treasure in China, wild giant pandas have rebounded somewhat in the last few years and had their \u2018endangered\u2019 status updated to \u2018vulnerable\u2019 after a population growth of 17% in the past decade. The World Wide Fund (previously the World Wildlife Fund) protects wild pandas by securing their habitat and protecting it from human development and encroachment. The work of the WWF-China and its partners include the preservation of panda corridors across China, including 34 million acres, two large river basins and three provinces.\nThe WWF has been working alongside the government since 1981 to implement initiatives to bring the panda back from the brink of extinction. Panda reserves protect two-thirds of wild pandas as well as bamboo forests located in mountainous regions. Along with protecting pandas, these measures also ensure shelter for a vast number of other species.\n10 Ageless Animals That Do Not Grow Old\nfact checked by Jamie Frater\nWhatsApp Pin Share Email 12 Shares"}

If you guessed the giant panda, you're right! The giant panda is also known as the panda bear, bamboo bear, or in Chinese as Daxiongmao, the \"large bear cat.\" Actually, its scientific name means \"black and white cat-footed animal.\" Giant pandas are found only in the mountains of central China. They live in dense bamboo and coniferous forests at altitudes of 5,000 to 10,000 feet. The mountains are covered in heavy clouds with torrential rains or dense mist throughout the year. Giant pandas are bear-like in shape with striking black and white markings.The ears, eye patches, legs , and shoulder band are black. The rest of the body is whitish. Adults are 4 to 6\nLing-Ling, at age 23, died in December 1992.\nGiant pandas are among the rarest mammals in the world. There are probably less than 1,000 left in the wild. Although adult giant pandas have few natural enemies, the young are sometimes preyed upon by leopards. Habitat encroachment and destruction are the greatest threats to the continued existence of the giant panda. This is mainly because of the demand for land and natural resources by China's 1 billion inhabitants. To offset this situation, the Chinese government has set aside 11 nature preserves where bamboo flourishes and giant pandas are known to live.\nGiant pandas are being poached, because their dense fur carries a high price in illegal markets in the Far East. The Chinese government has imposed life sentences for those convicted of poaching giant pandas. The low reproductive capacity of the giant panda makes it more vulnerable to these threats, and less capable of rebounding from its low numbers. In 1984, due to its decreasing numbers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the giant panda as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act. This means it is considered in danger of extinction throughout all of its range.\nThis protection also prohibits giant pandas from being imported into the U.S. except under certain conditions.

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant panda - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda", "text": "\"Panda\" redirects here. For other uses, see Panda (disambiguation)\nThe giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca, is a bear. It lives in south central China.\nAlthough it belongs to the order Carnivora, the panda's diet is 99% bamboo. Pandas in the wild occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents or carrion. In captivity, they may get honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.\nThe giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan province, but also in the Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. As a result of farming, deforestation and other development, the panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.\nGiant pandas are bears. They have black and white fur all around them. The black fur is on their ears, around their eyes, on their legs, and on their shoulders.\nGiant pandas are about the size of an American black bear. They are about 3 feet (91 cm) tall at the shoulder when they are standing on all four legs. They are about 6 ft (180 cm) long. Males weigh up to 251 pounds (114 kg) in the wild. Females usually weigh less than 220 pounds (100 kg).\nLiving areas [ change | change source ]\nWild giant pandas have lived in the mountains of central China. They live in forests of tall trees. They eat the bamboo that grows under the trees. The weather is rainy and misty in the mountain forests. There are thick clouds almost all the time.\nFood and water [ change | change source ]\nBamboo is the main diet of pandas. Ninety-nine percent of the food they eat is bamboo. They eat as much as 40 pounds (18 kg) of bamboo every day. They spend 10 to 16 hours every day looking for food and eating it.\nBamboo is a grass. Sometimes giant pandas eat other grasses. They also eat little rodents or musk deer babies (fawns). In zoos, giant pandas eat bamboo, sugar cane, vegetables, and fruit.\nGiant pandas get a lot of water from the bamboo they eat. They need more water though. They drink from the freshwater streams and rivers in the mountain. Melting snow high in the mountains runs into these streams and rivers.\nKinds of giant pandas [ change | change source ]\nThere are two kinds of giant pandas. They both live in China. The best known is the black and white panda. Its scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca melanoleuca.\nThe other giant panda has dark brown and light brown fur. Its skull is smaller than the other giant panda. It has larger molars. This panda lives only in the Qinling Mountains. Its scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca qinlingensis.\nBaby pandas [ change | change source ]\nGiant pandas are ready to have babies (cubs) when they are between the ages of four and eight years. They may be able to have babies until about age 20. Female pandas are ready to have a baby only once a year. This is in the springtime. There are only two or three days during which a baby panda can form in the mother's belly. Calls and scents bring the males and female pandas to each other.\nFemale pandas may give birth to two young. Usually only one lives. Giant panda cubs may stay with their mothers for up to three years. Then they leave her for a life of their own.\nGiant pandas and people [ change | change source ]\nToday, the giant panda is a symbol for China. It is protected by the Chinese government. Killing a giant panda is a crime. The giant panda may become extinct. It will die out if the forests of bamboo continue to disappear.\nPeople outside of eastern Asia did not know about the giant panda until 1869. The first \"Westerner\" to see a live panda was a German zoologist in 1916. In 1936, Ruth Harkness became the first Westerner to bring a live giant panda out of China. It was a cub (baby panda) named Su-Lin. The cub was taken to live at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago.\nIn the 1970s, China began showing giant pandas in zoos in the United States and Japan as a type of diplomacy. This happened until 1984, when China changed how this was done. Starting in 1984, China would allow zoos to keep the giant pandas for 10 years, but the zoo would have to pay China up to $1,000,000 each year. Also, the zoo would have to agree that any cubs born would belong to China.\nOne of three giant pandas at the Atlanta Zoo\n17 cities outside China have zoos with giant pandas.\nNorth America\nEurope\nCopenhagen, Denmark\nAsia\nThe Adelaide Zoo in Adelaide, Australia received two giant pandas in 2009.\nEndangered animal [ change | change source ]\nThe giant panda is an endangered species. It may become extinct. In 2013, it was estimated that there were less than 2,500 mature giant pandas living in the wild. Illegal hunting is no longer a problem. Hunting for pandas is a crime. The penalties are harsh if you hunt pandas.\nThe greatest threat to survival is the loss of living areas. People are ruining the areas where pandas live. They are cutting down trees. They are building farms. Groups of pandas are forced to live in small areas. They are isolated. They cannot mix other panda groups.\nGiant pandas eat bamboo. Sometimes the bamboo dies off. At one time, pandas could move to an area where bamboo was still growing. Moving has become more and more difficult. People are living and working in panda areas. Pandas cannot move about as freely as they once did.\nHelping pandas to survive [ change | change source ]\nChina set up the first giant panda nature reserve in 1963. Other nature reserves were also set up. There were 40 giant panda reserves in 2006.\nRelated pages [ change | change source ]\nOther websites [ change | change source ]"}

Giant pandas' lovability and renown has fueled protection programs.\nChina has tried hard to protect its lovely giant pandas. Most panda conservation work has involved protecting their habitat, making laws to punish hunters and smugglers, and captive breeding.\nOn September 5th, 2016, the IUCN announced that giant pandas had been removed from the endangered list. Now their new designation is \"vulnerable\".\nGiant Panda Numbers Are Increasing - from 1,114 to 1,864 in 26 years\nAccording to the World Wildlife Fund's research, in 1988 wild panda numbers were 1,114. In 2003, numbers grew to 1,596. And in 2014, the wild giant panda population was 1,864!\nHow China Is Saving the Giant Panda - Habitat Protection, Captive Breeding, Laws\nThe government has adopted a three-pronged approach to promote the survival of the giant panda as a wild animal species:\nProtecting the giant panda's habitat\nCaptive breeding and introducing pandas to the wild\nLaws to stop panda hunting\nRecommended tours:\n1. Habitat Protection - 13 Giant Panda Nature Reserve Areas\nWolong Nature Reserve Wolong Nature Reserve\nThe most important work to save the giant panda is to protect their habitat. Without this, pandas could only survive in captivity.\nTo protect giant panda's habitat, China government has set 13 panda nature reserve areas. In the areas, farming fields have been left to grow back as forest. Trees and bamboo have grown well, and habitat are recovering. Also farming practices around the forests have been reduced or separated from the reserve areas.\nAccording to government research in 2015, habitat for giant pandas has grown by about 2,720 km2, (almost the area of Yosemite National Park), compared to in 2003. At 25,770 km2, panda habitat is now almost twice the size of Serengeti National Park.\nIn the reserve areas, conservation staff live and work to rescue sick or starving pandas, and to stop smugglers from hunting giant pandas.\n2. Captive Breeding - Research, Education, and Returning to Wild\nGiant panda baby Giant panda baby\nIn 1980s, much of the bamboo on the Qionglai Mountains (the giant panda's main habitat area) died. Thus many giant pandas were starving, and were rescued to Chengdu Zoo.\nIn 1987, to separate the research work, the Chengdu Panda Center was established for giant panda research. The original six starving giant pandas have bred more than 150 pandas since then!\nUnlike ordinary zoos or attractions, panda research centers focus on research and breeding. There are several panda centers around Chengdu to breed pandas, educate people about protecting pandas, and to do research to help save this lovely species.\nSome research centers, like Dujiangyan Panda Valley, prepare the captive-bred pandas to be introduced into the wild.\n3. Laws and Stiff Penalties - Over 10 Years in Jail for Hunting or Smuggling Giant Pandas\nGiant pandas are the national treasure of China. Giant pandas are the national treasure of China.\nThe giant panda is known as the 'national treasure' of China. It's one of the \"first class protected species\" according to China's Wild Animal Protection Law.\nIn the past, there was much hunting of giant pandas and smuggling of their pelts and body parts, so China's government established laws and severe penalties to protect giant pandas from hunting and smuggling.\nNow the law states that panda hunting/smuggling carries a minimum jail sentence of 10 years and a fine. Life imprisonment and the death penalty may be employed in extreme cases.\nWhy the Giant Panda was Endangered - Mainly Habitat Reduction\nThere are many reasons that caused giant pandas to be endangered. But the main reason was disappearing habitat.\nHabitat reduction (people's logging and farming practices)\nFood decreased (bamboo dying off)\nLow reproductivity (1 cub in 2 years) and low survival rate for panda cubs\nPoaching and hunting\nBamboo is giant pandas' main food. Bamboo is giant pandas' main food.\n1. Giant panda habitat was reduced gradually by farming and forestry. As China's population increased around giant pandas' habitat the forest was cut down by hill farmers.\n2. Because their habitat was decreasing, giant pandas had to move up to higher mountain areas, which had few bamboo species. When these species declined, giant pandas didn't have enough food.\n3. Giant pandas only give birth to 1 or 2 cubs at a time. However, especially in a tougher environment, they usually can't raise both. They usually get pregnant every two years at most, but the decreases in their population made it increasingly difficult for females to find a mate, so reproductivity decreased.\n4. After giant pandas were discovered by foreigners in the late 1800s, more were poached, and many more were shot for their fur. Though poaching stopped after the 30s due to war and the new regime, locals continued to hunt pandas for food and fur, and smuggling was again rampant in the 80s.\nThe giant pandas couldn't adapt quickly enough to their environmental changes and human persecution, and were declared endangered in 1990.\nSee How China Protects Its Giant Pandas for Yourself\nIf you are interested in seeing giant pandas, and want to visit a research center or panda habitat in person, don't hesitate to contact us to create a panda tour according to your interests and requirements.\nYou can see our interesting giant panda experiences below for inspiration."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Red panda | Smithsonian's National Zoo", "url": "https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/red-panda", "text": "Physical Description\nRed pandas can be easily identified by their unique ruddy coat color, which acts like camouflage within the canopy of fir trees where branches are covered with clumps of reddish-brown moss and white lichens.\nThey have large, round heads and short snouts with big, pointed ears. Their faces are white with reddish-brown \u201ctear\u201d marks that extend from the eyes to the corner of the mouth. These markings could have evolved to help keep the sun out of their eyes. Their tails are marked with alternating red and buff rings.\nRed pandas have a soft, dense woolly undercoat covered by long, coarse guard hairs. Long, bushy tails help these arboreal animals maintain balance and protect them from harsh cold and winds. Dense fur completely covers their feet which have five, widely separated toes and semi-retractable claws.\nRed pandas scent-mark territories using anal glands and urine, as well as scent glands located between their footpads. These scent glands on the bottom of red pandas\u2019 feet exude a colorless liquid that is odorless to humans. The red panda tests odors using the underside of its tongue, which has a cone-like structure for collecting liquid and bringing it close to a gland inside its mouth. It is the only carnivore with this adaptation.\nRed pandas are skilled climbers, using trees for shelter, to escape predators and to sunbathe in the winter. Their ankles are extremely flexible, and the fibula and tibia are attached in such a way as to allow the fibula to rotate about its axis. These features make it possible for red pandas to adeptly climb headfirst down tree trunks.\nIn contrast with other carnivores their size, red pandas have extremely robust dentition. They also have a simple carnivore stomach, despite their predominantly leaf-based diet. Red pandas share the giant panda\u2019s pseudo-thumb, a modified wrist bone used to grasp bamboo when feeding.\nRed pandas are the only living member of the Ailuridae family, and their taxonomic position has long been a subject of scientific debate. They were first described as members of the raccoon family (Procyonidae) \u2014 a controversial classification \u2014 in 1825, because of ecological characteristics and morphological similarities of the head, dentition and ringed tail. Later, due to some agreements in DNA, they were assigned to the bear family (Ursidae).\nMost recent genetic research, however, places red pandas in their own, independent family: Ailuridae. Molecular phylogenetic studies show that red pandas are an ancient species in the order Carnivora (superfamily Musteloidea) and are probably most closely related to the group that includes skunks, raccoons and weasels.\nWhile originally thought to be two subspecies, new genetic studies suggest that there are two distinct species of red panda: Ailurus fulgens fulgens and Ailurus fulgens styani (also known as Ailurus fulgens refulgens). The latter tends to be larger and deeper red in color than the former."}

They\u2019re distinguishable by their thick red fur, short snouts, and pointed ears, but what really sets these mammals apart are their bushy ringed tails and the teardrop-shaped markings below their eyes.\nRed pandas spend most of their lives in trees, using their semi-retractable claws to move between branches and forage for food. The red panda is an endangered species with a declining population, though the exact number of surviving individuals is difficult to establish because of its shy and secretive nature. Here are 15 more facts you may not know about these furry red mammals.\nFast Facts Common Name : Red panda\n: Red panda Scientific Name : Ailurus fulgens\n: Ailurus fulgens Average Lifespan in the Wild : 8 to 10 years\n: 8 to 10 years Average Lifespan in Captivity : 13 years\n: 13 years IUCN Red List Status : Endangered\n: Endangered Current Population: Less than 10,000 individuals\n1. Red Pandas Have Pseudo-Thumbs\nLike giant panda bears, red pandas have a pseudo-thumb, which is basically an extended wrist bone that can function as a thumb but isn\u2019t a true appendage. These \u201cthumbs\u201d help red pandas grip and grasp objects like bamboo and tree branches to feed and move about. According to a 2015 study, the false thumbs were inherited from a primitive member of the red panda family that also lived in trees but had more carnivorous eating habits.\nAnita Csejtei / EyeEm / Getty Images\n2. They Are Not Closely Related to Giant Pandas\nDespite sharing a name, red pandas aren\u2019t in the same family as giant pandas. Red pandas were initially described as members of the raccoon family (Procyonidae) due to their similar heads and tails. More recent discoveries have placed red pandas in their own distinct scientific family known as Ailuridae, more closely related to skunks and weasels than to the giant panda bear.\n3. Red Pandas Were Recently Separated Into Two Species\nWhile the red panda was originally thought to be one species made up of two subspecies, new genetic studies have found that there are actually two distinct species of the red panda: the Himalayan red panda and the Chinese red panda. Researchers in China found that two separate species had formed about 250 thousand years ago when populations were divided by the Yalu Zangbu River. The Himalayan red panda tends to have more white on its face, while the Chinese red panda is larger with darker fur.\n4. They Primarily Eat Bamboo\nRed pandas feed selectively on the leaf tips and shoots of the bamboo plant \u2014 they prefer short and robust bamboo shoots over tall ones. Although their digestive system is not very good at processing the cellulose components of the plant cell, bamboo makes up 90% of their meals, while the remaining 10% is mostly comprised of berries, eggs, mushrooms, flowers, birds, and maple and mulberry leaves.\n5. They Have the Digestive System of a Carnivore\nRed pandas aren\u2019t strict vegetarians; they also forage for insects, grubs, and even birds and small mammals. They have the digestive anatomy of a carnivore that specializes in digesting protein and fats rather than the plant fibers and carbohydrates that make up most of their meals. Red pandas also possess traces of the umami taste receptor gene TAS1R1, which allows them to perceive components of meat and other protein-rich foods.\n6. Red Pandas Are One of Earth\u2019s Living Fossils\nFossils found at the Gray Fossil Site in Tennessee suggest that ancient relatives of the living red panda inhabited North America between 4.5 and 12 million years ago. Known as the Bristol\u2019s panda (Pristinailurus bristoli), the ancient panda was first discovered in 2004, when researchers from East Tennessee State University found skeletal fragments and a single tooth at the famous fossil site. The fossils were found to belong to an undiscovered ancient species and a more complete jawbone specimen was uncovered a few years later.\n7. Red Pandas Are Born Covered in Fur\nDavid Gray / Getty Images\nBaby red pandas are about as cute as you\u2019d imagine, weighing anywhere from 3 to 4 ounces at birth. Cubs are born completely covered in fur to protect them from their high altitude cold environments. Red panda offspring stay with their mothers until they are fully grown, which takes about a year.\n8. They Have a High Mortality Rate in the Wild\nRed panda females have low birth rates in the wild and on average only deliver two cubs per year. What\u2019s worse, panda mortality rate is high in their wild habitats, where parasites are also a concern. A study of Nepalese red pandas found that they are highly susceptible to deadly endoparasites, with a parasite prevalence of 90.80% in the population studied.\nSimilar issues are recorded in captive red pandas. Records of institutions holding captive red pandas in Europe between 1992 and 2012 revealed that 40.2% of total panda deaths were among cubs under 30 days of age, with pneumonia listed as the most common cause of death.\n9. They Can Digest Cyanide\nRed pandas can digest over 40 different species of bamboo. Like giant pandas, red pandas have evolved to neutralize cyanide in their guts as they feed on bamboo, which contains abundant cyanide compounds. The combination of their cyanide-digesting gut microbes with other commonalities like pseudo-thumbs and genomic signature suggests that giant panda and the red panda evolved these common traits and gut microbiota independently to adapt to their overlapping bamboo diet.\n10. Adult Red Pandas Stick to Themselves Outside of Mating Season\nAdult red pandas typically live alone, rarely interacting with others outside of the early winter mating seasons. Female pandas give birth in the spring or summer after a gestation period of about 114 to 145 days when they also work on collecting sticks, grass, and leaves to make nests in hollow trees or rock crevices.\nRed pandas have an extremely narrow birth window. In a 2018 study examining reproductive seasonality in carnivorous mammals, 80% of all red panda births took place within 35 days of each other.\n11. Red Pandas Are Confined to the Eastern Himalayas\nRed pandas live in high forest mountains from northern Myanmar in Burma all the way to the west Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces in China, but they are also found in Nepal, India, and Tibet. They can sometimes be found in other high mountains, but the World Wildlife Fund believes that about 50% of their range is confined to the Eastern Himalayas. The loss of nesting trees and bamboo due to deforestation and forest clearing is majorly responsible for the decline in red panda populations across their range.\n12. They Live at High Altitudes\nNatalia / 500px / Getty Images\nPreferring high forested mountain habitats, red pandas have adapted to endure extremely high altitudes. In Bhutan, for example, a survey of red pandas between 2007 and 2009 found that a majority of red pandas were confined to cool broadleaf and conifer forests between 7,800 to 12,000 feet above sea levels on south and east-facing slopes. While this was the majority of recorded habitats, some were found living in forests at almost 14,400 feet above sea level.\n13. They Are Endangered\nThe IUCN lists red pandas as endangered and believes that the population has declined by 50% over the past three generations. Unfortunately, this decline is projected to continue due to the poor survival rate of the species in certain regions, habitat loss, and fragmentation. Species of Himalayan bamboos that make up a vast majority of the red panda\u2019s diet are also sensitive to environmental degradation, deforestation, fire, and overgrazing. In addition, reduced canopy cover as land is cleared for agriculture or development increases wind and water stress for both mature bamboo plants and new seedlings.\n14. The Demand for Red Panda Pelts Is Increasing\nAn increase in red panda pelt seizures has suggested more interest in illegal trade, and a 2020 study published in Human Dimensions of Wildlife set out to discover why. Researchers were able to document socio-cultural perspectives affecting panda conservation in Nepal by interviewing local people, reviewing media, and consulting experts. Interestingly, the study found that a majority of people living in red panda habitats didn\u2019t show negative perceptions of the species to society or positive perceptions about its economic value and that they rarely had any medicinal, cultural, or religious significance.\n15. Red Panda Conservationists Have High Hopes for Nepal\nCurrently, 14.23% of the entire country of Nepal represents a suitable habitat for the red panda, making the country a perfect setting for potential panda conservation. However, while a limited number of red pandas are found in Nepal\u2019s Langtang National Park, Annapurna Conservation Area, Sagarmatha National Park, Manaslu Conservation Area, Makalu Barun National Park, and Kanchenjunga Conservation Area, more than 75% of potential red panda habitat in the country falls outside of protected areas.\nSave the Red Panda Support the World Wildlife Fund in its fight to protect red pandas within their natural habitat throughout India, Nepal, and Bhutan.\nBecome an ambassador for the Red Panda Network, a non-profit that helps raise awareness for the red panda and empower local communities in red panda habitat countries.\nHelp put a stop to deforestation in the Eastern Himalayan areas suitable for red panda habitat by getting involved in efforts organized by the Rainforest Trust."}

It is becoming widely used in China for international contexts, for instance, as the mascot of 2008 Beijing Olympics.\nAccording to the third national survey on wild giant panda population, there are less than 1,600 pandas around the world. Giant panda has been listed as one-level protected animal in China. Until to October, 2011, the total amount of captive giant panda in China is 333. The wild panda lives for 18-20 years, while the captive panda exceeds 30 years. Giant pandas in China mainly inhabit in Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces.\nInhabiting Environment\nGiant panda prefer to madid surrounding, so in China, giant panda inhabit in mountains and valleys along the upper reaches of Yangtze River, where the humidity is often above 80% all the year round due to the influence of southeast monsoon. The habitat of panda in China covers an area of 20,000 square kilometers stretching across Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. Their active area is in the gentle slope belt under 20\u2103 in common, where the temperature is relatively stable and is rich in bamboo and water resources.\nGiant panda live in bamboo forest with an altitude of 2,600-3,500 meters, where the temperature is below 20\u2103 and the air is thin. Some other factors also effect the distribution of giant panda such as bamboo, terrain, water resource or whether hideout suitable for nurturing cubs or hide. Now the artificial disturb is the main element affecting the distribution of giant panda.\nLiving Habit\nEveryday, giant panda spend half the time taking food and another half time sleeping. In the wild, giant panda sleep 2-4 hours between their two meals. Lying low, lying side, lying prostrate or scrunching are the favorite sleep modes of giant panda. In zoo, keepers feed them twice a day time regularly, so pandas can spend the remaining time sleeping.\n99% of food eating by panda are bamboo, sometimes it maybe some wildflowers, vines, weeds even some meat. Giant panda has lower digestibility, so they get enough energy by eating a lot and exhausting quickly. Giant panda ingest different parts of bamboo depending on different seasons. In spring and summer, giant panda prefer bamboo shoot. In autumn, panda focus on bamboo leaf and in winter they live on bamboo stalk. Its daily feed intake as follows: 23-40 kilograms\u2019 bamboo shoots; 10-18 kilograms\u2019 bamboo leaf; 17 kilograms\u2019 bamboo stalk.\nBesides of bamboo, giant panda is keen on water. They have to drink water at least one time on day. In order to take water nearby, giant panda settle close to streams flowing water. During the winter, after the water is frozen, giant panda often break up the ice with front foot or dig a 25*20 meters\u2019 shallow hole to lick.\nConservation\nThe giant panda is an endangered species, the protection of whom is imminent. All studies and conservation activities are put into practice in China.\n1. Protect panda by law\nsentenced to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment for hunting and smuggling panda.\n2.Establish natural reserves. Until now more than 30 natural reserves centering on giant panda have been set up.\n3. Strengthen the work of giant pandas in captivity and breeding. Giant panda Breeding Research Base and Giant Panda Research Center have been established in the northern suburb of Chengdu and Wolong, Aba Prefecture.\nAdd On: Chinese Great Wall\nThe Terracotta Warriors and Horses\nSophie\nQuestions & Answers:"}

They also eat fruit in the summer, as well as flowers and acorns. From time to time they also eat small birds, small rodents and eggs.\nRed pandas can\u2019t process the bamboo very well especially the cellulose so they have to eat large amounts of the high quality leaves and shoots, around 1.5 kgs (3.3 pounds) of leaves and 4 kgs (8.8 pounds) of shoots each day.\nThey have a bony extension of the wrist bone that acts like \u201ca false thumb\u201d that helps them grip the bamboo.\nTheir diet is very low in calories so most of their time is spent sleeping or eating and they can spend up to 13 hours a day searching for bamboo.\nWhen they want a drink they will dip their paws in the water to drink.\nRange\nThe red panda lives in the Himalayas, Myanmar (Burma), Nepal and central China.\nHabitat\nTheir habitat is the cool temperate bamboo forests, and mountainous areas.\nThey have become vulnerable due to loss of their habitat through deforestation and farming and agriculture. They are also threatened due to hunting and poaching mainly for their fur.\nReproduction\nThe breeding season for the red panda is from January to April, and just like the giant panda the female red panda is only fertile for one or two days a year.\nAfter mating the female will either build a nest or find a hollow tree log or small cave to have her babies.\nThe gestation period is about 100 to 145 days the female will give birth to a litter of 1-4 cubs. These cubs will weigh on average 110 to 130 grams (3.85 to 4.55 ounces) and have thick buff and grey fur.\nTheir ears and eyes are closed at birth and will start to open at about 2 -3 weeks. They will stay in the den nursing from their mother for about 90 days and then they will start to venture out and start to eat solid foods.\nWeaning takes place at 6-8 months old and by this time will be about the same size as their mother.\nMaturity occurs between 18-20 months and will leave their mother at this stage so the females can have their own litters and the mother can have another litter of her own.\nThe male red pandas rarely help with anything to do with the cubs."}

The World Wildlife Fund for Nature is the world's largest conservation organization and their logo has incorporated an image of the panda since its inception. Unfortunately, for many years the threat to this species was so grave that they were considered endangered, increasing the possibility of extinction. The reasons for this vary from difficulties breeding in captivity to illegal trafficking. The response from the Chinese government has been to take action and slow the decline of this species. So, is the giant panda still in endangered? At AnimalWised we can happily say that the answer is no. Their conservation status has changed to vulnerable. This does not mean the giant panda is completely out of the woods. The conservation status may have changed recently, but understanding why giant pandas are endangered in the first place will help us to prevent population decline returning in the future.\nConservation status of the giant panda\nAs of 2018, the current estimation of the global population of wild Giant Pandas is 1,864. This is according to a census from 2015, the figures being released by the Chinese government. This number does not include individual animals under one and a half years of age. If we take into account only the adult individuals capable of reproduction, the population would fall to below 1,000. The giant panda population can be broken down into different subpopulations. These subpopulations are restricted to isolated groups along several mountains in China. The degree of connectivity between each group and the exact number of individuals comprising each group is as yet unknown. The survey was carried out by the State Forestry Administration which accounts that the decline in population has stopped, reversed to a 17% increase since the last census. The reason for such population stabilization is believed to be the slight increase in available viable habitat for the animal. Specifically, it looks to the use of nature reserves in protecting the populations. Although the population seems to be increasing, problems still remain. Almost a third of the current population of giant pandas in the wild live outside protected areas. Some historical factors in population reduction such as poaching do not take place to the same extent. Much of this is likely due to the worldwide efforts made to raise awareness as well as increased practical protection in nature reserves. The Chinese government continues its efforts to conserve this species and their habitat. Although the population has increased, it is necessary to continue the maintenance of these areas and support the systems which improve their numbers. If you want to know more about the giant panda bear and its natural habitat, maybe you could take a look at this article on where do panda bears live?\nWhat is causing the giant panda to become endangered?\nHistorically, giant pandas were distributed throughout China, even inhabiting other parts of Asia in Vietnam and Myanmar. Currently, it has been relegated to certain mountainous regions of the Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. Like other animals, there is no single reason for their decline in population. Threats to the giant panda species include: Fragmentation and loss of habitat The construction of roads, dams, mines and other infrastructure created by humans is one of the major threats to the giant panda population in the wild. The creation of roads, finding power sources and mining are all having an affect on the future of giant pandas. Conservationists need to ensure they work with the organizations behind these infrastructures to help reduce their impact. Another factor is the increase of unsustainable tourism in certain areas. The presence of livestock and domestic animals add to the potential adverse conditions to pandas. This is because certain livestock such as horses also consume the bamboo which pandas need to survive and they generally select similar habitats to occupy. It is also possible that livestock can bring in certain pathogens and parasites which can affect panda populations in the wild. However, there needs to be further research put into this area to understand its full impact. Climate change Horses and other animals competing for bamboo is not the only threat to their main food source. This plant has a characteristic synchronous mass flowering which can happen anywhere between 65 and 120 years. Unfortunately, when this occurs, the block of bamboo itself will die. Why this occurs is difficult to determine and remains mysterious in scientific communities. In the past, when a bamboo forest dies naturally, giant pandas could easily migrate to a new forest. This type of migration can no longer take place due to human development and the lack of continuity between forest areas. Some panda populations are at risk of starvation after a mass flowering of their bamboo resources. Additionally, bamboo is susceptible to the greenhouse effect. Some scientific studies suggest losses in bamboo population of anywhere between 37% and 100% by the end of the century. This is based on current projections of plant decline. Loss of genetic diversity Human intervention resulting in loss of habitat, especially deforestation, has had an effect on giant panda populations. Deforestation has lead to a segmented habitat meaning that large populations have equally been segmented. These isolated populations are only able to reproduce with a small number of individuals. Genomic studies have shown that panda genomic variability is wide. However, if inter-population exchanges due to lack of connectivity continue to decline, the genetic diversity of small populations may be compromised. This increases vulnerability to becoming endangered or even extinct.\nHow can we protect giant pandas from becoming extinct\nAs we stated in the introduction, the conservation status of the giant panda has changed from endangered to vulnerable. The levels of threat to populations are on a scale from least concern to extinct. While it is progress that giant panda populations in the wild are no longer technically endangered, this does not mean action does not need to continue. A 2018 article in the journal Animals (Basel) questions how helpful it is to change the conservation status of pandas. While the writers praise the short-term changes leading to population growth, they stress the need to \u201ctake into account the long-term systemic threats to giant panda populations\u201d. This is why it is important to maintain conservation efforts. Past examples include: In 1981, China joined the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) which made trade in this animal or any part of its body illegal.\nwhich made trade in this animal or any part of its body illegal.

Pandas live on high mountains filled with large bamboo forests in the middle of China. The mountainous areas are present in a few of the country's provinces, but the majority of pandas live in Sichuan Province, nicknamed 'The Home of the Giant Panda.'\nPandas didn't always live in the mountains. In fact, they used to live in the lowlands of China, but the trees and forests in the lowlands were destroyed by humans. Because of this, pandas were forced to move higher into the mountains where they now live. The mountains in which the pandas live are usually cloudy and have heavy, strong rains all year long.\nThe Chinese government is now working to save pandas' habitats in the mountains, especially since they're an endangered species, which means they're at risk of extinction. The number of pandas in the world is getting smaller and smaller, putting them in danger of dying out forever.\nWhat Do Pandas Eat?\nBamboo is 99% of the pandas' food, and because they're big bears, they have to eat a lot of it! Even though bamboo makes up most of a panda's diet, they are technically omnivores, which means they eat both plants and animals. This other 1% of a panda's diet may include fish or small prey like rodents.\nTo get all the food they need, pandas can eat bamboo for up to 12 hours straight every day! This is how they maintain their large weights, since they hardly eat meat. Since bamboo is at least 50% water, pandas get much of the water they need from their food, too. They also drink fresh water from streams and rivers.\nLesson Summary\nAn animal's habitat is the place where it lives and that provides all that the animal needs to survive, and a panda is a black and white bear that lives in the high mountains in central China. Giant pandas live in bamboo forests in these mountains and almost completely depend on bamboo for both food and water. This endangered species used to live in the lowlands of China, but moved to the mountains when their homes were destroyed by humans."}

They are about as tall and as heavy as a really big, fat cat. They inhabit the forests of the Himalaya, from Nepal over Burma all the way to China. They spend a lot of time on trees where they eat bamboo, rest and sleep.\nSpecies\nWhat Kind of Animal Is the Red Panda?\nBiologists still hold differing views: Is the red panda really a genuine panda? It shares its habitat with the giant panda it also likes to eat bamboo and has an extra thumb for climbing just like its bigger \"cousin\". Or is it just a kind of raccoon? Its ringed tail and its bodily frame look very similar. Or is it a cat? The red panda is often also called red cat-bear. Biologists have not yet been able to pigeon-hole the red panda, and thus have categorized it as a member of the family of \"Ailuridae\".\nBehavior\nWhat Do Red Pandas Eat?\nRed pandas spend 13 hours per day with looking for bamboo and eating. They put away about 2-4 lb (1-2 kg), which is approximately 20-30 % of their own weight (a little more than 13 lb; 6 kg). So a human weighing 130 lb (60 kg) would have to shove 26-40 lb (12-18 kg) of food in its mouth!\nEnemies and Threats\nDo Red Pandas Have Enemies?\nPredators of the Red Panda mainly include snow leopards and martens.\nAnatomy and Appearance\nWhy Do Red Pandas Have Red Fur?\nBetween the green bamboo plants, the red fur does not seem to be the optimal camouflage. Yet, the trees on which the red panda spends its live are often overgrown with red mosses and lichens.\nWhy Do Red Pandas Have a Bush Tail?\nThe tail of the red panda can be as long as the animal itself: up to 24 inch (60 cm)! The panda cannot use it to hold on to branches, but it helps not to lose balance. When taking a nap, the panda protects its face with its tail and uses it just like a sleep mask.\nSenses and Abilities\nAre Red Pandas Fast Runners?\nRed pandas can run up to 24 mph (38 km/h) on short distances.\nWhat Sounds Do Red Pandas Make?\nYou might think that the Red Panda would growl like a bear, but no, the little redhead whistles and twitters like a bird.

Until then, we can all enjoy some particularly adorable shots of Bei Bei or watch him in action. Beyond being photogenic, the Giant Panda inhabits some interesting traits. We found the following facts about the Giant Panda to be the most interesting and surprising:\nThe Giant Panda is an introvert\nThe Giant Panda in general is not an extremely social animal outside of breeding. They might occasionally look to see what their brethren are up to, but only upon hearing a vocalization.\nThe Giant Panda wasn\u2019t always considered a bear\nUntil 1995, it was believed that pandas were actually a type of racoon. Genetics testing and observation revealed that the panda is, in fact, a bear\u2014though several adaptations make it unusual.\nThe Giant Panda has six \u2018fingers\u2019\nPandas indeed have six digits on the front paws, giving it an opposable thumb ideal for holding onto the stalks of bamboo which it consumes in great amounts.\nThe Giant Panda basically eats one thing\nWhile other types of bears are typically omnivores or carnivores, pandas enjoy a steady diet of 99 percent bamboo. Bamboo isn\u2019t particularly nutritionally dense, but it\u2019s a prevalent and extremely rapid growing food source that can be taken advantage of.\nThe Giant Panda\u2019s gender isn\u2019t obvious at birth\nThe big boy or girl reveal is a little lackluster when it comes to the Giant Panda. That\u2019s because external genitalia in bears doesn\u2019t develop until they are a few months old, but there\u2019s no need to wait that long to solve the mystery. According to the Smithsonian, the bear cub\u2019s sex is determined through DNA analysis.\nThe Giant Panda\u2019s reproduction is impacted by romance\nAccording to National Geographic, Giant Pandas that are crazy about each other produce more cubs than panda couples without amorous feelings toward their mate. Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, the female and male pandas at Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo in Washington, D.C., apparently aren\u2019t that fond of each other as all three of their cubs were conceived via artificial insemination after they failed to procreate naturally. Such an occurrence is common due to efforts to breed the rare animals in the hopes of eventually reintroducing them into the wild.\nWhat do you and your family love about pandas?"}

Chinese folklore recounts the story of a young girl, who had befriended the pandas. After herthe bears were overcome with sorrow and wept at her funeral. The black of their armbands rubbed off as they wiped their eyes, leaving dark patches behind. The pandas then hugged themselves, leaving marks on their hind legs, rumps, shoulders, and ears. This is the reason for the panda's unique coloring.These shy creatures still haunt the forests and mountains of. Though there are less than a thousand left in the wild, the panda has become a symbol of China and of her need to preserve her natural heritage.More than 24 million years ago, bears and raccoons shared a common ancestor. This fact has resulted in a long-stemming argument over the pandas\u2019 closest relative\u2014raccoons or bears. Panda displays physical characteristics common to both bears and raccoons, however, current DNA and serology studies have found that pandas are most closely related to bears, particularly South America\u2019s spectacled bear.\nPHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS\nstill\nunder layer\nHABITAT\nand\nFEEDING HABITS\nand\nBEHAVIOR & COMMUNICATION\nBREEDING\na number\nTHE YOUNG\nand\nTHREATS TO SURVIVAL\nbamboo,\nand\nCONSERVATION EFFORTS\nand\nPandas are similar in size to American black bears. Adult pandas measure between four and five feet in length and weigh between 165 and 353 pounds; males tend to be 10 to 20 percent heavier than females. These creatures are mostly white, with black markings on their ears, arms, shoulders, hind legs, and eye patches. Some scientists speculate these patterns camouflage pandas in the wintertime. Others believe their distinctive coats allow the solitary bears to easily spot one another. Andothers think the pandas\u2019 black eyes and ears make them more intimidating to possible predators or enemies.The thick coat of a panda has a warm, woolycovered by a rougher outer layer. Its slightly-oiled fur prevents water from penetrating its surface as it roams the cool, wet bamboo forests. It has large molars and strong muscles extending from its jaw to the top of its head, which it uses to gnash the tough, fibrous stalks of its primary food source\u2014bamboo.Pandas have dexterous forepaws and extended wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs and help them handle bamboo. They walk upright and have hairs on their feet to retain heat and give them traction on ice and rock.Panda bears first appeared two to three million years ago in the regions of Eastern and Southern China, Northern Vietnam and Myanmar. Today, these bears inhabit six isolated forests in the Chinese Provinces of Sichuan, ShaanxiGansu, though fossil evidence shows they were once found as far north as Beijing. They live in high mountainous regions that contain natural forested areas of fir, spruce, and bamboo\u2014usually from 8,500 to 11,500 feet above sea level. Currently, only 29 small, fragmented regions in the world can support the habitat and diet of the giant panda.Giant pandas are typically solitary creatures except during the breeding season. Pandas usually live in well-defined territories; male territories, ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 square miles, often overlap several female territories, which average about 1.8 square miles in area.Pandas belong to the family of carnivores and have a very similar digestive system to them. But millions of years ago, pandas adopted a vegetarian diet, perhaps because they were unable to compete with other carnivores for food. Giant pandas now feed almost entirely on bamboo stalks, sitting upright and collecting the leaves, stemsshoots with their forelegs. Although 95 to 99 percent of a panda\u2019s diet is made up of bamboo, they will also eat flowers, vines, mushrooms, grass, fish and small rodents.The digestive tract of a panda is only partially adapted to process bamboo. While they have a tough throat, esophagus, and stomach lining, their intestines are short and unable to digest cellulose from plant material. The panda\u2019s inability to extract all the nutrients from bamboo means that they only process about 20 percent of their food (cattle can process about 60 percent of what they eat).To compensate for the lack of nutrients, pandas eat large quantities of bamboo, consuming 33 to 66 pounds of food daily. They will feed for 10 to 16 hours a day, and usually sleep when not eating to conserve their energy.Giant pandas are most active at night and in the hours of twilight. Their eyes have vertical slit-shaped pupils, similar to other nocturnal creatures, which enable them to see in the darkness. Unlike many other species of bear, the panda does not hibernate, though it does move to lower elevations in the winter. Pandas make temporary shelters in caves and hollow trees, having no permanent den. They are for the most part terrestrial, though they are adept climbers and can swim.During most of the year, pandas communicate by scratching on trees and rubbing acidic-smelling anal gland secretions on rocks and tree trunks. Each panda\u2019s scent is unique and is used for personal identification. Pandas often leave scents to attract members of the opposite sex, or to mark their territory.Giant pandas also communicate using their vocal repertoire; they perform up to eleven calls. Courting pandas will make a bleating sound to one another, and opposing males will bark to intimidate each other during the mating season. Pandas also use body language to communicate. Aggressive pandas bob their heads, showcasing their eyes and ears, while submissive pandas hide their eyes with their paws or turn their heads to the side.Panda\u2019s reach sexual maturity between four and seven years of age, and the breeding season occurs once a year. Mating season lasts from March to May, and individual females remain in heat between two and seven days. During this period, a female may mate with several males.After fertilization, the egg dividesof times before free-floating in the uterus until implantation several weeks later. In June or July, the embryo finally attaches to the uterine wall and then continues development. This delayed implantation occurs so that cubs are born during stable climate conditions, between August and September.Female pandas give birth to one or two cubs in a hollow tree or cave. The cubs weigh between three to five ounces\u2014approximately 1/900 of their mothers\u2019 weight. When two cubs are born, the weaker cub is often abandoned by the mother.Pandas are born blind, pink-skinned, white-haired and entirely dependent on their mother. After two weeks, their skin turns gray where black fur will grow. Mothers start suckling their newborns immediately after birth. A cub will suckle fourteen times a day for up to 30 minutes at a time. Mothers will leave their den to feed making cubs vulnerable to predators such as snow leopards, yellow-throated martensjackals. The rate of infant mortality is high due to predators and illness.Infant pandas open their eyes at three weeks and don\u2019t move on their own until 3 to 4 months of age, at which time they start to crawl. Cubs and mothers are often observed playing; the mother will roll her cub and wrestle with it, and the cub will climb on its mother\u2019s back. They begin to eat bamboo at 5 months of age and are weaned at six months. The cub weighs 80 pounds at one year and lives with its mother until it is 18 months old. In the wild, the life expectancy of the panda ranges from 18 to 25 years.Though populations are rebounding after years of decline, pandas continue to be threatened by human activities. There are only about 1,864 giant pandas left in the wild, and habitat destruction is the most immediate threat to their survival. Between 1973 and 1984, the panda\u2019s six remaining habitats were diminished by 50 percent. Many of these forests are exploited by human activities such as logging, conversion to agriculture and livestock grazing.Bamboo also poses a question for the pandas' sustainability. Every 10 to 100 years, a species of bamboo will flower, seed, and die. Though the bamboo regenerates from seed after the first year, it can take up to 19 years before the bamboo is ready to sustain a population of pandas. Once a bamboo flowers pandas are forced to search out other regions forsince a single variety grows in a region.The flowering of bamboo may have once had a positive effect on pandas\u2019 health by maintaining genetic variation, as being forced to different areas in search of bamboo encouraged mating between diverse populations. As human populations increased, however, many forests were cleared for logging, agriculture, infrastructure, railroadsroadways. Now, habitat fragmentation has caused panda populations to become isolated in disconnected forests, and as a result, migration has become much more difficult.Pandas were once poached for their luxurious fur. In Japan, a panda's coat was worth about $176,000 in the mid-1990's. Today, however, strict laws have made poaching uncommon. Instead, the giant pandas are sometimes killed by traps and snares meant forand musk deer.In 1963 and 1964, China established the Wolong National Nature Reserve and the Wanglang Nature Reserve to preserve important panda habitats. The World Wildlife Fund has worked with China since 1979 to reduce human activity in crucial panda habitats, create green corridors, monitor pandasforests for illegal activity, establish panda reserves, create awareness campaigns, engage with local communities, and further educate on conservation. In 2016, the IUCN upgraded the panda\u2019s conservation status from \u201cendangered\u201d to \u201cvulnerable,\u201d after a 17 percent increase in the panda population since 2014. Protected panda reserves now encompass 3.8 million acres of forested habitat."}

They are good climbers and can also swim. They don\u2019t build dens (except to put cubs in) or hibernate. They prefer shallow slopes and solitary living. If it is too cold up in the mountains they head down to the valleys where it is warmer.\nChengdu Accessibility & Restrictions for Visitors\nChengdu is conditionally open and can be visited by foreign travelers.

They use scent markers to avoid one another. Giant pandas don't roar like other bears, but bleat like goats, or or honk, growl and bark to communicate. Cubs whine and croak for attention.\nEating Habits \u2014 14 Hours a Day\nA giant panda eating bamboo A giant panda eating bamboo\nThe giant pandas spend as long as 14 hours eating per day. A giant panda needs about 12 to 38 kilograms of food per day, approximately 40% of its own weight. The giant pandas prefer eating tender stems, shoots and leaves of bamboo, all of which are richer in nutrition and lower in fibrins.\nPandas eat golden bamboo. Each season they eat the best bits. In April the best bit is the woody part. At other times they eat the tips and disguard the wood.\nWild giant pandas eat grasses, wild fruits, insects, mice, even lambs in the surrounding villages and leftovers in rubbish dumps as well.\nRead more about What do Giant Pandas Eat.\nRecommended Tours:\nSleeping Habits \u2014 2\u20134 Hours' Sleep Between Meals\nYoung pandas sleeping Young pandas sleeping\nIn addition to eating for about half a day, the giant pandas spend the rest of their time in sleeping.\nIn the wild, the giant pandas sleep for 2 to 4 hours between its two meals, whose favorite sleeping poses include lying flat on their backs, lying on their sides, lying on their stomachs, stretching their paws and rolling themselves up into balls.\nThe keepers feed giant pandas twice a day at regular times in the zoo, therefore, the giant pandas spend most of their spare time in rest, and they seem very lovely even during their sleeping time.\nHow They Sleep\npandas get into positions of various kinds with their seemingly clumsy bodies. Their favorite sleeping position is putting their hind paws on the trees with their front paws shading their eyes.\nFond of Climbing Trees \u2014 to Protect Themselves\nThe pandas are very nimble in climbing trees and run rapidly in danger. They propose to their partners, run away from danger and evade stronger competitors by climbing trees.\nThe giant pandas also walk into the valley, sneak into mountain villages or residences, which play with round-shaped utensils as toys and later abandon them in the wild.\nOnce in a while, the giant pandas also show their kindness to sheep and pigs by sharing food and rooms with them.\nSolitariness \u2014 They Like Being Alone\nPanda families don't live together. They are solitary, each female having a well-defined range. Males generally live apart, except for in the short breeding season (March to May), when they compete for female attention. Females raise the cubs alone.\nWith an uncommunicative and eccentric temperament, the giant pandas prefer freedom of being alone, and sleep in the daytime and look for food in the night. In addition to one month spent with their partners during mating season, most of their time is spent alone.\nRecommended Tours:\nDocile Temperament \u2014 Seldom Attacking Men or Other Animals\nThe giant pandas have a very docile temperament in most cases, and they often lower their heads or shade their faces with front paws to conceal their true appearances when they come across a man for the first time. Seldom actively attacking men or other animals, the giant pandas always evade them when coming across them.\nHowever, the giant pandas consider their cubs holy and untouchable once they give birth, and they will burst into rage at such small things as their cubs being watched by visitors. The giant pandas can stretch their paws and open their mouths wide like cats to make themselves more comfortable. They can also shake water off themselves like dogs after a heavy rain.\nCommunication \u2014 Scent Markings and Sounds\nMost communication among giant pandas is reached by scent markings left on the habitat, by which they can find their previous partners during mating season.\nAfter finding their partners, they will communicate with sound, which is barely understood by humans, and they will remain silent when simply but playing. Therefore, we could predicate their behaviors simply by their sounds.\nScent Markings for Dividing Territory\nThe secret to keeping peace in the habitat is dividing territory by scent markings. The giant pandas leaves their glandular secretions on tree stumps, walls and ground in their habitats, by which they gather together or evade stronger competitors.\nIn the non-mating season, the giant pandas would walk away as soon as they smell scents of newcomers. In the mating season, the scent of a female giant panda means that she is ready for male pandas to mate.\nIn addition to glandular secretions, urine is also employed by pandas for scent markings. While making markings, the giant pandas usually shake their heads with mouths half open, and then strip the barks from trees where they urine to attract attention of other pandas.\nRecommended Tours:\nReproduction\nMating from March to May\nThe female giant pandas are monestrous, which usually falls in March to May and only lasts 2 to 3 days each time. The female giant pandas will leave their partners after mating and rear their cubs alone.\nGiving Birth from July to September\nA baby panda A baby panda\nGiant panda gestation is about 83 to 200 days, and usually give birth from July to September. Cubs usually were born in hidden hollow trees or natural dens, where the branches and dry hays well-prepared by mother pandas are available. Normally, the giant pandas are monotocous and rarely multiparous. Even the female giant pandas have two cubs at one birth in the wild, they would choose to take care of one and abandon the other.\nOwing to feeding on bamboos, the giant pandas need to spend long time in eating to get enough energy each day, and they will leave their cubs to hunt for food for 2 to 4 hours each day even in their child-care periods.\nRead more about Giant Pandas Life Cycle.\nSee Giant Pandas with China Highlights\nIf you are interested in a panda tour, we can help you tailor-make your own unique tour.

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "The Panda: Characteristics, Behavior and Habitat - My Animals", "url": "https://myanimals.com/animals/wild-animals-animals/the-panda-characteristics-behavior-and-habitat/", "text": "The Panda: Characteristics, Behavior and Habitat\n3 minutes\nEven in Ancient China, this animal was considered unique, not just for its appearance but also for its behavior.\nLast update: 17 January, 2020\nThe panda, also known as the \u201cgiant panda\u201d is a unique mammal. They\u2019re known for a love of bamboo and for being at the top of the list for endangered animals for more than two decades. Presently, they\u2019re less endangered, but they\u2019re still highly vulnerable.\nCurrently, there are more than 2,000 living in the wild, however, many continue to live in captivity in sanctuaries. As a result, they\u2019ve become a symbol for environmental protection and the chosen image for important organizations such as the WWF (World Wildlife Fund).\nThe panda and its characteristics\nIn terms of their size, shape, and behavior, pandas are quite similar to other bears. The most distinctive thing about them is the pattern of their coat, with the recognizable black and white patches around their eyes, ears, and legs.\nObviously, they\u2019re robust animals with a well-developed muscle structure, especially in their front legs. This allows them to climb and swim with ease. They can weigh up to 330 lb and, when standing, can measure over six feet tall.\nThere is one very curious physical feature: they have a sixth finger on their front legs, which they use as a thumb when climbing or reaching for food. It\u2019s actually not a thumb at all but part of the bone in their wrist.\nHabitat and diet\nTheir natural habitat is the bamboo forests and mountain ranges of central China and Tibet. However, most of these habitats have been destroyed, and as a result, sanctuaries and reserves have become vital for keeping the species alive.\nUnlike other bears, pandas don\u2019t hibernate. Instead, they move to warmer areas in the winter and spring. Basically, their natural habitat doesn\u2019t force them to hibernate, so they don\u2019t.\nWhilst their digestive system is best for digesting meat, their favorite food is bamboo. This means that they\u2019re omnivores, being able to eat either vegetation or other animals, such as small rodents, birds, eggs, and insects. However, they only eat other animals very occasionally.\nPandas can spend up to 14 hours a day eating since they need to eat between 26 and 83 lb of food every day in order to meet their nutritional needs.\nBehavior\nPandas are solitary animals and very territorial. They clearly define their territory by urinating and normally don\u2019t look to spend time with other pandas or let other pandas into their space. There are, of course, special exceptions to this.\nThey\u2019re not very active animals, and they limit themselves mainly to eating and sleeping. This means that they\u2019re pretty quiet. Although they have a very striking way of mating.\nPandas reach maturity between 5 and 8 years old and intercourse is normally quite short. A panda can give birth every two years, and it normally takes 3 years for the young to become independent.\nAs one final fact, there is also a subspecies of panda known as a Qinling. They have a coat with the same patterns as a normal panda but with brown patches instead of black. This subspecies is smaller than the giant panda, and research suggests that this color variation is the result of environmental influences.\nIt might interest you..."}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant Isopod Facts - Animals Of The Oceans - WorldAtlas", "url": "https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/giant-isopod-facts-animals-of-the-oceans.html", "text": "Giant Isopods belong to the Clade Euarthropoda, class Malacostraca, and order Isopoda. There are twenty species of giant isopods including Bathynomus affinis, Bathynomus giganteus, Bathynomus brucei, Bathynomus bruscai, and Bathynomus crosnieri among others. The species Bathynomus giganteus is arguably the largest isopod globally. These isopods are close relatives of shrimps and crabs. In 1879, French zoologist, Alphonse Milne-Edwards became the first man to clearly define the genus of giant isopods from samples he and his colleague collected from the Gulf of Mexico. Giant isopods are a good example of abyssal gigantism (deep-sea-gigantism), where animals that dwell in the deep sea are larger than their relatives that live in shallow waters.\nPhysical Description\nThese species are in two groups, giants and super giants. Giants have adults measuring between 3.1 and 5.9 inches long whereas super giant adults are between 6.7 and 19.7 inches long. The maximum lengths and weights for a supergiant are thirty inches and 3.7 lb respectively. The shapes of these species resemble that of their terrestrial relatives, the woodlouse. The axis joining their ventral and dorsal sides are compressed and a rigid exoskeleton with overlapping segments protect their bodies. Giant isopods can also curl up into a ball-like shape leaving the tough shell exposed for protection. Bathynomus have large compound eyes spaced far apart on the head and they also have approximately 4,000 ommatidia units. These species have two pairs of antennae on the head, seven pairs of thoracic legs, and five segments of the abdomen. The first two pairs of legs are for holding and carrying food to the jaws, and the other pairs are for swimming. In color, isopods can be pale lilac or pink.\nBehavior\nGiant isopods are gentle feeders. Researchers also believe that giant isopods live in a constant state of semi-hibernation, probably because they take time between meals due to the low supply of food in their habitat. In addition to the compound eyes, giant isopods also use other senses in the antennae to communicate and move.\nHabitat And Range\nGiant isopods live between 550 feet and 7020 feet deep, however, there is a probability that some live deeper in colder waters. Most isopods prefer clay or mud where they also find shelter and hide from predators. These sea species mostly live in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Japan and also in the South China Sea. Some also live in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, and the West Atlantic Ocean between Brazil and Georgia.\nDiet\nInitially believed to be scavengers, recent evidence suggests that they also eat animals like sponges. In addition, they can stay for long without eating, months or even up to four years but when they are hungry, they do eat a lot at one time. They also eat crab, shrimp, fish, and whale carcasses. Some specimen retrieved from the Gulf of Mexico discovered plastic in the stomach contents although it is not clear whether or not they feed on plastic.\nReproduction\nMost species reproduce during the spring and winter months, perhaps because of the inadequate food during summer. Males have two specialized organs; white appendages on the top that carry sperm and appendices at the bottom which transfer sperm to the female. The male injects sperms anywhere on the softer female after she molts. Females of reproductive age have a brood pouch (marsupium) that holds twenty to thirty eggs when sexually active and it is where the young ones hatch and come out as miniatures called mancae. The eggs usually have a diameter of 0.51 inches. Females do not eat during the brooding period and have limited activity to conserve energy."}

Luckily for giant pandas, they don't have just five fingers on their front paws the way you have five fingers on your hands. They also have an extra finger that works like a thumb and is part of their wrist bone. This gives them a total of six fingers on each front foot.\nGiant panda using six fingers\nJust like an extra thumb would make it easier to catch balls, the giant panda's extra thumb makes it much easier to grab its favorite bamboo snack and pull off the leaves.\nWhy Such a Big Head?\nIf someone says you have a big head, they usually mean you think too much of yourself and are being snooty. But giant pandas really do have big heads compared to other kinds of bears and for a good reason.\nGiant panda eating tough bamboo\nYour favorite foods like spaghetti and hamburgers aren't too hard to chew up, but bamboo is a really tough plant. If you tried to eat tough stuff like bamboo, your jaw would tire out long before you were full. In order to chew the hard stalks and get enough to eat, giant pandas need large, powerful jaws. Their head has to be big to hold all that munching muscle power!"}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Ailuropoda melanoleuca (giant panda) - Animal Diversity Web", "url": "https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Ailuropoda_melanoleuca/", "text": "Geographic Range Ailuropoda melanoleuca, already considered rare in ancient China, is now limited to the provinces of Sichuan, Gansu, and Shanxi in the central part of the country. The total range covers 29,500 sq. km, but only 5900 sq. km is panda habitat (Ward and Kynaston, 1995; Massicot, 2001). Biogeographic Regions\noriental native\nHabitat Giant pandas inhabit montane forests and mixed coniferous and broadleaf forests where bamboo stands are present (Helin et al., 1999; Massicot, 2001). Habitat Regions\ntemperate Terrestrial Biomes\nforest Range elevation 1200 to 3900 m 3937.01 to 12795.28 ft\nPhysical Description In general, A. melanoleuca has a round head, stocky body, and short tail. The shoulder height is 65-70 cm. It is well-known for its distinctive black and white markings. The limbs, eyes, ears, and shoulders are all black and the rest of the body is white. In some areas the black actually has a chesnut-red tinge. The dark markings around the eyes may be the reason for these animals' popularity giving them a wide-eyed, juvenile appearance. An enlarged shoulder and neck region along with a smaller back end gives giant pandas an ambling gait. A baculum (bony rod in soft tissue of penis) is present as in many other mammals. However, in other bears it is straight and forwardly directed, while in giant pandas it is \"S\" shaped and backwardly directed. Giant pandas also have several adaptations to the skull. They have a large sagittal crest that has become wider and deeper resulting in powerful jaws. The molars and premolars are wider and flatter than other bears' and they have developed extensive ridges and cusps in order to grind tough bamboo. A notable feature on these animals is an extra, opposable digit on the hand known as \"the panda's thumb.\" It has caused confusion in the past as to these bears' classification. This digit is not actually a thumb but a pad of skin overlying a radial sesamoid structure (wrist bone) (Ward and Kynaston, 1995; Helin et al., 1999). Other Physical Features\nendothermic\nbilateral symmetry Range mass 80 to 125 kg 176.21 to 275.33 lb\nRange length 1.5 to 1.8 m 4.92 to 5.91 ft\nReproduction Females in this species increase their scent markings as well as become more vocal when sexually receptive. A study between sexually active and sexually inactive pandas suggested that scent markings relate to sexual activity and captive inhabitance could be the cause for the poor reproductive ability. Males may also compete for access to a female (Liu et al., 1998; Ward and Kynaston, 1995). Mating occurs from March to May. The female is in estrous for roughly 1-3 days. There is usually a delay of implantation which can last 1.5 months to 4 months. This may be due to climatic conditions so that the young is born at a fairly stable time. Females are less active as estrous begins, however they become restless, lose their appetite, and their vulva swells. Most of the young are born in August and September. Actual embryonic development lasts about 1.5 months. At birth, giant pandas, like all other bears are blind and helpless; but unlike most bears at birth, giant panda cubs are covered with a thin layer of fur. Newborn cubs weigh 85 to 140 grams. Immediately after birth the mother helps place the infant bear into a position to suckle. Suckling takes place up to 14 times a day and lasts for periods of up to 30 minutes. Infant pandas open their eyes at 3 weeks and cannot move around on their own until 3-4 months and are weaned at about 46 weeks. A cub may remain with its mother up to 18 months (Massicot, 2001; Helin et al., 1999; Ward and Kynaston, 1995). Breeding these bears in captivity has been an incredible challenge. Giant pandas are notorious for their reluctance to breed in captivity (Helin et al., 1999; Milius, 2001; Ward and Kynaston, 1995). (Helin, 1999; Massicot, July 29, 2001; Ward and Kynaston, 1995) Key Reproductive Features\niteroparous\nseasonal breeding\ngonochoric/gonochoristic/dioecious (sexes separate)\nsexual\nviviparous\ndelayed implantation Breeding interval Female giant pandas may breed every 2 years or less frequently.\nBreeding season Breeding is from March to May.\nRange number of offspring 1 to 3\nAverage number of offspring 1.7\nAverage number of offspring 1.5 AnAge\nRange gestation period 112 to 163 days\nAverage weaning age 46 weeks\nRange age at sexual or reproductive maturity (female) 5.5 to 6 years\nRange age at sexual or reproductive maturity (male) 5.5 to 6 years It has been found from studying giant pandas in captivity that they have twins more often than previously thought--roughly half the time. The mother usually selects one and the other dies shortly after (Milius, 2001). Parental Investment\naltricial\nfemale parental care\nLifespan/Longevity One giant panda lived to an age of about 34 years in captivity but that is uncommon. Normal max life expectancy in captivity is 26 years, surprisingly it is sometimes as much as 30 years. Lifespan in the wild is not known (Massicot, 2001; Helin et al., 1999; Word Wildlife Fund, 2001). Range lifespan\nStatus: captivity 34 (high) years\nTypical lifespan\nStatus: wild 10 to 15 years\nTypical lifespan\nStatus: captivity 30 (high) years\nBehavior Unlike many other bears, A. melanoleuca does not hibernate. However, it will descend to lower elevations during the winter. Giant pandas do not build permanent dens but rather take shelter in trees and caves. They are primarily terrestrial, though good climbers and capable of swimming. This species is mainly solitary except for the breeding season. Mother pandas play with their cubs, but not just to appease the young. Some mothers have actually woken the infant to start to play (Helin et al., 1999; Malius, 2001; Massicot, 2001). Key Behaviors\nnocturnal\ncrepuscular\nmotile\nsolitary\nCommunication and Perception Perception Channels\ntactile\nchemical\nFood Habits Giant pandas have an extremely strict energy budget. They travel little and are usually foraging when they do move. Giant pandas can spend 10-12 hours a day feeding. Bamboo, the main source of pandas' diet (over 99%) is a very poor nutritional source but present all year round. Only about 17% of the nutrients found in the leaves and stalks are extracted. These bears make a trade-off to have a plentiful, easily obtained food source but with low nutritional value. Giant pandas are well-known for their upright feeding position which leaves their forelegs free to handle the bamboo stalks. This species has several special characteristics related to eating bamboo. The extra digit on the panda's hand helps the panda in tearing the bamboo. This adaptation also allows increased dexterity while handling bamboo. The stomach walls are extremely muscular to help digest the woody diet; and the gut is covered with a thick layer of mucus to protect against splinters (Ward and Kynaston, 1995; Malius, 2001; Massicot, 2001). Foods eaten include: bamboo stems and shoots, fruits of plant matter like kiwi, small mammals, fish and insects. Primary Diet\nherbivore folivore\nAnimal Foods\nmammals\nfish\ninsects Plant Foods\nleaves\nfruit\nPredation The black and white markings on giant pandas may have served as an anti-predator device in the past when the animals had predation pressure. The black and white pattern might have broken up the outline the bears presented, similar to the effect of zebra stripes. Also, in the past, when these pandas inhabited snowier areas, the white may have helped these bears blend into the surroundings. However, today giant pandas live in almost snow free areas. Fortunately no more natural predators exist for pandas today (Ward and Kynaston, 1995). Known Predators humans (Homo sapiens) No natural enemies today but possibly in the past animals such as tigers\nEcosystem Roles Giant panda population is closely tied to bamboo abundance and vice versa. Pandas help to distribute the bamboo seeds over areas. However, as panda numbers dwindle so does bamboo, making it harder for them to find food. Panda protected areas help to protect native ecosystems. (World Wildlife Fund, 2001) Ecosystem Impact\ndisperses seeds\nEconomic Importance for Humans: Positive Giant pandas have been hunted for their fur. In recent years the pelt has been considered a valuable sleeping mat; it is comfortable but also believed to have supernatural markings which prevent ghosts and help predict the future through dreams. A panda skin is highly valued--in Japan it carries a price tag equal to $176,000. Giant pandas are also popular zoo exhibits attracting many people. (Ward and Kynaston, 1995) Positive Impacts\nbody parts are source of valuable material\necotourism\nresearch and education\nEconomic Importance for Humans: Negative There are no real negative economic impacts of giant pandas on humans, primarily because of their rarity. Panda preserves occupy land that might be considered valuable for harvesting, but the presence of pandas and their economic impact through tourism and preservation of ecosystems is likely to more than make up for any negative impact of reduced development.\nConservation Status Threats to this species include poaching, habitat loss, human encroachment, and trouble breeding in captivity. Tourism around giant pandas' habitat means more hotels, waste disposal systems, cars, buses, etc. and less room for pandas. Remaining bamboo forests in China only support about 1,000 wild pandas. Thirteen panda reserves totaling an area of 6,227 square km make up half of the remaining habitat. Also, the habitat has been broken into about 20 different separate patches. The pandas have trouble migrating from one site to another. Although efforts are showing improvement compared to earlier years, the zoo population of about 100 pandas worldwide has yet to produce enough cubs to maintain itself. The first successful panda breeding came in 1980 at the Mexico City Zoo, however the infant died after 8 days. In August 1999 another cub was born at San Diego Zoo and seems to be flourishing. To protect the population in the wild, the Chinese government has many anti-poaching laws. Some violators of these laws have even been sentenced to death. In October 1989 the first executions for trading panda skins took place. China has also stopped commercial logging. In 1986 an education campaign took place among 5,000 villages. It attempted to teach farmers and villagers about panda protection and discourage them from cutting bamboo. In 1992 the Chinese government approved the National Conservation Program for the Giant Panda and its Habitat. Since the 1980s many programs have been put in place attempting to save these great animals. Success to breed them in captivity is looking more hopeful but in the wild the numbers are still low. Recent Chinese studies have shown that panda populations have actually been stable for 20 years, but all this effort still may not be enough to save this species (Ward and Kynaston, 1995; World Wildlife Fund, 2001; Massicot, 2001) IUCN Red List Endangered\nMore information\nIUCN Red List Endangered\nMore information\nUS Federal List Endangered\nCITES Appendix I\nThere is an ancient Chinese story about how giant pandas got their unique markings. A young girl who was a friend of these bears died and the pandas were struck with sorrow. They wept at the funeral and rubbed their eyes with their arms. The dark color from their arm bands was wiped onto their eyes. The bears then hugged themselves and marked their ears, shoulders, hind legs and rumps, resulting in the pattern seen today. The classification of A. melanoleuca has been a difficult one for researchers to agree upon. Giant pandas have several characteristics in common, like bamboo eating, with red pandas, who have sometimes been considered to be members of the raccoon family (but currently are also classified with bears). Today it is widely accepted with little doubt that that giant pandas belong to the bear family (Ward and Kynaston, 1995).\nContributors LeeAnn Bies (author), University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, Cynthia Sims Parr (editor), University of Michigan-Ann Arbor.\nGlossary altricial young are born in a relatively underdeveloped state; they are unable to feed or care for themselves or locomote independently for a period of time after birth/hatching.

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Why Are Giant Pandas Endangered? (Solved!) | BestofPanda", "url": "https://bestofpanda.com/why-are-giant-pandas-endangered/", "text": "A world without pandas is just unimaginable. Their existence faces threats for many years. Come to think of it, why are giant pandas endangered?\nGiant pandas were part of the endangered species before. The irresponsible actions of the humans towards the pandas and the environment where they live caused this to happen.\nLuckily, their label as endangered species turned into vulnerable species in the past few years. All thanks to the people who do massive actions towards the conservation of the pandas.\nDo you think these people are admirable? What if I tell you that you can support them or be one of them? How is that possible? Let\u2019s find out as we discussed everything you need to know about saving the pandas.\nAre giant pandas going extinct?\nNo, they are not. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announced the giant panda\u2019s official status in the Red List of Threatened Species from endangered to vulnerable.\nThat would mean that the population of pandas is improving as the years pass by.\nWhy are giant pandas going extinct?\nPresently, their status is far from extinction. However, the survival of the pandas in the future is not 100% guaranteed. Here are the reasons why pandas are going to extinct:\nClimate Change\nThe world we live in now suffers from climate change. According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),\nClimate change is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth\u2019s local, regional, and global climates.\nHuman\u2019s irresponsible actions in the environment cause this problem. This drastic change makes pandas and other animals in the world have a hard time coping up.\nModernization\nModernization brought changes to human life and posed threats to animals. Humans extended more and more. To the point wherein humans invaded the places where animals like pandas live.\nIllegal Activities\nRegardless of the existing laws to protect animals and the environment, humans continue to do illegal activities.\nThese include illegal logging, animal poaching, black-market trading, and more. The mentioned problems are the main reasons why there is an increasing rate of endangered animals like pandas and others in the world.\nGiant Panda Populations (How many pandas are left in the world today?)\nBased on World Wildlife Funds (WWF), there are 1,864 giant pandas in the wild. Furthermore, Pandas International (PI) states that there are an additional 400 pandas in captivity. These numbers reflect a total of 2,264\u202c giant pandas in the world now.\nOn the other hand, their relative animals called red pandas are now enlisted as endangered species. This is due to their declining population in the wild. There are estimated around 10,000 red pandas left in the world today.\nWith the present population count and considering the remaining numbers of the existing red pandas, are giant pandas endangered in 2020?\nThe quick answer is no. The enlistment of endangered animals is not just about the number. It talks about their capacity to reproduce and the places where they are expected to encounter.\nWhat causes giant pandas to be endangered?\nHabitat Loss\nIn China, where do giant pandas live, there is a strong force of modernization. This modernization causes invasion of the dwelling places of the giant pandas. They will build infrastructures at the expense of the giant panda habitat.\nAdapting Difficulties\nUnlike other animals, giant pandas are primarily dependent on bamboo. Their digestive system is made for eating bamboo.\nAlthough they sometimes eat other food, it cannot help them live longer without bamboo. So if they are not in places where their food supply grows they will die.\nThis is also the reason why most of the giant pandas are in China. The country where they can live freely in the wild with a sufficient amount of food:\nReproduction Difficulties\nGiant pandas have complicated mating practices. Here are giant panda facts from WWF about breeding that you should know:\nGiant pandas reach sexual maturity at 5.5 to 6.5 years.\nA female can mate with several males, who compete over her.\nA male will seek out different females who are on heat.\nThe mating season is in spring between March and May.\nMales and females usually associate for no more than 2-4 days.\nGestation takes from 95-160 days.\nPandas normally give birth to single young\nTwins are born more frequently in captivity when artificial insemination is used.\nThe reproductive rate is about 1 cub every 2 years.\nAnimal Poaching\nPhoto Source: Quora\nThe thick black and white fur of the panda sells at a high price on the black market. This is mainly the reason why there are still people who illegally hunt giant pandas.\nEven though there are strict laws about it, some people are still doing this animal cruelty.\nOn the other hand, there other species of pandas called red pandas are now enlisted as endangered species. Here are the reasons why their conservation status is becoming worse:\nDeforestation Struggles\nThe continuous cutting down of trees endangers the animals that dwell on them.\nAnimals like squirrels, red pandas, and others lose their habitat. This action forces them to move from one place to another which is hard for them because of their geographical ability to survive.\nAccidental Trapping\nHunters who use traps in the forest to hunt for animals to eat can create great danger among the animals that move from one place to another due to human illegal activities.\nThe traps they set don\u2019t choose what animals to trap or not. So if highly sensitive animals like red pandas are trapped, they are more likely to die.\nIllegal Pet Trading\nRed pandas are undeniably attractive. However, they are not domesticated animals.\nIt only means they can\u2019t co-exist with humans, unlike cats and dogs. Living with humans can cause them extreme fear which may eventually lead to their death.\nAnimal Poaching\nThe bright reddish cappuccino-colored fur of the red pandas makes a good amount of money in the black market. It is the main reason why illegal hunters target them.\nThese illegal activities greatly affected the red pandas. It makes them part of the list of endangered animals in the world. There are more or less 10,000 remaining red pandas in the world.\nPanda Conservation Status\nThe conservation status of pandas is vulnerable. What does it mean? Here\u2019s a description of vulnerable species.\nA creature is considered vulnerable species if:\nPopulation Reduction Rate\nPopulation declines than 30% (for unknown reasons) or 50% (for known reasons).\nGeographic Range\nExistence in the areas where they are expected to live gets lower.\nPopulation Size\nMature individuals are fewer than 10,000 or the total population or decline at least 10% within 10 years.\nPopulation Restrictions\nTheir ability to reproduce in a certain area gets lower.\nProbability of Extinction\nThe probability of extinction reaches 10% within 100 years.\nAccording to WWF, The Red List is the world\u2019s most comprehensive inventory on the global conservation status of plants and animals. Every 5 years the IUCN evaluates the population status of each species and the threats to each one\u2019s survival.\nBased on that information the IUCN assigns each species a category. These categories are:\nExtinct \u2013 the species no longer exist.\nExtinct in the Wild \u2013 the species only exist in captivity.\nCritically Endangered \u2013 the species has an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.\nEndangered \u2013 the species has a very high risk of critical endangerment.\nVulnerable \u2013 the species has a high risk of endangerment.\nThreatened \u2013 the species has a high possibility of vulnerability.\nNear Threatened \u2013 the species will not have critical threats in the near future.\nLeast Concern \u2013 the species has a lower chance of extinction in the future.\nDomesticated \u2013 the existence of the species is normal.\nHow to prevent giant pandas\u2019 extinction?\nStep 1: Donate or Adopt\nThere are dedicated institutions like World Wildlife Funds and Pandas International that aim for the welfare of the giant pandas. You have two options to help them save the pandas.\nTo donate is where you send them financial assistance for panda conservation. On the other hand, to adopt is where you apply for symbolic adoption of the pandas and in return, you will receive items. These items correspond to the adoption level that you apply for.\nStep 2: Take Action\nThere are ways on how to further help them. Help them through direct action. You can join the team that will physically take care of the pandas and their environment.\nYou can also help through indirect action by promoting the concerned organization to other people to increase the support that they will receive.\nStep 3: Be Eco-Friendly\nNever use anything that can harm the environment. Also, discourage any forms of illegal actions towards the environment.\nSimply because no matter where you are, inappropriate action towards the environment will always contribute to climate change, which is not good for the pandas and other animals.\nConclusion\nIn this article, you learned that giant pandas are no longer endangered species. They are now vulnerable species. It is a step away from their feared extinction.\nHowever, people should not let their guard down. They are still at high endangered risk. Nevertheless, there are ways on how to save pandas from the worst-case scenario of extinction.\nYou can reach out to the official and legitimate organizations to know how you can contribute to their advocacy towards the welfare of the giant pandas. You can also save giant pandas, through major or simple actions.\nAt the end of the day, our actions will always have a result. Choose to do what will promote the common good for man, animals, and the environment.\nDid you find this article informative?

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant Panda | Lifestyle + Habitat + Diet + Facts | - Science4Fun", "url": "https://science4fun.info/giant-panda/", "text": "Giant Pandas are one of the cute and famous animals found in the world. The scientific name of the giant panda is Ailuropoda melanoleuca, which is also known as panda bear \u2013 in short, just the panda. They belong to the order Carnivora and the family Ursidae.\nIn fact, they are species of bears, and their native area is the southern part of Central China. It attracts people with its large and black spots around its eyes and ears. Such spots are also seen in its body as well.\nWhat Do They Look Like?\nThey have a prominent black and white coat and exhibit black fur around their eyes, ears, nose, legs, and shoulders. The length of adult pandas, from their nose to hind-part, stretches up to 150 cm; the tail-length can be around 10 to 15 cm. Furthermore, their height from fore-legs to their shoulders can reach up to 90 cm. An adult panda weighs as much as 150 Kg. Their males are 10% larger and 30% heavier than the females. They possess broad and flat molar teeth for chewing bamboo.\nHabitat\nHistorically, a large number of the panda inhabited the southern and eastern parts of China. They were also located in Myanmar and northern parts of Vietnam. But due to urbanization and other human activities, their habitats are shrinking. Which results in difficulties in their survival. But still, the mountain ranges in various provinces China are homes to thousands of pandas.\nDiet\nDespite belonging to the order Carnivora, they are folivore (leaf-eaters). Thus, bamboo shoots and other leaves make up more than 90% of their diet. Occasionally, the wild pandas eat grasses and tubers. They also eat the flesh of birds or meat of mice. The captive pandas, on the other hand, use eggs, honey, leaves of shrubs, bananas, oranges in addition to the specially prepared diet for them.\nThey eat from 12 to 40 Kg of bamboo leaves per day because those leaves have deficient nutritional value.\nHowever, their digestive system has characteristics of carnivore animals (meat-eating animals).\nBehavior and lifestyle\nIn general, they prefer to live a lonely life. However, their home-range is precisely defined by their adult members. Moreover, female pandas don\u2019t tend to socialize with other female pandas.\nPandas communicate with each other by making sounds and leaving their scents. When they wander away from their habitat, they leave their marks behind by urinating, claw-marks on trees, and by rubbing various objects in their path.\nMany pandas are active during dawn and dusk timings. However, some others may be active during day-hours and midnight time. They don\u2019t tend to make permanent homes, because they are capable of taking refuge into hollows of trees and the crevices of rocks. They don\u2019t need to hibernate (long sleep during winters) like other bears.\nGenerally, they remain calm towards humans. But in case they are irritated, they may adopt aggressive behavior towards humans.\nConservation Status\nGiant pandas were considered as an endangered species. However, with the efforts of WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature) and other organizations, their status is now still considered as vulnerable \u2013 no more as endangered.\nSimilar trends have also been confirmed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), based on the data from 2014 and onwards.\nInteresting Facts\nPandas have the ability to climb on trees and swim in the water. They get these abilities mostly after they are seven months older.\nGiant pandas, much like in Kung Fu Panda movie, tend to be sluggish animals. They spent most of their time, either sleeping or eating activities.\nChina has reserved its 3.8 million acres of land for the wildlife habitat of pandas."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Red Panda images!\nRed Panda Classification and Evolution\nThe Red Panda is a cat-sized species of carnivorous mammal that is found inhabiting the temperate mountain forests on the slopes of the Himalayas. As their name suggests, they are related to the larger and more famous Giant Panda (although the exact closeness of their connection still remains uncertain to science), along with also sharing a number of characteristics with the Raccoon and so Red Pandas are classified in a family of their own. The Red Panda is also known by a number of different names in their native regions including the Lesser Panda, the Red Cat-Bear and as the Fire Fox in Nepal. Like their much larger cousin, the Red Panda is an animal that relies on bamboo to feed and with rapid deforestation of these unique areas there is less and less for these animals to eat, which has ultimately led to the Red Panda being listed as being an endangered species.\nRed Panda Anatomy and Appearance\nThe Red Panda is a very cute animal that is about the same size as a large housecat, with a cat-like face and a long, bushy tail. Their rusty coloured thick fur covers their body with the exception of their almost white coloured ears, cheeks, muzzle and spots above their eyes. The Red Panda also has reddish brown stripes that run down either side of their white muzzle, along with alternating light and dark rings on their tails. The Red Panda also has semi-retractable claws to aid climbing and stability amongst the branches and strong, tough jaws which they use to chew on bamboo. Like the Giant Panda, the Red Panda also has an extended wrist bone which acts a bit like a thumb, allowing them to hold onto bamboo whilst they are chewing it. The Red Panda also has dense fur which helps to keep it warm during the cold winter along with having thick and woolly fur on the soles of their feet which not only helps to keep their feet warm but also prevents them from slipping on the wet branches.\nRed Panda Distribution and Habitat\nThe Red Panda is found inhabiting the temperate forests in the Himalayas at altitudes of between 1,800 and 4,000 meters. These high mountain slopes tend to be covered in deciduous hardwood forest with a bamboo under-storey that is crucial to the Red Panda\u2019s survival. Their historical range extended through Bhutan, Nepal, India, Myanmar and China where their range overlaps that of the even rarer Giant Panda, but today the Red Panda is extinct from certain areas and population numbers are rapidly declining in others. Due to the fragile ecology of their native, mountain forests and their reliance on eating bamboo, the Red Panda is being pushed into smaller and more isolated pockets of their once wide range with other factors including climate change affecting the lack of abundance of bamboo.\nRed Panda Behaviour and Lifestyle\nThe Red Panda is a nocturnal and generally solitary animal with the exception of males and females coming together to mate during the breeding season. Red Pandas spend the daylight hours sleeping in the branches high in the tree canopy with their long, bushy tail wrapped around them to keep them warm. Although they are known to feed in the trees, they usually come down to the ground after dusk to begin foraging in the safety of the darkness. The Red Panda is a territorial animal that marks its patch with droppings, urine and releasing a musky secretion from its anal glands. They are also known to communicate between one another using short whistles and squeaks. The Red Panda is a strong and agile climber that not only sleeps safely in the branches during the day but also can dart up a trunk if threatened by predators aided by its sharp claws.\nRed Panda Reproduction and Life Cycles\nRed Pandas usually breed between January and March and after a gestation period that lasts for around four months, the female gives birth to 1 \u2013 5 cubs that are born blind and although they begin to open their eyes within a couple of weeks, the eyes of the Red Panda cubs don\u2019t fully open until they are about a month old. Before her cubs are born, the female Red Panda builds a nest in a tree-hole, roots or bamboo thicket which is lined with leaves, moss and other soft plant material. Red Panda cubs may not leave the nest until they are three months old and are strong enough to negotiate the tricky branches. They feed solely on bamboo until they are old enough to stomach other foods and reach their full adult size after about a year. There is however a high mortality rate in young Red Pandas with up to 80% not reaching full adulthood.\nRed Panda Diet and Prey\nAlthough the Red Panda belongs to the carnivorous group of mammals, their diet is almost vegetarian as bamboo shoots comprise the majority of their food. However, as the Red Panda is a mammal it has a short digestive system meaning that although bamboo holds little nutrition anyway, they are unable to get the most of their meals. Unlike the Giant Panda though, the Red Panda will also eat a variety of other foods to supplement its diet like acorns, berries and grasses, along with grubs, mice, lizards, chicks and birds\u2019 eggs. Along with its excellent sight, smell and hearing the Red Panda also has long, white whiskers on its snout which help it to navigate through the dense vegetation in the darkness of night, when it is most actively foraging for food. For a complete list of foods red pandas eat, check out out \u201cWhat Do Pandas Eat?\u201d page.\nRed Panda Predators and Threats\nDue to the fact that Red Pandas inhabit high-altitude mountain forests, they actually have fewer natural predators than they would have living further down the slopes. Snow Leopards and Martens are the only real predators of the Red Panda along with Birds of Prey and small carnivores that prey on the smaller and more vulnerable cubs. The biggest threat to the Red Panda however is people who have affected this species mainly through deforestation of their incredibly unique habitats. Due to Human encroachment, illegal hunting and poaching there have been drastic declines in the Red Panda population numbers with these populations also being pushed into more separate, isolated areas. One of the main concerns with this is that these populations will although be threatened by inbreeding leading to less successful individuals in these areas.\nRed Panda Interesting Facts and Features\nLiving high in the cold mountain climates means that Red Pandas are well adapted to keeping warm with their dense fur and blanket-like tail. However, on really cold days Red Pandas have been known to sunbathe high in the canopy to warm themselves up whilst sleeping during the day. A study conducted in 2001 found that 79% of the Red Pandas reported where found within 100 meters of the nearest body of water, indicating that a good water source may also to be crucial to their already strict habitat requirements. Evidence also suggests that Red Panda reproduction rates have been declining which is believed to be related to the decline in the foods that they eat in order to survive and reproduce successfully.\nRed Panda Relationship with Humans\nRed Pandas have been admired by people for years but many of the experiences that we have with them are in zoos and animal institutions as these rare and secretive animals can be incredibly hard to spot in the wild. This is however one of the factors in their demise as one Indian village reported that 47 Red Pandas were captured and sold to zoos around the world in just one year. Human interference of their unique and specialised habitats though is believed to be the biggest reason for the decline in Red Panda numbers throughout the Himalayas with deforestation mainly in the form of logging being one of the primary culprits. As with the Giant Panda, the Red Panda relies heavily on high-altitude bamboo thickets to survive and without them it has no-where else to go.\nRed Panda Conservation Status and Life Today\nToday, the Red Panda is listed on the IUCN Red List as being an animal species that is Endangered in its natural environment and is therefore severely threatened by extinction in the near future. There are estimated to be less than 3,000 Red Pandas remaining in the wild with the majority of these inhabiting small protected zones within national parks. A number of captive breeding programs have also been established in Asia, Europe and North America and appear to be having relative success in their work.\nView all 71 animals that start with R"}

Depending on the bear species, habitats include North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and the northern-most polar regions. While not ordinarily a threat to humans, bears are animals that can be very dangerous if startled, provoked, or approached when young bears (cubs) are present.\nTop Bear Facts\nWhile considered a carnivorous species, most bears eat vegetation as their primary food source. In fact, just 10% of a grizzly bear\u2019s diet is meat!\nPolar bears are on average not just the largest bear species, but also the largest carnivorous land animal on Earth!\nDo NOT try to outrun a bear. Black bears can run up to 35 miles per hour, which is significantly faster than the fastest human ever. Even larger grizzly bears can reach speeds that top 30 miles per hour.\nMany bear experts believe bears can smell from up to 20 miles away.\nTypes of Bear \u2013 The 8 Different Bear Species\nThere are eight unique species of bears that vary in size, appearance and food preference. You can predominantly find them throughout North America, South America, Europe and Asia. The bear species types include:\nAsiatic Black Bear (Asian Black Bear) \u2013 The Asiatic black bear, also referred to as the moon bear, is primarily an herbivore bear species found predominantly in Southern Asia, Afghanistan and parts of Japan. They are often found in trees in mountainous areas.\nBrown Bear \u2013 The brown bear, also referred to as the grizzly bear, is found in North America, Asia and Europe. They are most notable by the humps that rest over their shoulders and massive brown physique. These bear species are the least likely to become extinct of all the bears, at this time.\nNorth American Black Bear \u2013 The North American black bear can be found from Northern Canada to Central Mexico. It does not have a climate preference. They will even feed on prickly pear cactus. This bear species prefers mountainous regions. However, you will find them in meadows and wetlands, too.\nPolar Bear \u2013 Polar bears are only found in the Arctic region surrounding the North Pole. They travel by floating glacial ice blocks. As these ice packs melt, the threat to the existence of polar bears increases making them highly susceptible to extinction.\nSpectacled Bear \u2013 The spectacled bear, also referred to as the Andean bear, enjoys spending time in trees. They are the only bear species to reside in South America. These bears are vulnerable to extinction due to human killing for profit and due to mythology.\nPanda Bear \u2013 The Panda bear might be the most well-known bear on the planet due to their perceived adorable appearance. They primarily feast on bamboo in Central China. Panda bears are considered endangered due to demand on the black market.\nSloth Bear \u2013 The sloth bear receives its namesake due to the similarities of the sloth animal. The long snout allows them to consume prey not typically associated with bears, including ants and termites. Sloth bears are found in India and Sri Lanka.\nSun Bear \u2013 Sun bears are distinctive due to their cream, crescent markings on their chest. As they often eat bees\u2019 nests, they are commonly referred to as honey bears. You can find them in Malaysia and Indonesia, and they are vulnerable to extinction due to deforestation.\nBear Scientific Names\nThe family name for the bear species is Ursidae and Ursus is the genus, which means bear in Latin. The following are the eight bear genus species of the bear family:\nBear Appearance & Behavior\nBears are distinctive by their fur-based bodies and strong claws. Some climb trees and others swim. Certain bear subspecies have even more distinctive markings around the eyes and on their chest that set them apart from the others.\nVarious species of bears have adapted to their environments over time. For example, polar bears are white to blend in with the snow and North American black bears have versatile eating habits that include corn crops and cactus depending on their region of residence.\nAll bears have an acute sense of smell, hearing and sight. They often hear and smell humans before they see humans and flee as a result. Bears are solitary creatures by nature. However, mothers and cubs will travel together, and bears will travel in pairs during mating seasons.\nAsiatic Black Bear: 50 \u2013 116 kg (110 \u2013 255 lbs)\nBrown Bear: 93 \u2013 410 kg (205 \u2013 900 lbs)\nNorth American Black Bear 39 \u2013 409 kg (86 \u2013 900 lbs)\nPolar Bear 200 \u2013 682 kg (440 \u2013 1,500 lbs)\nSpectacled Bear 64 \u2013 125 kg (140 \u2013 275 lbs)\nPanda Bear 70 \u2013 125 kg (155 \u2013 275 lbs)\nSloth Bear 55 \u2013 141 kg (120 \u2013 310 lbs)\nSun Bear 22 \u2013 50 kg (50 \u2013 110 lbs)\nBear hibernation\nMany species of bears will hibernate for long periods to save energy during winters when prey and other food sources are in short supply. Bear will hibernate in locations such as caves, hollowed out trees, holes they dig in the ground, and dens that bears have dug in prior years. Prior to hibernating bears will become hyperphagic, which means they\u2019ll eat excessively to build energy reserves. For example, Himalayan black bears will reach up to 400 pounds before they hibernate. That\u2019s significantly higher than their normal weight, which is between 200 and 265 pounds!\nHowever, not all bear species hibernate. Panda bears will adjust their latitude throughout the year to find more abundant seasonal food rather than hibernating. Likewise, Asiatic black bears in southern climates will also skip hibernating. Finally, while polar bears do not hibernate, pregnant polar bears will construct maternity dens where they stay for long periods in a dormant state.\nBear Habitats\nThe geographic regions of bear species are as diverse as their appearance. Most bear species prefer to live within the canopy of a dense forest. You can find bears throughout North America, Europe, Asia and Africa. They never made it to the Antarctic or Australia. While bears are curious by nature, many times, if they hear or smell a human, they will hide up a tree. Some bears prefer higher elevations, such as the Asiatic black bear, and others prefer coastal regions, such as polar bears. You will even find bears in desert climates, including the spectacled bears and American black bears. Bear populations that are unable to adapt to new habitats are vulnerable to extinction as their current homes are destroyed for development and for lumber.\nBear Diet and Food\nBears have proven they can survive on almost anything. Most bears eat vegetation, such as the panda bear eats bamboo. However, many North American bears have adapted to their environments and will eat other animals and fish, including elk, caribou and salmon. The polar bear, also referred to as the maritime bear, is a carnivorous animal as they typically eat seals, as well as whales and smaller walruses on occasion. And the sloth bear survives on ants and termites.\nA growing concern exists for bears eating human food as it causes them to destroy property and even break into homes to seek out more of the same. Eventually, these bears are put down as they become an increasing threat to humans. This tragic result is avoidable as long as humans do not feed wild bears. On rare occasions, bears will eat a poisonous plant by mistake and die. Other than that, bears can eat almost anything to live.\nBear Population\nToday, all bear species are somewhat susceptible to extinction. Some bear species are more vulnerable than others. Asiatic black bears, polar bears, panda bears, sloth bears and sun bears are all considered vulnerable to extinction. Brown bears are categorized as stable, and the American black bears are actually increasing in population and considered a least concern at the moment.\nAsiatic Black Bear \u2013 Less than 50,000\nBrown Bear \u2013 200,000\nNorth American Black Bear \u2013 600,000\nPolar Bear \u2013 20,000 to 25,000\nSpectacled Bear \u2013 Less than 2,000\nPanda Bear \u2013 2,000\nSloth Bear \u2013 7,000 to 10,000\nSun Bear \u2013 Unknown, possibly less than 1,000\nBear Extinction\nWhile several bear species of today are vulnerable to extinction, only a few bear species or subspecies have become extinct in recent history. This includes the Californian grizzly bear in the 1920s and the Mexican grizzly bear in the 1960s. Both became extinct due to hunting. The same is true of the Atlas bear. The Atlas bear was the only bear native to Africa. It was hunted to extinction in the 1870s.\nThe giant panda bear was near extinction in recent times when drastic efforts were made to save the species. Many scientists believe the polar bear is under severe threat due to climate change. Their existence may be directly connected to their ability to adapt. Thousands of years ago, it is believed that a number of bear species existed before their extinction.\nThe giant short-faced bear was a carnivorous animal that stood 12-feet high, ran over 40 mph, weighed over 1,500 pounds and lived in the Northern half of North America. It became extinct around the end of the Ice Age due to loss of habitat. Cave bears resided in much of Europe and became extinct around 25,000 years ago before the last Ice Age began. They were believed to weigh up to 1,500 pounds just like the short-faced bear.\nBear Predators and Threats\nBear cubs are particularly susceptible to any number of predators, such as coyotes and wolves; however, adult bears experience very few natural predators. The primary predators that target bears are other bears and humans. Illegal bear hunting is likely their greatest predator. Some cultures poach bears for their meat and various body parts and organs to sell on the black market. Environmental change is another significant threat to bears, their natural habitats and their food sources. And human deforestation and development are also threatening many bear species and subspecies.\nBear Mating, Babies and Lifespan\nA courting process does occur between a male and a female bear during the spring. Male bears are promiscuous and will mate with several female bears if possible over time. Only the largest males will mate due to the high level of competition. Because of this competition, female bears will also take on several partners in their life. However, during the courting and mating process, both bears became nearly inseparable. The season of breeding and mating lasts from May to early July. Females typically give birth in January and February.\nFemale bears mate and experience a fertilized egg and embryos much like humans. They will give birth to between one and six bear cubs. Mother bears are quite affectionate and protective. They will care for and den with their cubs for up to three years, often less. During this time, the cubs will feed on the mother\u2019s milk and food gathered by their mother and themselves. When it is time to separate, the cubs do not take it well. As a result, siblings often stay together for a duration after the initial separation.\nThe average lifespan of each bear species varies, including:\nAsiatic Black Bear \u2013 25 to 30 years, Oldest on Record: 42 years\nBrown Bear \u2013 20 to 30 years, Oldest on Record: 40 years\nNorth American Black Bear \u2013 20 years, Oldest on Record: 39 years\nPolar Bear \u2013 20 to 30 years, Oldest on Record: 45 years\nSpectacled Bear \u2013 20 years, Oldest on Record: 37 years\nPanda Bear \u2013 15 to 20 years, Oldest on Record: 38 years\nSloth Bear \u2013 20 years, Oldest on Record: 27 years\nSun Bear \u2013 25 years, Oldest on Record: 34 years\nIt is important to note that most bear species live longer in captivity than in the wild. The averages listed above represent the average lifespan of a wild bear. The oldest age on record is representative of any bear regardless of being wild or captive. As bears age, their health begins to decline just as with humans, including dental health, eyesight and an overall dulling of the senses. This greatly affects their quality of life and ability to survive\nView all 184 animals that start with B"}

It\u2019s incredibly difficult for these pandas to get pregnant, only 50 percent of the babies born tend to survive, and pandas aren\u2019t even interested in eating the type of food that their bodies can digest. All these factors make it very hard to get pandas out of the endangered species category.\nHere\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard to save the giant panda.\n1. Raising Baby Pandas Is Difficult\nPanda babies are often born at a dangerously low birth rate, partially because of their extremely low-calorie bamboo diet. If a mother gives birth to twins, she invariably abandons one because she simply can\u2019t raise both babies. That\u2019s why at the National Zoo, officials swapped the pandas in and out each day between the mom and an incubator, so the momma panda Mei Xiang was able to care for both. Sadly, it just wasn\u2019t enough, CNN reported.\n2. Pandas Can Only Get Pregnant Once a Year\nHere\u2019s where things get really tough for endangered pandas. The females can only get pregnant once a year, The Guardian reported. Female pandas only ovulate once a year, and there\u2019s only a 24-hour optimal window in that time where they\u2019re likely to get pregnant. Even veterinarians who specialize in pandas say that it can be hard to tell the signs and sometimes they miss the 24-hour window.\n3. It\u2019s Nearly Impossible to Tell When a Panda Is Pregnant\nZoo officials can have a really tough time because it\u2019s nearly impossible to tell when a female panda is pregnant. The hormone levels of a female panda stay the same when she\u2019s pregnant and, pregnant or not, she might start building a nest, sleeping longer, and doing other things to act like she\u2019s pregnant, Motherboard reported. Panda fetuses are also hard to find on an ultrasound and often can be mistaken for feces. To make things even tougher, a panda\u2019s pregnancy can last anywhere from three to six months.\n4. Pandas Eat Mostly Bamboo, Which They Don\u2019t Digest Well\nAbout 99 percent of a panda\u2019s diet consists of bamboo. In the wild, they can only digest about 17 percent of the bamboo that they eat. This is because the microbes in their guts aren\u2019t adapted to bamboo, BBC reported. The bacteria in their guts are designed to digest meat, not plants. In addition, they don\u2019t have the genes required to produce enzymes that digest plants. This means that pandas end up eating bamboo almost all day when they\u2019re awake, because they need tremendous amounts of bamboo to survive. This low-calorie diet also means that they don\u2019t have enough fat to hibernate like most bears and they try to expend as little energy every day as possible.\n5. Pandas Have Lost the Ability to Taste Meat\nPandas would thrive so much better if they ate meat instead of bamboo. So why don\u2019t they? The gene that allows animals to taste savory flavors found in meat is actually inactive in pandas, io9 reported. This means that even if meat was given to pandas in large quantities, they wouldn\u2019t eat it because they can\u2019t taste it. Unfortunately, their digestive systems are designed for meat and not plants, making them very inefficient eaters."}

Location: Northern America (especially Alaska and Canada) Lifespan: 20-25 years Size: 198 cm (6.50ft) on average Weight: Females: 130-180kg (290-400lb), 180-360 kg (400-790lb) Color: Brown Diet: Large mammals (caribou and bison), carrion, fish, berries, clams etc. Predators: None Top Speed: 56 km/h (30 mph) No. of Species:\n1 Conservation Status:\nThreatened under US law, but least concern according to the IUCN\nThey are apex predators, hunting large prey such as caribou, but they are also very opportunistic. They will eat carrion (already dead animals), salmon, berries and even clams. Their strong front legs are adapted both for running fast to catch prey, and for digging and foraging.\nThey are primarily solitary, except for mothers with cubs. However, as many as 20 individuals can come together to hunt salmon that are moving upstream to spawn.\nFemales live for around 26 years, which is longer than males who live for around 22 years on average.\nInteresting Grizzly Bear Facts\n1. They are a subspecies of the brown bear.\nGrizzly bears are considered a subspecies of the brown bear (Ursus arctos). The main difference between them is in diet and geography. Brown bears are mainly coastal with access to marine foods, whereas grizzlies live further inland.\n2. They are called \u201cgrizzly\u201d both for their fur and their nature.\nTheir hair is grizzled, meaning silver tipped. However, it is believed they originally got their name after the word \u201cgrisly\u201d meaning gruesome or scary.\nTheir scientific classification \u2018Ursus arctos horribilis\u2018 was also named after their \u2018horrifying\u2019 reputation by a natuaralist in 1815.\n3. They are apex predators.\nThis means they are at the top of the food chain. They hunt large mammals, such as moose, caribou, and bison, using their speed and strength to catch them.\n4. Grizzly bears are also very opportunistic eaters.\nThey\u2019ll also eat carrion (things that are already dead), forage for berries, dig into sand for razor clams, eat grass, and go fishing in rivers.\n5. They come together to hunt salmon.\nEvery year grizzlies gather to fish for the salmon that are swimming upstream to spawn. As many as 20 can be seen in one spot, where they often catch salmon leaping out of the water with their paws.\n6. They are huge.\nAverage length of grizzly bears is around 2 metres, with females weighing 130-180kg and males 180-360kg. However, some huge males grizzlies have been reported to stand as high as 3 metres (9.8 ft) and weighing up to 680kg!\n7. They have a distinctive hump on their back.\nThis hump is actually a large muscle which controls their forearms.\n8. Grizzlies claws are as long as human fingers.\nThey are up to 4 inches long.\n9. They can run at 30 miles (56kmp) an hour.\nDespite their large size, they can move fast. The large hump on their shoulders powers their fast-moving front legs. This is why they tell you if you bump into a grizzly, don\u2019t try and run from it!\n10. They hibernate for 5-7 months every year.\nThey\u2019re well known for their hibernating habits. Bears will dig large dens which they curl up in to sleep for the coldest months of the year. However, bears in sunny California don\u2019t hibernate as it\u2019s not needed.\n11. They give birth while hibernating.\nFemale grizzly bears give birth while hibernating. The grizzly cubs will stay in the den drinking milk until the end of winter.\n12. They don\u2019t become pregnant straight away.\nVia a process of \u201cdelayed implantation\u201d, embryos are stored until the mother has gained enough weight for hibernation.\n13. They eat a lot of food before they hibernate.\nThey don\u2019t eat while they\u2019re hibernating, so they eat as much food as possible beforehand. Bears can gain as much as 180kg (400lb) in weight before going into hibernation.\n14. Grizzly bears don\u2019t pee or poop during hibernation.\nThroughout the whole of the 5-7 months they don\u2019t go to the bathroom. They are actually able to turn excess urea (a component of urine) back into protein, meaning they actually gain muscle while hibernating.\n15. Mama bears are fierce.\nMothers with young cubs will be very protective of their young, including fighting off larger male bears.\n16. They will nurse their cubs for up to 3 years.\nA mother will keep her cubs with her for as many as three years.\n17. They need a lot of space.\nGrizzlies in general range over large areas, as much as 1500 square km (~600 square miles). Males have large territories, which females roam through.\n18. They are more dangerous to humans than sharks.\nWhile sharks get all the media attention, bear attacks on humans are actually more common and numbers are actually on the rise.\nHowever, grizzly bears normally avoid contact with people and rarely actively hunt humans. Many of these attacks occur when people accidentally stumble upon mother bears with cubs.\nThe rise in attacks is thought to be due to growing human use of grizzly bear habitat, and \u2018problem bears\u2019 who have associated humans with having potential \u2018food\u2019 near to them.\n19. Grizzlies and wolves are competitors.\nIn places where the two overlap, like Yellowstone Park, they often compete fiercely over food.\n20. They are a conservation success story.\nHuman expansion into grizzly habitat led to huge numbers in their decline, however after they were declared protected by the law in the USA, their numbers have bounced back.\nGrizzly Bear Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification"}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Gorilla Facts - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/gorillas/", "text": "Gorilla Profile\nGorillas are part of the great ape family, which includes orangutans, bonobos and chimpanzees. They are predominantly ground dwelling, and inhabit forests located in numerous countries in central Africa.\nGorillas are third in line as the closest relatives to the human. Chimpanzees take first place followed by bonobos. They are the largest living primates today.\nGorilla Facts Overview\nHabitat: Jungles & Forests Location: Sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 Congo, Gabon, Guinea, Cameroon, Rwanda, Uganda Lifespan: 35 \u2013 50 Years Size: 4 ft 7 in \u2013 6 ft 5in Tall (1.4 to 2 m) Weight: 300 \u2013 590 pounds (135 \u2013 275 kg) Color: Black, With Some Silver / Grey Hair Diet: Herbivore \u2013 Leaves, Shoots, Roots, Vines & Fruits Predators: No Natural Predators. Humans & Occassionally Leopards. Top Speed: 30 \u2013 35 Kph (20 \u2013 25 Mph) No. of Species:\n2 Conservation Status:\nCritically Endangered\nIn addition to being stocky, gorillas have broad chests and shoulders. They also have large hands with forearms that are shorter than their upper arm. Gorillas have a black and hairless face with large nostrils and small eyes that are set closely together.\nThere are actually two distinct species of gorillas, the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla.\nThe eastern species (Gorilla beringei) lives specifically in the east central part of Africa, and the western species (Gorilla gorilla) inhabits the west central part of Africa. The eastern gorilla are the larger of the species and have darker and longer fur.\nAdult male gorillas known as \u2018silverbacks\u2019, due to silver hair on their backs, are generally larger than their female counterparts, and can weigh between 136 to 195 kg (300 to 430 lb) and be as tall as 4 ft 7 in to 5 ft 11 in (1.4 to 1.8 m).\nUnfortunately all species (and sub-species) of gorilla are currently listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List due to habitat destruction, poaching for the bushmeat and wildlife trade.\nInteresting Gorilla Facts\n1. Of the two species of gorillas, each has two lowland and upland subspecies.\nThe western gorilla is split into two different subspecies including the Cross River gorilla and the Western Lowland gorilla. The eastern gorilla species includes the Mountain gorilla, and Eastern Lowland or Grauer\u2019s gorilla.\n2. The two subspecies have very different habitats.\nThe gorilla is mostly restricted to countries in central Sub-Saharan Africa, but the various subspecies live in different elevations. The mountain gorillas are known to inhabit higher elevations up to 4,300 metres above sea level. The lowlands species tend to stay near the valley floor in the thick rain forests on the Atlantic Coast of Africa.\n3. Of the various subspecies of gorillas, two have small populations left on the planet.\nThe Cross River gorilla contains about 250 animals still in the wild restricted to a small border area between Nigeria and Cameroon, making them the worlds rarest ape. The Mountain gorilla is also severely endangered with an estimated 880 still alive today. There are estimates of fewer than 5,000 Eastern Lowland gorillas, and over 100,000 Western Lowland gorillas in existence.\n4. Gorillas are the largest primate, with the tallest Silverback recorded at over 6ft 5in and heaviest at over 590 pounds (265 kg).\nThat\u2019s roughly 3 times heavier than an average man, when their height is somewhat similar. This indicates just how broad and muscly gorillas are.\nThey out rank monkeys, lemurs, chimpanzees, orangutans and humans as the largest primate.\n5. Gorillas are fast.\nIf you were to be chased by a gorilla, you better have wheels underneath you as they can reach speeds of over 20 miles per hour with a top speed clocked at 25 Mph.\n6. They are highly intelligent, and can learn words.\nEvidence of this comes from Koko, a gorilla that was born in captivity that was taught sign language and had a vocabulary of about one thousand signs by the age of 40. She also understood about 2,000 words in English.\n7. Mountain gorillas are generally larger, with longer, darker hair and tend to have shorter arms than their lowland gorilla cousins.\nThey also generally have a larger nose and jaw, and teeth, too!\n8. Gorillas move around by knuckle-walking.\nThis is when they rely on their knuckles (or other parts of their hands) to walk and shift location.\n9. Gorillas live in \u2018troops\u2019.\nA \u2018troop\u2019 is a group of up to thirty gorillas, which often consistent of a dominate male gorilla, a handful of females and their immature offspring.\n10. Gorillas have a fairly long lifespan.\nGorillas can live generally between 35 and 40 years in the wild. Those who are kept in zoos fair better and can live for 50 or more years. One female gorilla in a zoo in the United States lived to 60 years of age.\n11. Gorillas stand in similar heights as humans.\nAn adult male gorilla will stand between 5-feet, 7-inches to 6-feet tall. Females are slightly shorter.\n12. Gorillas arm span is significantly longer than their body height.\nThe arm span of an average adult male gorilla is between 7-feet, 7-inches and 8-feet, 6-inches. The females arm span is somewhat less than that. This is in comparison to the average human male arm span, which is usually around 1-5cm longer.\n13. They rarely go ape about anything.\nGorillas are considered to be peaceful creatures. However, there are times when a younger male will challenge a more mature one. They will typically just make a lot of noise, beating chests, baring teeth, charging forward and waving sticks until one backs down.\n14. Gorillas are not meat eaters.\nThe gorilla diet is mainly vegetarian, which includes fruit, bamboo shoots and plant stems. They also rarely drink water, as they can get all they need from the foods they consume. Adult gorillas can eat up to 30kg of food each day.\n15. They have a large repertoire.\nGorillas communicate in a variety of ways which also includes 25 different sounds, from belches, to screams, to warning calls, singing and chuckles.\n16. There is no clearly defined mating season.\nGorillas can mate any time of the year. Females mature between 10 and 12 years of age and males mature between 11 and 13 years. The gestation period is roughly 8 and-a-half months.\n17. The mother and baby gorilla spend a lot of time together.\nA newborn gorilla will weigh between three and four pounds. The mother will carry it around against her chest for a number of months until the baby can hang on to her back.\n18. The young gorilla learns fast.\nA baby gorilla will learn how to walk by the time it reaches six months of age and it will be able to follow its mother for short distances once it gets to 18 months of age. Riding on Mom\u2019s back is the safest place for the baby, even at this point in its life. It will stay with its mother until it is four to six years of age sharing her nest all the while.\n19. The young gorillas continue learning as they grow.\nYoung gorilla will learn just by imitating what it sees others around him or her doing. In fact, this is how a young gorilla will pick up many different actions and will act them out in play fights with other young gorillas.\n20. Gorillas are always on the move.\nA group of gorillas is called a troop. The troop will not spend more than a day in the same place and it is believed that this is to allow food to replenish itself after the troop moves to another location. The new location is picked by a silverback gorilla, which is more or less the leader of that troop. Food is the determining factor as to where the gorillas will move today and tomorrow.\n21. Gorilla building is believed to be more than just art.\nNest building by gorillas is no longer looked upon by researchers as just being a fine example of animal architecture. They are now saying that nest building demonstrates great tool use by the primates.\n22. Gorillas are poor swimmers.\nAs they are unable to swim naturally, gorillas will avoid rivers and large bodies of water.\nGorilla Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification"}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Red Panda Facts - WorldAtlas", "url": "https://mail.worldatlas.com/articles/red-panda-facts-animals-of-asia.html", "text": "These adorable animals, with their rusty red fur, round face, and pointy ears, look like a cross between a fox and a puppy\u2014but they are neither. They are also not closely related to the iconic giant panda despite the similar name.\nSomething they have in common with giant pandas is their primary food source. You guessed it: bamboo! Here are other interesting facts you might want to know about these elusive animals.\nScientific Name\nThere are two different subpecies of red panda (Ailurus fulgens): the Himalayan red panda (A. f. fulgens) and the Chinese red panda (A. f. styani ). They are found in different regions and possess slightly different physical features.\nTaxonomic Position\nPhylum: Chordata\nChordata Class: Mammalia\nMammalia Order: Carnivora\nCarnivora Family: Ailuridae\nAiluridae Genus: Ailurus\nAilurus Species: fulgens\nfulgens Binomial Name: Ailurus fulgens\nWhat Is A Red Panda?\nAlone in their family, the red panda species is unlike any other. Image credit: Sands0013/Shutterstock\nRed pandas are mammals that belong to the order Carnivora. At first, red pandas were classified under the family Procyonidae along with raccoons because of their similar-shaped head and ringed tail. However, further research found that their DNA is similar to bears, so they were then classified under the Ursidae family. Now, the most recent genetic studies have found that they have no living relative and are thus placed in their own family called Ailuridae.\nThe order Carnivora, which the red panda belongs to, includes 12 families and more than 270 species. Most of them are carnivores but the order also includes several omnivores like some species of bears.\nThe order includes dogs, cats, raccoons, weasels, badgers, otters, skunks, civets, seals, and walruses, among many others. Since they have no living relatives and are alone in their family, their closest relatives and nearest ancestors lived 3 to 4 million years ago.\nAre Red Pandas Related To Raccoons?\nAlthough they are both mammals and both belong under the order Carnivora, they belong to different families. They are therefore not directly related. Some scientists consider them like distant cousins.\nAre Red Pandas Marsupials?\nRed pandas are not marsupials since they are placental mammals. Marsupials are animals that give birth to extremely under-developed young which then crawl to the mother\u2019s pouch where they will fully develop. Placental mammals are born fully developed. A baby red panda is born completely covered in fur.\nWhere Do Red Pandas Live?\nRed pandas spend most of their lives up in trees. Image credit: MyImages - Micha/Shutterstock\nRed pandas are arboreal. They spend around 90% of their time in trees. They aren\u2019t built for movement on the ground but have various adaptations for life up in trees. They have extremely flexible ankles and the fibula and tibia are attached in such a way that they can rotate about their axis so they can climb down trees headfirst with ease. Red pandas also have pseudo-thumbs just like the giant panda and modified wrist bones. These adaptations allow them to climb up and live on trees throughout the day with remarkable agility.\nThey live in the mountains of Central China, Northern Myanmar, and Nepal in high-altitude temperate forests. Some are also found in Parts of India, Bhutan, and Tibet.\nWhat Do Red Pandas Look Like?\nClose-up of a Himalayan red panda. Image credit: Mr.Adilok Utama/Shutterstock\nThe red panda is known for its rusty red fur that serves as camouflage against the canopy of fir trees that are covered with reddish-brown moss and white lichen. They have large round heads, short snouts, and perky, pointed ears. They have distinct \u201ctear\u201d marks on their face that run from the eyes to the corner of the mouth. They are also known for their thick and bushy ringed tail which they use to maintain their balance and keep their body warm.\nThe Chinese red panda's fur is redder than the Himalayan red panda, whose face is usually paler. The ringed tail is also more prominent on the Chinese species.\nRed pandas are dwarfed by giant pandas in terms of size. They can weigh only anywhere between 12 to 20 lbs (5.4 to 9 kg). They are about the size of a common house cat. The head and body can grow up to 50 to 65 cm (20-26 inches) long. The tail can be anywhere between 25 to 50 cm (12-20 inches).\nRed Panda Diet\nA red panda eating bamboo. Image credit: Tallllly/Shutterstock\nAbout 85-95% of a red panda\u2019s diet consists of bamboo. Their name comes from the Nepalese word Ponya which roughly translates \"bamboo eater.\" They chomp on bamboo shoots and bamboo leaf tips, but you may also find them foraging for roots or fallen fruits. The rest of their diet consists of insects, birds, eggs, and other small mammals.\nAre Red Pandas Nocturnal?\nRed pandas are crepuscular, so they are most active at dusk and dawn. They spend almost half of the day sleeping and tend to be more active in cooler weather.\nRed Panda Life Cycle\nA mother red panda with her cub. Image credit: esdeem/Shutterstock\nRed pandas give birth to fully developed young called cubs. They create birthing dens in stumps, hollow trees, tree roots, or even in crevices between rocks. They line their nests with moss, leaves, grass, and soft branches. They can give birth to up to four cubs but more often give birth to twins. Young are born in the spring and summer after a gestation period of 114 to 145 days.\nRed panda cubs nurse until they are around 22 weeks old. They stay with their mothers for around one year.\nThe lifespan for these animals is 8 to 10 years in the wild and up to 15 years in shelters or zoos.\nHow Many Red Pandas Are Left In The World?\nSadly, there aren\u2019t a lot of them left in the wild and their populations are fast dwindling in numbers. According to the World Wildlife Fund, there are currently less than 10,000 individual pandas left in the world.\nThreats To Red Pandas\nHumans are responsible for the principal threats to red pandas, such as habitat loss due to deforestation. Image credit: Jure1/Shutterstock\nThough they are located in regions inhabited by predators, red pandas spend most of their time on trees in order to escape predators like snow leopards, cloudy leopards, martens, and jackals.\nThese animals are endangered and are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)\u2019s Red List of Threatened Species. Among the chief causes of their decline are human-caused environmental degradation, habitat loss and human behavior. The latter includes poaching and trafficking. This animal\u2019s beautiful fur is illegally trafficked and used to produce hats and clothes. They are also targets for the illegal pet trade.\nHumans also contribute to the threats affecting red pandas through deforestation causing habitat loss. Climate change, caused by human activity, has also been shrinking their habitable range.\nWhy Are Red Pandas Important?\nAs the only surviving animal under the Ailuridae family, it is important to keep their species alive to preserve the planet\u2019s animal diversity. Extensive efforts like raising awareness are now underway to try to preserve their habitat and stop the illegal trade of their fur."}

It has also become a symbol of animal conservation, immortalized on the logo of the World Wildlife Federation. Due to human encroachment, the panda has become an endangered species. Even today this species suffers from habitat loss and very low birthrates. However, as a result of strong conservation efforts in recent times, especially bolstered by an immense level of international support and collaboration, the giant panda population is considered to be on the rise. According to a 2006 study using DNA analysis, there are estimated to be as many as 2,000 - 3,000 giant pandas in the wilds of China.\nPhysical Description:\nThe panda is most readily distinguished by its black-and-white coat; it has black eye patches, ears, limbs, and shoulders. Its fur is thick and wooly, which help insulate against the forest cold. Beneath its seemingly cuddly exterior lies a muscular frame, and within its soft muzzle is a strong jaw lined with large molars. Its paw has has a larger radial sesamoid bone than most other bears - a \"thumb\" - that helps it grip and eat bamboo. After the sloth bear, the giant panda has the longest tail of any bear at 4 - 6 inches long.\nDiet:\nThe giant panda's diet is composed of abut 99% bamboo. It is known to eat 25 different species of bamboo in the wild. The giant panda is also known to eat eggs, fish, fruits, honey, yams, and shrub leaves.\nHabitat:\nThe giant panda's range is now narrowly defined in select mountainous areas of the Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces of China. It once inhabited lowlands areas, but has since been pushed out of those regions due to farming and deforestation.\nReproduction:\nA female can have, on average, 2 - 3 cubs in a lifetime. Pandas do not usually reach sexual maturity until 5 - 7 years of age. Mating generally takes place from the middle of March to the middle of May. Gestation lasts anywhere from about 83 - 163 days, with 135 days being the average."}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "10 Wild Wolverine Facts - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/wolverine/", "text": "Wolverine Profile\nThe Wolverine, or Wolverene, is from the family Mustelidae and is the largest land dwelling species from that family.\nThe Wolverine is a muscular and stocky carnivore which actually resembles a small bear. Wolverines are found in remote areas in the Northern Hemisphere with the majority of them in Northern Canada, Alaska, the Nordic countries of Europe, western Russia and Siberia.\nWolverine Facts Overview\nHabitat: Remote boreal forests & alpine tundra Location: Northern Canada, American State, Alaska, The Nordics, Russia & Siberia Lifespan: 5 \u2013 13 Years Size: 65 \u2013 110cm (26 \u2013 42 in) Weight: 20 \u2013 71 pounds (10 \u2013 32 kg) Color: Dark black, brown & tan Diet: Carnivore. Deer, porcupines, squirrels, chipmunks, beavers, marmots, moles, gophers, rabbits, voles, mice & much more. Predators: Gray wolf & bears Top Speed: 30 kph (20 mph) No. of Species:\n1 Conservation Status:\nLeast concern\nThe Wolverine has short legs, a broad, rounded head with short rounded ears and small eyes. Although the legs are short, the Wolverine has large paws that contain five toes. The paws also have crampon-like claws.\nThe animal itself has a plantigrade posture which permits it to easily climb up and over cliffs, even particularly steep ones, snow-covered peaks and trees.\nThe fur on a Wolverine is thick and oily and is dark in color. It is also highly hydrophobic which means it resists frost. It is because of this that hunters and trappers look to the Wolverine hide for use as a lining in outerwear worn in Arctic conditions. The Wolverine may have a light silver colored facial mask, which has distinct characteristics in some of the individual animals. Plus, there may be a pale buff stripe that runs from the shoulders along the side laterally and crossing the rump. There are also some Wolverines that display white patches of hair on their throats or chests. Wolverines also have a bushy tail.\nInteresting Wolverine Facts\n1. The adult Wolverine is about the size of a medium dog.\nWolverines grow to a length of between 26 and 42-inches, a height of between 6 and 10-inches and can weigh between 12 and 55-pounds. A large male can weigh up to 71-pounds and an exceptionally large male can reach 77-pounds. The males are larger than females by about 30-percent. The Eurasian wolverines are said to be even larger than the North American variety with average weighs of 44-pounds. As an example, the Wolverines found in northern Canada range in weight from 22-pounds (female) to 34-pounds (male). The Alaskan Wolverines weigh 21-pounds (female) to 37-pounds (male). In Finland the average weights range from 24 to 28-pounds and in Norway the Wolverines can weigh 22-pounds for females and 32-pounds for males.\n2. There is a reason why Wolverines are called skunk bear or nasty cat.\nThe Wolverine has a potent anal scent glands it will use to mark territory as well as during mating season. Or more accurately, when seeking the company of a female Wolverine. The odor is so pungent that the above-mentioned nicknames are commonly used in reference to it.\n3. You could say that Wolverines do clean up after other animals are done feeding.\nAs Wolverines are scavengers, the majority of their meals are made up of carrion. This is of particular need during winter and early spring. Wolverines find carrion in a couple of ways. Sometimes they stumble upon it, they sometimes feed on it after other predators have had their fill or they may actually rob a predator. In some cases, the latter has resulted in the odd loss of a Wolverine. It goes to show that sometimes you really shouldn\u2019t poke the bear.\n4. Wolverines are also predators.\nThe words powerful and versatile are used to describe the predatory skills of the wolverine. It will hunt mostly for small or medium-sized mammals but will sometimes take on something much bigger than itself. It is not uncommon for a Wolverine to take down a deer as an example. However, normal catches include rabbits, mice, voles, gophers, marmots, beavers, chipmunks, porcupines and squirrels.\n5. Wolverines will actually stash food for later.\nAlthough their eating styles has been referred to as similar to that of a glutton, when there is a lot of food available, the Wolverine will store some in a cache. The main purpose for this is to have a supply of food handy during winter when it happens to be scarce and for lactating females to maintain their strength.\n6. Wolverines have natural enemies as well.\nTypically a Wolverine will give up its territory should wolves arrive in the neighborhood. However, a Wolverine may defend kills against larger animals like wolves and bears. Another natural enemy of the Wolverine happens to be bears.\n7. Wolverine males form long-lasting bonds with females.\nSome male wolverines will live their lives without ever having a mate. Others will end up spending their lifetime in a long-term relationship with two or more females. The male in this relationship will visit the female from time to time.\n8. The reproductive cycle for Wolverines has a delay in it.\nMating season for Wolverines is during the summer but the implantation of the embryo in the uterus does not take place until early winter and this delayed the fetus development stage. If food is scarce, a female Wolverine will not produce any young. Litters of two or three kits follows a 30 to 50 day gestation period and the kits grow quickly reaching adult size in a year.\n9. Wolverines don\u2019t have a very long lifespan.\nThe typical Wolverine will live to between 15 and 17 years in captivity where they will live only to about 10 years in the wild. The adults do a little bit of parenting with their young. The fathers will visit their offspring until they have been weaned (at about 10 weeks of age). Once the kits reach about six months old, they will reconnect with their fathers and will travel together for a period of time. Possibly to learn skills from the elder.\n10. There are several subspecies of Wolverines.\nWithin the Gulo gulo species, there are two subspecies \u2013 the Old World and New World. There are possibly four more subspecies related to where the Wolverines live. One subspecies is limited to Vancouver Island in Western Canada, another exists only in parts of Alaska on the Kenai Peninsula. Genetic evidence points to most of the Wolverines in North America having descended from a single source.\nWolverine Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification"}

And More Red Panda Facts", "url": "https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/news/red-panda-bear-and-more-red-panda-facts", "text": "Is a red panda a real panda?\nThat depends on your definition of a real panda! The name panda is believed to come from the Nepali word \"ponya,\" meaning \"bamboo eater\u201d or \u201cbamboo footed.\" Despite sharing a common name, giant pandas and red pandas are not closely related. Red pandas are the only living members of their taxonomic family, Ailuridae, while giant pandas are in the bear family, Ursidae.\nThe red panda was first classified and given its scientific name, Ailurus fulgens, in 1825. Giant pandas were described much later and earned their \"panda\" name because of the similarities the two species shared, like eating bamboo. So, red pandas could be considered the original (or only) true pandas \u2014 even if giant pandas have grown more famous over the years.\nWhy is a red panda\u2019s tail so fluffy?\nIt\u2019s all about balance! A red panda\u2019s long, woolly tail helps to keep it steady as it walks along rock ledges and tree branches. Red pandas don\u2019t hibernate through the winter, so their thick fur and bushy tails also provide protection from the cold, wind and other harsh weather."}

In this lesson, Dynamic Earth Learning will help you learn more about pandas.\nThere are four types of pandas:\nGiant Panda Two types of Red Panda Qinling Panda\nGIANT PANDA \ufeff\nFirst, thanks to the hard work of many people, giant pandas are no longer endangered. In 2020, the International Union for Conservation of Nature stated that giant pandas are no longer \u201cendangered.\u201d Instead, they are now listed as \u201cvulnerable.\u201d Recent counts show there are now more than 1,800 giant pandas in the wild! China says giant pandas are no longer an endangered species. This is due to successful breeding programs.\nRED PANDA\nRed pandas are endangered. (Dynamic Earth Learning\u2019s Post: Why Extinction is Bad?) Also, they are legally protected in India, Bhutan, China, Nepal, and Myanmar. Researchers think the total number of red pandas went down by 40 percent over the past twenty years. Overall there are as many as 10,000 and as few as 2,500 red pandas still in the wild.\nQINLING PANDA\nThe Qinling panda (Brown Panda) is endangered. In fact, there are only around 100 Qinling pandas still living in the wild. The Qinling is a relative of the giant panda, discovered in the 1960s. It\u2019s different from the giant panda. It has a smaller skull, has dark brown or light brown fur, and is smaller. Brown pandas are very rare. Also, this panda type lives only high up in the Qinling or the Qin Mountains in China.\nWHY ARE PANDAS ENDANGERED FACTS\nHere are some important facts about why pandas used to be endangered.\n1. Habitat Loss\nPandas have less and less land to live on. They also struggle to find food, as there is less land. Also, it\u2019s important to know that pandas like to be alone. They don\u2019t spend much time with each other. Overall, the loss of land pushes these quiet animals closer together.\n2. Deforestation (Loss of Woods)\nWhen people move into a panda\u2019s area, they clear forests for homes. Also, people make stores and other buildings. Next, farmers clear land for animal grazing. Even miners need to clear land for mining.\n3. Loss of Food\nAbout 98% of a panda\u2019s diet is bamboo. Finding enough bamboo is difficult for many reasons. Some reasons include cutting down forests, humans building homes, farm animals grazing (Dynamic Earth Learning\u2019s Post: Meat and The Environment) and logging.\n4. Hunting And Poaching\nIllegal poaching and smuggling are increasing. Basically, hunters like the red pandas for their special fur and meat. Sometimes hunters find red pandas and sell them as pets.\n5. Natural Disasters\nThings like landslides, floods, tornadoes, heavy snow, and rainfall destroy habitats. A habitat is where an animal lives. Also, forest fires, invasive plant species, and problems with bamboo flowering hurt a panda\u2019s habitat.\n6. Hard Time Having Babies\nPandas have a hard time having babies. Basically, pandas have only one to three cubs at a time. Then only one cub will live to be an adult. Sadly, bamboo has low nutrients. So, it\u2019s hard for a panda to have enough food while it\u2019s pregnant. Also, pandas are picky about whom they\u2019ll mate with. So, zoos that try to breed pandas can\u2019t always help.\nThis is because the two pandas they find need to like each other. If the pandas don\u2019t like each other they will fight instead of making more panda babies. This is unlike other animal species which are much less picky.\nDO YOU WANT TO HELP PANDAS?\nThe Red Panda Network is a nonprofit organization that protects red pandas and their habitat. They work with local community groups to make special wildlife areas. Also, they have \u201cforest guardians\u201d to help teach about red pandas. Finally, the group watches panda numbers in the wild to make sure they aren\u2019t disappearing. You can help this group by donating and working against the red panda trade.\nInterested in helping other wildlife?

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "50 Giant Panda Facts That You Never Knew About - Facts.net", "url": "https://facts.net/panda-facts/", "text": "You can track pandas in the wild through their poop.\nThere\u2019s a saying that goes, \u201cWhat goes in, must come out.\u201d Since pandas have to eat about 38 kg of bamboo per day, they excrete around 28 kg of poop daily. In the wild, a trail of panda poop most likely leads back to their nest or den, which is a great help to researchers. Unfortunately, this behavior also makes them more vulnerable to poachers and possible extinction.\nNewly-born pandas are only as big as a stick of butter.\nAs adults, pandas grow big enough to prove their namesake of giant pandas. However, newborns are the complete opposite. Upon birth, baby pandas measure 900 times smaller than their mother. With the average size of 5 oz, they only weigh a mere 36 g to 210 g.\nPandas have the digestive system of a carnivore.\nNormally, the panda diet consists of 99% bamboo. Although they already eat large amounts to compensate for bamboo\u2019s poor nutritional value, their bodies are further specialized to sustain their needs.\nDespite being herbivores, pandas evolved to have a shorter gut, which is usually only seen in carnivores. The special construction of their digestive system allows pandas to metabolize all the nutrients they need to survive.\nRead also: 30 Interesting Tuxedo Cat Facts That Will Make Your Day\nPandas in captivity have an omnivorous diet.\nWild pandas may all be herbivores, but it\u2019s a different story for captive pandas. In zoos and sanctuaries, pandas have a more varied diet of eggs, fish, and produce.\nBaby pandas are born pink.\nPandas may be known for their distinct black and white coloring, but they lack these colors completely at birth. Instead, newborn pandas appear mostly pink with a fine layer of hair.\nTheir black and white color only appears after around three weeks. Baby pandas are also born blind with weak limbs. As a result, baby pandas have to stay in their nests for two months, relying completely on their mothers for sustenance.\nPandas are real bears.\nSince pandas share the features of both raccoons and bears, scientists have long debated the panda\u2019s true classification. However, a 1970 study on pandas\u2019 cellular molecules officially confirmed pandas as real bears. Hence, pandas have been classified under the Ursidae family since the study\u2019s conclusion.\nChina has many names for pandas.\nThroughout history, the Chinese language gave pandas 20 different names. As one of the country\u2019s defining symbols, pandas have appeared even in China\u2018s earliest writings. Among these names, the ancient Chinese referred to pandas as spotted bear, bearcat, giant bearcat, and bamboo bear.\nThe panda\u2019s name comes from the Nepalese word \u2018Nigalya Ponya\u2019.\nThe Nepalese term \u2018Nigalya Ponya\u2018 literally translates to \u2018eater of bamboo\u2019. The word Ponya later became panda in the Western Regions, which explains why we call them pandas today.\nThere may be two subspecies of giant pandas.\nThese panda subspecies are determined by their distinct color patterns, cranial sizes, and population genetics. Although they share close similarities with giant pandas, their minor differences set them apart.\nFor one, the A. m. melanoleuca refers to the native pandas in Sichuan. However, the scientific community has yet to officially recognize it as a panda subspecies.\nRead also: Top 10 Facts about Earwig Diet Lifespan Habitat More Factsnet\nThe Qinling panda\u2019s color is light brown and white.\nThe Qinling panda mostly resides in the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi at heights of more than 1,000 up to 3,000 meters. As a subspecies of the giant panda, Qinling pandas have a light brown and white pattern instead of the usual black and white. Furthermore, it has a smaller skull and bigger molars compared to giant pandas. Definitely one of the more unlikely panda facts.\nScientists are uncertain why pandas have their color patterns.\nOver the years, scientists have tried to understand why pandas have unusual colors of black and white. Although they haven\u2019t come to an official conclusion, they propose that their dual color provides pandas adequate camouflage in snowy and rocky habitats.\nPandas have thick skin.\nPandas have a thick, wooly coat that keeps them warm in their cold forest habitats. Moreover, the average thickness of panda skin ranges from 5 mm to 10 mm, which is twice the human average.\nMale pandas usually grow bigger than females.\nMale pandas usually measure 20% heavier and 10% larger than females. The typical adult male can weigh up to 159 kg, which is twice the weight of an average man. Generally, female pandas weigh much lighter at around 77 kg.\nWild pandas have a lifespan of 20 years.\nPandas that live in the wild have an average lifespan of 20 years. However, captive pandas live longer because of better food and nutrition, reaching up to 30 years.\nThe Beijing Zoo has a collection of many endangered species, including pandas.\nFounded during the late Qing dynasty in 1906, Beijing Zoo is the oldest zoo in China. As one of the oldest public parks in the country, Beijing Zoo is well known for its collection of endangered animals. Among these endangered species are giant pandas, red pandas, South China tigers, golden snub-nosed monkeys, and snow leopards.\nFemale pandas can mate with several partners.\nA female panda can mate with several male partners that compete over her since males would often look for different females who are in heat. Female pandas have a birth rate of around one cub every two years.\nFemales can only mate within 24 to 72 hours.\nUnlike dolphins that can mate for three months, a panda\u2019s heat period only lasts for 24 to 72 hours. Since pandas only go into heat every two years, male pandas become extremely competitive so they won\u2019t miss their chance to mate. Generally, pandas approach sexual maturity at the age of 5 to 6 years old.\nPandas are strong climbers and swimmers.\nDespite being born helpless, pandas can climb trees as early as seven months old. Much like other bears, these giant pandas are also strong swimmers. However, they don\u2019t regularly spend much time swimming, since they don\u2019t hunt any marine life.\nPandas don\u2019t hibernate.\nIn contrast to most bears, pandas don\u2019t hibernate during the winter season. Instead, they go down the mountains in colder seasons to seek a warmer temperature. Since most of its diet is bamboo, pandas can\u2019t store much fat, which is crucial when bears hibernate.\nPandas prefer to be alone.\nAnother similarity shared with their relatives is that giant pandas are solitary species. Pandas usually don\u2019t live together with their family. Female pandas have distinct territories and choose to be alone. This also applies to males, except for mating season. After mating, female pandas raise their cubs alone.\nYoung pandas usually leave when their mothers become pregnant again.\nWhen a baby panda reaches nine months old, it will be completely weaned and leave the company of its mother once she becomes pregnant again. Typically, this takes around 18 months.\nRead also: Raven VS Crow Whats The Difference\nPandas are relatively fast.\nAt full speed, a panda can run around 32 kilometers per hour. As cute as they may look, pandas can defend themselves with their strong built and jaws. Definitely one of the panda facts to take note of if you encounter one in the wild.\nAdult pandas only have a few predators.\nAdult pandas don\u2019t really have much natural predators. However, panda cubs are extremely vulnerable. Predators such as black bears, eagles, yellow-throated martens, wild dogs, and snow leopards may easily attack the cubs.\nChina started giving away pandas during the Tang dynasty.\nChina has offered its giant pandas as diplomatic gifts throughout history, even becoming known as \u2018Panda diplomacy.\u2019 This practice traces back to the 6th century, when the Tang dynasty Empress Wu Zetian sent pandas to Emperor Tenmu of Japan.\nChina loans pandas to other countries.\nIn the 1970s, China gave pandas to American and Japanese zoos as gifts, which formed an important part of Chinese diplomacy. This giveaway was also the first cultural exchange between China and the US. Since then, pandas rose in popularity, and other nations began asking China for pandas.\nStarting in 1984, China stopped giving away pandas for free. Instead, they loaned them off for $1 million a year. These loan plans usually only allow countries to hold pandas for 10 years. Simply put, all pandas in the world are owned by the Chinese government.\nNewborn pandas also become China\u2019s property at birth.\nWhen China loans pandas, there is also an agreement that any cubs born during the loan officially become Chinese property. Hence, these cubs must be returned to China.\nPandas often leave scents for their own kind.\nThrough their odors, they can easily determine if there is another panda in the area. Furthermore, pandas can tell if odor marks are old or new, and can even distinguish if it\u2019s a male or female panda. Female pandas leave their odor once they are in heat, which helps the males track them.\nRead also: 50 Interesting Cheetah Facts That You Never Spotted Before\nPandas are the only bears with thumbs.\nCompared to other bears, pandas stand out for the special bone found on their wrists. The panda\u2019s sixth toe is used for grasping bamboo. Although they aren\u2019t fully opposable, this bone functions similarly to human thumbs \u2013 mainly used by pandas to grip their favorite bamboo.\nAncient China believed that pandas had magical powers.\nThe ancient Chinese believed that pandas have mystic abilities. During the Han Dynasty (206 BC to 24 AD), pandas were regarded as semi-divine as some of them were found in the emperor\u2019s garden.\nStricter laws and people\u2019s awareness are saving the panda population.\nOver the years, human activity has caused a great decline in the population of pandas. Aside from the destruction of their natural habitat, pandas have also been hunted for the illegal trade of their fur. Thankfully, due to stricter laws and raised awareness, the panda population has steadily increased since 2003."}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant Pandas - info and games - Sheppard Software", "url": "https://www.sheppardsoftware.com/content/animals/animals/mammals/giantpanda.htm", "text": "The Giant panda is a mammal classified in the bear family, Ursidae, native to central and southern China. There is on-going debate as to whether this creature is truly a bear or more related to the raccoon rather than the bear, or perhaps in a family of its own. Recent genetic research has tended to support the conclusion that the Giant panda is in fact a bear, but one that diverged relatively early from the rest of the family Ursidae.\nThe Giant panda has a very distinctive black-and-white coat, and adults measure around 1.5m long and around 75cm tall at the shoulder. It lives in mountainous regions, such as Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, and Tibet. Since the latter half of the 20th century, the panda has become an informal national emblem for China, and its image is found on many Chinese gold coins. Paw: The Giant panda has an unusual paw, with a \"thumb\" and five fingers; the \"thumb\" is actually a modified sesamoid bone. Stephen Jay Gould wrote an essay about this, then used the title The Panda's Thumb for a book of collected essays. The Giant panda has a short tail, approximately 15 cm long.\nOn the Menu: Despite being taxonomically a carnivore, the panda has a diet that is overwhelmingly herbivorous. The Giant panda eats shoots and leaves, living almost entirely on bamboo. Pandas are also known to eat eggs, the occasional fish, and some insects along with their bamboo diet. These are necessary sources of protein. Some zoos also feed their pandas specially formulated biscuits, fruitsicles or other treats to supplement their bamboo intake. Like other subtropical mammals, the Giant panda does not hibernate. Pandas in Trouble: Easily recognizable through its large, distinctive black patches around the eyes, ears and on its rotund body, the Giant panda is an endangered animal: an estimated 1600 pandas live in the wild and some 188 were reported to live in captivity at the end of 2005. However, several instances of successful captive-breeding in 2005 have pushed the population closer to 300. Public Favorite: The Giant panda has long been a favorite of the public, at least partly on account of the fact that the species has an appealing baby-like cuteness that makes it seem to resemble a living teddy bear. The fact that it is usually depicted reclining peacefully eating bamboo, as opposed to hunting, also adds to its image of innocence. Though the Giant panda is often assumed docile because of their cuteness, they have been known to attack humans, usually assumed to be out of irritation rather than predatory behavior. Life span: Giant pandas can usually live to be 20-30 years old while living in captivity.\nBirds and Bees: Giant pandas reproduce very slowly and infant mortality is high. Growth is slow and pandas may not reach sexual maturity until they are five to seven years old. The mating season usually takes place from mid-March to mid-May. During this time, two to five males can compete for one female; the male with the highest rank gets the female. When mating, the female is in a crouching, head-down position as the male mounts from behind. Copulation time is short, ranging from thirty seconds to five minutes, but the male may mount repeatedly to ensure successful fertilization. Mating is also a very noisy time, accompanied by moaning and squealing. Gestation Period: The whole gestation period ranges from 83 to 163 days, with 135 days being the average. Baby pandas weigh only 90 to 130 grams, which is about 1/900th of the mother\u2019s weight. Usually, the female panda gives birth to one or two panda cubs. Since baby pandas are born very small and helpless, they need the mother\u2019s undivided attention, so she is able to care for only one of her cubs. She usually abandons one of her cubs, and it dies soon after birth. At this time, scientists do not know how the female chooses which cub to raise, and this is a topic of ongoing research. Single Mother: The father has no part in helping with raising the cub. When the cub is first born, it is pink, naked and blind. It nurses from its mother's breast 6\u201314 times a day for up to 30 minutes each time. For three to four hours, the mother might leave the den to feed, which leaves the panda cub defenseless. One to two weeks after birth, the cub's skin turns gray where its hair will eventually become black. A slight pink color may appear on the panda's fur, as a result of a chemical reaction between the fur and its mother's saliva. They Grow Up So Fast: A month after birth, the color pattern of the cub\u2019s fur is fully developed. A cub's fur is soft as silk and coarsens with age. The cub begins to crawl at 75 to 90 days and the mothers play with their cubs by rolling and wrestling with them. The cubs are able to eat small quantities of bamboo after six months, though mother's milk remains the primary food source for most of the first year. Giant panda cubs weigh 45 kg at one year and live with their mother until they are 18 months to two years old. The interval between births in the wild is generally two years. < Possible Advertisement\nWhat's in a Name? The name \"panda\" originates with a Himalayan language, possibly Nepalese. And as used in the West it was originally applied to the Red panda, to which the Giant panda was thought to be related. Until its relation to the red panda was discovered in 1901, the Giant panda was known as Mottled Bear (Ailuropus melanoleucus) or Partli-colored Bear. In Chinese, the Giant panda is called the \"large bear cat\", or \"cat bear\" , a term usually used only in Taiwan. Most bears' eyes have round pupils. The exception is the Giant panda, whose pupils are vertical slits, like cats' eyes. It is these unusual eyes that inspired the Chinese to call the panda the \"Giant bear cat\".

The answer, unfortunately, is the giant panda. While conservation efforts are underway, these cuddly creatures are facing serious problems in the wild. In honor of National Panda Day on March 16th, let\u2019s take a look at the threats to these gentle giants, as well as learn some fascinating facts about them. Bonus: Adorable pics ahead!\nThe panda\u2019s plight\nMainly because of habitat loss, there aren\u2019t many giant pandas left in the world. That\u2019s a common problem with many wild animal species you probably never realized were endangered. Other reasons the panda population is threatened: Illegal poaching for the black market remains a problem, pandas often have difficult pregnancies, and mother pandas only have enough milk to feed one cub, even though two or three cubs are often born at once. Plus, pandas are really picky in choosing a mate.\nSo, how dire is the situation? The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) says there are just 1,864 pandas left in the wild. There are an additional 400 pandas in captivity, according to Pandas International. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the giant panda as \u201cvulnerable,\u201d which is the category between \u201cnear threatened\u201d and \u201cendangered.\u201d However, there is some good news: The population has started to increase slightly, thanks to breeding programs in China.\nTheir home turf\nAll existing pandas come from the bamboo forests of central China, so it\u2019s appropriate to greet them with n\u01d0 h\u01ceo (pronounced \u201cnee haow\u201d), which is how you say \u201chello\u201d in Mandarin. Pandas also used to live in Laos, Myanmar/Burma, and Vietnam, according to Sciencing.com.\nGiant pandas have their own language\nHung_Chung_Chih/Getty ImagesPandas won\u2019t say \u201chello\u201d back, of course, but scientists say they have more varied vocalizations than any other type of bear. The San Diego Zoo reports that pandas growl, huff, squeak, bark, honk, coo, tweet, and even bleat like lambs.\nPandas International describes a linguistics project by the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda. Researchers have figured out the meaning behind 13 different panda noises. They say that a mother panda will bark when a stranger approaches her cub and that male pandas baa like sheep when they\u2019re in love. Supposedly, when a baby panda makes a \u201cgee-gee\u201d sound, it means \u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d and \u201cwow-wow\u201d means the panda isn\u2019t happy.\nThe perfect panda picnic\nGiant pandas look a lot like teddy bears, especially when they sit down and stretch out their hind legs, a posture National Geographic says they like to use when eating. Speaking of which, a panda\u2019s favorite meal is bamboo. In fact, these gentle giants rarely eat anything else and spend half of every day eating the fibrous stuff. However, bamboo isn\u2019t the most nutritious of foods, especially for big animals like pandas. Bamboo is very low in protein, and the IUCN says pandas can digest less than 30 percent of it. A giant panda needs to eat between 25 and 40 pounds of bamboo daily, as well as have a sedentary lifestyle, to stay alive and healthy. Here are more panda facts that will make you love them even more.\nBe glad you\u2019re not a panda\nSure, it might seem like a nice life just to sit around all day and snack on your favorite food. But know that if you were a giant panda, you\u2019d need to get off your couch and visit the bathroom a lot. According to the IUCN, a panda poops at least 100 times a day. Plus, when the bamboo in their territory is gone, pandas have to migrate to search for more.\nLeave me alone!\nPascale Gueret/Getty ImagesPandas generally like to be by themselves. They do get together to mate in the spring and a mother will raise her cub until it\u2019s 18 to 24 months old, but otherwise, pandas prefer to be alone with their bamboo. Interestingly enough, studies show that pandas \u201ctalk\u201d when they do get together.\nHere\u2019s what we do know: Pandas rely on their excellent sense of smell to help avoid one another, says National Geographic. They also use smell to find a mate when they\u2019re ready to have a break from all of that alone time.\nWhy do pandas do handstands?\nWhile pandas generally prefer to sit around by themselves and eat, they can sometimes be seen doing acrobatics. Pandas mark their territories to tell other pandas who they are and to stay away. Their scent gland is underneath their tails, and they rub this area on trees. In order to get the mark as high as possible on a tree (showing that they\u2019re a great big panda that other pandas should avoid), pandas will do a handstand. Plus, adds LiveScience.com, pandas like to hang in trees and do somersaults when they play.\nAre they bears, or aren\u2019t they?\nBefore scientists were able to test panda DNA, they thought that giant pandas might be part of the raccoon family, another animal that has black markings around its eyes. But it is now confirmed that the panda is part of the bear family. That\u2019s unlike the koala bear, which isn\u2019t a bear at all. It is, however, one of these 11 animals with surprisingly misleading names.\nPandas are different from bears in many ways. They don\u2019t store fat and hibernate like their North American bear cousins. They have an extra-long wrist bone that acts like a thumb to make it easier to hold onto bamboo. And technically, the giant panda is classified as a carnivore. Even though they mostly eat bamboo, they will also occasionally eat fish, rats, and other small animals.\nAnd here\u2019s another fun animal comparison: In Mandarin, the name of the giant panda translates as \u201cgiant bear cat,\u201d perhaps because of their cat-like vertical pupils or maybe because they like to lie around all day like cats.\nThe size of a stick of butter\nJohn Moore/Getty ImagesGiant pandas are truly giant when fully grown\u2014males weigh about 300 pounds. But the WWF reports that panda newborns are 1/900th the size of their mamas. They weigh four to six ounces at birth, approximately the same size and weight as a stick of butter in your fridge. When they\u2019re born, baby giant pandas are tiny, pale, and hairless. They only get their distinctive black and white fur when they\u2019re about a month old. Here are some adorable pictures of baby animals you\u2019ll love instantly.\nLiving fossils\nPandas International calls giant pandas \u201cliving fossils\u201d because the species is thought to have existed for three million years. In order to prevent pandas from going extinct, we need to protect the animals and their habitat, as well as help them reproduce in panda breeding centers. So much of the world\u2019s wildlife is at risk and in need of protection\u2014for example, do you know how many cheetahs are left in the world?\nHow to help giant pandas\nDonating to animal conservation organizations like the WWF is a great way to help pandas and to prevent their populations from shrinking. With the WWF, you can even adopt a panda. Pandas are particularly important to the WWF\u2014the group has used the panda as its logo since it was founded in 1961.\nAnother simple way you can help? By visiting a panda in a zoo. China leases pandas to zoos around the world and uses the funds to preserve pandas in the wild.

And what is the difference between a forest, a rain forest and a jungle?\nThe word \"forest\" basically means an area with a large density of trees. Forests can occur in low or high elevation, can be relatively dry or very rainy, and can be of basically any temperature that still supports tree growth.\nA mature forest is one that may have very large trees and many species of plants and wildlife, such as tropical rain forests, or may be limited in the number of species of both trees and wildlife, such as is the case with the coniferous forests found in the taiga regions of the world.\nThe term \"rainforest\" refers to a forest that receives at least 60 inches of rainfall a year.\nThere are two types of rainforests, temperate rainforests with moderate temperatures and even some snowfall, or tropical rainforests which occur close to the equator and rarely dip below 60 degrees.\nRainforests are characterized by having such a thick upper canopy of growth, that little sunlight reaches the ground. This means that young trees must be able to grow with limited sunlight, and it also means that the undergrowth in a rainforest is not particularly dense.\nIt is generally easier to walk through a rainforest than a jungle. A jungle, however, is a different story.\nThe jungle is an area of forest that combines warmer temperatures and dense vegetation. The tree canopy is not as thick in a jungle as it is in a rainforest, allowing sunlight to reach more of the ground.\nVines, shrubs, grasses and moss grow in the lower third of a jungle making it very difficult to penetrate on foot. Jungles are simply warm forests that are very densely vegetated at the forest floor. Rainforests are forests with a great deal of rainfall and very thick vegetation at the canopy.\nAnd here are some of the rain forest animals that live there- Rainforest Animals\ncheck out our youtube channel!\nwhat are the parts of a rainforest?\nFruit Bat\nSquirrel Monkey\nRain forests are divided into very distinct layers of different types of vegetation.These layers are called \"stories\", because, like a building, they are stacked on top of each other.\nThe top floor of the rainforest forms a platform, where the tops of the tallest trees, called emergents, receive the vast majority of sunlight. Larger monkeys may sunbathe or dine on the platform, and bats and birds of prey nest there, keeping watch for small creatures peeking out.\nThe trees at the top can reach over 250 feet in height. These are broad leafed trees that have flat leaves like deciduous trees but are evergreen like coniferous trees.\nBeneath the emergents is the canopy, a section of thick growth that may be as much as 80 feet deep. Within the canopy are the branches, leaves and twigs of the emergent trees, and also large colonies of plants called epiphytes\nEpiphytes are a classification of small plants that grow directly on larger plants without smothering or harming them. These vines, herbs and flowers root right into the trunks of the emergents and thrive in the canopy where they can receive sunlight that they would never be able to get if they rooted in the ground. The epiphyte population, and the number of plant species in the canopy, create a density that begins to block out much of the sun to the understory beneath.\nThe trees in the understory are between 10 and 30 feet high. They are broad-leafed but have fewer limbs, and stretch out thinly to drink up the little spots of sunlight that trickle down through the canopy. Understory trees are able to survive on very limited light, and their saplings can root and begin to grow in the relative darkness of the rainforest floor.\nFinally, the floor of the rainforest, which receives less than 2% of the available sunlight, is a deep rich bed of leaf litter and animal waste. A compost heap that spurs further growth and greenness.\nThe worlds rainforests cover only about 6% of the globe, but provide safe harbor for nearly 60% of all the worlds species. Scientists believe there are literally thousands of undiscovered species of animals, birds reptiles, insects and plants living in the canopy alone. -Rainforest Animals Facts\ncan it snow in a rain forest?\npanda in the snow\nRainforests are forests that receive a large amount of precipitation, but they don't necessarily have to be warm. There are two types of rainforest - temperate and tropical.\nThe tropical rainforest occurs close to the equator and is warm, (usually hot) and rainy year-round.\nThe temperate rainforest occurs farther away from the equator and has seasonal changes including snowfall in some northern areas. In the bamboo rainforests of China, snowfall occurs fairly regularly and accounts for some of the yearly precipitation that qualifies it as a rain forest.\nOne of the world's most beloved animals - the giant panda - lives in the temperate bamboo rainforests of China. The bamboo in these forests is actually the worlds largest species of grass, and not a tree. It makes up the 25 foot to 30 foot high under-story of the rainforest and is the only ecosystem that can provide the giant panda with the kind of food and shelter it requires. - Rainforest Animals\nThis Form cannot be submitted until the missing\nfields (labelled below in red) have been filled in Vote Here for Your Favorite Animal!

They spend about 98% of their lives high up in the rainforest canopy and only go down to the forest floor to relieve themselves - about once a week!\nEverything about this animal is designed with tree top living in mind. They have specialized claws that allow them to grip branches effortlessly and they spend the majority of their lives hanging up-side-down. Even the fur of three-toed sloths is special.\nThe fur on the torso and limbs grows in the opposite direction from most other animals. The sloth has a part down the center of its belly, not its back, and all the hairs grow outward from there. The hair on the arms and legs grows up the limbs, toward the body, not away, and the follicles point everything so that when the sloth is hanging upside down from a limb in a rain storm, all the rain flows away from it and towards the ground.\nImagine if it were not designed this way. The rain would get caught and pool up between the rows of hairs and the animals skin.\nBeyond just growing in the opposite direction, the sloths fur is usually has a green tinge, especially during times of high rain. Due to the moisture in the air and the sloths very slow movements, algae is actually able to grow on its fur.\nThe algae provides insulation and camouflage in the green forest. In addition to algae, moss, lichens and even moths and other insects have been known to live in the three-toed sloth's spongy mat of fur. - Rain forest Animals\na few more rain forest Animal facts\nRainforests make up only about 6% of the Earth's land surface.\nOver 60% of all the living species in the world call the rainforest their home\nRainforests plants and trees are evergreen and grow continually.\nMany plants in the rainforest are epiphytes that grow directly out of the trunk of another plant and do not need soil to survive.\nthat grow directly out of the trunk of another plant and do not need soil to survive.

Approximately 99 percent of a panda\u2019s diet\u2014bamboo leaves and shoots\u2014is void of much nutritional value. Its carnivore-adapted digestive system cannot digest cellulose well, thus it lives a low-energy, sedentary lifestyle but persists in eating some 60 species of bamboo. Pandas must eat upwards of 30 pounds of bamboo daily just to stay full.\nSee pandas during a WWF tour to China,"}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "What Do Pandas Eat? - AZ Animals", "url": "https://a-z-animals.com/blog/what-do-pandas-eat/", "text": "There\u2019s often public confusion around the relationship between the two identified species of pandas \u2014 but it only makes sense when you consider that these animals are only distantly related and demonstrate dramatic differences in everything from physiology to habitat to behaviors. The name panda is derived from the Nepali word for \u201cbamboo eater\u201d, and the link between these animals breaks down almost entirely according to dietary and nutritional habits.\nDespite being the less well-known of the two, the facts show red pandas earned the name ten years before the giant panda in 1825. It\u2019s an example of how challenging it was to trace evolutionary family trees before the advent of DNA testing, but it\u2019s also proof of how convergent evolution can cause distinct species to develop the same highly specialized \u2014 and highly unusual \u2014 behaviors in isolation from one another. Here\u2019s everything you could want to know about how giant pandas and red pandas eat.\nWhat Do Pandas Eat?\nPandas eat bamboo, leaves, eggs, and rodents. A-Z-Animals.com\nOne way to better understand how natural selection influences diets is to identify animals as generalists or specialists. Generalists can subsist on a variety of different food sources \u2014 and this behavior has allowed omnivorous coyotes to find suitable ecosystems stretching over most of the United States and herbivorous elephants to serve as African gardeners pruning vegetation along migration routes that can extend over 60 miles. Specialists like flamingos and koalas \u2014 which feed primarily on shrimp and eucalyptus leaves respectively \u2014 often manage to flourish by finding a food source that\u2019s readily available but has little competitive demand. But the practical facts behind specialization also make them particularly vulnerable to habitat destruction.\nThis is the case with red pandas and giant pandas, which have two of the most specialized and bizarre diets on the planet. The latter subsists of a diet that\u2019s 99% bamboo species, while the former has a slightly more varied diet that\u2019s between 85 and 95% bamboo. If that seems like a boring diet, there\u2019s at least some solace in the fact that there\u2019s a little variety sprinkled in there. Roughly 40 bamboo species can be found in the overlapping habitats of red and giant pandas. Giant pandas are known to selectively feed on over 20 different varieties, while red pandas will usually feed on only one or two. Despite that, red pandas may exhibit a more varied diet overall since they feed on a wider range of foods outside of bamboo.\nGiant pandas eat a diet that includes:\nBamboo shoots, leaves, and culm (roughly 20 species, 99% of overall diet)\nMeat (pikas, rodents, insects)\nCarrion\nCrops (wheat, pumpkins, kidney beans, livestock feed)\nRed pandas eat a diet that includes:\nBamboo shoots and leaves (1-2 species, 85 \u2013 95% of overall diet)\nMeat (insects, mice, rats, eggs, and small lizards or birds when pregnant)\nPlants (bark, lichen, roots, grass, flowers)\nOther vegetation (berries, fruits, mushrooms, acorns)\nHow Do Pandas Find Food?\nRed and giant pandas have independently adapted to subsist mostly on bamboo, but they\u2019ve also similarly developed \u201cfalse thumbs\u201d that allow them to grip and manipulate bamboo far more easily. But other physiological developments affect what parts of the bamboo plant each species eats. The sharp and weasel-like teeth of the red panda are great for stripping bamboo shoots and leaf tips, but they leave the jointed stem known as the culm to giant pandas. This bear\u2019s heavy, crushing teeth have been designed to effectively chew these stems.\nGiant panda bears tend to selectively prioritize specific bamboo species and parts of the bamboo depending on the seasonal nutritional content. With fewer options to choose from, red pandas will usually supplement their diet with other food sources instead. Foraging is rarely an issue for either species of the panda, because bamboo tends to be available in abundance, and neither species has many natural predators.\nHow Can Pandas Live on a Diet of Mostly Bamboo?\nRed pandas are endangered and are slightly bigger than a domestic cat. Jose Angel Astor Rocha/Shutterstock.com\nSpecies largely manage to succeed by making the most efficient use of their energy, but pandas are an indication that low-efficiency diets can be sustainable when there\u2019s both an abundance of the resource and minimal foraging or hunting needs. Giant pandas only digest 17% of the bamboo they eat, and they make up for that by consuming between 25 and 85 pounds of it a day. By contrast, red pandas can digest 24% of their bamboo diets and have to eat 20 to 30% of their body weight in a day to compensate. As a result, giant and red pandas need to spend 12 to 18 hours out of the day foraging and eating.\nDid You Know Pandas Have the Digestive System of a Typical Carnivore?\nRed and giant pandas may not be closely related, but their inefficiency at digesting bamboo is the result of the fact that they both have the digestive system of a carnivore. In contrast to the typical carnivore\u2019s diet, bamboo is low in protein and fat and high in fiber. Both panda species have to be conscientious about energy consumption as a result. The facts of a 2010 genetic study indicate that both species developed their vegetarian diets after a mutation caused them to lose the ability to taste umami flavors, thus making meat an unappealing nutritional source.\nWhat Animals Eat Pandas?\nThe lethargic and high-volume diets of pandas would be unsustainable if they faced serious predation. Red and giant pandas have overlapping habitats and naturally overlapping predators as well. Snow leopards are the primary threat, but jackals and martens have been known to prey on them as well. In both cases, these animals will typically only prey on panda cubs. Red panda cubs are also threatened by some birds of prey. The biggest threat to pandas comes from human poaching and deforestation.\nNext Up: What Flowers Attract Butterflies?"}

Taxonomists previously assigned them to both the raccoon family and the bear family, but DNA research later revealed that they belong to their own unique family (Ailuridae) and genus (Ailurus).\nWhile originally thought to be two subspecies\u2014the Himalayan red panda and the Chinese red panda\u2014growing evidence suggests they may be two distinct species instead. The Chinese red panda is a bit larger and has more distinct rings on its fluffy tail.\nRange and habitat\nRed pandas live in the rainy mountain forests of Nepal, India, Bhutan, northern Myanmar (Burma), and central China. They spend the vast majority of their lives in trees, where they sleep and sunbathe.\nThese animals have adapted incredibly well to their environment: They have sharp, semi-retractable claws that help them grip slippery branches, and their flexible ankles give them the unique ability to climb down trees headfirst. This helps them quickly escape predators like snow leopards and jackals, which may have difficulty seeing the animals to begin with: Their coats match the moss clumps that grow on their tree homes, and their black bellies make it difficult for predators to spot them from the ground.\nRed pandas even have two layers of fur\u2014a soft undercoat covered with coarse hairs\u2014to insulate them from the mountain chill, and they use their long tail as a wraparound blanket.\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\nDiet\nRed pandas belong to the order Carnivora, but this has more to do with their biological classification than their actual diet. In reality they rarely eat meat, instead using their powerful molars to grind through up to four pounds of bamboo a day. They also sometimes eat fruit, acorns, roots, eggs, rodents, and birds.\nLike giant pandas, red pandas have an extended wrist bone that functions almost like a thumb and helps them grip bamboo shoots. The solitary creatures forage at night and in the gloaming hours of dusk and dawn.\nBehavior\nIn general red pandas live on their own, but when they do interact with other red pandas, they communicate by arching their tails, bobbing their heads, squealing, or making a sound that scientists call a \u201chuff-quack\u201d\u2014a mix between a duck quack and a pig snort. Pandas who feel threatened may let out a barking sound or release a pungent liquid from glands at the base of their tail.\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\nThis smelly liquid also serves another purpose: Males release it to mark their territory when searching for a mate in winter and early spring. They don\u2019t have a big window: females are only fertile for a couple of days a year. They typically give birth to one to four cubs that remain with them for about 90 days. Males take little or no interest in the cubs, leaving the cub-rearing to the mothers.\nThreats and conservation\nRed pandas are considered endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the organization that determines the conservation status of plant and animal species. While no one knows the exact number of animals in the wild, a 2015 estimate put the population at 10,000, a 50 percent drop since 1997.\nThese animals are threatened by people clearing their forest habitat for logging and agriculture, as well as by diseases that can spread from domesticated animals. Hunters also kill red pandas for their fur or inadvertently when the creatures stumble into traps meant for other animals. In rare instances red pandas have been snatched from the wild, likely for the illegal pet trade.\n2:38\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Found in the late 1800s on an expedition, this species of caecilian was rediscovered in 2011 in the same region.\nThe \u2018penis snake\u2019 as it has since been dubbed due to its appearance, is the largest of the few known lung less tetrapods. Its species, caecilian, is a group of limbless, serpentine amphibians that are snake like in appearance, but have rings like a earth worm.\nPhoto credit Fazered via Imgur.\nAtretochoana Facts Overview\nHabitat: Rivers Location: South America Lifespan: 5 \u2013 10 years Size: 80 cm (32 inches) Weight: 50 \u2013 100 grams Color: Pink, purple Diet: Small fish, worms, aquatic invertebrates Predators: Large birds Top Speed: 5 mph (3 kph) No. of Species:\n1 Conservation Status:\nData deficient\nThe penis snake is twice the size of the second-largest lung less tetrapod. It is a limbless amphibian which has a body similar to that of a snake with rings around it much like that of an earthworm. The head is broad and flat and features sealed nostrils, an enlarged mouth and a mobile cheek. There is also a fleshy dorsal fin.\nCaecilians typically have a well-developed right lung along with a vestigial left lung. There are others that have two well-developed lungs. This particular species differs from these as it contains no lungs whatsoever. Capillaries fill the skin which permits the exchange of gas and there are muscles in the skull of the penis snake that have yet to have been found in any other living organism.\nCaecilians usually range in size from 4.3 to 63.0 inches. The penis snake specimen from Vienna measures 28.5 inches and the Brazilian specimen is 31.7 inches in length.\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the penis snake as \u2018Data Deficient\u2019 resulting from a lack of information. Scientists do feel that this animal is to be considered uncommon as its distribution is limited. It is believed to be a predator, or possibly a scavenger, and may even be viviparous.\nThe major threats to the penis snake include any alteration to the land they inhabit that could result in habitat loss and possible drainage of their habitat. The use of pesticides, fertilizers and other pollutants used by man may also contribute to a decline in penis snake population. Development of the habitat for hydroelectric dam projects is the current concern.\nInteresting Penis Snake Facts\n1. The penis snake is not actually a snake, or a penis.\nThanks to the visual similarity to a human penis, this animal has earned many nicknames. They include penis snake, manaconda and floppy snake.\n2. There is no clear understanding on how the penis snake survives.\nAs a lung less animal, there are several challenges. With specimens being located in the Madeira River in 2011, a warm, slow-flowing body of water, scientists question how the snake breathes as warm water contains less oxygen.\n3. These snakes are not believed to be burrowers as most caecilians are.\nPenis snake relatives, such as the lung less salamander and other lung less tetrapods, are aquatic. As a result, it is the opinion of the scientific community that these creatures are also aquatic.\n4. The name given to the genus the penis snake is classified under hints at features of the animal.\nThe word Atretochoana is from two Greek words. Atretos translates to mean \u2018imperforate\u2019 and choana is the word that refers to a funnel or tube shape.\n5. The penis snake is considered a strong swimmer.\nComing from speculation following the witnessing of penis snakes on the surface of both the Amazon and Madeira Rivers, swimming skills are believed to be excellent.\n6. Most lung less snakes rely on their skin to stay alive.\nAs the penis snake is not really a snake, it is not certain how it breathes. Lung less amphibians, such as the salamander, use a method known as cutaneous respiration. This is when gas is exchanged through moistened skin. Plethodontids breathe through their skin as well as the mucous membrane in the mouth. However, in order to absorb oxygen, these surfaces must be moist at all times.\n7. The penis snake lacks additional features common in other life forms similar to it.\nThe eyesight of the penis snake is believed to be poor. However, it is capable of finding food, mates and shelter by a sensitive sense of smell.\n8. Little is known on what the penis snake feeds on.\nBecause the penis snake is a caecilian, scientists feel that it very likely feeds on small fish, worms and other aquatic invertebrates. However, much more research is required in order to be certain.\n9. Development projects in the Amazon are expected to impact the penis snake as well as other life forms in the region.\nA series of hydro-electric dams are being proposed for the Amazon. Brazil has projected that a major project being undertaken there will result in thirty new dams by the year 2020. Environmentalists are critical of the project stating it will severely impact rainforest by flooding it and a national park will require rezoning prior to some construction. Ecologists fear that the dam-building project will impact fish migration and reduce nutrient flows throughout the Amazon basin.\n10. The penis snake is believed to be native to just one main region and have a limited range as a result.\nFound in the Amazon River and the largest tributary to the Amazon \u2013 the Madeira River \u2013 in Brazil, the penis snake has yet to have been found anywhere else on the planet. The Amazon and Madeira are white-water rivers that contain high concentrations of silt which reduces visibility considerably. Speculation points to the possibility that the creature could be found further upstream in Peru or Bolivia but there have been no sightings or discoveries as yet.\n11. Although the penis snake is believed to just inhabit the Amazon River \u2013 and its tributary the Madeira River \u2013 the region is best known for a completely different kind of snake.\nYou\u2019ve heard of the Anaconda snake. While it is not related to the penis snake in any way \u2013 as the penis snake is more of a worm than a snake \u2013 the Anaconda is the largest snake in the South American rainforest. Some specimens have been known to reach up to 17 feet in length. However, the smallest Anaconda can grow to about 12 feet.\nAtretochoana Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification"}

One belief was that it helped them camouflage in forests of bamboo and in the snow, and another suggested that it helped them maintain appropriate body temperature since black absorbs heat and white reflects it. But in 2017, a study published in the journal Behavioral Ecology claimed that the camouflage theory is in fact correct, stating that the white fur helps the animal hide in snowy habitats while the black fur is used for camouflage and communication. The study authors believe their black ears are a sign of aggression toward predators and the black fur around their eyes helps them identify other pandas."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant panda Facts for Kids | KidzSearch.com", "url": "https://wiki.kidzsearch.com/wiki/Giant_Panda", "text": "\"Panda\" redirects here. For other uses, see Panda (disambiguation)\nThe giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca, is a bear. It lives in south central China.\nAlthough it belongs to the order Carnivora, the panda's diet is 99% bamboo. Pandas in the wild occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents or carrion. In captivity, they may get honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.\nThe giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan province, but also in the Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. As a result of farming, deforestation and other development, the panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.\nAppearance\nGiant pandas are bears. They have black and white fur all around them. The black fur is on their ears, around their eyes, on their legs, and on their shoulders.\nGiant pandas are about the size of an American black bear. They are about 3 feet (91 cm) tall at the shoulder when they are standing on all four legs. They are about 6 ft (180 cm) long. Males weigh up to 251 pounds (114 kg) in the wild. Females usually weigh less than 220 pounds (100 kg).\nLiving areas\nWild giant pandas have lived in the mountains of central China. They live in forests of tall trees. They eat the bamboo that grows under the trees. The weather is rainy and misty in the mountain forests. There are thick clouds almost all the time.\nFood and water\nBamboo is the main diet of panda . Ninety-nine percent of the food they eat is bamboo. They eat as much as 40 pounds (18 kg) of bamboo every day. They spend 10 to 16 hours every day looking for food and eating it.\nBamboo is a grass. Sometimes giant pandas eat other grasses. They also eat little rodents or musk deer babies (fawns). In zoos, giant pandas eat bamboo, sugar cane, vegetables, and fruit.\nGiant pandas get a lot of water from the bamboo they eat. They need more water though. They drink from the fresh water streams and rivers in the mountain. Melting snow high in the mountains runs into these streams and rivers.\nKinds of giant pandas\nThere are two kinds of giant panda. They both live in China. The best known is the black and white panda. Its scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca melanoleuca.\nThe other giant panda has dark brown and light brown fur. Its skull is smaller than the other giant panda. It has larger molars. This panda lives only in the Qinling Mountains. Its scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca qinlingensis.\nBaby pandas\nGiant pandas are ready to have babies (cubs) when they are between the ages of four and eight years. They may be able to have babies until about age 20. Female pandas are ready to have a baby only once a year. This is in the springtime. There are only two to three days she is ready for a baby. Calls and scents bring the males and female pandas to each other.\nFemale pandas may give birth to two young. Usually only one lives. Giant panda cubs may stay with their mothers for up to three years. Then they leave her for a life of their own.\nGiant pandas and people\nToday, the giant panda is a symbol for China. It is protected by the Chinese government. Killing a giant panda is a crime. The giant panda may become extinct. It will die out if the forests of bamboo continue to disappear.\nPeople outside of eastern Asia did not know about the giant panda until 1869. The first \"Westerner\" to see a live panda was a German zoologist in 1916. In 1936, Ruth Harkness became the first Westerner to bring a live giant panda out of China. It was a cub (baby panda) named Su-Lin. The cub was taken to live at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago.\nIn the 1970s, China began showing giant pandas in zoos in the United States and Japan as a type of diplomacy. This happened until 1984, when China changed how this was done. Starting in 1984, China would allow zoos to keep the giant pandas for 10 years, but the zoo would have to pay China up to $1,000,000 each year. Also, the zoo would have to agree that any cubs born would belong to China.\nZoos\nOne of three giant pandas at the Atlanta Zoo\n17 cities outside China have zoos with giant pandas.\nNorth America\nEurope\nCopenhagen, Denmark\nAsia\nThe Adelaide Zoo in Adelaide, Australia received two giant pandas in 2009.\nEndangered animal\nThe giant panda is an endangered species. It may become extinct. In 2013, it was estimated that there were less than 2,500 mature giant pandas living in the wild. Illegal hunting is no longer a problem. Hunting for pandas is a crime. The penalties are harsh if you hunt pandas.\nThe greatest threat to survival is the loss of living areas. People are ruining the areas where pandas live. They are cutting down trees. They are building farms. Groups of pandas are forced to live in small areas. They are isolated. They cannot mix other panda groups.\nGiant pandas eat bamboo. Sometimes the bamboo dies off. At one time, pandas could move to an area where bamboo was still growing. Moving has become more and more difficult. People are living and working in panda areas. Pandas cannot move about as freely as they once did.\nHelping pandas to survive\nChina set up the first giant panda nature reserve in 1963. Other nature reserves were also set up. There were 40 giant panda reserves in 2006.\nRelated pages\nReferences\nOther websites\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'Module:Icon/data' not found."}

How many of these facts did you already know about pandas and their lives?\n\ud83e\udd23 Beano Facts Team\nPandas! They're the weirdest and most unique bears around. Learn all about where they live, what their name means, and just how much they poo a day (hint; its a lot!) with our interesting panda facts! If you liked this, we've got more awesome animal facts, including weird animal facts, these turtelly-awesome turtle facts, and these slow but sweet sloth facts! Go Wild!\n1. Giant Pandas Aren't That Giant\nThe name 'Giant Panda' is a bit misleading - while Giant Pandas are big, they're probably not as big as you're imagining; smaller than a polar bear and a grizzly bear. The reason they're called 'Giant' is to distinguish them from Red Pandas. That doesn't mean they're small though! Males can weigh as much as 350lb!\n2. They Live In China\nPandas live in a relatively small region of the world; Mountain ranges in the Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces of south China. Their habitat is mostly misty, mountainous and cloudy, which may explain their white and black colouring - it could be for camouflage.\n3. It's One of China's National Animals\nThe most-used national symbol of China is the dragon, but the panda often pops up too, appearing on coins as at the Beijing Olympics as a mascot. Pandas are also often given as a diplomatic gift from China to other countries - which makes sense, it's pretty hard to get your hands on a dragon!\n4. Pandas Sometimes Pretend To Get Pregnant\nBecause of their declining population, zoos with pandas are particularly keen to get them to breed. Some pandas seem to have noticed that they get special treatment when they are pregnant, because there have been recorded instances of pandas faking pregnancy to get the best snacks!\n5. Pandas Need Help\nPandas are a vulnerable species, which means they could be in danger of dying out. The two biggest causes of this are habitat loss and their own reluctance to reproduce - on average pandas only give birth every two years, and normally only one cub survives, so it's hard to get their populations to grow quickly. At the moment its estimated there are only about 2,000 at high estimate. But the good news is, they seem to be slowly increasing their populations - they're now classed as 'vulnerable' instead of 'endangered'.\n6. They Aren't Related To Red Pandas\nThe name is rather confusing, but red pandas and normal pandas aren't related! In fact, the red panda isn't even a panda! It's a mustelid, which is a family of animals that includes weasels, badgers, otters and wolverines.\n7. Panda Means 'Bear Cat'\nPanda is a Chinese word which directly translates as something like 'bear cat'. This makes sense; the panda is definitely a bear, but it's round ears, unique markings and playful nature are similar to that of an overgrow, naughty cat!\n8. They Need A Lot of Bamboo\nYup, they really do need to eat a LOT of bamboo. Pandas eat roughly 20 to 40lbs of bamboo a day! In the wild, this can take up to 16 hours to forage. Their digestive system isn't as efficient as it could be, which is why they need so much bamboo to get all the nutrients they need.\n9. They Sometimes Eat Meat\nAlthough 99% of their diets are plant based, pandas are technically omnivores, and their bodies are designed for a carnivore diet, like most bears. This means that very occasionally, they will eat meat - normally small rodents\n10. They Poo About 40 Times A Day\nIt's inevitable, after all that bamboo - pandas need to poo! And they poo a LOT - about 40 times in one day! Can you imagine going to the loo that much? You wouldn't get anything else done!\n11. They Don't Hibernate\nMost bears hibernate in winter to preserve energy, ready for mating season in the spring. Not pandas though. The reason is pretty simple - they can't stop eating. Their diet of bamboo and other plants isn't designed to help them store lots of fat like most other bears, and so they have to keep eating if they want to survive!\n12. They Like Their Alone Time\nPandas are pretty solitary - they don't tend to hang around in groups, and they only really meet up to mate. Although they can form groups, these groups are pretty wide spread and don't spend too much time together. The only ones who really hang out are mums and babies - who stay together for the first two years of the cubs life. Aw!\n13. They Like To Nap\nPandas love a nap. They aren't quite as sleepy as the koala, but they still get in a good couple of hours every day between meals! This is to preserve enough energy to forage and hunt more food.\n14. You Can Visit Pandas In The UK!\nThere are several hundred pandas in captivity, mostly in China, but there are two pandas in the UK which you can visit! Tian Tian (Sweetie) and Yang Guang (Sunshine) live at Edinburgh Zoo, where they attract hundreds of visitors every day. They don't hang out much, in fact they only meet once a year for breeding season!\n15. They Can Live For Up To 35 Years\nExperts aren't sure how long pandas live in the wild, but in captivity they've been known to live as long as 35 years! They probably live less than this in the wild due to habitat loss, disease and other factors."}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Animals Native to China - WorldAtlas", "url": "https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/animals-native-to-china.html", "text": "China has a very large landscape which is home to a great variety of wildlife. The diversity in the wildlife of China includes 562 mammal, 346 amphibia, 4936 fish, and 403 reptile species. China has the third largest number of mammals in the world. Animals such as the giant panda are endemic to China. Some of the animals that are native to China include the Asian elephant, sable, dugong, Pallas cat, North China leopard, binturong, clouded leopard, Tibetan macaque, golden snub-nosed monkey, and the giant panda.\n10. Asian Elephant\nThe elephant is the largest land animal on earth. However, the Asian elephant is slightly smaller than the African elephant. They can be differentiated from the African elephant by their smaller rounded ears. Their ears help in cooling their body through radiation. The Asian elephant showers by sucking water with their trunk then spraying their body. The elephant uses its trunk for drinking, grabbing, breathing, and smelling. Their main meals are bark, grass, roots, and fruits. Then female Asian elephants live with their young ones in family herds while their male counterparts roam freely. Their pregnancy takes a total of twenty-two months. One interesting thing about the Asian elephants is that they can be domesticated. They help in activities such as falling trees and carrying humans.\n9. Sable\nThe sable is mainly found in the northern parts of Mongolian mountains in China. The sable is a weasel-like creature. It weighs between two to five pounds and has a length of between 15-20 inches. The sable feeds on meat. Its other family members include; mink, badgers, otters, and ferrets. Their body color ranges from brown to a dark color that is almost black. They have patches on their neck that has a salmon color. The sable uses the sense of smell and hearing for hunting. They are therefore very stealthy for successful hunting. They feed on birds, small mammals, and fish. Sables enjoy living in temperate forests.\n8. Dugong\nThe dugong is found in the warm coastal waters of the Pacific Ocean. They are quite big, and they are vegetarians. Dugongs have very similar behavior and appearance to the manatees. The major feature that differentiates them is the dugong\u2019s tail that is fluked like the one of a whale. Scientific studies show that they are related to the elephant despite not having similar appearance or behavior. Dugongs mainly feed on underwater grass. They can go up to six minutes in water. Dugongs can be spotted alone, in pairs, or in large herds. The pregnancy of a dugong is 12 months.\n7. Pallas Cat\nThe Pallas cat is almost the size of a domestic cat. However, it looks bigger since it is long and built, and has a dense coat. The coat keeps it warm in the cold and changes color depending on the season. During spring, the fur turns fox-red while in winter it turns grey. Their body hair becomes longer and heavier during the cold season. The length of their body ranges from 50 to 60 centimeters. They weigh 2.5-5.0 kilograms. The male Pallas cat is heavier than their female counterparts. Their large eyes with a big forehead make them display a flat face.\n6. North China Leopard\nThe North Chinese Leopard is one of the world's Big Cats. Despite being known as the North China Leopard, some are found in Russia. They are listed as Critically Endangered with less than 100 individuals seen in the wild. They are often found in elevated forests and are well adapted to cold temperatures. They display a shorter cream-colored coat in the summer and a longer golden or yellowish-red coat in the winter. The coat has black rosettes year round.\n5. Binturong\nThe Binturong is scientifically known as Arctictis binturong. Their lifespan differs; the male binturong have an average lifespan of 18.8 years while their female counterparts have an average lifespan of 15.6 years. Their gestation period ranges between 84 and 92 days. The binturong weighs about 142 kilograms at birth and about 20 kilograms at maturity. They mature after three years. Their tail of between 50 and 85 centimeters elongates their body length that ranges between 60 and 90 centimeters. Their body color ranges from black to brown silver or white on the tips. These colors give the binturong a grizzled appearance.\n4. Clouded Leopard\nThe clouded leopard is scientifically known as Neofelis nebulosi or Neofelis diardi. This leopard has a lifespan of about 13 years. Their gestation period ranges between 86 and 95 days depending on the species. The young ones weigh about 170 grams at birth. They take about 25 months to mature. The clouded leopard is between 68 and 105 centimeters long. Their tail that is about 70 centimeters long elongates their body. The males are heavier than the females. The male clouded leopard has an average weight of 23 kilograms while the females weigh about 12 kilograms. Clouded leopards are very good at swimming.\n3. Tibetan Macaque\nThe Tibetan Macaque is also known as Stump-tailed or Pere David\u2019s Macaque or the Short-tailed Tibetan Macaque. They are the largest species of macaque. Their thick fur is quite long. The fur is very dense on their head and around their ears. The coat is warm protecting them from cold during the winter season. A few Tibetans are black while others are greyish brown. Young macaques have a darker fur with a silver tinge. Their eyelids are light-colored. They have a large cheek with a muzzle that is hairless. The females can be differentiated from the males by the red skin around their eyes.\n2. Golden Snub Nosed Monkey\nThe Golden snub-nosed monkey is also known as Sichuan snub-nosed monkey. This species of monkey is very rare and can only be found Southwest and central China. The Golden snub-monkey has long golden-brown guard hair on their backs. This feature makes it be identified easily. Their name comes as a result of their nose that is unique with no protruding nasal bones. Some scientists believe that this type of nose helps them to avoid frostbites. The size of guard hairs differentiates the male subadults from the female ones. The male adults have more and longer guard hairs than the subadults.\n1. Giant Panda\nThe giant panda is part of the bear family. The body of the giant panda is covered by a thick black and white coat. However, black fur is predominant since it covers its long wrist bones, legs, shoulders, muzzles and eyes. These animals weigh up to 330 pounds. They have a tail of about fourteen centimeters that attenuates their 150-centimeter body. They are about 90 centimeters tall. They feed on meat and plants, with the majority of their diet composed of bamboo. One interesting fact about the giant panda is that they spend about 12 hours a day eating. They are majorly found in Southwest China."}

Among the world\u2019s rarest and most threatened animals, giant pandas are adorably plump, prominent symbols of nature\u2019s treasures, international diplomacy and global efforts to save the world\u2019s long list of endangered species. PAW is the work of China\u2019s Chengdu Panda Base, a leading panda breeding and research base in southwest China\u2019s Sichuan province that plays an important role in saving giant pandas from extinction.\nFollow @GlobalSherpa\nThe clip below shows some playful young giant pandas enjoying a fun workout at Chengdu Panda Base. (Warning: This video contains images of extreme cuteness that may be highly addicting.)\n[youtube sGF6bOi1NfA]\nPanda Diplomacy\nAs home to nearly all of the world\u2019s wild giant pandas, China has practiced the fine art of panda diplomacy since the Tang Dynasty (618-907), when Empress Wu Zetian (624-705) sent a pair of the animals to the Japanese emperor as a gesture of goodwill.\nFrom 1958 to 1982, China reportedly loaned a total of 23 giant pandas to nine different countries. Chairman Mao Zedong\u2019s aggressive brand of panda diplomacy may have reached its height when the Communist leader sent giant pandas Hsing Hsing and Ling Ling to Washington, D.C. on the heels of U.S. President Richard Nixon\u2019s historic summit visit to China in 1972. Writing in the Irish Times, Frank McNally suggested the animals might have been the most deserving recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize. Apparently, Nixon chose to reciprocate by giving China a pair of musk oxen in return.\nGiant Panda Facts\nDespite their Asian origins and exotic good looks, giant pandas are essentially black and white bears. Full grown adult giant pandas typically tip the scales at 220 to 330 pounds or 100 to 150 kg. While at birth, a baby panda cub weighs in at a tiny 3.5 to 7 ounces, or about 1/900th of the size of its mother. Despite their formidable dimensions, adult pandas are adept tree climbers and can frequently be found lounging among the limbs of dense bamboo forests.\nAnother Helping of Bamboo Please\nThere\u2019s a reason why many fetching panda pictures feature one of the lovable animals sitting on its haunches or reclining on its back gnawing away at a bamboo shoot. Giant pandas are some of the world\u2019s most dedicated vegetarians. Despite their adorable, roly poly physiques and carnivore\u2019s digestive system, pandas have evolved to feast almost exclusively on bamboo leaves.\nLong stints at the dinner table are a direct result of the intriguing juxtaposition in the pandas\u2019 eating habits. Giant pandas spend anywhere from 10 to 16 hours per day consuming 26 to 83 pounds (12 to 38 kg) of bamboo in order to fulfill their daily dietary requirements.\nFortunately, the fibrous green shoots that monopolize the panda\u2019s diet grow like a weed once they take hold. Although, it can take 20 years for a bamboo forest that dies off \u2013 a natural phenomenon occurring every 15-120 years \u2013 to return to the point of supporting a giant panda population.\nNot So Fast\nWhile the pandas\u2019 fondness for all things bamboo is well-documented, the recent discovery of a panda feeding on the carcass of a takin (Himalayan goat-antelope) that died of natural causes has raised eyebrows within the conservation community. The evidence came courtesy of a motion sensor camera on the Motianling Land Trust Reserve in northern Sichuan province that was established by The Nature Conservancy, Peking University and local government partners to assess and monitor local wildlife.\nPanda Habitat Loss and Preservation\nBefore modern civilization encroached on the pandas\u2019 natural habitat, they were once widespread in the temperate broadleaf forests of southern and eastern China, Myanmar (Burma) and northern Vietnam. As economic development took hold in China\u2019s lower lying areas, the pandas retreated to more remote mountainous surroundings. Satellite imagery reveals that half of the limited natural panda habit remaining in 1974 was lost in a period of just 15 years to 1989. The maps below from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Conservation International show the dramatic reduction in China\u2019s panda habitat. (Click on the images below to view the full-size maps in a separate browser tab or window.)\nToday, China\u2019s panda population is largely confined to about 20 isolated patches of forest in six mountain ranges in southwestern China: Minshan, Qinling, Qionglai, Liangshan, Daxiangling and Xiaoxiangling. The fragmentation of China\u2019s panda population and their natural habitat increases their vulnerability and risk of extinction.\nAn Endangered Species\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species classifies the giant panda as an endangered species based on several factors, including population size, extent of interaction, capacity for reproduction and rate of population change. Billed as \u201cthe most comprehensive survey of China\u2019s giant panda population,\u201d a four-year study by the State Forestry Administration of China and the WWF identified nearly 1,600 giant pandas living in the wild in China by 2004. The encouraging results revealed a panda population more than 40 percent larger than previously thought.\nChina\u2019s Panda Conservation Efforts\nFortunately, the Chinese government has taken action to reclaim and protect the pandas and their stomping grounds by establishing a multitude of panda reserves. By mid-2005, over 50 reserves protected more than 45 percent of the remaining giant panda habitat.\nSince its founding in 1987 with the rescue of six giant pandas, Chengdu Panda Base (officially the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding) has managed to breed and nurture a population of 108 giant pandas, a number that it hopes to increase to 150 pandas within the next ten years. Along with wildlife research and captive breeding, the center also engages in conservation education and educational tourism. In addition to giant pandas, Chengdu Panda Base is home to red pandas, golden monkeys and other wild and indigenous species.\nNortheast of Chengdu in Shaanxi province, the mystical environs of the fog-crested Qinling mountain range lay claim to about twenty percent of China\u2019s wild pandas. The mountains form a boundary between two of China\u2019s largest watersheds, the Chiangjiang (Yangtze River) and Huang He (Yellow River). Set in the foothills of the Qinling mountains, the Shaanxi Wild Animal Conservation Research Centre (SWARC) works to rescue injured animals and prevent the extinction of China\u2019s indigenous species, including: giant pandas, crested ibis, golden monkeys, takins and brown-eared pheasants.\nFarther east, the China Conservation and Research Center for Giant Panda was founded in Wolong, China with the help of the WWF. The Wolong panda center has succeeded in breeding giant pandas that have been provided to zoos around the world, including: Austria\u2019s Tiergarten Schonbrunn (Zoo Vienna), Japan\u2019s Kobe Oji Zoo, Thailand\u2019s Chiang Mai Zoo, and the U.S.\u2019 San Diego Zoo and Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington D.C. The picture below shows a group of Wolong staff holding a host of giant panda cubs.\nInternational Conservation Efforts in China\nIn honor of the panda\u2019s highly photogenic status and emotional appeal as a symbol of environmental conservation, the World Wildlife Fund adopted the giant panda for its logo when the organization was formed in 1961. As the first international conversation organization to work in China, WWF has been active in protecting China\u2019s giant pandas since 1980.\nFortunately, the WWF\u2019s friendly history with the Chinese government has not kept it from pushing China to do more to protect the natural environment at home and broad, particularly in Africa. According to the WWF, \u201cChina is now the world\u2019s largest consumer of forest products, and it imports more than 50 percent of Mozambique\u2019s and Tanzania\u2019s timber.\u201d As part of its China-Africa work, the WWF is partnering with the U.K.\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID) to facilitate cooperation between Chinese and African officials that would promote the sustainable, legal use of Africa\u2019s rich supply of natural resources.\nVisit a Panda, Get Involved\nFor the more adventurous, one of the best ways to enjoy an up-close and personal encounter with a giant panda is to visit a research center in China. Chengdu Panda Base offers visitors the chance to walk or ride through the base\u2019s panda habitat, tour the panda museum and take part in educational programming. Truly diehard panda aficionados can apply to participate in the base\u2019s one-to-three month internship program.\nFor those short of the time or cash to visit the pandas in their native land, a limited number of them can be found in a handful of zoos around the world. At present, a total of 45 giant pandas live in 16 zoos in eleven countries, including: Australia, Austria, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, U.K. and U.S.\nJapan claims the distinction of having the most zoos with giant pandas. A total of eight giant pandas reside at Adventure World Shirahama, the Kobe Oji Zoo and Tokyo\u2019s Ueno Zoo. While most giant pandas living abroad come from breeding centers in China, three of Adventure World\u2019s four giant pandas were born locally. At Ueno, Ri Ri and Shin Shin are the proud parents of the first baby giant panda born in 2012 and the first born in Tokyo since 1988.\nIn the U.S., four zoos are lucky to have custody of giant pandas: the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C., the San Diego Zoo, Zoo Atlanta and Zoo Memphis. The Smithsonian hosts giant pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian through 2015 under a Giant Panda Cooperative Research and Breeding Agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association. Thanks to a cooperative arrangement with Chengdu Panda Base, Zoo Atlanta has an enviable collection of four giant pandas, Lun Lun, Yang Yang, Mei Lan and Xi Lan, whose birthdays all happen to fall within two weeks of one another in September.\nTo learn more about contributing to international efforts to protect the giant pandas and their natural habitats, visit the sites of conservation organizations like the World Wildlife Fund, The Nature Conservancy and Conservation International.\nFollow @GlobalSherpa\nRelated articles and content:\nGlobal Sherpa country profiles and topic pages: China, Japan, India, Brazil, BRIC Countries, Development, Sustainability, World Rankings\nGiant Panda Quiz!\nArctic Polar Bears on Thinning Ice\nCambodia Biodiversity Find \u2013 Carnivorous Plant\nChina in Africa: South Africa Joins BRICs Summit\nVisit the Global Sherpa home page."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Endangered Animals Facts For Kids: Information & Pictures", "url": "https://www.activewild.com/endangered-animals-facts-for-kids/", "text": "This page contains endangered animals facts for kids \u2013 and anyone else interested in finding out about the world\u2019s threatened species.\nHere you\u2019ll find all kinds of information on endangered animals, including: who decides if a species is endangered; the different categories for endangered species; and why animals become endangered.\nWe\u2019ll begin with some interesting endangered animals information. We\u2019ll then discover more about threatened animals with a list of endangered animals facts for kids.\nYou can see a list of endangered animals here: Endangered Animals List.\nEndangered Animals Facts For Kids: What Is An Endangered Animal?\n\u2018Endangered animal\u2019 is a term used to describe a species that is in danger of becoming extinct.\nMore specifically, an Endangered Species is a species that has been identified by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as being under threat of global extinction.\nThe International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is an international organisation that compiles data on endangered animals and places them into different threat categories. Their findings are presented on the IUCN Red List.\nThe term \u2018Endangered\u2019 is usually used to describe an animal\u2019s global status, rather than its local status.\nFor example, the number of Common Starlings is falling in Europe. However, in Asia there is no change in their numbers and in Africa the population is increasing. Therefore, Common Starlings are not considered to be endangered.\nAnimals can be \u2018locally endangered\u2019, or even \u2018locally extinct\u2019, without being globally endangered.\nThere are guidelines on how animals should be counted. How a species is categorized on the Red List (see below) depends on how fast its population is falling and how many animals have already been lost.\nExtinct Animals\nA species becomes extinct when the very last one of its kind dies. Animals that have become extinct include the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Terror Birds, the Dodo, and the Thylacine.\nThere are actually two official extinction categories, as we\u2019ll find out below.\nSpecies go extinct in the wild all of the time naturally. It\u2019s part of nature. However, we have a duty to prevent animals becoming threatened due to human activity.\nFacts About Endangered Animals: IUCN Categories\n\u2018Endangered\u2019 is one of three categories the IUCN uses for species that are threatened with extinction, and one of nine that the IUCN uses to rate all species. These categories are:\nLeast Concern (LC)\nNear Threatened (NT)\nVulnerable (VU)\nEndangered (EN)\nCritically Endangered (CR)\nExtinct in the Wild (EW)\nExtinct (EX)\nTwo other categories are also used. Not Evaluated (NE) is for species that haven\u2019t yet been studied. Data Deficient (DD) means that insufficient data has been collected.\nThe IUCN Red List is not just for animals; plants and fungi can become endangered, and are also included on the list.\nAs you can see from the list above, there are two degrees of extinction.\nIf a species is \u2018Extinct in the Wild\u2019, then there are still living specimens, but they are in zoos, or in places other than where they were naturally found.\nIf a species is \u2018Extinct\u2019, there is no way back. The species will never again be seen on Earth.\nEndangered Animals Facts For Kids\nBelow is a list of facts about endangered animals. There are several links you can follow to find out more about a particular animal. If you want to learn even more endangered animals information see our Endangered Animals List.\nAmur Leopards are the most endangered big cats (not including the South China Tiger, which scientists believe may already be extinct). Amur Leopards have been categorised by the IUCN as being \u2018Critically Endangered\u2019. Estimates of the number of Amur Leopards left in the wild range from around 70 to under 20.\nThere are two species of Orangutan: the Bornean Orangutan, and the Sumatran Orangutan. Both are on the Red List.\nThe Bornean Orangutan is endangered. There are only around 40,000 left in the wild.\nThe Sumatran Orangutan is critically endangered. Sadly only around 7,000 of these beautiful animals are left in the wild.\nThe main cause of Orangutans becoming endangered is habitat loss caused by deforestation.\nOf the seven species of Sea Turtle found in our oceans, two (Kemp\u2019s Ridley and Hawksbill) are Critically Endangered, one (Green) is Endangered, and three (Loggerhead, Olive Ridley and Leatherback) are Vulnerable. (Insufficient data have been collected on the Flatback Sea Turtle.)\nThe world\u2019s Tiger population has shrunk by around 97% since the beginning of the 19 th century.\ncentury. Today, it is possible that there are as few as 3,200 tigers left in the wild.\nOf the six tiger subspecies, 3 are Critically Endangered, and the other 3 are endangered.\nTigers are going extinct due to deforestation and habitat loss. Even today they are still hunted for their fur and body parts.\nThe most endangered tiger subspecies is the South China Tiger. Some scientists believe that it is already extinct in the wild.\nSeveral species of whale were hunted almost to extinction, including the Blue Whale. Whales were hunted for their meat and blubber. Their body parts were also used to make products including tools, ornaments, fuel, clothes and baskets.\nToday, five species of whale are classed as being endangered. These are: the Sei Whale, Blue Whale, Fin Whale, North Atlantic Right Whale, and North Pacific Right Whale.\nThe Sperm Whale is also threatened, and is classed as \u2018Vulnerable\u2019.\nOther whale species may be threatened, but there isn\u2019t enough data to classify them yet.\nToday\u2019s Blue Whale population is under 1% of its original size. However, due to hunting bans, the number of Blue Whales is growing. There may be as many as 12,000 Blue Whales alive today, but they are still at risk.\nEndangered animals don\u2019t just live in rainforests or far-flung foreign lands. Franklin\u2019s bumblebee is a critically endangered insect found in California and Oregon. The Dusky gopher frog is found in Mississippi. Many other threatened species are found in Northern America, Europe and Australia.\nIt\u2019s not all bad news: the Iberian Lynx was rated Critically Endangered in 2002. In 2014 its rating was changed to \u2018Endangered\u2019. However, there are still under 200 individuals left in the wild.\nThanks to conservation measures, populations of Blue Whales in some areas are approaching their original numbers. With our help, many other species around the world are making a comeback.\nHow Many Endangered Animals Are There In The World?\nThe numbers of species Listed As Near Threatened, Vulnerable, Threatened, Critically Endangered, and Extinct In The Wild on the IUCN Red List, as of February 2016, are:\nNear Threatened: 5,204\nVulnerable: 11,029\nEndangered: 7,323\nCritically Endangered: 4,898\nExtinct In The Wild: 69\nEndangered Animals Activity\nThe plight of endangered animals such as tigers, pandas and gorillas is well-known, and each has its own charity or charities.\nThere are many, many other species that are not as famous but whose situation is just as serious.\nWhy not learn about a lesser-known endangered animal, and try to raise awareness of its situation among your family and friends? You could design posters and give a presentation about your chosen animal.\nHere are some lesser-known critically endangered animals you might like to study: Great Indian bustard (a bird), Pygmy three-toed sloth, Northern bald ibis (a bird), Vaquita (a porpoise), Angel shark, Attenborough\u2019s echidna, Bulmer\u2019s fruit bat.\nEndangered Animals Facts For Kids Conclusion\nAs an animal lover it\u2019s easy to get upset when reading about endangered animals. However, the more we know about endangered animals, the more we can help them, either directly or indirectly. Don\u2019t forget that there are many conservation success stories!\nWhat can you do to make a difference?\nFind out about some of the world\u2019s most amazing endangered animals here: List Of Endangered Animals."}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "20 Astonishing Cheetah Facts - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/cheetahs/", "text": "Cheetah Profile\nThe Cheetah is a large, slender cat that live in sub-Saharan Africa, and in eastern and southern African parks. Cheetahs can also be found in small numbers in southern Algeria, northern Niger and Iran.\nThe Cheetah is the fastest land animal on the planet. They are members of the family Felidae, which includes the tiger, lion, jaguar, leopard, snow leopard, and other big cats.\nCheetah Facts Overview\nHabitat: Dry Grasslands, Scrub Forests & Savannahs. Location: sub-Saharan Africa, eastern and southern Africa, southern Algeria, northern Niger and Iran Lifespan: 15 \u2013 20 Years Size: 112 \u2013 150 cm (45 \u2013 60 in) Weight: 46 \u2013 159 pounds (21 \u2013 72 kg) Color: Tan with black spots Diet: Gazelles, Wildebeest, Impalas, Rabbits, Birds, Hares, Antelopes, & Warthogs Predators: Lions, Leopards, Hyenas, Eagles (Young cubs) Top Speed: 100 kph (65 mph) No. of Species:\n1 Conservation Status:\nVulnerable\nCheetahs are found in open and dry grasslands in the Sub-Saharan region of Africa, although they were once widespread throughout Africa and Asia. The majority of Cheetahs today inhabit natural reserves or parks.\nCheetahs in the wild typically live between 10 \u2013 15 years in the wild. Some can reach 20 years of age while in captivity.\nThe Cheetah has a slender body with long legs and is clearly designed for speed. They are tan in color with a massive covering of black spots all over the body. The unique patterns of the spots are as distinctive as fingerprints are on humans.\nCheetahs are easy to distinguish from other large cats as they are smaller in size, have a smaller head and ears than most other cats, have a spotted coat and carry what are known as tear stripes that run from the corner of each eye to the side of their nose.\nThese meat eaters typically hunt and eat impalas, wildebeest calves, gazelles and other smaller hoofed animals. They are diurnal, which means they hunt during the day and rely on tall grasses to hide when on the hunt. Cheetahs mostly hunt in either the late morning or early evening.\nA typical chase can last between 20 and 60-seconds with only half of them being successful. They have large non-retractable claws that are used to prevent skidding when cornering quickly, and to pull down an animal.\nInteresting Cheetah Facts\n1. Cheetahs are the fastest land animal in the world.\nThese cats are fast. They can typically reach speeds of up to 98 kilometers per hour (61 miles per hour), and can go from 0 to 60 Mph in just 3-seconds, which is faster than most super-cars. Their stride length becomes as long as 7m (23ft) at full pace, which means the cheetah spends more than half the time airborne.\n2. Cheetahs don\u2019t simply rely on their speed, they anticipate the escape tactics of different prey when hunting.\nA team or researchers found that Cheetahs hunting tactics were specific to characteristics of their prey, and are far more sophisticated than thought.\n3. The Cheetah tail helps them steer at high speed.\nIt may look large and cumbersome, but when on the chase, the tail of the Cheetah plays an important role. It actually helps to steer the cheetah as it runs, like a rudder on a boat.\nIt\u2019s not a cheetahs speed that\u2019s their greatest attribute when hunting, it\u2019s this agility \u2014 their skill at jumping sideways, changing directions quickly and slowing down almost instantly.\n4. Cheetahs tire quickly.\nDue to the energy required to run at such speed, cheetahs can only maintain a chase for between 200 \u2013 300m. If a hunt isn\u2019t successful after 1 min, they usually stop to rest.\n5. Fossils have revealed that Cheetahs date way, way back.\nCarbon dating has estimated the age of some cheetah fossils as being between one and two million years old.\n6. Cheetah can\u2019t roar.\nUnlike big cats like the lion, cheetahs are unable to roar. They are closer to your domestic house cat in that they can purr, both inhaling and exhaling.\n7. Female adult cheetahs often live alone.\nKnown to be typically solitary animals, females raise their cubs alone for about a year before they leave. Male cheetahs sometimes will live in a small group of brothers from the same litter.\n8. Cheetahs abandon around 10% of kills to larger predators.\nIn order to prevent losing their kill to another big and nasty carnivore (Lions, hyenas or even vultures), Cheetahs will move their prey to a secluded spot, and eat quickly. They will also hunt during the day when predators are generally asleep, and only end up abandoning a relatively small number of kills.\n9. The cheetahs spots act as camouflage.\nThe cheetah can have between 2,000 and 3,000 spots, to help it blend into surroundings when hunting or hiding from predators.\n10. There is no end to the cheetah mating season.\nCheetahs can mate any time of the year with gestation lasting just three months. A litter can range between 2 and 4 cubs.\n11. Cheetah cubs have a very different coat to that of adults.\nThe cubs have a smoky colored, long, wooly coat called a mantle. It runs down their backs and acts as a form of camouflage. It helps to conceal the cubs and their mothers assist in this by constantly seeking places to \u2018hide\u2019 them to protect the cubs from predators until they are old enough to take care of themselves.\n12. Cubs get moved around a lot.\nFemale cheetahs will move their cubs to different hiding places every few days. Once the cubs reach 5 or 6 weeks of age, they will follow their mothers and even start eating from their kills. By the time the cubs reach one year of age, they are hunting on their own. At 15 months, they will move away from their mother and either find a mate or sometimes live in a small group.\n13. Cheetahs are not that thirsty\u2026for water that is.\nHaving adapted for life in an environment where there is little water, cheetahs can go three to four days without a drop of it. That doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t actually get any liquids at all. As it turns out, cheetahs are able to draw water from the animals they hunt, kill and eat.\n14. Cheetahs start families early.\nThe male can reproduce at the age of one while females can begin rearing families at the age of two. The pairing is mostly random as cheetahs will mate with many different cheetahs during their lifetime.\n15. Females end up raising their young alone.\nMales do not participate in the rearing of their young however, females have been described as caring, affectionate and dedicated mothers.\n16. Cheetah cubs have a shockingly high mortality rate.\nOne study in the 90\u2019s the Serengeti found that 95% of cubs died before reaching adulthood. Many deaths were due to Lions, but also other predators and disease.\n17. Cheetahs can do something no other cat can do.\nThe Cheetah is the only big cat that is capable of turning in mid-air while sprinting.\n18. It\u2019s a myth that cheetahs abandon hunts due to overheating when running.\nTwo Harvard scientists in 1973 set-up an artificial experiment in a laboratory, that that concluded a cheetah would be forced to stop running when their body temperature reached 40.5 degrees Celsius.\nHowever, new research in real world conditions shows that cheetahs body temperatures never rise that high in the wild, and they don\u2019t abandon hunts due to overheating.\n19. Cheetahs have been around for a very, very long time.\nSumerians trained cheetahs for hunting back in 3000 BC. The Indian (then Hindustan) ruler Emperor Akbar had 1,000 trained cheetahs he used for hunting while in power from 1556 to 1605. Even King Tut\u2019s tomb (1400 BC) contained various cheetah artifacts. It was because of this that historians believed that the cheetah was a sacred animal to ancient Egyptians.\n20. Cheetahs are slowly disappearing from the planet.\nAt the turn of the 20th century there were well over 100,000 cheetahs. Today the numbers are considerably less with roughly 7,000 in Africa and a few hundred in Iran. They have been driven out of their historic range by humans, and are now only found in Algeria, Angola, Northern Niger, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, South Africa, and Mozambique. The species is already almost extinct in Asia, with fewer than 50 individuals remaining in one isolated pocket of Iran.\nCheetah Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification\nKingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Carnivora Infraorder: Cetacea Suborder: Feliformia Family: Felidae Subfamily:\nFelinae Genus:\nAcinonyx Species Name:\nAcinonyx Jubatus\nRelated \u2018Big Cat\u2019 Facts"}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Red Panda Facts: Behavior, Habitat, Diet - ThoughtCo", "url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/red-panda-facts-4172726", "text": "The red panda (Ailurus fulgens) is a furry mammal with a lush red coat, a bushy tail, and a masked face. Although both the red panda and the giant panda live in China and eat bamboo, they are not close relatives. The giant panda is more closely related to a bear, while the red panda's next of kin is a raccoon or skunk. Scientists have long debated the red panda's classification; currently, the creature is the only member of the family Ailuridae.\nFast Facts: Red Panda Scientific Name : Ailurus fulgens\n: Ailurus fulgens Common Name : Red panda\n: Red panda Basic Animal Group : Mammal\n: Mammal Size : 20-25 inch body; 11-23 inch tail\n: 20-25 inch body; 11-23 inch tail Weight : 6.6-13.7 pounds\n: 6.6-13.7 pounds Diet : Omnivore\n: Omnivore Lifespan : 8-10 years\n: 8-10 years Habitat : Southwestern China and the Eastern Himalayas\n: Southwestern China and the Eastern Himalayas Population : Hundreds\n: Hundreds Conservation Status: Endangered\nDescription\nA red panda is about as big as a domestic cat. Its body ranges from 20 to 25 inches and its tail is 11 to 23 inches. Males are slightly heavier than females, with the average adult panda weighing 6.6 to 13.7 pounds.\nA red panda has reddish fur, a masked face, and a banded tail. Feng Wei Photography / Getty Images\nThe red panda's back features soft, reddish-brown fur. Its belly and legs are dark brown or black. The panda's face has distinctive white markings, somewhat similar to those of a raccoon. The bushy tail has six rings, which serve as camouflage against trees. Thick fur covers the animal's paws, protecting them from the cold of snow and ice.\nA red panda's body is adapted for feeding on bamboo. Its front legs are shorter than its hind legs, giving it a waddling walk. Its curved claws are semi-retractable. Like the giant panda, the red panda has a false thumb extending from its wrist bone that aids in climbing. The red panda is one of only a few species able to rotate its ankles to control a head-first descent from a tree.\nHabitat and Distribution\nRed panda fossils have been found as far away as North America, but today the animal is only found in the temperate forests of southwestern China and the eastern Himalayas. Groups are geographically separated from each other and fall into two subspecies. The western red panda (A. f. fulgens) lives in the western portion of the range, while Styan's red panda (A. f. styani) lives in the eastern part. Styan's red panda tends to be larger and darker than the western red panda, but the panda's appearance is highly variable even within a subspecies.\nRed Panda Global Distribution. IUCN\nDiet\nBamboo is the staple of a red panda's diet. Like the giant panda, the red panda can't digest the cellulose in bamboo, so it has to eat a huge amount of bamboo shoots (4.8 kg or 8.8 lb) and leaves (1.5 kg or 3.3 lb) each day to survive. In other words, a red panda eats its weight in bamboo every day! About two-thirds of a red panda's diet consist of bamboo leaves and shoots. The other third includes leaves, berries, mushrooms, flowers, and sometimes fish and insects. Due to its low caloric intake, nearly every waking hour of a panda's life is spent eating.\nOne interesting fact about the red panda is that it is the only non-primate known to taste artificial sweeteners. Scientists speculate the ability helps the animal identify a natural compound in food with a similar chemical structure, influencing its diet.\nThe red panda is adapted to spend its waking hours eating bamboo. retales botijero / Getty Images\nBehavior\nRed pandas are territorial and solitary except during the mating season. They are crepuscular and nocturnal, spending the day sleeping in trees and using the night to mark territory with urine and musk and to seek food. They clean themselves, much like cats, and communicate using twittering sounds and whistles.\nPandas are only comfortable at temperatures ranging from 17 to 25 \u00b0C (63 to 77 \u00b0F). When cold, the red panda curls its tail over its face to conserve heat. When hot, it stretches on a branch and dangles its legs to cool off.\nRed pandas are preyed upon by snow leopards, mustelids, and humans. When threatened, a red panda will try to escape by running up a rock or tree. If cornered, it will stand on its hind legs and extend its claws to appear larger and threatening.\nA red panda standing on its hind legs and extending its claws may look cute, but it's actually a threat behavior. Corbis via Getty Images / Getty Images\nReproduction and Offspring\nRed pandas become sexually mature at 18 months of age and fully mature at age two or three years. The mating seasons runs from January to March, during which mature pandas may mate with multiple partners. Gestation lasts from 112 to 158 days. Females gather grass and leaves to build a nest a few days before giving birth to one to four deaf and blind cubs. Initially, the mother spends all of her time with the cubs, but after a week she starts venturing out to feed. The cubs open their eyes around 18 days of age and are weaned around six to eight months of age. They remain with their mother until the next litter is born. Males only help raise young if the pandas live in very small groups. On average, a red panda lives between eight and 10 years.\nConservation Status\nThe IUCN has classified the red panda as endangered since 2008. Worldwide population estimates range from 2500 to 20,000 individuals. The estimate is a \"best guess\" because pandas are difficult to spot and count in the wild. The species' population has declined about 50 percent over the last three generations and is expected to continue to fall at an accelerated rate. The red panda faces multiple threats, including deforestation of bamboo, increased death from canine distemper due to human encroachment, habitat loss, and poaching for the pet and fur trades. Over half of red panda deaths are directly related to human activity.\nCaptive breeding programs at several zoos are helping protect the red panda's genetic diversity and raise awareness of the animal. The Rotterdam Zoo in the Netherlands manages the red panda international studbook. In the United States, the Knoxville Zoo in Knoxville, Tennessee, holds the record for the largest number of red panda births in North America.\nCan You Keep a Red Panda as a Pet?\nAlthough the red panda is cute and cuddly-looking and breeds well in captivity, there are several reasons it's not a common pet. A red panda needs a massive amount of fresh bamboo each day. It requires a large enclosure, canine distemper vaccination, and flea treatment (infestation can be lethal). Red pandas use anal glands to mark territory, producing a strong smell. Pandas are nocturnal in captivity, so they don't interact much with people. Even hand-raised red pandas have been known to get aggressive toward their keepers.\nFormer Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi kept red pandas in a special enclosure. They had been presented to her family as a gift. Today, obtaining a pet red panda is inadvisable (and often illegal), but you can aid conservation efforts in zoos and in the wild by \"adopting\" a panda from the WWF or Red Panda Network.\nSources"}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant Panda Behavior - Animal Sake", "url": "https://animalsake.com/giant-panda-behavior", "text": "The giant panda behavior is quite different from other animals living in the same biome. Living in mountain ranges in different Chinese provinces, this mammal has adapted quite well to is new home from its previous habitat in the lowlands.\nA cuddly and docile animal, the giant panda is recognized universally as an icon for endangered animals. The giant panda is one of the most fascinating species in the kingdom Animalia. Scientifically called Ailuropoda melanoleuca, this mammal belongs to the bear family.\nDue to its fur color the panda is sometimes associated with the raccoons. With its rotund body this animal can be easily mistaken as being clumsy. But in reality it is not so. In fact it is quite deft while protecting its territory from trespassers, or while escaping from predators. It is the mannerism of the giant panda, which makes it stand out from the rest of the animals.\nBehavior of the Giant Panda\nThe meek giant panda is a very interesting animal to observe in terms of its behavior. Usually, secluded or solitary from the rest, the giant panda is seen in company, only during the mating season. Apart from this, the female is seen with her cubs.\nThe habitat of the giant panda is mainly forests which have rich bamboo growth. The panda loves to live near places which have a clear running brook and is laden with bamboo. Pandas do not build homes or dens, except for their cubs. A terrestrial being, the panda marks its territory by clawing trees, with scent and also by spraying urine to differentiate its habitat from others.\nThe giant panda happily feasts on tender bamboo shoots, which is its favorite food, along with leaves, roots and tubers. Being omnivorous in nature, it also feeds on fish, rodents and insects as well. Occasionally, the giant panda may also eat flowers, green corn, tufted grass, honey and vines.\nPandas prefer solitude over company and can be seen roaming around all alone. However, the only times when the pandas, especially the males, can be seen in groups is for mating. The female takes care of the cubs and once the cub turns 3 years old, it leaves the mother and fends for itself.\nThe only time the panda is active and moves about, looking for food, is in the morning and at sunset. The rest of the day is spent in sleeping. This is because the panda feeds on food that is low in nutrition and does so to conserve energy.\nUnlike other members of the bear and raccoon family, the giant panda does not hibernate. This is because the panda does not get enough nutrients from the food it eats and hence cannot conserve it in its body for further use. This makes it a poor candidate for hibernation. So during the cold, winter months, the pandas move to lower altitude places where they can be warm, and during the summers they relocate to higher places, to remain cool.\nThe breeding season of the giant panda is between the months of March and May. Following a gestation period of 3 to 5 months, the female gives birth to one cub, which is blind. Only after six or eight weeks can the cub open its eyes. In case of twins, only one cub survives. Once the cub becomes three months old, it begins to move around, along with its mother.\nThe natural predators of the giant panda are wolves, leopards and jackals. Though on land, the panda may resemble a slow moving and clumsy animal, it can climb trees with precise dexterity when it feels threatened by enemies. It can quickly reach the top on all fours in swift movements.\nDue to the depletion of its natural habitat and encroachment, the giant panda is bred in captivity since they have become endangered. It is necessary to save the shy animal and the WWF symbol from becoming extinct."}

The creature ate a similar diet to modern giant pandas, suggesting their unusual bamboo-chewing lifestyle has survived through evolutionary time. The finding also adds to the evidence that pandas originated in Europe, not Asia.\nThe giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is only found in forested mountain ranges in central China. It famously eats little but indigestible bamboo, despite having the digestive system of a carnivore, and is one of the world\u2019s most iconic vulnerable species. This black-and-white bear is the only surviving member of the Ailuropodinae subfamily, part of the larger Ursidae family.\nNobody really knows how the giant panda evolved. Few fossils of its relatives have been found, so its lineage is almost as hotly debated as that of humans.\nAdvertisement\nNow palaeoanthropologist David Begun at the University of Toronto in Canada has found a set of fossil teeth in the town of Rudab\u00e1nya, Hungary. The site previously yielded the remains of an ancient great ape called Rudapithecus, a possible ancestor of African great apes and humans.\nBegun was looking for ancient hominid bones when he spotted the teeth trapped beneath a rhino\u2019s shoulder blade. The teeth are 10 million years old, placing them in the late Miocene.\nSuspecting they belonged to a panda, based on their shape, Begun enlisted the help of Louis de Bonis at the University of Poitiers in France and Juan Abella at the State University Santa Elena Peninsula in Ecuador.\nChewing the veg\nThe team compared the shape, structure and wear patterns of the teeth with those of other bears. Such wear patterns, created when food being chewed scrapes away some tooth enamel, can reveal what an animal ate \u2013 and in this case they were similar to those of giant pandas. \u201cBoth species consumed tough plant foods, requiring shearing rather than crushing of food during chewing,\u201d says de Bonis. \u201cThis tell us that the way of life of the panda\u2019s ancestors was very similar to the modern panda.\u201d\nThe teeth belonged to a previously unknown panda, and the team has named the species Miomaci panonnicum. \u201cMiomaci could be considered not like a direct ancestor, but more like a \u2018cousin\u2019 of the modern panda,\u201d says de Bonis. \u201cTheir lineage probably separated in the middle Miocene period.\u201d\n\u201cFrom the description, it appears to be closer to the split between giant pandas and the rest of the carnivores, including bears,\u201d says Russell Ciochon at the University of Iowa. \u201cThe fossil they found lacks the very specialised dental anatomy found in modern giant pandas, which evolved in southern China around 2 million years ago, and is believed to be when pandas became dependent on bamboo.\u201d\nPanda history\nSince giant pandas are confined to China, we had assumed that the panda family has been living there since shortly after it split off from other bears. Some fossils support that idea. Asian caves have yielded teeth from Ailuropoda baconi, which lived 750,000 years ago, and a skull from Ailuropoda microta from 2 million years ago. Fossil pandas can be found in China as far back as 8 million years ago.\nHowever, in 2012 scientists found teeth from possibly the oldest known direct ancestor of the giant panda, Kretzoiarctos beatrix. They were 11.6 million years old and were discovered in Spain, suggesting the giant panda\u2019s ancestors originated in Europe before migrating to Asia. The Miomaci teeth support that idea.\n\u201cThere are interesting similarities between animal fossils found in some European and Chinese sites in the late Miocene period, suggesting that there may have been a lot of travelling between the two areas,\u201d says Begun.\n\u201cThe direct lineage of the extant giant panda is likely to be Asian, but related to the older European forms, which are extinct sister lineages,\u201d says Abella.\n\u201cBecause apes migrated from Rudab\u00e1nya to mainland Asia, it proves that a migration route was possible,\u201d says Ciochon. \u201cHowever, without more data we can\u2019t determine if an early giant panda evolved in Asia and moved to Europe, or travelled in the other direction.\u201d\nClimate may have played a role. When Miomaci lived, Europe was warmer and wetter than it is today. The chemical make-up of other teeth from Rudab\u00e1nya suggest the area was once a lush subtropical forest on the shores of a lake.\nSuch forests disappeared from Europe about 5 million years ago, and this may have spelled the demise of European pandas. \u201cThe environment cooled and dried out,\u201d says de Bonis. \u201cThere was a change in the faunas in Europe, and the species linked to dense warm forest disappeared.\u201d China could have been the only congenial home for surviving pandas.\nJournal reference: Geobios, DOI: 10.1016/j.geobios.2017.09.003"}

They are so rare and respected.\nOne thing about Panda Bears that give them the \"Cat-foot\" name is because their eyes are slits like cat eyes. Instead of having round pupils like other bears do, they have slits as pupils. This adaptation allows them to have good night vision. This benefits them because they are always foraging for food, even at night.\nPhoto: Rachael Barger\nWhy are Panda Bears Black and White?\nA very common question is why do Giant Pandas have black and white fur. It is proven that in the hills of China, and snowy rock peaks they do blend in. It is a sort of camouflage. The colors also signify to other Pandas to stay away. This allows them all to have their own territory, and they don't have to deal with many intruders of their same species.\nPandas in Captivity\nGiant Pandas were first exported to a zoo in 1937. Since then it has been obvious that holding Giant Pandas in captivity has allowed researchers to better understand them, and help them survive.\nIn captivity Giant Pandas live longer than Pandas in the wild. Most every Panda that is born in captivity never leaves captivity. It proves too much of a danger to bring them into an unfamiliar, unsafe environment.\nThe most recent addition to captive Giant Pandas was Su Lin. She was born on August 2nd, 2005. She is the third Giant Panda to be born at the San Diego Zoo in San Diego, California.\nThe San Diego Zoo has a great Panda Bear Exhibit. Here is a link to the \"Panda Cam\" that records the Pandas in the zoo exhibit 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Panda Cam\nConservation and Respect\nEver since 1957, efforts to protect the Giant Panda have proven successful. Chinese government has instituted rules about the Pandas and created a policy to leave them alone, and no killing. Unbelievably, Giant Pandas were killed for their hides in early 1900's. This is part of the reasons that the Chinese government has stepped in and stopped this horrible hunt.\nChinese citizens respect the Giant Panda more than anyone else on this planet. No one would ever think about killing it now, and they all have a very high respect for the animal. The Panda Bear image isn't allowed on any Chinese media. They are not allowed in cartoons (even if portrayed well), movies, newspapers, comics, or books. The Chinese realize what they have is special, and they are doing everything they can to keep it in high respect and conserve it.\nIncreasing Giant Panda Population\nGiant Pandas were close to extinction about 40 years ago, and ever since then China and other nations have been trying to increase population numbers. They 'rent' Giant Pandas to zoos all around the world (for the hefty price of about one million dollars per Panda) to increase breeding, and population numbers.\nA very important landmark happened about one year ago. On April 28th, 2006, the Chinese government released a male Giant Panda named Xiang Xiang into the wild. Xiang Xiang was four at the time. He was born and bred in captivity since birth. This was a very important step because it could be the start of increasing Pandas numbers.\nXiang Xiang was expected to run into difficulties while being in the wild for his first year, so they put a computer chip inside of him to keep track. Xiang Xiang is at the age where he is sexually mature and he has been doing fine ever since."}

An explanation of significant or unique phyaical characteristics\nGiant pandas have a distinctive appearance. Their thick black and white fur equips them for life in cool forests. Their white coat with black markings is unique, with black patches round the eyes and ears, black legs, and a black band around the shoulders. And they have cute white tails.\nThe Giant Panda eats almost only bamboo and so has a number of physical adaptations to help with its consumption including an extension of their wrist bone which acts a bit like a thumb, allowing the Giant Panda to grip onto bamboo stems. They also have large jaws with strong jaw muscles that along with their flat molars, allow the Giant Panda to crush bamboo stems and leaves in order to extract the nutrients.\n3.) How the animal breathes\nPandas breathe using their lungs, just like humans. Pandas communicate through vocalisation, producing sounds such as roaring or bleating that convey to the other pandas their intentions. Panda cubs produce high pitched wailing to attract their mothers\u2019 attention for care and nursing. Giant Pandas are very vocal during mating seasons to attract each other. The females will produce sounds that are not heard at other time of the year.\n4.) how long the average animal of this special lives"}

As a result, the cubs are \u201cvery active, pink, and fat.\u201d These facts were reported by ABC News.\nThe twins were born soon after midnight, according to the zoo. It was approximately 1 a.m. at the time. They weigh 149 and 129 grams, respectively. They are the zoo\u2019s second and third panda babies, respectively. Yuan Meng, the first panda, was born in 2017.

The vet team had also carefully observed the pandas\u2019 interactions. In addition, they used artificial insemination. This, however, was only a precaution. These facts are reported by Thailand\u2019s Nation.\nThe gender of the panda babies has yet to be determined. It will, however, be discovered after some time. Normally, this takes several months. Furthermore, during the first 100 days, the panda babies will not be named. This is in accordance with Chinese custom. In the wild, there are around 1,800 gigantic pandas. This is only in China.

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "What Do Giant Pandas Eat? - WorldAtlas", "url": "https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-do-giant-pandas-eat.html", "text": "Giant pandas are native to southwestern and central regions of China. These large black and white mammals, whose name in Chinese translates to \u201cbig bear cat\u201d, have become well known as furry ambassadors for global efforts aimed at preserving endangered species as well as symbols for the importance of wildlife conservation and preservation throughout the world. Giant pandas are considered a vulnerable species by the IUCN and the Chinese government as stepped up giant panda conservation. Despite being members of the Carnivora order of animals, giant pandas feed on a diet consisting predominantly of plants, in particular bamboo. Most Carnivoran creatures (or carnivores) are meat eaters who use their sharp claws and teeth to catch prey. Giant pandas, however, are primarily herbivorous although their diet can also include small quantities of eggs, fish, insects, and even small rodents.\nDiet of the Giant Panda\nThe giant panda is a species of bear and therefore classified as a carnivore. It has the digestive system and canine teeth of a meat eater even though it has evolved over millions of years to primarily consume bamboo. Ancestors of modern giant pandas were carnivores and there are a number of theories as to why the species switched to a plant based diet. Many experts believe that this drastic dietary change was brought about by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. It is thought that approximately seven million years ago the animals which the giant pandas had depended upon for nourishment died off and disappeared due to changes in the natural habitat. Because of this shortage of prey, giant pandas then adapted to a new diet and lost their taste for meat. The animals are believed to have switched to an exclusively bamboo based diet about two million years ago.\nResearch has shown that several of the physical characteristics of modern giant pandas evolved due to the drastic changes in their diet. One example of this is the rounded shape of the animal\u2019s face which resulted from the development of the powerful muscles in its jaw. Giant pandas also employ their large molar teeth to chew and grind up the fibrous material which makes up bamboo.\nBamboo Consumption\nBecause they subsist on a herbivorous diet giant pandas primarily feed on plants, a vast majority of which (up to 99%) is made up of bamboo. Giant pandas consume a variety of species of bamboo and feed not only on this plant\u2019s leaves but also its stems, roots, and shoots. Due to the fact that bamboo is a poor source of the nutrients needed for giant pandas to survive they must consume large amounts of the plant material every day. On average the animals eat between 26.5 and 84 pounds of bamboo per day.\nAround twenty types of bamboo are eaten by giant pandas. These include varieties such as black, water, and arrow bamboo. The animals may consume different parts of the bamboo plant depending upon the season and what\u2019s available to them in their native habitat. During the winter months they must feed on bamboo roots, in the spring and summer seasons shoots become more plentiful, and in the fall bamboo leaves are abundant.\nOther Plants and Animals\nBesides bamboo, other types of plants eaten by giant pandas include vines, grasses, green corn, flowers, and honey. Captive pandas are also fed foods such as apples and steamed corn bread. In their native habitat, wild giant pandas are also known to eat small rodents as well as pikas which are small mammals related to rabbits."}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "23 Astonishing Blue Whale Facts - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/blue-whale/", "text": "Blue Whale Profile\nThe Blue Whale is a marine mammal, that\u2019s believed to be the largest animal that has ever lived, far bigger than even the largest dinosaur. They habitat the Antarctic Ocean, the North Atlantic, North & South Pacific and Indian Oceans.\nThey are members of the order Artiodactyla and family Balaenopteridae (or \u2018Rorquals\u2019), the largest group of Baleen whales, which includes the Humpback Whale.\nBlue Whale Facts Overview\nHabitat: Antarctic Ocean, North Atlantic Ocean, North & South Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean Location: Virtually all oceans. Lifespan: 80 \u2013 110 Years Size: 80 \u2013 108 ft (24 \u2013 30 m) Weight: 330,000 \u2013 441,000 pounds (150 \u2013 200 tonnes) Color: Deep Blue-Grey Diet: Krill (Shrimp-like crustaceans) Predators: No Natural Predators. However, there have been some Killer Whale attacks. Top Speed: 50 Kph (31 Mph) No. of Species:\n1 Conservation Status:\nEndangered\nThe Blue Whale (Balaenoptera musculus) prefer the deep ocean, rather than coastal waters or bays, and can be found living in any of the oceans located around the globe.\nThey tend to spend the warmer months feeding in the polar regions, and will participate in extensively long migrations to the Equator as winter approaches.\nBlue Whales live typically between 80 and 90 years, with some reaching up to 110 years of age.\nThey have a carnivore diet, but despite their size, these massive sea creatures prefer to eat some of the tiniest marine life. Blue Whales feast on plankton called krill, which is a small animal that resembles shrimp. Due to the relative sizes of both the blue whale and krill, they can consume as many as 40 million krill, or 8,000 pounds (3,600 kg) of it daily.\nBlue Whales can grow to over 30-metres in length, but are extremely graceful swimmers. They typically have a cruising speed of around 8-kilometres per hour, and can hit top speeds of up to 50 kph. They are also great divers, plunging down to depths of 500-metres, to seek krill to snack on.\nBecause the blue whale is the largest animal to live on the planet, it has few predators. However, shark attacks and killer whales can injure or kill a blue whale. More commonly, they succumb to injuries sustained with collisions with large sea vessels.\nThe global population of blue whales is uncertain, but based on research from the IUCN, the global total for the species is estimated to be between 10,000-25,000 and classed as endangered.\nInteresting Blue Whale Facts\n1. The mouth of the blue whale contains a row of plates that are fringed with \u2018baleen\u2019, which are similar to bristles.\nThe bristles are used to filter food from the water that the whale takes in its mouth when feeding. A mouthful of water for the Blue Whale is about 5,000-kilograms of liquid and plankton. As the whale forces the water out of its mouth, the bristles act to capture and trap the food. The whale then licks the bristles clean with its massive tongue, which allows it to swallow the plankton.\n2. The tongue of the blue whale is as big as an elephant.\nAside from cleaning krill from the plates in its mouth, the blue whale tongue weighs about as much as an elephant, or a daily car.\n3. The blue whale was once hunted for whale oil.\nIn the 1900\u2019s blue whales were extensively hunted, which severely impacted their population. Hundreds of thousands of them were massacred for their oil, which is obtained from their blubber. Historically whale oil was widely used in oil lamps, and to make soap and margarine.\n4. Blue whales were hunted almost to extinction, until they were protected in 1966.\nThe hunting for whale oil was so excessive that records suggest approx. 380,000 whales had been caught. The International Whaling Commission deemed the blue whale as a protected animal which has allowed it to breed safely.\n5. The blue whale population size is slowly increasing.\nHowever, their population has not grown back to previous levels. Pre whaling, there were estimated to be around 240,000 blue whales globally. The numbers today are estimated to be between 3-11% of the pre-1911 population size.\n6. A blue whale weighs as much as 200 tonnes. Or, 150 Honda Civics.\nThey are the heaviest animals known to ever live on the planet.\n7. Blue whales make few friends in the water.\nAlthough it is common for them to just swim around the many oceans on the planet alone or in a pair, the blue whale will from time to time swim in a small group. Where food is readily available, as many as 60 blue whales may come together.\n8. The blue whale is not only the world\u2019s largest animal, but also the loudest.\nThe human ear can\u2019t pick them up underwater, but the blue whale happens to make the loudest noise of any animal, up to 188 decibels, which is louder than a jet engine. The blue whale talks with low frequency moans, groans and pulses.\n9. The blue whale has incredible hearing.\nBecause the Blue Whale communicates with sounds that are such a low frequency, under the correct conditions, one can communicate with others and be heard as far as 1,600-kilometres away.\n10. Although a mostly solitary animal, the blue whale forms bonds.\nProbably due to the long lifespan of the blue whale, it has the ability to form an attachment to another living creature that spends time with one.\n11. Actions displayed by blue whales appear that they have feelings.\nThis belief is backed up by how whales that wash ashore will show affection towards those who rescue them as if so say thank you.\n12. The reproductive cycle for the blue whale is rather slow.\nBreeding occurs just once every three years. Pregnancy is usually between 11 and 12 months.\n13. Following such a slow reproductive cycle, blue whale families are small.\nUsually females will give birth to just one calf.\n14. A Blue whale calf is anything but a little baby.\nThe newborn calf will weigh as much as 2,700-kilograms and measure 8-metres or more in length.\n15. A Blue whale calf grows fast.\nThe calf will gain roughly 90-kilograms of weight per day in its first year of life.\n16. The Blue whale calf has a huge appetite.\nAs it is suckled in the water, a calf will consume over 600 liters of mother\u2019s milk per day in its first year.\n17. Blue whale mothers nurture their young.\nA female will lift her newborn calf to the water surface in order for it to take its first breath of air. Other females that may be nearby will help by nudging the newborn in an effort to encourage it to break the surface and breathe.\n18. Blue whales have a blowhole to breathe, similar to our nose!\nWhen one surfaces, it exhales through the blowhole at the top of its body. A cloud of pressurized air is sent as much as 9-metres in the air due to the force of exhalation. They tend to come up for air between every 5-15 mins \u2013 but can go for longer without breathing.\n19. Blue whales have a huge heart.\nAside from having feelings and showing affection, the average blue whale heart is as big as a mid-sized car. The beating of this massive heart can be heard as far as 2-mile away. Their blood vessels are so wide you could swim through them. What we are saying is, they are big. Very big.\n20. The blue whale resembles a well-known sea craft.\nWhen viewed from above, aside from having fins and a fluke, the Blue Whale can easily be mistaken for a submarine \u2013 as it has the same basic aerodynamic shape.\n21. The steering equipment is relatively small on a blue whale.\nThey use their flippers for maneuvering around under water, but the blue whale flipper is just 12-percent of the overall size of the mammal.\n22. Killer whale (Orcas) rarely attack adult blue whales, but may prey on young calves occasionally.\nTypically, killer whales pick on prey smaller than them. While blue whale are quite passive, due to their sheer size, it usually deters groups of killer whales.\n23. Research suggests ship strikes are a threat to blue whales, although relatively minor.\nWhale-ship collisions might be partly behind the low blue whale population counts, despite international protections since 1966. Howeber, studies suggest the risk is still fairly low, and that reducing the speed limit of vessels in shipping lanes helped reduce strikes by 80%.\nBlue Whale Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification\nKingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Artiodactyla Infraorder: Cetacea Family: Balaenopteridae Subfamily: Balaenoptera Species Name: Balaenoptera musculus\nSubspecies List"}

From the time we first ever became aware of these amazing animals, giant stuffed pandas have only soared in popularity in the competitive market of soft toys.\nUntil the late 1980's, the giant panda was classed with raccoons and lesser pandas but was then found through DNA testing to be closer to the bear family. These black and white bears with their distinctive eye patches, only exist currently in cold coniferous forests in inland China, where they live almost entirely on bamboo. With the ongoing encroachment by farmers, these forests have only an estimated 700-1,000 pandas left in the wild.\nGiant pandas are among the world's most threatened animals specifically due to the building of roads and railroads in the mountainous areas in which they live. Outside of protected areas, habitat loss is also still an ongoing issue in addition to illegal poaching. To try and save them from further future uncertainty, by 2005, more than 50 panda reserves (which protects 2.5 million acres and more than 60% of the panda population) were created by the Chinese government. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), have very strict regulations on the both the trade in the species and its products. And, in 1984, the giant panda was moved from Appendix III to Appendix I of the CITES convention which was intended to impose the strictest laws to protect the animal.\nIn the Yantgze Basin ecoregion in which the pandas live, there are also millions of people who make use of the natural resources found there. This particular ecoregion happens to be the geographical and economical heart of China. Biodiversity conservation is also critical in the area. These habitats are so diverse, that a significant amount of rare, endemic flora and fauna that can be found there, are also endangered, just like the panda that shares their home.\nThe next time you purchase a giant stuffed panda, you may not look at it in quite the same way knowing what hardships pandas face in the wild just to stay alive. While there is no denying that giant stuffed pandas are extraordinary plush toys, like the real thing, they are also symbols of animal extinction and conservation which is not reserved strictly for them. Tigers, white rhino's, and polar bears are just a few of the other animals that are also struggling to remain alive in areas in which they are either hunted illegally or losing their habitats to both global warming and ever growing populations."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Bearcat Facts - Animals of Asia - WorldAtlas", "url": "https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/bearcat-facts-animals-of-asia.html", "text": "5. Physical Description\nAlso known as a \"Binturong\", the bearcat is actually related to neither bears nor cats, but is rather a member of the Viverridae Family, along with other civets and genets. Weighing up to 44 pounds (20 kilograms), the bearcat\u2019s body length can reach 38 inches (96 centimeters), and its tail alone nearly doubles its total length, as they can be up to 35 inches (89 centimeters). Their fur is long and coarse, and usually black in color, though it may occasionally have gray tips. Their faces are a lighter color with long whiskers protruding from them, and there are long clusters of fur around their ears. One of the strangest things about the bearcat is that they are said to smell like \"buttered popcorn\".\n4. Diet\nDespite being in the Carnivora order, bearcats are omnivores, and in fact mainly eat fruits such as figs. Being excellent climbers with agile limbs, there is hardly anything they cannot reach in the trees, and they are even capable of opening fruit using only their toes. When they do hunt, however, their prey mainly includes smaller animals such as insects, birds, fish, and rodents. The bearcat\u2019s hunting style resembles a cat stalking its prey from the branches. When the opportunity presents itself, the bearcat is not a picky eater and will scavenge and eat leftover carcasses. They will also not shy away from eggs, tree bark, shoots, or leaves.\n3. Habitat and Range\nThe bearcat was once widely spread throughout Southeast Asia from China to India and all the countries in between, as well as many stretched out between there and into Oceania. However, due to deforestation, habitat degradation, the pet trade, the fur and meat trades, and poaching, it is now listed as a \"Vulnerable\" species under the IUCN Red List. Their population is still declining as the dense jungles they require grow even sparser each and every year, and, while there are no definitive population estimates for the species, they have become rare in all the countries they have traditionally been known to reside in. Although they are large and relatively slow, the bearcat does not have very many natural predators, apart from tigers, dholes, and snakes. This leaves humans and their activities as the largest threats to this species.\n2. Behavior\nGenerally solitary creatures, the bearcat are not known to be territorial, but they are not social either and will avoid contact with each other. Mothers and their young may be seen together at certain times of the year, but it is not common. Bearcats use scent (their iconic \"popcorn smell\") and sound to communicate with one another, and will mark trees while they climb to keep others informed of where they are and have been. A happy bearcat will chuckle while an upset one will wail. They use their prehensile tails to help them climb, and when they are climbing down trees head first, they are able to rotate their hind legs backwards to better grasp the tree.\n1. Reproduction\nBearcats mate throughout the year and do not have a peak season in which they breed. Females tend to breed twice a year. When they are \"in heat\" (estrus), they will make a mating call and purr to show that they are receptive. Their gestation period lasts around 3 months, and an average bearcat average litter will have 2 whelps (young ones), though litter sizes may range between 1 and 6. The male will occasionally stay with the female to care for their young until they are independent, whereas the female always will. Female bearcats become sexually mature at 30 months, whereas males mature a little faster and will be ready to mate at around 28 months of age."}

It can be 1.2-1.8 meters in body length, 10-12 cm in tail length and 80-120 kg in weight and even weigh to 180 kg. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora with sharp paws, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo. The lifespan of pandas in the wild is between 18 to 20 years old, but can be over 30 in captivity.\nThe giant panda has been living on earth for at least eight million years and is known as the \"living fossil\" and the \"national treasure of China\". The panda diplomacy has made an indelible contribution to the development of foreign friendly relations. It is also the image ambassador of World Wildlife Fund. A 2013 report stated that the wild giant panda population had increased to 1,864 by the end of 2013. By the end of 2015, there were 422 captive panda populations in China.\nThe giant panda is a unique species of China, and its main existing habitats are Sichuan, Shaanxi and the mountains of Gansu."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Curious facts about red pandas - ZME Science", "url": "https://www.zmescience.com/ecology/animals-ecology/animal-files-curious-case-red-panda/", "text": "Red pandas may be cute, but they have been a headache for biologists since their discovery. We may have just finally discovered where red pandas belong in the tree of life, and they are unlike anything else alive today. These small mammals are distinguishable by their rusty red\u2013coloured fur and bushy ringed tails. They live in Southern China, Myanmar, Nepal, and India in high mountains within bamboo forests. Unfortunately, they are currently endangered.\nThey have been confusing biologists for almost 200 years\nOther names for the red panda include cat-bear, bear-cat, lesser panda, fox bear, Himalayan racoon, and firefox (yes, the web browser is named after it). When they were first discovered by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cuvier in 1825, he placed them in the same family as racoons because of their head shape, teeth, and ringed tails. A 1977 Nature paper also placed red pandas in the same family as racoons. Then, because of their similarity to panda bears and DNA composition, red pandas were thought to be part of the bear family. Now, they are the only members of the Ailuridae family, which is most closely related to the group containing weasels, racoons, and skunks.\nTheir closest relatives are long gone\nRed pandas have no living relatives.Their most recent fossil ancestor, Parailurus, had a large distribution across Eurasia tens of millions of years ago. There may have been three different species of Parailurus that are all larger and had a more robust head and jaw than the red panda. The family, Ailuridae, contains seven extinct genera of animals. Fossils of jaws and other bones from extinct red panda relatives have been found in Spain, Eastern Europe, and the US. The UK is also home to a giant panda\u2014no it\u2019s not the cuddly black and white giant panda, but an extinct relative of the red panda. A lower jaw and fossil molar of this cougar-sized beast were found in 1888.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAlmost a wah?\nAn English naturalist, Major General Thomas Hardwicke, presented the discovery of the red panda to the Linnean Society in London in 1821. He was likely the first Western scientist to discover the red panda, which he did so during his service in India. He gave a presentation entitled \u201cDescription of a new Genus of the Class Mammalia, from the Himalaya Chain of Hills Between Nepal and the Snowy Mountains.\u201d He thought that it should be called a \u201cWah\u201d because of the sound of its call for which the locals called it the Wha or Chitwha. Hardwicke\u2019s paper was only published two years after Cuvier\u2019s description in 1825, which meant that he lost the right to name the species.\nRed pandas are not giant pandas\nActually, red pandas were the first animal to be called \u201cpanda\u201d. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cuvier, a French zoologist, first described the red panda in 1825 and called it Ailurus fulgens (fire-coloured or shining cat) after its cat-like appearance and bright fur colour. The origin of \u201cpanda\u201d is unknown but could be from the Himalayan language or the French name for the Roman goddess of peace and travellers. The giant panda was not described until 1873 and also named panda because of its similarities to the red panda.\nBoth the red panda and giant panda eat mostly bamboo and live in high-altitude forests in Asia. Both pandas have a sort of thumb created from a modified wrist bone that is only used for holding the bamboo when they feed. This is an example of convergent evolution, as the animals are not closely related, though the thumbs evolved in the two pandas for different reasons. In contrast, giant pandas are not picky at all and will eat every part of bamboo, while red pandas only eat leaf tips and shoots, which are more nutritious.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSorry to interrupt, but you should really... ...Join the ZME newsletter for amazing science news, features, and exclusive scoops. More than 40,000 subscribers can't be wrong. Daily Weekly I have read and agree to the terms & conditions. Leave this field empty if you're human:\nVegetarian by choice\nAlthough red pandas are most closely related to carnivores and they have a carnivore stomach, they mostly eat bamboo and other plants. On rare occasions, they\u2019ll hunt a small mammal or bird and eat bird eggs. This trait is also similar to most species of bears, which also eat a mostly vegetarian diet, with the exception of the polar bear.\nOther unique facts\nWhen presented with water and sweetened water, red pandas preferred the water with artificial sweeteners, making them the only known non-primate to be able to taste aspartame. In colder temperatures, red pandas become dormant, with a very low metabolism rate, which they only shake out of to get food. Additionally, they mark their territory with a clear liquid produced by glands between their footpads. The red pandas have a cone-like structure at the bottom of their tongues to test odours and bring items close to a gland in their mouths.\nEven though we know how to classify red pandas, they are still unique animals that need our protection so that they don\u2019t go the way of the rest of their taxonomic family."}

Tail length: About one half foot (6 inches). Height: Average is 2 to 3 feet for males, about half a foot less for females Weight: Males weigh about 175 to 250 pounds. Females weigh about 150 to 225 pounds. The giant Panda bear weight depends on many factors including diet and environment. Habitat: The panda bears habitat has been reduced to the most remote regions of central China. Their living area is in high mountains remote from humans. Their habitat is being threatened by direct and indirect (global warming) impacts from mankind. Diet: Giant pandas will eat a variety of foods in captivity. However their natural diet is in fact almost exclusively bamboo shoots, leaves, and stalks. Fun fact: Birthday cakes are often offered to captive pandas for fun. The cakes are completely healthy since they are made from ice and vegetables. The candles are usually bamboo sticks. Digestive system: Since the panda is technically classified as a carnivore it is not very efficient at digesting plant material. One for more interesting panda facts is that it is exclusively feeds on bamboo, a low nutrient plant food. They must eat massive quantities to get adequate nutrition. It is estimated that between 30 to 45 pounds of bamboo must be consumed every day! Gestation period: About 100 to 150 days after mating. Conditions in captivity may vary. Panda cub litter size: A mother panda usually has only 1 or 2 babies. More interesting information on baby panda facts. Size at birth: About 4 ounces (113 grams). Childhood: Young pandas are much like kids, they like to have fun. They are very energetic and clumsy. Age of maturity: Males mature at about 6 to 7 years. Females about 4 to 5 years. Giant Panda lifestyle: As with most bears they spend a lot of time roaming their territory, foraging for bamboo, and sleeping. Social behavior: The panda is mostly a solitary animal that meets occasionally for social feeding and mating. Communication: Methods include calls, tree scratching, and scent markings. Climbing ability: Giant panda bears are good climbers. Hibernation: One of the more unique panda facts is that the bears do not hibernate. Their main food supply is available all year around. However they may head to lower elevations during the cold season. Live Span: Exact statistics on natural age in the wild are one of the more difficult giant panda facts to determine. However wild pandas are estimated to have a longevity of 15 to 25 years. Captive panda bears have been known to live over 30 years. Conservation status: Endangered. Fun Fact: Giant panda bears have special front paws. Both paws have five fingers plus a thumb! The thumb is actually a wrist bone that has grown outward to help the panda grasp bamboo stalks.

They can frequently be seen patrolling their territories, investigating scent markings left by other pandas, leaving scent marks, climbing trees, playing in water and making bleating and chirping vocalizations.\nMales will mark their territories doing a behavior called \u201curine hopping\u201d (which looks like they are hopping on one foot as they urinate). They will also attempt to make their urine marks as high as possible on trees and other structures. When they do this, they look like they are doing a handstand.

This, coupled with a long generation time and low reproductive rate, will limit their ability to adapt to a changing climate.\nBamboo makes up almost 90% of their diet, and may itself be quite vulnerable in a changing climate. It is subject to periodic, synchronous flowering and die-off, forcing giant pandas to relocate to areas with healthy bamboo. Bamboo has a slow colonization rate, and may not be able to shift to higher elevations or latitudes at the same rate as giant pandas might.\nHuman activities such as agriculture, logging, and infrastructure development also pose a big threat. Giant pandas have been allowed to persist only at elevations higher than land that can be used for productive agriculture. However, as the agricultural value of land in current panda habitat increases under a changing climate, activities like growing crops and grazing livestock may further encroach on their habitat.\nPriorities for climate-informed giant panda conservation should include maintaining and increasing suitable, connected habitat, and restoration of habitat with bamboo species or genotypes which are adapted to a warmer climate. It is also essential to help people adapt to the changing climate, and minimize habitat loss and fragmentation caused by agriculture and other land uses."}

Twenty years later, WWF became the first international organisation to work in China.\nEver since, WWF has been working with the government on initiatives to save giant pandas and their habitat, including helping to establish an integrated network of giant panda reserves and wildlife corridors to connect isolated panda populations as well as working with local communities to develop sustainable livelihoods and minimise their impact on the forests.\nThese efforts have seen the number of panda reserves jump to 67, which now protect nearly two-thirds of all wild pandas. They have also helped to safeguard large swathes of mountainous bamboo forests, which shelter countless other species and provide natural services to vast numbers of people, including tens of millions who live alongside rivers downstream of panda habitat."}

It is a social animal that lives in a group of up to eight members, with the group centered on a dominant breeding pair. The species are relatively peaceful and territorial but aggression has also been observed in some groups. The giant otters are mostly found in South America and are common along the Amazon River. Its velvety pelt has attracted poachers leading to a significant reduction in their numbers. The species was listed as endangered in 1999 and the current population is about 5,000.\nPhysical Characteristics\nThe giant otter is the longest species in the mustelid family. The male giant otter is between 4.9 and 5.6 feet long from head to tail and weighs 57-71 pounds while the female is between 3.3 and 4.9 feet and weighs 49-57 pounds. The tail is well-muscled and can be as long as 28 inches. The giant otter possesses short fur compared to other otter species. The fur is chocolate brown and sometimes reddish or fawn and appears black when wet. The fur is so dense that water cannot penetrate the skin. The guard air traps water and keeps the inner fur dry. The throat and under the chin has white marking which is used to identify one another. The giant otter has small and rounded ears while the nose is completely covered with fur. It has highly sensitive whiskers.\nDiet\nGiant otters are apex predators and feed mainly on fish such as Characins and catfish. They hunt on shallow water of about 2 feet. They are opportunistic; feeding on whatever is locally abundant. If fish is not available, they will prey on crabs and even small anacondas. The giant otter hunts solo or in groups and relies on the sharp eyesight to locate its prey. They catch their prey and consume it immediately and eat up to 10% of their weight.\nHabitat and Range\nThe giant otter is commonly found in freshwater rivers which floods seasonally. It may also inhabit freshwater springs and permanent lakes. They make their dens on the banks of the river and also use the river banks as latrines. Food abundance and low sloping banks are important factors when selecting a habitat. They range across South America along the Amazon River and Pantanal.\nBehavior\nGiant otters are social species. They live in groups of 4-8 animals with the group centered on dominant male and female species. They are diurnal species with most of their activities taking place at night. They often engage in a behavior known as \u201cperiscoping\u201d whereby they show their throats and chests which are marked white to each other, especially when they are with other otters. When hunting larger species such as small anaconda, they usually hunt in cooperation and eat the prey together. Giant otters are noisy species. It produces an explosive snort when it senses danger and hums when reassuring within the group\nReproduction\nThe giant otter makes its den on the river bank and gives birth within the dens. They normally give birth during the dry season. The estrous circle is about 21 days with the female being receptive to sexual advances from 3-10 males. The male initiates the copulation. The gestation period of the female giant otter is 65-70 days and gives birth to 1-5 pups"}

Origin of the word \u201cpanda\u201d\nHave you ever thought about why pandas are called so? The term \u201cpanda\u201d originated from the Nepalese word \u2018nigalya ponya\u2019, which means \u2018eater of bamboo\u201d. As used in the West, it was initially applied to the red panda, to which the giant panda was thought to be related.\n2. Scientific Names of Panda\nThere are many different species of pandas with different scientific names. However, the most common ones are giant pandas and red pandas. Giant pandas are scientifically called Ailuropoda Melanoleuca, whereas red pandas are called Ailurus Fulgens.\nLooking for the best names for your panda stuffed toys? Click here\n3. Panda Babies\nImage Source: Gulf Times\nPanda babies are born blind. Moreover, they have a fine coat of fur at birth and mostly appear pink in colour. Panda cubs are entirely dependent on their mothers as their limbs are too weak, and they can be easily attacked by other animals.\n4. Weight of Pandas\nMale giant pandas weigh more than female giant pandas. On average, adult giant pandas can weigh up to 300 lbs. However, adult female giant pandas are rarely seen weighing more than 220 lbs. On the other hand, panda babies weigh as less as 100 gms.\n5. Sleeping Habit\nPandas love sleeping. They usually sleep for 8 to 12 hours a day. You can see pandas sleeping in a curled-up position, lying on their bellies and sides. Panda can also be seen resting on tree barks.\n6. Digestive System of Pandas\nAlthough the diet of pandas consists of 99% bamboo, they have a digestive system of a carnivore.\n7. Variety of Names\nPandas are called by different names in China. Studies show that there are about 20 different names of pandas in China, including bearcat, giant bearcat, spotted bear, bamboo bear, and many others. Isn\u2019t it interesting?\n8. Lifespan\nWild pandas have a different lifespan than captive pandas. While wild pandas have a lifespan of about 20 years, captive pandas can survive up to 30 years because of better food and living conditions.\n9. Myth about Pandas\nAncient Chinese used to consider pandas as semi-divine. During the Han Dynasty, pandas were thought to be sacred as they were found in the emperor\u2019s garden. The myth about the mystic abilities of pandas is indeed a very interesting fact about pandas.\n10. Time Spent in Eating\nPandas spend almost half of their day eating, which is nearly 12 hours a day. They can eat 38 kgs of bamboo per day.\n11. Solitary Nature of Pandas\nPandas are solitary species that love living alone. You will not find pandas in colonies. They also don\u2019t prefer living with their families. Also, female and male pandas have different territories where they love living alone, except for the mating season. Interestingly, female pandas raise their cubs alone.\n12. Best Time to See Panda Babies\nAugust is the perfect time for spotting panda babies. This is because many pandas are born in the month of August as the mating months of pandas are from March to May, and the gestation period is of 3 to 5 months.\n13. Pandas\u2019 Poop\nPandas can frequently poop in a day as they eat massive amounts of bamboo. They can poop anywhere from 3 times to 40 times a day. However, it varies from panda to panda. Roughly, pandas can poop 28 kilos a day.\n14. Predators of Panda\nImage Source: Phys.Org\nAdult Pandas have very few natural predators because of their massive size. However, panda cubs can be attacked by snow leopards, yellow-throated martens, wild dogs, and some other enemies.\nConclusion\nAlthough pandas are solitary animals, they have their ways of having fun. From climbing to swimming, pandas are good at various activities. No matter how lazy they appear, pandas can run too that to at a super-fast speed. Isn\u2019t it unbelievable? And the sight of pandas playing in the snow and having fun is so delightful!\nBesides the daily routine of the panda, we have also shared amazing facts about pandas in this article.

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Unique Facts about Asia: Giant Panda - Sheppard Software", "url": "https://www.sheppardsoftware.com/Asiaweb/factfile/Unique-facts-Asia13.htm", "text": "Giant Panda\nThe Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca \"black-and-white cat-foot\") is a mammal now usually classified in the bear family, Ursidae, that is native to central China.\nThe Giant Panda lives in mountainous regions, like Sichuan and Tibet. The Giant Panda is the symbol of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), a conservation organization. Toward the latter half of the 20th century, the panda also became somewhat of a national emblem for China, and is now used in Chinese gold coins.\nDespite being taxonomically a carnivore, their diet is overwhelmingly herbivorous. They eat shoots and leaves, living almost entirely on bamboo. Pandas are also known to eat eggs and some insects along with their bamboo diet. These are necessary sources of protein.\nGiant pandas reproduce very slowly, and infant mortality is high. Growth is slow and pandas may not reach sexual maturity until they are from five to seven years old. The mating season usually takes place from mid-March to mid-May. During this time, up to two to five males can compete for one female; the male with the highest rank gets the female. When mating, the female is in a crouching, head-down position as the male mounts from behind. Copulation time is short, ranging from thirty seconds to five minutes, but the male may mount repeatedly to ensure successful fertilization. Mating is also a very noisy time, accompanied by moaning and squealing.\nThe whole gestation period ranges from 83 to 163 days, with 135 days being the average. Baby pandas weigh only 90 to 130 grams, which is about 1/900th of the mother\u2019s weight, which is the biggest proportion in difference of the mother\u2019s and child\u2019s weight in all animals. Usually, the female panda gives birth to one to two panda cubs. Since the baby panda is born very small and helpless, they need the mother\u2019s undivided attention, so she is only able to care for one of her cubs. She usually abandons her weaker cub in a cave or tree, and it dies soon after birth.\nThe father has no part in helping with raising the cub. When the cub is first born, it is pink, naked and blind and sucks from its mothers breast 6-14 times a day for 30 minutes each time. For three to four hours, the mother might leave the den to feed, which leaves the panda cub defenseless. Two weeks after birth, their skin turns gray where the hair will eventually become black. A month after their birth, the color pattern of the cub\u2019s fur is fully developed. The cub begins to crawl at 75 to 90 days and the mothers play with their cubs, by rolling and wrestling with them. The cubs are able to eat bamboo after 6 months and the cub weighs 45 kilograms at one year and lives with their mother until they are 18 months year old. The interval between births is 2 years.\nFor many decades the precise taxonomic classification of the panda was under debate as both the Giant Panda and the distantly related Red Panda share characteristics of both bears and raccoons. However, genetic testing has revealed that Giant Pandas are true bears and part of the Ursidae family. Its closest bear relative is the Spectacled Bear of South America. Disagreement remains about whether or not the Red Panda belongs in Ursidae or the raccoon family, Procyonidae.\nGiant Pandas are an endangered species, threatened by continued loss of habitat and by a very low birthrate, both in the wild and in captivity. About 1,600 are believed to survive in the wild.\nThe Giant Panda has an unusual paw, with a \"thumb\" and five fingers; the \"thumb\" is actually a modified wrist-bone. Stephen Jay Gould wrote an essay about this, then used the title The Panda's Thumb for a book of collected essays.\nThe Giant Panda was first made known to the West in 1869 by the French missionary Armand David. The Giant Panda has long been a favourite of the public, at least partly on account of the fact that the species has an appealing baby-like cuteness that makes it seem to resemble a living teddy bear. The fact that it is usually depicted reclining peacefully eating bamboo, as opposed to hunting, also adds to its image of innocence.\nLoans of Giant Pandas to American and Japanese zoos formed an important part of the diplomacy of the People's Republic of China in the 1970s as it marked some of the first cultural exchanges between the PRC and the West.\nBy the year 1984, however, pandas were no longer used as agents of diplomacy. Instead, China began to offer pandas to other nations only on 10-year loans. The standard loan terms include a fee of up to US$1,000,000 per year and a provision that any cubs born during the loan are the property of the People's Republic of China.\nIn 1998 a lawsuit filed by the WWF spurred the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to require U.S. zoos seeking to import pandas to ensure that half of the fee charged by China be channeled into conservation efforts for wild pandas and their habitat before the service will issue a permit allowing the pandas to be imported.\nClick here to go back to the Asia page!"}

They are both members of the order Carnivora (the carnivores) but have been difficult to classify further. They were once thought to be closely related to each other and to either bears or raccoons. Through genetic studies, however, scientists have determined that the giant panda is a bear, in the family Ursidae. The red panda is now usually classified in its own family, Ailuridae. The giant panda is also commonly called panda bear. Its scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca.\nGiant pandas are found in bamboo forests in the mountains of central China. Like other bears, the giant panda has a bulky build and a short, stubby tail. It also has a round face with powerful jaw muscles. Adults are about 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 meters) long from the tip of the nose to the rump and weigh about 165 to 250 pounds (75 to 115 kilograms) or more. The males are larger than the females. Giant pandas have a thick, woolly, white coat with black fur on the legs, shoulders, tail, muzzle, and ears and around the eyes.\nGiant pandas usually live alone. They are mainly ground dwellers but also climb trees. Giant pandas can easily stand on their hind legs and are commonly observed somersaulting, rolling, and dust-bathing. They can also swim.\nAs much as 90\u201398 percent of the panda\u2019s diet consists of bamboo shoots, leaves, and stems. On each front paw is an extension of the wrist bone, which the panda uses somewhat like a thumb to help it grasp the slender stalks of bamboo. Unable to digest cellulose, a major component of bamboo, giant pandas rapidly pass large quantities of the grass through their digestive tracts on a daily basis. They spend as much as 16 out of every 24 hours feeding, consuming some 20 to 40 pounds (9 to 18 kilograms) of bamboo every day. They eliminate wastes up to 50 times per day.\nThe female is able to breed for only one to three days in the spring. In the fall she gives birth to one or two cubs (but in the wild only one usually survives). Newborn cubs are tiny and helpless. They spend the first 100\u2013120 days of life in the den in which they were born. The eyes do not begin to open until about 45 days, and the first wobbly steps are taken at 75\u201380 days. By about 14 months the cubs are readily eating bamboo. The young usually leave the mother at 18 to 24 months of age and reach sexual maturity at four to eight years. Giant pandas may live beyond 30 years in captivity, but their life span in the wild is estimated at about 20 years.\n\u00a9 wong yu liang/Fotolia\n\u00a9 Hung Chung Chih/Shutterstock.com\nDestruction of habitat and illegal hunting have contributed to drastically reduced numbers of giant pandas in the wild. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) placed the animal on the endangered species list in 1990. At that time China began to expand its conservation efforts. By the early 21st century, China had set aside more than 50 nature reserves in an attempt to save the species. The country also made great strides in restoring the bamboo forest habitat. Giant pandas are difficult to breed in captivity, but expanded breeding programs have begun to have greater success. As a result of these efforts, the IUCN in 2016 changed the status of the giant panda from endangered to vulnerable (meaning that it is still threatened but faces a lesser risk of extinction than before)."}

(As of 2006)\nWhy: The main reason giant pandas have become an endangered species is because of habitat loss. As China\u2019s population continues to grow, the pandas\u2019 natural habitat is being taken over. This continued habitat destruction pushes the giant pandas into smaller areas where there is often less bamboo for them to eat."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Endangered species facts and information - Animals", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/endangered-species-1", "text": "Whether a species is endangered\u2014meaning at risk of extinction\u2014depends on which definition you use. The International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s Red List of Threatened Species classifies an animal as endangered when its numbers in the wild have dropped so low that it\u2019s at \u201cextremely high risk\u201d of extinction.\nMeanwhile, the United States\u2019s Endangered Species Act of 1973 takes into consideration any destruction to a species\u2019 habitat, whether it has been over-consumed, any disease or predation that threaten it, whether any other man-made factors put it in danger, and what policies currently exist to protect it.\nWhen members of the public or a state agency propose to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service that a species be listed as endangered under the law, research and management plans are formed to help those species survive. It is illegal under the Endangered Species Act to capture, hunt, shoot, or otherwise harm an animal that\u2019s listed as endangered.\nSometimes, federal agencies decide that although a species could be considered endangered, other species are higher priorities. In those cases, the animal or plant gets limited protections.\nConservation successes\nOne animal whose numbers have increased through conservation is the bald eagle. There were only about 500 bald eagles in the continental United States in the 1960s because of pesticides that damaged the shells of their eggs. Conservation efforts including captive breeding programs, habitat protection, and a ban on the insecticide DDT helped the bald eagle\u2019s numbers soar back into the thousands.\nAnother is the giant panda, which was declared no longer endangered in 2016 thanks to 50 years of efforts to save it.\nU.S. Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), who wrote the Endangered Species Act, argued that \u201conly natural extinction is part of natural order.\u201d Scientists believe that 227 species\u2014including the grizzly bear, the peregrine falcon and the gray wolf\u2014were saved from extinction in the first 33 years of the law\u2019s existence.\nConservation challenges\nStill, critics argue that the act is expensive and ineffective because it protects so many species. Several federal courts have heard and rejected arguments that the Endangered Species Act is unconstitutional, and members of Congress have tried to weaken the law in small ways.\nLuckily for endangered species, there are many people looking out for them.

Is it a panda, as its name suggests? Does its ringed tail mean they\u2019re a cousin of the raccoon? Or is it possible they represent an entirely different family of animals? Here are some general details about the ever-popular red panda, as well as some fun facts you may not have known!\nGeneral Information\nScientific name: Ailurus fulgens and Ailurus refulgens\nAilurus fulgens and Ailurus refulgens Class: Mammal\nMammal Biome: Temperate, isolated mountain forests in China, Nepal, India, Myanmar (Burma) and Bhutan Ailurus fulgens is found in the western part of this range, while Ailurus refulgens is found in the eastern part\nTemperate, isolated mountain forests in China, Nepal, India, Myanmar (Burma) and Bhutan Diet: Omnivore (consumes primarily bamboo and other plants but occasionally eats insects, bird eggs, mice, etc. as well)\nOmnivore (consumes primarily bamboo and other plants but occasionally eats insects, bird eggs, mice, etc. as well) Pelage: Ailurus fulgens have a much lighter pelage (fur) on their face than Ailurus refulgens\nAilurus fulgens have a much lighter pelage (fur) on their face than Ailurus refulgens Body temperature: Endotherm (warm-blooded)\nEndotherm (warm-blooded) Biorhythm: Nocturnal\nNocturnal Birth: Viviparous (gives birth to live young)\nViviparous (gives birth to live young) Social interaction: Solitary\nSolitary Habitat: Arboreal (tree dwellers)\nArboreal (tree dwellers) Average lifespan: 8 to 10 years in the wild and up to 15 in captivity\nFun Facts About the Red Panda\nThey\u2019re only slightly larger than a domestic cat. With a body length of 20 to 26 inches and weight of 12 to 20 pounds, the red panda is extremely close in size to the average domestic house cat, with the only major difference in size being its 12 to 20-inch-long bushy ringed tail. It\u2019s important not to mistake their small size and charming appearance for an animal that would make an acceptable pet. Red pandas are wild animals that should not, under any circumstances, be viewed as domesticable They belong in the wild, and our job as human beings is simply to appreciate them and help preserve their natural, wild habitats; not to invite them into our homes.\nTaxonomists have had a lot of trouble classifying them. For years\u2019 taxonomists classified red pandas as a relative of the giant panda as well as the raccoon, due primarily to its iconic ringed tail. However, more recent DNA studies have found that the red panda is neither a relative of the panda nor the raccoon, but represents its own unique family scientists have termed Ailuridae. The red panda is currently the only living species within this family; all other relatives are extinct.\nThey have a false thumb. Like giant pandas, red pandas have what appear to be false thumbs, but are actually just extended wrist bones. While this trait is mainly seen as an evolutionary adaptation to help them grasp and eat tough bamboo shoots, a 2006 study suggests that unlike the giant panda, the red panda\u2019s false thumb first evolved to help them climb trees with tremendous skill and ease.\nThe Brandywine Zoo is home to two red pandas. All of us at the Brandywine Zoo in Wilmington, Delaware are proud to be home to two red pandas (Ailurus fulgens), Merry and Gansu, who were born at the Detroit Zoo and transferred to our care. Click here to view pictures of Merry and Gansu!\nConservation Concerns\nLike countless other magnificent species on Earth, the red panda is considered an endangered species whose current population trend is notably decreasing. In fact, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) estimates there are less than 10,000 red pandas left in the wild today. Their decline in population and at-risk status are primarily attributed to the fact that these beautiful creatures are the victims of deforestation and rapidly shrinking habitats due to human behaviors such as logging, agriculture and hunting.\nThese issues have resulted in the red panda being added as one of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums\u2019 (AZA) cooperatively managed Species Survival Plan\u00ae (SSP) Programs. The ultimate goal of these programs, of which there are nearly 500, is to conserve populations of at-risk species such as this in the wild.\nVisit the Red Pandas and All Your Other Animal Friends at the Brandywine Zoo!\nTo start planning your family\u2019s visit or to learn about the many ways you can get involved and support the Brandywine Zoo, contact us online today!"}

The giant panda can weigh from 165 to 330 lb. The head and body of the panda is mainly white with the exception of its ears, eye patches, nose, shoulders, arms, and legs. The giant pandas eyes are very small and its vision is poor. Enlarged bones in its wrists allow it to grip bamboo stems. They have very strong jaws and large molar teeth that are used to crush the tough bamboo stems. Pandas are very good climbers and use their skill to escape predators. They are also able to move quickly and silently allowing them to evade predators through tunnels of bamboo.\nGiant pandas eat mostly bamboo leaves and shoots. But they can also eat fruit and berries, fungi, grass, and even small mammals, birds and fish. Pandas live alone most of their lives, only coming together when it is time to mate. Females give birth to cubs that are hairless and blind and weigh only 100g. Cubs depend on their mothers for about 18 months, and then it is time to find and establish its own territory. They use their scent glands beneath their tails for marking territory.\nThe giant panda is only found in central and western China, and only 1000 to 2000 remain in the wild. Causes of their decline include destruction of habitat and poaching. And the panda is heavily dependent upon its main food source, bamboo, which is becoming rare in its habitat. In an effort to save this species, the World Wildlife Fund and the Chinese Ministry of Forestry have developed a conservation management plan outlining 14 new panda reserves and five corridors connecting patches of panda habitat. This species is also legally protected to prevent poaching.\nWikipedia Article\nWikipedia Article\nCopyright Notice: This article is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License.

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant Panda Bear - bearlife.org", "url": "http://www.bearlife.org/panda-bear.html", "text": "Giant Panda Bear The giant panda bear is found at the top of the Yangtze Basin. Its range is confined to small remote mountain areas in the central China provinces of Sichuan, Gansus, and Shaanxi. Its population is declining since its original habitat has been reduced to a mere fraction due to deforestation, farming, global warming, poaching, hunting dogs, and other activities related to mankind. Often nicknamed the Asian bear or Oriental bear, the panda bear once lived in Vietnam and Burma. Left unprotected, endangered pandas would inevitably become extinct. Mysterious and unknown in the past, many fascinating facts and information are continuously being discovered about male and female pandas and their baby cubs. PANDA CUBS Panda cubs are adored for their puppy-like resemblance and unique color scheme. Who can resist their fluffy white fur with black circle eyes, ears, and stripes. On all fours they resemble a cuddly puppy. Many facts contribute to the plight of the endangered panda. Panda cubs are born in small litters, often only one. Where they live and the robustness of their habitat determines their survival. Since the mother\u2019s reproduction rate is limited, specie propagation is fragile. The more information and facts we know about baby pandas the better we can insure their survival. Panda bear cubs are born to play. But the survival skills they learn from their mother are critical. With proper skills and a favorable environment, cubs can mature to adulthood and continue the cycle of reproduction to save the species. The owl is an enemy of panda babies. The life of a panda cub has some fascinating characteristics. See our page of interesting facts about baby pandas. RESEARCH OVERVIEW Although their habitat and population is on the decline, giant panda facts are more abundant today thanks to the studies of animal scientists and conservation groups. Difficult to observe in the wild, giant panda and cub information was scarce and difficult to gather. Today much is known about their habitat, life cycle, baby pandas, and their endangered status. Classification of the panda seems to be clarified for now. The more panda research studies conducted, the more we will learn about this precious bear and how we can insure it survives from becoming extinct. PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION Panda bear features are unique. They are medium sized bears that have a more round figure than their cousins. In fact they are often portrayed as a roundish dog in early information sketches. They have white with black ears and teardrop circles around their eyes. Their arms and legs are black along with a band extending from their front arms around their back. Their tail is short and white. Of all the endangered bear species they have the most distinguished color combination. Their color is uniform across their entire population. Baby pandas do not initially possess these unique characteristics. After a few months cubs form their familiar patterns. The unusual color patterns have caused much confusion in its scientific classification. Some researchers theorize that the black and white colors protect the panda from enemies where it lives. The colors are designed to blend in with the black mountain rock terrain and white snow. WEIGHT AND SIZE Panda dimensions vary but statistics reveal that the weight of a male panda is about 175 to 250 pounds. The female weighs about 150 to 225 pounds. Their average height is about two to three feet tall when standing on four legs. Females are slightly less, about half a foot shorter. Males can reach five to six feet in length. The female panda is almost as long, sometimes identical. The tail reaches four to seven inches in length. GIANT PANDA POPULATION One of the most alarming panda bear facts is the size of their total population. The worldwide total estimate is less than 1600 and has put the giant panda bear on the endangered species list. Their ability to survive as a species is challenging. The most critical factor is the destruction of their natural habitat. Education, conservation, reserves, and captive breeding are some of the efforts being practiced to prevent their numbers from declining. HOW LONG DO PANDAS LIVE? The giant panda lifespan is difficult to determine in the wild. Studies indicate that the average estimate is somewhere between 15 and 25 years. However some captive pandas have been reported to live past the age of 30. In the wild their life may be shortened by encounters with poachers. Premature starvation can occur when areas of bamboo die off and they are unable to cross into territories containing healthy bamboo. HABITAT Pandas live in remote mountainous areas that have dense forests of bamboo. Their remaining living area is at very high altitudes that have not been developed by people. They may descend to lower levels to live during the winter, but not past the point where humans are present. Endangered panda bears are continuously losing their habitat. Loss is most acute at lower levels where deforestation, farming, housing, and other projects of civilization occur. GIANT PANDA ENEMIES Panda bear information is rare when it comes to their predators. They simply do not have many. Their main enemy is man. People hunt panda bears for their unique colored pelts. Human destruction of its natural habitat is the biggest threat and has pushed the animal to the brink of extinction. Another enemy is the snow leopard. The leopard is a predator of baby panda cubs once they wander from their mother. However in the mother\u2019s presence the leopard dare not attack. The mother will attack vigorously to defend her young. Pandas avoid people and their living areas. But when they wander nearby, roaming dogs owned by villagers have been known to attack them. PANDA ATTACK? Panda attacks are rare. These animals are docile, reclusive, and avoid people. In the wild contact with humans seldom occurs due to their remote habit. However angry panda bears can attack to defend themselves or their young if provoked. Most people find pandas adorable. Although rare, \u201cattacks\u201d can occur when a person approaches an adult panda in a zoo or reserve to tease, pet, feed, or take a photo beside it. Adult panda bears should be respected and treated like any other wild animal. PANDA CLASSIFICATION Classification information on the giant panda bear has not been without controversy due to its unique traits. Once thought to be bear, it was later placed in the raccoon family. The giant panda was linked to the red panda, an animal more raccoon like in appearance which has similar characteristics and consumes bamboo. Some even though it was related to the dog family. Genetic panda information from numerous scientific research projects now indicate that the giant panda is closer to the bear family. At least all agree that research facts indicate the panda is gravely endangered. WHAT DO PANDAS EAT? The giant panda has a very specialized diet consisting nearly entirely of bamboo. It eats all parts of the bamboo including the stalk, leaves, shoots, and roots. The plant is highly fibrous and low in nutrition. Combined with the fact that pandas digest a very low percentage of what they eat, they must consume huge quantities to absorb sufficient nutrients. Pandas can eat 30 to 45 pounds of bamboo every day. Once baby pandas are finished nursing, they voraciously dine on bamboo. Panda cubs have been known to devour 5 to 10 pounds a day. When bamboo supplies diminish, populations decline and contribute to their endangered status. They have evolved specialized features to help them eat their favorite food. Panda teeth are designed to penetrate the fibrous bamboo stalks. The rear molar teeth are huge for grinding down material prior to digestion. Extending from their wrist bone is a unique thumb like feature to grasp bamboo stalks. This is in addition to their five fingers! Giant panda bear information from studies in the wild indicate that bamboo is nearly 95% of their diet. However, wild giant panda food may include roots, tubers, and bark. Many facts indicate they may also eat wild yams if available in their habitat. They may occasionally graze on grass (like dogs). In captivity, some zoos supplement the pandas diet by feeding them bananas, oatmeal, vegetables, and eggs. ENDANGERED PANDAS The number of wild pandas is small and their habitat reduced to narrow isolated territories. Until recently these remaining areas were cut off from each other, further reducing the panda\u2019s ability to migrate, mate, and locate food. Since pandas are dependent on a bamboo diet, their diminished habitat has put them at risk. Part of the bamboo plant\u2019s life cycle includes periodic die-offs after flowering. This can affect entire forests of bamboo. Pandas normally roam to new forests, but this is not possible if their range is confined or disconnected. The giant panda is endangered and conservation is mandatory to save it from extinction. The giant panda is endangered for many reasons: global warming, commercial logging, farming, and illegal poaching. PANDA POPULARITY Always popular, the panda bear has wide spread appeal as stuffed animal toys, cartoon characters, sketch information, logos, and so on. The panda dog is the epitome of panda mania. It is a dog that looks like a panda. The panda dog is testimony to the popularity of this endangered species. Any dog (or cat) will do. However the ideal \u201cmodel\u201d should have short hair, round ears, and a short muzzle. It should also have a short tail and rounded body. In fact the rounder the animal the better. The subject is trimmed to resemble the panda. It is then colored black and white patterns. Ideally the pet's original hair is white so only black coloring has to be applied. With the right features and dimensions the model looks like the real thing. A smaller pet looks like a baby panda! PANDA FACTS For more information on pandas check out our Panda Bear Facts."}

Click to download the free sample version Download sample\nMembers of the clam genus Tridacna, giant clams (Tridacna gigas) are the largest extant bivalve mollusks. Among the most endangered clam species, giant clams can be found in flat coral sand or broken corals, in depths of as much as 66 feet.\nSee the fact file below for more information on the giant clam or alternatively, you can download our 21-page Giant Clam worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\nKey Facts & Information\nANATOMY\nYoung giant clams are hard to identify from other species of Tridacninae. Adults are the only giant clams that cannot close their shells completely. Even when closed, portions of the mantle can still be seen, unlike the very similar Tridacna derasa. However, this can only be distinguished with increasing age and growth. Small gaps continue to remain visible between shells through which retracted brownish-yellow mantle can be spotted.\nTridacna gigas consists of four or five vertical creases on its shell, a main feature that differentiates it from the similar shell of T. derasa, which displays six or seven vertical folds. As with extreme deposition of coral matrices made of calcium carbonate, the bivalves with zooxanthellae, or single-celled dinoflagellates, may seem to grow huge calcium carbonate shells. The mantle\u2019s edges are composed of symbiotic zooxanthellae that are assumed to make use of carbon dioxide, phosphates, and nitrates given off by the clam.\nThe mantle border is lined with hundreds of different eyespots of about 0.5 mm in diameter.\nEach of these has a small chamber with a pupil-like aperture and a base of a hundred or more photoreceptors, which permit the giant clam to react to the unexpected dimming of light in which they withdraw their mantles and slightly close their shells as a way of protecting themselves from potential predators.\nAside from their reaction to dimming, giant clams also respond to the movement of an object prior to the casting of a shadow. In order for this to occur, an image forming optical method is needed as the reaction is based on the local dimming of a portion of the generated image with respect to the rest. The motion of a dark object caused this sequential dimming, letting enough time for the mantle to be retracted before a potential predator is nearby and casting a shadow.\nLARGEST SPECIMENS\nThe largest identified T. gigas species measured 137 centimeters, and was found around 1817 on the northwestern coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. The weight of this specimen\u2019s two shells was 230 kilograms, implying that the live weight of the clam would have been about 250 kilograms. Currently, these shells are exhibited in a museum in Northern Ireland.\nAnother peculiarly large giant clam was discovered in 1958 off the Japanese island of Ishigaki. However, it was not scientifically studied before 1984. The shell\u2019s length was 115 centimeters and the weight of the shells, together with its soft parts, was 333 kilograms. Researchers assumed that the live weight of this giant clam species would be around 340 kilograms.\nFEEDING\nGiant clams feed on algae, which act as a supplementary source of nutrients. These plants consist of unicellular algae, whose metabolic elements add to the filter food of clams, resulting in the species\u2019 massive size which is as large as a meter in length, even in coral reef waters with less nutrients. The clams enrich algae in a specialized circulatory system which lets them keep a substantially higher amount of symbionts per unit of volume.\nIn small clams \u2013 10 milligrams dry tissue weight \u2013 filter feeding releases about 65% of total carbon required for respiration and growth; large clams (10 grams) require only 34% of carbon from this resource.\nREPRODUCTION\nGiant clams sexually reproduce and are considered as hermaphrodites, having both egg and sperm. Self-fertilization is impossible, although this trait permits them to mate with any other member of the species, reducing the burden of searching a compatible mate, at the same time doubling the number of offsprings. Compared to other forms of sexual reproduction, hermaphroditism guarantees that new gene combinations can be inherited by other generations.\nSince giant clams are unable to move or wander, they adopt broadcast spawning, emitting sperm and eggs into the water. A spawning induced substance, secreted through a syphonal outlet, assists in the transmission and synchronization of the release of sperm and eggs to guarantee fertilization.\nDiscovery of these transmitter substances prompts the giant clam to expand its mantle in the central region and to contract its adductor muscle. Each clam crowds its water chambers and clogs the incurrent syphon. The shell intensely contracts with the adductor\u2019s assistance, so the excurrent chamber\u2019s contents passes through the excurrent syphon. A few contractions containing only water, eggs, and sperm are present inside the excurrent chamber, and then flow through the excurrent syphon into the water.\nEggs are about 100 micrometers in diameter, and adult giant clams are able to release more than 500 million eggs at a time.\nSpawning takes place within incoming tides near the second (full), third, and fourth (new) quarters of the moon phase, occurring every two or three minutes, which can even reach to 30 minutes to two and a half hours.\nDEVELOPMENT\nFertilized eggs can be seen floating in the sea for about 12 hours until a larva, or a trochophore, hatches. The larva begins to develop a calcium carbonate shell. Two days after fertilization, it grows into 160 micrometers, and forms a \u201cfoot\u201d, which is used for mobility; it can also swim to locate suitable habitats.\nAt around seven days, the clam stays on the ground, although it shifts location frequently within its first few weeks.\nHUMAN RELEVANCE\nGiant clams are now endangered because of the intensive exploitation of bivalve fishing vessels. Majority of the large adult T. gigas are killed, since they are most likely profitable.\nGiant clams are also eaten in Japan (known as himejako), France, South East Asia, and other Pacific Islands. Some Asian delicacies include the meat from the muscles of clams.\nGiant clam shells are sold as ornaments in the black market.\nGiant Clam Worksheets\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about the giant clam across 21 in-depth pages.

You might think that, due to its name, the red panda is related to the giant panda \u2026 but you\u2019d be wrong! In fact, this cute, cat-sized Asian mammal isn\u2019t a bear at all, and is more closely related to animals such as badgers, skunks and raccoons.\nSadly, due to poaching and habitat loss, the red panda has become endangered. Even the most optimistic estimates put its wild population at around 20,000 individuals.\nLet\u2019s find out more about this fascinating animal \u2026\nRed Panda Facts At A Glance\nOther Name(s): Lesser panda, red cat-bear, red bear-cat\nLesser panda, red cat-bear, red bear-cat Scientific name: Ailurus fulgens\nAilurus fulgens Type of Animal: Mammal\nMammal Animal Family: Ailuridae\nAiluridae Where Found: Eastern Himalayas and southwestern China\nEastern Himalayas and southwestern China Head-Body Length: 50 to 64 cm (20 to 25 in)\n50 to 64 cm (20 to 25 in) Tail Length: 28 to 59 cm (11 to 23 in)\n28 to 59 cm (11 to 23 in) Weight: 3 to 6.2 kg (6.6 to 13.7 lb.)\n3 to 6.2 kg (6.6 to 13.7 lb.) Conservation Status: Endangered\nMeet The Red Panda: Introduction\nWatch the amazing red panda documentary below to see footage of the animal in the wild, or continue reading for in-depth info on the species \u2026\nDespite its name, the red panda is not a member of the bear family and the species is not closely related to the giant panda. In fact, the red panda is the only living member of the family Ailuridae.\nThe family Ailuridae belongs to the superfamily Musteloidea, a group of animals that also includes the weasel, raccoon and skunk families.\nCurrently, 2 subspecies of red panda are recognized: the Western red panda (A. f. fulgens) and Styan\u2019s red panda (A. f. styani).\nConfused by terms such as \u2018family\u2019 and \u2018subspecies\u2019? Check out our easy guide to Animal Classification.\nWhat Does The Red Panda Look Like?\nThe red panda looks like a \u2018miniature bear\u2019, with a long body and sturdy legs. Unlike a bear, it has a long, bushy tail. Its thick fur is reddish-brown in color. Its undersides and legs are black. The tail is marked with lighter-colored rings.\nThe red panda\u2019s think, bushy coat provides insulation from the cold mountainous environment.\nThe red panda has a rounded head with a flat face and pointed, cream-colored ears. Most red pandas have a predominantly white face, with reddish-brown tear-shaped markings below the eyes. The facial markings resemble those of a raccoon and vary from individual to individual.\nThe red panda is slightly bigger than a domestic cat. Males are slightly larger than females, and can weigh up to 6.2 kg (13.7 lb.).\nThe two subspecies are similar in appearance, with Styan\u2019s red panda possibly being slightly larger and having a darker coat \u2013 although there is a degree of variation even between members of the same subspecies.\nAlthough unrelated to the giant panda, the red panda shares the bear\u2019s liking for bamboo. Like the larger animal, the red panda has a \u2018false thumb\u2019 \u2013 a thumb-like extension of the wrist bone. However, whereas the panda\u2019s false thumb is an adaptation for holding bamboo, the red panda\u2019s false thumb is thought to be an adaptation for climbing trees.\nWhere Is The Red Panda Found?\nThe red panda lives in temperate forests in the Himalayas. Countries in which the red panda is found include Nepal, China, Myanmar, India and Bhutan.\nThe Brahmaputra River is often considered to form a natural boundary between the ranges of the Western red panda and Styan\u2019s red panda subspecies.\nYou can see the region in which the red panda is found on the map below:\nThe Himalayas\nThe Himalayas is a mountain range in Asia. It lies between the Indian Subcontinent and the Tibetan Plateau. Mount Everest \u2013 Earth\u2019s highest mountain above sea level \u2013 is part of the Himalayas.\nRed Panda Habitat\nThe red panda inhabits deciduous and coniferous forests at altitudes between 2,500 and 4,800 m (7,200 and 15,700 ft.).\nThe species appears to prefer habitats with the following features: gentle north-facing slopes; near water; dense understory of bamboo and old trees.\nBehavior\nThe red panda is a solitary, territorial animal. It is mostly active in the late evening and at night. During the day it rests in trees or inside tree hollows.\nThe red panda\u2019s sleeping posture depends on the temperature: in warm weather, it stretches out on a branch with its legs dangling. In cold weather, it curls up and covers its face with its furry tail.\nCommunication\nThe red panda is not a particularly vocal species, although it does make some twittering and whistling sounds. Instead, the species communicates via body language. Movements used by the red panda to communicate include: shaking its head from side to side; moving the head slowly up and down; arching of the tail and back; and standing on the hind legs with the forelimbs raised.\nThe red panda uses urine as well as a secretion from its anal glands to mark its territory.\nMovement\nThe red panda is an arboreal (tree-dwelling) species. It is an excellent climber, and when in the branches uses its tail for balance. It is able to climb down a tree head first by rotating its ankles.\nWhen on the ground the panda walks with its feet flat against the ground and the tail held horizontally. It has a slight waddle due to its front legs being shorter than the hind legs.\nFamily Life\nThe red panda mating season falls between mid-January and early March. Scent marking increases during this time, and both sexes may mate with multiple partners.\nThe gestation period is between 112 and 158 days. In the summer (between June to July), the female uses leaves, grass and other vegetation to build a nest inside a hollow tree or a rock crevice. Here she will give birth to a litter of 1 to 4 young. The cubs weigh around 110 to 130 g (3.9 to 4.6 oz.).\nAt around 3 months of age, the young develop their adult coloration. At this time they start to spend time outside the nest and to eat solid food. The cubs are weaned at around 8 months, but remain with their mother until her next litter is born.\nWhat Do Red Pandas Eat?\nDespite being a member of the order Carnivora (a group of animals descended from meat-eating ancestors), the red panda is mainly herbivorous.\nBamboo makes up around 80% of the red panda\u2019s diet. The red panda is unable to digest cellulose \u2013 a tough plant material \u2013 and as a result has to consume large quantities of bamboo every day. It eats the tender parts of the plant, including the shoots and young leaves.\nOther foods eaten by the red panda include fruit, berries, roots, succulent grasses, mushrooms, flowers, lichens and acorns. Occasionally, it may also feed on fish, insects, birds and bird eggs.\nRed Panda Predators\nThe snow leopard (Uncia uncia) is the main predator of the red panda.\nWhen threatened, the panda will usually attempt to flee by climbing a tree. If cornered, it will stand on its hind legs in order to appear bigger than it actually is. It will defend itself by slashing out with its claws.\nIs The Red Panda Endangered?\nThe red panda is rated \u2018Endangered\u2019 by the IUCN.\nThe red panda population has declined significantly (an estimated 50%) over just 3 generations. The main threats to the red panda are mainly linked to the growing human population in the Himalayas. These include:\nHabitat loss: Commercial logging, agriculture and roads have decreased and fragmented red panda habitat. Habitat fragmentation makes it difficult for the pandas to move to new feeding grounds when bamboo (the species\u2019 main food source) goes through its cycles of mass flowering and die-off over large areas.\nCommercial logging, agriculture and roads have decreased and fragmented red panda habitat.

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Facts About Red Pandas | Live Science", "url": "https://www.livescience.com/57312-red-pandas.html", "text": "Primarily a bamboo eater, this charismatic mammal is covered in fur the color of cinnamon, which keeps it warm in cooler climates. Found in parts of Asia, red pandas are losing ground due to their specific habitat needs for their food staple, bamboo, that grows in areas becoming more and more disturbed by human activity.\nRed pandas are small mammals with long, fluffy tails and red and white markings. Though they share a name with the more famous giant panda, they are not closely related. In fact, the name 'panda' was first applied to these animals, and not to the larger black-and-white bear.\nAccording to the San Diego Zoo, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cuvier, a French zoologist, first described the red panda in 1825, about 48 years before the giant panda was cataloged. He called it the most beautiful animal he had ever seen and named it Ailurus fulgens, meaning fire-colored, or shining, cat. The common name, panda, may be derived from a Nepalese name for these animals, nigalya ponya, which may have meant 'bamboo footed.' The giant panda was given its name later because of similarities to the red panda.\nOther names for the red panda include lesser panda, cat-bear, bear-cat, Himalayan raccoon, fox bear and firefox, according to the San Diego Zoo. The mascot of the Firefox Web browser is a red panda, according to Mozilla.\nRed pandas were at first classified as relatives of raccoons in the Procyonidae family, because of physical similarities, such as the head, teeth and ringed tail, according to the Smithsonian National Zoo. Later, because of some DNA similarities, they were classified as bears in the Ursidae family. Recent genetic research now places them in their own family, Ailuridae. They have no living relatives, and their nearest fossil ancestors lived 3 million to 4 million years ago.\nSize and description\nRed pandas are similar in size to the common house cat. They are 20 to 26 inches (51 to 66 centimeters) long from head to rump, and their tail adds another 10 to 20 inches (25.4 to 51 cm). They weigh from 10 to 20 lbs. (4.5 to 9 kilograms).\nRed pandas have large round heads and short snouts with large, pointed ears. Their coats are reddish-brown, although their faces are mostly white with reddish 'tear tracks' extending from their eyes to the corner of their mouths. These markings may help keep the sun out of their eyes, according to the National Zoo.\nThey have long, bushy tails with alternating red and white rings. The tail helps them maintain their balance as they climb trees. Long, sharp claws help them climb to the highest branches to sunbathe or escape from predators, according to the San Diego Zoo.\nOne feature that red pandas do share with giant pandas is a modified wrist bone that acts like a thumb, helping them grasp bamboo when feeding, according to the National Zoo.\nHabitat and diet\nRed pandas live in the mountains of Nepal, central China and northern Myanmar in rainy, high-altitude temperate forests and tropical forests, according to the National Zoo.\nOne important factor to their habitat is bamboo. The forest must have a bamboo understory for it to be viable for the red panda. Bamboo consists of 85 to 95 percent of their diet, according to the National Zoo. Red pandas eat bamboo shoots and bamboo leaf tips, stripping them off the stems with their mouths. They may also forage for roots, grasses and fallen fruits. Sometimes, they will eat eggs, insects, birds and small mammals as well, but they mostly stick to bamboo.\nWhile it is a big part of their diet, red pandas can digest only about 24 percent of the bamboo they eat. They need to consume 20 to 30 percent of their body weight, or about 2 to 4 lbs. (1 to 2 kg) of bamboo shoots and leaves per day. One study found that female red pandas eat about 20,000 bamboo leaves a single day, according to the San Diego Zoo.\nHabits\nRed pandas are primarily crepuscular \u2014 active at dawn or dusk \u2014 but they can be active any time of the day, according to the National Zoo. They are solitary creatures; males are territorial and will mark their territory with strong odor from the scent gland at the base of their tail. Like skunks, red pandas can unleash the smell when they are scared to fend off a predator. If that doesn't work, they stand on their back feet and strike out with the claws on their front feet, according to the San Diego Zoo.\nThese creatures spend most of their time in trees, eating and sleeping without the need to step foot on soil. They also like to lie on branches to sunbathe as they sleep. It can get a bit chilly at night where the red pandas live, so to keep warm, they wrap themselves in their fluffy tails, according to National Geographic (opens in new tab). When temperatures drop significantly, red pandas can become dormant. Their metabolic rate gets lower and increases only every few hours to wake them up so they can look for food, according to the National Zoo.\nWhen they wake up, red pandas groom themselves like cats, according to the San Diego Zoo. They lick their front paws and use them to wipe down their fur instead of a full tongue-to-fur bath, though.\nRed pandas like to stretch out on tree branches and warm themselves in the sun. (Image credit: Karel Gallas Shutterstock)\nOffspring\nFemale red pandas give birth during the spring and summer after a gestation period of 114 to 145 days, according to the National Zoo, although it may be as short as 90 days and as long as 158 days. Females build birthing dens in stumps, hollow trees or rock crevices. Dens are lined with grass, leaves, twigs, moss and small branches.\nFemales can have one to four young, though they usually have twins, according to the San Diego Zoo. The baby red pandas are called cubs. Cubs' eyes and ears are sealed until they are around 2 to 3 weeks of age. They nurse until they are 13 to 22 weeks old. They stay with their mothers in their birthing dens for about 90 days and reach maturity at 18 to 20 months. A typical life span for a red panda is 8 to 10 years in the wild and 15 years in zoos.\nClassification\nHere is the taxonomy of the red panda, according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS):\nKingdom: Animalia Subkingdom: Bilateria Infrakingdom: Deuterostomia Phylum: Chordata Subphylum: Vertebrata Infraphylum: Gnathostomata Superclass: Tetrapoda Class: Mammalia Subclass: Theria Infraclass: Eutheria Order: Carnivora Suborder: Caniformia Family: Ailuridae Genus and species: Ailurus fulgens Subspecies: Ailurus fulgens fulgens (found in the Himalayas), Ailurus fulgens refulgens (found in China)\nSome taxonomists, as well as the ITIS and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), recognize two subspecies, while others argue for two separate species: the Himalayan red panda (Ailurus fulgens) and the Chinese red panda (Ailurus stanyi).\nConservation status\nThe red panda is considered endangered and is on the IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species. It is believed that the population has decreased by 50 percent over the past 18 years, and the decline is projected to continue and perhaps intensify in the next three generations. The number of adults in the wild is probably about 10,000 animals, according to the San Diego Zoo, although some estimates put the number at only 2,500.\nThe population decline is almost solely due to deforestation. Hunting also seems to be increasing, the IUCN says, perhaps partly in response to the increasing number of 'cute' images on social media. There are now worldwide efforts to protect the red panda, according to the San Diego Zoo. In China, there are 35 protected areas; in India, there are 20. There are eight in Nepal and five in Bhutan.\nAdditional Resources"}

They are gentle creatures who live high in the trees, feed on bamboo, and pretty much chill most of the time. In this post, we provide you with intriguing red panda facts for kids, including information on their lives, habitat, and food habits.\nUnfortunately, the cute species has recently been threatened with extinction because of human encroachment on their habitat. Hence, we must educate our children about red pandas and prevent them from going extinct.\nQuick Facts About The Red Panda\nScientific name: Ailurus fulgens Size: Body is 22 \u2013 24.6 inches (56 \u2013 62.5 centimeters) long. The tail is about 14.6 \u2013 18.6 inches (37 to 47.2 centimeters) Weight: Males, 8.8-13.3 pounds (4 \u2013 6.5 kilograms); Females, 6.6-13.2 pounds (3-6 kilograms) Lifespan: 8 years in the wild; Can reach 14 years of age in captivity\n`\nIUCN conservation status: Endangered\nName & Taxonomy\nThe name panda comes from the Nepali word called \u201cpoonya,\u201d which means bamboo eater.\nThe red panda is not related to the giant panda but is more closely related to a raccoon.\nBefore the discovery of the giant panda, the red panda was simply called panda. It was known to the western world way before the black & white giant panda came into limelight.\nRed pandas were once considered to be of the bear family. However, extensive DNA analysis found that they belong to a family of their own.\nThey are the only living members of their biological family called Ailuridae. All other members of the family are extinct.\nThere are two subspecies of the red panda: fulgens and styani. Pandas of the styani subspecies are usually larger and with deeper fur color when compared to fulgens subspecies.\nRed panda goes by other several English names, the most popular ones being firefox, fire cat, and red cat. Some scientific researchers also refer to the animal as the lesser panda.\nWhen zoologists discovered the red panda, they thought it resembled a cat since the size of the animal is quite similar to that of a domestic cat.\nLifespan\nThe red panda lives for eight years on an average, although those living in captivity may live up to 14 years.\nIn rare instances, captive red pandas may live up to 23 years.\nAppearance\nThe body of an adult panda (except the tail) usually stands at 22 \u2013 24.6 inches (56 \u2013 62.5 centimeters). Interestingly, their tail alone can measure at 14.6 \u2013 18.6 inches (37 to 47.2 centimeters).\nThe wrist bone extends to create a false thumb, which allows the animal to have an optimum grip. Red panda shares the extended wrist bone feature with the giant panda.\nThe fur on the back and above the limbs is reddish brown. The fur on the limbs and belly is black.\nAn adult male red panda can weigh about 8.8-13.3 pounds (4 \u2013 6.5 kilograms). Females weigh between 6.6-13.2 pounds (3-6 kilograms).\nRed pandas have furry feet. It helps them have a better grip when walking in snow.\nCubs are covered with fur and are almost blind with their eyes closed at birth. A single cub weighs about 3 \u2013 4 ounces (approx. 90 to 110 grams).\nThey have sharp claws almost resembling that of a cat. The red panda\u2019s claws help it grip the bark of the tree while climbing.\nClaws are semi-retractile, which means the animal can partially withdraw within the paw.\nHabits & Lifestyle\nThe red panda uses the tail to wrap itself when the weather is cold. The tail makes a great blanket when it is snowing. It explains why they have such long, bushy tails.\nThe long tail of the animal also has another functional benefit: it helps the animal balance its weight when walking on narrow tree branches.\nThey are mostly nocturnal. They may also forage for food during dusk and dawn.\nRed pandas show most activity during colder weather and tend to become lethargic when the weather gets warm.\nRed pandas spend the majority of their time on tree tops and thus are arboreal animals.\nThe Red panda is mostly solitary except during mating season.\nIt is less common to see red pandas live in pairs and rare to see them stay in family groups.\nIt is a quiet animal and has very few vocalizations such as twitter and squeal. Sometimes they may hiss or grunt. Cubs whistle or bleat often to call their mother.\nJust like a dog, red pandas pant during warm weather to cool their bodies and regulate their body temperature.\nMale red pandas fight while standing on their hind legs and strike each other with their claws.\nReproduction\nFemale red pandas have a gestation period of 130 days (about four months and ten days).\nFemales give birth to three to four cubs during spring or summer.\nRed pandas do not stay in pairs, and only females raise the cubs.\nThe female makes a nest in tree stumps, tree holes or bamboo thickets before giving birth to the cubs. Nests are usually lined with leaves or moss.\nDiet\nThe main food of the red panda is bamboo branches. It also eats fruit, insects, small reptiles, and bird eggs sometimes.\nBamboo makes 85-90% of a Red panda\u2019s diet. They prefer the leaves and shoots of the plant.\nAlthough they spend most of the time on trees, they may descend to the ground to dig out roots and grass to eat when they are very hungry.\nA red panda is heavily dependent on its habitat for food and may not migrate to other areas to look for extra food, unlike other animals. It makes the animal very sensitive to any habitat destruction.\nRed pandas avoid water. They get most of their water intake from their solid diet.\nHabitat & Endangerment\nA single red panda will command a forest area of one square mile, which is their territory.\nRed panda\u2019s natural habitat spreads across five countries namely China, India, Nepal, Burma, and Bhutan.\nIn their natural habitat, the top predator of a red panda is the snow leopard.\nRed pandas prefer colder climates and do not like temperatures above 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F).\nAt any sign of danger, the red panda will scurry up the nearest tree. If cornered, a red panda will stand on its hind legs and defend itself with its sharp paws and teeth.\nThere are less than 10,000 red pandas left in the wild, and their numbers are slowly declining.\nThe red panda is at risk of poaching and losing its habitat due to deforestation. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) declared the red panda as an endangered animal in the year 2008.\nAbout 70% of red panda habitat falls outside government protected areas, which makes conservation of the animal even more essential.\nRed pandas that live in captivity undergo some basic training to help them interact with human beings. However, if they show no interest in training, then the panda is not trained forcefully.\nRed Panda In Society & Culture\nA company called Mozilla chose the red panda as the software icon for its internet browser called Firefox, which is another name for the Red panda.\nIn the popular animated film Kung Fu Panda, the character of Shifu, who is the Kung Fu teacher, is a Red panda.\nEvery year, the Indian state of Sikkim organizes a music event called the Red Panda Festival. The red panda is the state animal of Sikkim.\nEvery year, the international community of conversationalists picks a date in September as the International Red Panda Day. Various zoos and natural history organizations conduct events on this day to spread awareness about red panda conservation.\nAlthough it is perceived as cute and cuddly, the red panda cannot be domesticated. These pandas are wild animals and under no circumstance can they become pets.\nRed pandas are fluffy, cuddly animals that look like teddy bears and live high up in the trees. They are presently listed as an endangered species since humans have destroyed their natural habitat. Therefore, educating your children about some fascinating red panda facts will inspire them to contribute toward protecting these animals from extinction. If your child has an affinity for learning about nature and different animals, they will surely be amused by this peculiar creature and these interesting facts about its lifestyle, appearance, and more."}

[Explained]", "url": "https://bestofpanda.com/when-was-the-giant-panda-discovered/", "text": "Like many people all today, especially panda lovers, you may have lots of questions about giant pandas. They are cute, cuddly creatures that create fun in their habitats. At a point you may have thought, when was the giant panda discovered?\nWell, the first giant panda was discovered on April 1, 1869, by a priest who was living in Sichuan at that time. He found the beautiful creature, out of curiosity, after seeing a special black and white animal skin. Since then, a lot of giant pandas have been found in that area and moved to facilities in some parts of the world.\nI\u2019m glad you now know when the giant panda was discovered, but it is not enough. Has it ever crossed your mind that, who was the first person to discover pandas?\nI\u2019ll provide answers to these questions and others in this article.\nJust keep scrolling!\nWho Was the First Person to Discover Pandas?\nArmand David, a French priest, botanist, and zoologist, was the first person to discover pandas. Being a botanist, David was sent on a mission to collect certain species of plants and animals in China. He planned to transfer the species to the Natural Museum of Natural History in Paris for identification.\nAmazingly, David did not know he would become famous for a long time.\nOn March 11, 1869, still on his mission, the priest visited a stranger named Li Pinshan in Denchingou Village, Baoxing. Then he saw a white and black animal skin and was determined to find out where it came from.\nPhoto Source: Wikipedia.org\nWithout wasting time, David asked some hunters to search Boaxing mountains and bring the animal with this skin to him. Luckily, on the 1st of April, 1869, David saw the first black and white bear in flesh and blood.\nImmediately, he sent a message to the Natural Museum in Paris that he had found something of interest. He gave the creature a Latin name, \u201cUrsus melanoleucus\u201d which is translated in English as \u201cblack and white bear\u201c.\nUnfortunately, the \u201cbear\u201d died on the way to Paris, where zoologists wanted to perform research on it.\nHowever, David sent its body to the museum in Paris and a study was conducted on it by Alphonse Milne-Edwards. In 1870, a paper was published describing the creature as a new animal species. Since then, inhabitants of Boaxing, China have seen more giant pandas coming out of the mountains.\nIn fact, Sichuan Province in China has become a popular location since then, thanks to the giant pandas!\nIf it wasn\u2019t for Armand David, the giant pandas may not have been recognized.\nWhere was the First Giant Panda Found?\nThe first giant panda was found in Boaxing, Sichuan Province, China. To date, the place is often called \u201cthe hometown of the great panda\u201d. As discussed earlier, Armand David found the animal in April 1869 and Alphonse Milne-Edwards named it.\nLet\u2019s just say without the giant pandas, David wouldn\u2019t have been popular. And without David, maybe we wouldn\u2019t have known much about giant pandas.\nOver the years, researchers, and tourists have visited China just to look at one of the wonders of nature \u2013 the giant pandas.\nWhere Did the Giant Panda Originate From?\nGiant pandas originate from China. It was the place Armand David first discovered one of them. And from then till this present day, scores of giant pandas have been found in the country.\nNow, all giant pandas in zoos across different countries were loaned from China. Tourists, inhabitants, and all panda lovers often visit the various zoos in China to see the giant pandas every year. Whenever you are in China and want to see giant pandas, visit the popular Chengdu Research Breeding Center or other zoos.\nHow Was the Giant Panda Discovered?\nGiant pandas were discovered by their special black and white skin. Armand David, the french zoologist, and botanist noticed the panda skin at a villager\u2019s house in China. He hired hunters to look for animals with similar skin.\nThree weeks later, luck smiled on the hunters as they found the animal with the same black and white skin. But the creature didn\u2019t make it alive to the Paris Museum, where David was taking it to. Regardless, the botanist sent its remains to the museum in Paris; since he was on a mission in China.\nAlphonse Milne-Edwards, a zoologist at the National Museum in Paris, studied the skin and skeleton of the animal. In 1870, the zoologist published a paper where he concluded that the animal was a new species. He named it \u201cAiluropoda melanoleuca\u201d.\nSince then, the giant panda became popular, and a lot of them have been found in China.\nRelated Questions;\nWas the Red Panda Discovered Before the Giant Panda?\nYes, the red panda was discovered before the giant panda. In 1825, a French zoologist named Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cuvier noticed the red panda, almost 50 years before giant pandas were discovered. Cuvier named the red panda \u201cAilurus fulgens\u201d and described it as the most beautiful animal he had seen.\nBased on the similar characteristics they share with the red panda, the giant pandas got their name.\nPanda, the common name for red pandas and giant pandas, was derived from nigalya ponya, a Nepalese name for both animals. It means \u2018bamboo footed.\u2019\nHow Many Pandas Are Left In The World?\nAs of now, there are 1,800 pandas in the wild and 600 in captivity. Thanks to China, the panda population would have been lesser or even non-existent. By creating more habitats and putting laws in place against the illegal hunting of pandas, the animals\u2019 lives were saved.\nFormerly, the giant pandas were considered endangered species because of certain factors.\nFirst, humans prey on them and also destroy their habitats for farming or building purposes. When this happens, the pandas\u2019 bamboo diet can be destroyed, leaving them to starve to death.\nSecondly, the giant pandas don\u2019t reproduce as often as they should. It is a major challenge affecting their population besides the human factor.\nTo prevent the pandas from going extinct, the Chinese government made an effort to protect the pandas\u2019 habitat.\nIn addition to this, they put in place a law preventing people from harming them. Also, breeding and research centers have been set up in China to help the giant pandas to reproduce.\nFortunately, their effort produced positive results.\nPresently, the giant pandas are no longer endangered species. Nevertheless, the Chinese government is still actively involved in saving the lives of these creatures.\nWhere Do Pandas Live?\nIn the wild, pandas live in the mountains of southwestern China, where they survive mostly on bamboo.\nHowever, in captivity, pandas live in breeding centers and zoos across various parts of the world. China\u2019s reserve centers, which were set up to protect the lives of giant pandas, are currently more than sixty.\nApart from China, there are giant pandas in the National Zoo, Zoo Atlanta, and Memphis Zoo, all in the USA. A few countries have giant pandas too, but the cuddly animals were all loaned out from China.\nConclusion\nHere is a summary of what we talked about in this article before you leave.\nKeep in mind that the giant panda was discovered on the 1st of April 1869 by a French missionary, Armand David.\nBeing the first place that a panda was found, Boaxing in China is often called the \u201chometown of the giant panda\u201d.\nRemember that the giant panda was discovered because of its special black and white skin. Also, pandas are no longer endangered species.\nFinally, giant pandas in the wild live in the mountains of southwestern China while those in captivity live in breeding centers and zoos.\nDo you wish to learn more about the interesting life of pandas?

This feature is great for escaping predators! Pandas also never den which means they never go inside a den to live in it. Something else you may want to know about Giant Pandas is that the Chinese government doesn`t allow Giant Pandas to be shown on the media. The reason for this is they realize what they have is special and the want to cherish it without bothering it. Another interesting fact about the Panda is it has an extra thumb on its wrist called the pseudo thumb which is used to help it pick up Bamboo stalks. Wow!"}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Bears, facts and information - Animals", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/bears-grizzly-polar-panda", "text": "Common Name : Bears Scientific Name : Ursidae Type : Mammals Diet : Omnivore Size : 4 to 8 feet tall Weight : 60 to 1,600 pounds\nBears are mammals that belong to the family Ursidae. They can be as small as four feet long and about 60 pounds (the sun bear) to as big as eight feet long and more than a thousand pounds (the polar bear). They\u2019re found throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.\nThey have nonretractable claws, short tails, and excellent sense of smell. They\u2019re typically solitary, except for mothers with cubs. There are eight species: Asiatic black bears (also called moon bears), brown bears (which include grizzly bears), giant pandas, North American black bears, polar bears, sloth bears, spectacled bears (also called Andean bears), and sun bears.\nOn average, bears can live up to 25 years in the wild and 50 in captivity. Six species, including the polar bear and the giant panda, are included on the IUCN Red List as threatened or vulnerable.\nSurvival of the fattest\nDuring winter, when food is scarce, most bears have an effective survival solution: hibernation, a physical state in which the heart rate, body temperature, metabolism, and respiration is lowered. Grizzly and black bears can go for 100 days or so without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. They live off a layer of fat that they build up during the summer and fall.\nFemale bears rouse during hibernation in their dens to give birth to up to four cubs. Giant pandas, which do not hibernate, usually give birth to just one cub. After a couple of months, the cubs are strong enough to totter out after their mother\u2014except for sloth bear cubs, which hitch a ride on their mother\u2019s back.\nBear diet\nAll bears are considered omnivores\u2014and yes, they all love the taste of honey\u2014but each species has a preferred diet. Polar mostly eat seals. American black bears love berries and insect larvae when they\u2019re available, and giant pandas mainly eat bamboo, though they\u2019ll also eat small animals. Despite their name, sloth bears are ferociously fast eaters, able to tear a hole in a termite mound, push their noses inside, and inhale a full meal in just a few seconds. Brown bears in Alaska gorge on spawning salmon, plucking them from the water or catching them right out of the air as they jump.\nThreats\nAmong the biggest threats to all species of bears is habitat loss, especially from logging, agriculture, and growing human populations. Habitat loss reduces the amount of area bears have to hunt and means they\u2019re increasingly coming into contact with humans, which can lead to human-wildlife conflict. Bears are killed out of concern for human safety or in retaliation for hunting livestock or crop-raiding.\nSome species of bears, including Asiatic black bears and sun bears, are also threatened by the illegal wildlife trade. Bear bile, which is produced in the gall bladder, is an important ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine. Asiatic black bears and sun bears may be poached for their gall bladders, paws, skins, and other parts. Sometimes American black bears are also targeted for the same reasons.\nClimate change is also a significant threat, especially polar bears. They depend on finding seals on sea ice for their meals, and they\u2019ll often pass the summer months without eating while they wait for ice to solidify. Melting sea ice poses an existential threat to polar bears."}

The growing bear played with his first enrichment toys, sampled his first sweet potato, took his first bite of bamboo, let fans into his habitat during his first livestream and experienced his first encounter with snow! Through each of these milestones, giant panda assistant curator Laurie Thompson and keepers Marty Dearie and Mariel Lally helped keep fans at home connected to our cub.\nVideo\nJan. 11, 2021 | Tumbles and Toys\nSpending more time out of the den presents our cub with more opportunities to explore\u2014and play! While we have presented Xiao Qi Ji with enrichment items before\u2014most notably a pumpkin for Halloween\u2014we have seen his interest in them grow exponentially since the beginning of January. These items encourage our giant pandas to keep physically active and mentally sharp; they also give the bears an opportunity to use their natural behaviors and choose how to spend their time.\nWith Xiao Qi Ji becoming more aware of and interested in his surroundings, keepers gave him two toys to investigate: a small red Jolly Egg (perfectly sized for a panda cub) and an empty PVC puzzle feeder. When Xiao Qi Ji is exploring the habitat and happens upon them, he usually stops for a few minutes to paw at them, pick them up and give them a nibble. If you would like to help us replenish some of our worn but well-loved toys, you can do so by making a donation to the Enrichment Trunk.\nSome toys built for cubs are made from softer materials to help the animals grasp or chomp on them. Our team is very careful to watch Xiao Qi Ji as he plays during the day, since Mei Xiang\u2019s more powerful teeth and jaws could damage the toys. Before we leave for the day, we remove these toys from the enclosure. Neither Mei Xiang nor Xiao Qi Ji seem to mind, content to eat or play with their bamboo overnight.\nPersonality-wise, Xiao Qi Ji seems to take after his mother. Like Mei Xiang, he is careful and cautious when it comes to exploring his environment. Now that he has mastered walking, he has started to practice his climbing skills. He is very deliberate about the paths he takes when traveling up or down the rockwork\u2014more so than siblings Tai Shan, Bao Bao or Bei Bei were. He has taken a few tumbles here and there, but not nearly as many as his brothers and sister did at this age. Luckily, these bears are built to be robust and have thick, wooly fur to cushion their fall.\nRead the full update here.\nVideo\nJan. 15, 2021 | A Playful Panda Cub\nGiant panda cub Xiao Qi Ji\u2019s word of the week seems to be: play! Our 4.5-month-old cub\u2019s interest in his surroundings really took off this week. He seems to explore the world with his mouth. He nibbles on everything from his paws and enrichment toys to mother Mei Xiang\u2019s ears. While she is eating bamboo, we often see Xiao Qi Ji try to initiate a play session with a few not-so-ferocious bites. After Mei Xiang shifts outside in the morning, he often emerges from the den to \u201csupervise\u201d the keepers as they clean and get the habitat ready for Mei Xiang\u2019s return.\nAs I mentioned in my last update, Xiao Qi Ji received his first enrichment toys a few weeks ago and plays with them whenever they catch his attention. Those who have followed his sibling\u2019 stories have asked when Xiao Qi Ji will get a rubber tub. With the adults, we often put leaf-eater biscuits or sensory enrichment (like bubbles) into these tubs. Cubs, though, seem to enjoy the exercise of climbing in-and-out or just sitting in this cub-sized space.\nWe weigh Xiao Qi Ji in one such tub. This week, he tipped the scales at 19.8 pounds (9.04 kilograms). He also receives tubs to play in during the day. He is not quite big enough to get out from underneath a tub if it were to overturn on top of him, so he only receives this enrichment during the day when we can keep an eye on him.\nRead the full update here.\nVideo\nJan. 22, 2021 | A Parcel of Sweet Potato\nJust like his mother, Mei Xiang, our giant panda cub Xiao Qi Ji is curious yet cautious about the world around him. Yesterday\u2014the day our cub turned five months old\u2014we decided to introduce him to something new. Using a piece of bamboo shred as a spoon, we scraped some cooked sweet potato onto the end, then handed it over to Xiao Qi Ji. He grabbed the bamboo in his mouth, paused for a moment to take in the new taste, then lay back and licked the remainder. When we offered him more, he wouldn\u2019t stop nibbling on it!\nXiao Qi Ji clearly enjoyed this new treat, which is not surprising since both Mei Xiang and his father, Tian Tian, are also fond of sweet potatoes. In addition to bamboo, nutrient-rich biscuits, carrots and apples, sweet potatoes are part of our pandas\u2019 balanced diet.\nEven though Xiao Qi Ji is beginning to sample some new foods, Mei Xiang\u2019s milk is still his main source of nutrition. Around 1 year old, bamboo and other solid foods make up the majority of a panda's diet. However, Xiao Qi Ji may nurse for comfort up to 18 months of age. He typically nurses at night and in the early morning. On Wednesday, Jan. 20, he weighed 20.79 pounds (9.45 kilograms), and continues to make good gains.\nRead the full update here.\nVideo\nJan. 27, 2021 | Livestream with Xiao Qi Ji\nThis was a big week for our little panda cub! On Wednesday, Jan. 27, the giant panda team hosted our first-ever virtual encounter with Xiao Qi Ji. An important part of saving species is being able to tell their stories, and it was wonderful to see in the comments that many of you are as enamored with our adorable ambassador as we are. Your kind words and support for our bears and our team are much appreciated, especially as the Zoo remains closed and we continue to navigate this \u201cnew normal\u201d brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nXiao Qi Ji\u2019s newest enrichment toy made an appearance in Wednesday\u2019s broadcast. This week, we gave him a bright green ball with a small handle. Since it is made from a softer material than the adults\u2019 toys, it\u2019s perfect for him to chew on and sink his claws into. It is also scented like green apple, providing some olfactory enrichment, too!\nDuring the livestream, this ball was at the center of a friendly game of tug-of-war between Xiao Qi Ji and keeper Marty Dearie. Don\u2019t let Xiao Qi Ji\u2019s small size fool you\u2014he is remarkably strong! Just before Xiao Qi Ji stole everyone\u2019s hearts\u2014and wrestled his new green ball away from Marty\u2014we placed him on a scale for his weekly weigh-in. Since his last measurement seven days prior, our 5-month-old cub gained another two pounds. This week, he weighed 22 pounds (10 kilograms).\nVideo\nJan. 29, 2021 | A Bear's First Taste of Bamboo\nIn her update last week, assistant curator Laurie Thompson mentioned that Xiao Qi Ji tried cooked sweet potato for the first time and was a big fan of this new food. This week, bamboo was on the menu. We saw him munching on some of his mother Mei Xiang\u2019s leftover leaves.\nAs Xiao Qi Ji\u2019s walking and climbing skills improve, we are starting to see him explore more and more of his habitat. Yesterday, he walked out of the den, through both indoor enclosures, and over to the opposite den. He sat up and pressed his face against the \u201ctake out window\u201d where we routinely feed Mei Xiang. It was hilarious to see our curious cub waiting at the same window for us!\nRead the full update here."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant Pangolin Facts - Animals", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/giant-pangolin", "text": "Common Name : Giant Pangolin Scientific Name : Smutsia gigantea Type : Mammals Diet : Insectivore Average Life Span : unknown Average Life Span In Captivity : Up to 20 years Size : Males: 55 inches long; females: 50 inches long Weight : Up to 70 pounds IUCN Red List Status : ? Vulnerable LC NT VU EN CR EW EX Least Concern Extinct Current Population Trend : Decreasing\nAs its name implies, the giant ground pangolin is the largest of the eight pangolin species, stretching more than four feet long. And like all pangolins, Smutsia gigantea is covered in protective scales over much of its body, making it look like a walking pinecone.\nThe giant pangolin prefers to be near water and live in moist habitats. It's native to the humid forests of West and central Africa, where it spends its days close to its burrow or partially covered in leaves or brush. It is solitary and comes out to feed only at night. It's a terrestrial species, unlike the white-bellied and black-bellied tree pangolins that also live in West and central Africa.\nDefenses\nPangolins don\u2019t have many defenses; they don\u2019t even have teeth. If a predator like a leopard or a python gets too close, the pangolin rolls into a tight ball. With its tail tucked, scales cover every part of its exposed body, making it a tough nut to crack. The animals also have a stinky, large anal glands to deter predators.\nThe scales also come in handy when the pangolin snacks on its favorite treat: ants. It takes its long front claws and uses them like a backhoe to pry up rocks and rip into ant colonies (and termite mounds, its other food source). Once it\u2019s made an opening, the pangolin sticks its face in it and uses its very long tongue to slurp up the insects. When the ants swarm, the scales protect the pangolin from bites.\nOther anti-ant features include a special valve in its nose that closes, no exterior ears, and thick eyelids.\nReproduction\nPangolins live alone except when it comes time to mate. Females typically bear a single offspring at a time and are doting single mothers. A baby pangolin will ride on its mother\u2019s back, nursing and eating ants.\nThreats\nElusiveness hasn\u2019t protected giant pangolins from their main predator: humans. Like its pangolin cousins, Smutsia gigantea is hunted for its meat and scales. In fact, pangolins as a group are believed to be the most trafficked mammals in the world. Their scales are especially in demand for traditional Chinese medicine, though there is no scientific evidence they have any medicinal value. Giant pangolin scales, which are easily distinguishable from the scales of other species, are regularly found in overseas seizures of illegal shipments of scales. Giant pangolins also show up at bushmeat markets in range countries.\nWhile scientists don't know how many giant pangolins there are, they're believed to be slightly better off than pangolins in Asia. But as pangolin trafficking shifts from Asia to Africa, their population trend has been downward, and the species is listed on the IUCN\u2019s Red List as vulnerable."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "What Are The National Animals of China? - WorldAtlas", "url": "https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-are-the-national-animals-of-china.html", "text": "China is a country located on the south-east of the Asian continent with a rich sense of culture and heritage. It hosts a variety of plants and animal species, many of whom are rare. It also boasts of three national animals: the giant panda, the Chinese dragon, and the red-crowned crane. These animals are also the national symbols of China. They are highly treasured and preserved by the government of China as a symbol of national heritage and mythology.\n3. Giant panda\nThe giant panda is referred to as the \"national treasure\" of China. It has also been a symbol of World Wide Fund (WWF) since its inception in 1961. It is distinctly black and white (black around the eyes, shoulders, and legs with the rest of the body being white). It has an average height of 0.75 meters and is 5 feet in length. It has a lifespan of about fifteen to twenty years. Until 2015, the giant panda was an endangered species (there were fewer than 2,000 giant pandas in the wild). Giant pandas mostly feed on bamboo shoots, leaves, and roots. They spend time in bamboo forests at least 1200m to 3100m above sea level. The animals also eat mice, grass, insects, lambs, and some fruits.\nGiant pandas possess strong molar teeth and jaws which helps them crush bamboo with ease. When feeding, they sit like human beings. The city of Chengdu hosts many panda bases and natural reserves suitable for panda survival. It spends most of its time eating (14 hours), sleeping (2 to 4 hours a day), and the rest of the time climbing trees. They are also vulnerable due to human encroachment and degradation on their habitat. Logging and farming work have minimized their habitat space. Poaching and hunting of pandas have also contributed to their ever reducing number. The Chinese government has put measures of protecting giant pandas by reforesting farmlands with bamboo trees. The life cycle of a giant panda consists of Newborn (0 to 4 months), Cub hood (4 - 24 months), Independence stage (1.5 to 2 years) and Maturity stage (4 to 6 years).\n2. Chinese dragon\nThe Chinese dragon is an important symbol in the Chinese culture, with the history of the Chinese Dragon dating back about 7,000 years. It is present in most Chinese festivals, art expos, and other functions. The dragon is deemed lucky and pleasant and it is a symbol of prosperity, power, and luck. Although Chinese dragons do not exist in the real world, they are a sign on the Chinese zodiac. In ancient China, the rulers (emperors) were known as the sons of dragons. The dragons were not meant for ordinary people, but for the rich and powerful. Pictures of a Chinese dragon resemble that of a snake but with four legs. Its appearance has features of several animals including a stag (antlers), carp (scales), clam (belly), claws of an eagle, soles (tiger), and ears (cows).\nAccording to ancient Chinese mythology, the dragons lack wings but can \"fly\" with an added ability to summon rain. They live at the base of water systems such as seas, lakes or rivers. This habit makes the Chinese dragon highly associated with moving bodies in the form of water. The superiority of this dragon is evident with its presence at the Forbidden City in China (the city is filled with imagery involving the dragon). According to Chinese mythology, the dragon has nine sons (Qiuniu, Pulao, Yazi, Bixi, Chaofeng, Suanni, Chiwen, Bi'an and Fuxi).\n1. Red-crowned crane\nThe red-crowned crane is one of the rarest birds in the world. It is a giant crane with a red crown head and a white body. It has a long beak, neck and legs. The red-crowned crane has a lifespan of approximately 50 to 60 years making it one of the longest living birds on the planet. The red-crowned crane has a maximum weight of fifteen kilograms. It is a first-class state protected animal. It is a symbol of durability, good luck, and loyalty. It mostly resides in the coastal wetlands in North Eastern China. The red-crowned crane has a wide variety of food ranging from small fish, insects, shrimps, aquatic invertebrates, and some plants. They also feed on rice, carrots, buckwheat among others. They feed by fixing their heads next to the ground.\nRed-crowned cranes are migratory birds who migrate from one place to another. Spawning lasts for six months. The crane is an omnivorous bird. Several policies and measures have been put in place to protect endangered and vulnerable national animals in China."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Training Giant Panda Vets | Smithsonian's National Zoo", "url": "https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/news/training-giant-panda-vets", "text": "Last month Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute chief veterinarian, Dr. Copper Aitken-Palmer and veterinarians from the San Diego Zoo and Hong Kong Zoo led a first-of-its-kind veterinary workshop at the Dujiangyan Panda Base to diagnose and elevate the level of medicine provided to giant pandas within China. During the workshop, veterinarians from all over China worked in partnership with veterinarians at Dujiangyan and international veterinary experts in diagnosing and treating ailments found in aging pandas. Just like humans, older pandas generally start to encounter more health issues, especially dental and ocular problems, the older they get. As part of the workshop, the veterinarians anesthetized eight giant pandas simultaneously to examine them closely. Each panda had a team of Chinese and international veterinary specialists using state-of-the-art monitoring and diagnostic equipment devoted to their care.\nDr. Aitken-Palmer partnered with Li Caiwu of Dujiangyan Panda Base to lead her team of veterinarians, which consisted of a group of about five veterinarians from zoos all over China. They anesthetized two giant pandas over 20 years old (giant pandas usually live to be in their mid to upper 20s). They were able to diagnose several things not previously diagnosed in the individuals including reproductive tumors (which may explain why the individuals had not been reproductive), cataracts, anemia, severe arthritis and dental disease. During the workshop, Pan Pan, a 30-year-old male panda famous for his natural breeding skills was evaluated. He's father to at least 32 cubs, including the Zoo's own Tian Tian! The workshop was a big success! All the veterinarians involved from Dujiangyan and around China deserve many congratulations as they work together to learn more about giant panda health and disease.\nThis veterinary training workshop is one of a series of three workshops focused on developing the Dujiangyan Panda Base into a center of veterinary excellence. Dr. Aitken-Palmer is leading the third and final workshop on laboratory diagnostics in November. SCBI's involvement in all three workshops has been made possible by the Ford Motor Company Fund, Hong Kong Ocean Park Conservation Foundation and the Rubenstein Family.\nAnd finally, a #PandaStory update! We still do not know if Mei Xiang is pregnant or experiencing a pseudopregnancy. It isn't possible to determine if a female is pregnant from monitoring her behavior and hormones alone. Both will mimic a pregnancy even if she is experiencing a pseudopregnancy. Our veterinarians will continue performing ultrasounds twice a week, but they have not seen any evidence of a fetus yet. Mei has started exhibiting behaviors associated with pregnancy/pseudopregnancy. She is not eating as much bamboo as usual, she is sleeping more during the day, and she is nest-building at night. Since our keepers have started noticing changes, our corps of skilled volunteer giant panda behavior watchers are going to start observing Mei very closely. That means that both panda cams may be focused on Mei from time to time. But don't worry, Bao Bao will still be on camera! Even though our behavior watchers will be recording Mei's behavior, we have not moved to 24-hour cub watch yet. That likely will not happen until later this summer, so follow @smithsonianzoo on Instagram!

Additionally, you will get to know more about the other food that a panda can eat.\nKeep on reading to learn more!\nWhat Does A Giant Panda Eat?\nThe entire diet of giant pandas totally depends on bamboo, and it won\u2019t be wrong to say that 99% of the giant pandas\u2019 diet is bamboo. However, there are different species of bamboo in the forests.\nGiant pandas do not eat every species of bamboo, but the most likeable species for pandas are water bamboo, arrow bamboo, black bamboo, and about 20 more other species. Among bamboo, pandas like to eat leaves, shoots, and roots.\nMoreover, the eating habits of giant pandas change with the seasons. During the spring season, they like to eat different kinds of shoots, while in autumn, their entire diet depends on the leaves of bamboo. However, in the winter season, they mainly eat roots.\nGiant pandas usually eat 23 to 40 Kg of bamboo every day. It is because of the very little nutritional value in bamboo. So, they eat a lot to meet their daily energy needs.\nWhat Do Giant Pandas Eat Besides Bamboo?\nGiant pandas not only eat bamboo, but there are other plants and foods that giant pandas eat like vines, apples, green corn, and much more.\nThe following are the giant panda facts you need to know for understanding the diet of giant pandas:\nGiant Pandas Eat Fruit\nThe interesting fact about the diet of giant pandas is that they also like to eat fruits. Not all giant pandas eat fruits, but it is true that captive pandas like to eat fruits like apples.\nNot only this, but most of the captive pandas also like to eat steamed cornbread and panda cakes. However, during the summer season, the diet of captive pandas is ice mixed with the apples to cool them down.\nWhen it comes to the nutrition of giant pandas, great care is required to make sure that the pandas get enough nutrition from the fruits.\nThe food selection process goes through several rounds of examination before feeding to pandas. It is to ensure the health safety of giant pandas.\nIt is now evident that giant pandas eat fruits and other foods like steamed cornbread.\nGiant Pandas Eat Vegetables\nYes, giant pandas can eat vegetables even though their digestive system is better equipped to digest meat.\nSo, why do these giant pandas survive on low nutrient foods like bamboo and vegetables?\nAccording to a study, scientists found that giant pandas expend a low amount of energy daily. The reason behind this is the low levels of physical activity and lower levels of thyroid hormones.\nSo, it won\u2019t be wrong to say that 99% of giant pandas\u2019 diet depends on bamboo and the remaining 1% depend on other foods like vegetables, fruits, and sometimes rodents.\nGiant Pandas Eat Meat\n99% of the giant pandas\u2019 diet depends on bamboo. However, according to the anatomy of their digestive tract, it is evident that giant pandas are able to digest meat.\nWe all know that Tigers can eat meat and Cows cannot; it is because of their different body and digestive structures. However, the anatomy of the giant pandas\u2019 digestive system is unique subject to their diet or food they eat.\nAiluropoda melanoleuca or giant pandas belong to the bear family, which means they are able to digest meat like the other species of the same bear family.\nNow, you might be thinking of why giant pandas only eat bamboo instead of meat. Well, a recent study explains that giant pandas became herbivores about 2.4 million years ago and completely switched their diet to bamboo.\nHowever, with evolution, the anatomy of their digestive tract is still the same \u2013 which means that they are still able to digest meat. Theoretically, giant pandas can eat meat but not grass.\nWhat Do Pandas Drink?\nAnother important fact about giant pandas is that they get most of the water from bamboo and grasses. Giant pandas feed on the shoots of bamboo, which are 90% water.\nHowever, giant pandas need more water than they get from bamboo, so they meet their water needs by drinking fresh water from rivers and streams that fill up by the melting of snow on the top of mountains.\nWhat Do Baby Pandas Eat?\nThe newly born baby pandas rely on their mother\u2019s milk for almost 6 months. After that period, these cute cubs of pandas start eating bamboo and other foods.\nAfter the first birthday, baby pandas weigh more than 75 pounds. Although, the mother still nurses the baby pandas for another 6 months for comfort.\nAfter one-and-a-half or two years, the baby panda is ready to get separated from its mother. However, the baby panda still grows and gains weight. The maximum weight it gains is up to 300 pounds.\nbestofpanda.com/how-much-does-a-giant-panda-weigh/(opens in a new tab)\nSo, after the initial five to six months of baby panda\u2019s birth, the baby panda is able to walk, climb, and eat solid food like bamboo and some fruits.\nPanda-Bear Diets\nAlthough giant pandas and bears relate to the same family, giant pandas are herbivores, and bears are omnivores. Due to the same family of these two animals, there is also a similarity in their digestive system.\nGiant pandas totally rely on bamboo, and sometimes they eat fruits and vegetables as a secondary source of food. On the other hand, bears are omnivores, and they eat meat, unlike giant pandas.\nMoreover, giant pandas also eat according to each season. During the summer season, they feed on the shoots of bamboo, while in the autumn season, they feed on leaves, and in winter, they feed entirely on roots.\nThe pandas living in zoos also like to eat some vegetables and fruits as a snack. Moreover, some wild giant pandas also eat small rodents and pikas as a source of meat.\nRelated Questions About Panda Diet\nAre Giant Pandas Vegetarian?\nYes, you can say these giant pandas are vegetarian because they are herbivores and get 99% of their food from bamboo.\nHowever, it is really interesting to know how pandas changed from eating meat to vegetables and then to only bamboo.\nGiant pandas are highly mysterious animals on the earth because of their dual traits \u2013 both herbivorous and carnivorous. Giant pandas are considered as specialized herbivores that exclusively feed on high fibrous bamboo, despite the fact that they are the descendants of flesh-eating carnivores.\nAccording to new research on the Nutritional Geometry of giant pandas, it is evident that giant pandas have developed some traits relating to herbivores during their evolution for the past millions of years.\nAmong those herbivorous traits, some include teeth, jaw musculature, and a skull that are adapted for fibrous diets. Moreover, a pseud-thumb is another evolution in giant pandas for handling bamboo.\nAdditionally, this research reveals the fact that giant pandas have lost the ability to taste umami, which is usually connected with flesh-eating.\nDo Giant Pandas Eat Apple?\nYes, giant pandas can eat apples, but apples are like a secondary source of food or as a snack for them.\nUsually, when someone mentions giant panda, we come across a cute black and white animal holding a stalk of bamboo in its paws and eating it. No doubt, bamboo is the principal source of food for giant pandas.\nBut when we talk about the captive giant pandas, they also like apples as a snack. It won\u2019t be wrong to say that a sweet red apple is one of the favorite snacks of giant pandas.\nAlthough apples are rich in vitamins and microelements, it is important to undergo a food selection process before feeding apples to giant pandas. Since the giant pandas only rely on bamboo, so great care or precaution is required while changing their diet.\nAnimals experts also suggest that you should feed captive pandas in the morning and afternoon because they have less physical activity and spend most of their time sleeping.\nDo Giant Pandas Eat Carrot?\nYes, giant pandas can eat carrots. The giant pandas living at the zoo eat carrots and other vegetables and fruits like apples, sugar cane, sweet potatoes, a special high-fiber biscuit, rice gruel, and of course, their favorite bamboo.\nNot only this, but there are a lot of videos of giant pandas eating carrots as a piece of evidence. As I mentioned earlier, 99% of the giant pandas\u2019 diet depends on bamboo, and the remaining 1 % depends on other foods like fruits, vegetables, small rodents, and pikas.\nWhat Type of Meat Do Giant Pandas Eat?\nThe giant pandas are usually vegetarian and completely feed on bamboo. But it is also true that giant pandas sometimes hunt for pikas and small rodents as a source of food.\nSo, you can say that giant pandas sometimes eat meat, but that is rare. This trait of the eating meet has been evolved from the ancestral pandas like 2.4 million years ago. Giant pandas relate to the same family as the bear.\nScientists believe that giant pandas have dual-digestive traits, one is herbivorous, and the other is carnivorous. It is because of the anatomy of their digestive system. Although the giant pandas are herbivores, their digestive system is still capable of digesting meat.\nDue to this reason, sometimes giant pandas hunt for small rodents and pikas to feed on them. Moreover, some wild giant pandas are also reported to be seen while eating meat in the northwest region of China.\nThe hidden cameras also captured the images of wild giant pandas eating meat in China. So, it is clear that giant pandas can sometimes eat small rodents and pikas, but their major food source is still bamboo.\nConclusion\nTo summarize, giant pandas\u2019 diet 99% rely on bamboo, and the remaining 1% rely on other foods like fruits, vegetables, small rodents, and pikas.\nI have explained everything relating to the diet of giant pandas in detail. Moreover, you might have understood the evolution of giant pandas and their digestive system in this article.\nSimilarly, this article also includes the diet of small baby pandas and how much time they spend with their mothers.\nThe important and interesting fact about the diet of giant pandas is that the wild pandas usually feed only on bamboo, but on the other hand, captive pandas or pandas living in zoos also eat some other foods like fruits and vegetables as a source of food.\nHowever, proper precaution is required to feed other foods to giant pandas.\nLove our Article?

But it also drew attention to the vulnerability of the country\u2019s giant pandas.\nThe magnitude 8.0 temblor destroyed large swaths of panda habitat, as well as parts of the Wolong Panda Center, a key breeding facility for the vulnerable species. Several pandas died.\nNow, all eyes are back on these iconic animals as the Chinese government creates a supersize national park in their name.\nThe proposed Giant Panda National Park\u2014whose final plan will likely be finalized in fall 2019\u2014spans 10,476 square miles, nearly triple the area of Yellowstone. (Check out three places to see giant pandas in the wild.)\nMost of the land will be in Sichuan Province, home to more than 80 percent of wild pandas. The majority of it is not \u201cnew\u201d\u2014it brings together dozens of established panda reserves and other protected areas containing thousands of plant and animal species, many of them threatened or endangered.\nThe park is the latest bit of good news for the panda: The most recent census, released in 2015, estimated a total wild population of 1,864 bears (not including cubs), up from a low of around 1,200 in the 1980s.\nWhether the higher number is due to better counting methods or true growth is unknown, but in 2016 the International Union for Conservation of Nature went so far as to downgrade the giant panda from \u201cendangered\u201d to \u201cvulnerable.\u201d\nBut the large mammal is still confined to six mountain ranges and split into about 30 groups across western China. Logging, road construction, agriculture, and other human encroachment\u2014plus natural disasters\u2014have degraded the landscape and broken up populations. (Read about efforts to reintroduce pandas into the wild.)\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\nThe new refuge aims to connect fragmented panda habitat and, by doing so, link up bear populations, some of which have fewer than a dozen individuals.\nIt \u201ctakes the long view,\u201d says Bob Tansey, China policy advisor for The Nature Conservancy. \u201cGenerally, pandas are doing well. But what will they need in the future? Connectivity.\u201d\nMaking connections\nTheoretically, the park\u2019s melding together of wild landscapes will improve pandas\u2019 ability to find mates and boost their genetic diversity.\nIt will also give them room to roam as climate change shifts where bamboo\u2014their main food\u2014can grow.\nTo panda expert Marc Brody, designating the national park is a vital step, but it \u201cdoes not directly resolve habitat fragmentation.\u201d\nThe new park has promise on paper, he says, \u201cbut habitat will remain patchy until degraded lands are restored and stronger land-use restrictions get enforced that make wildlife corridors possible.\u201d\n4:16\nIf such corridors become reality, \u201cthat will be the exciting legacy of this park,\u201d says Brody, a National Geographic Explorer and founder of Panda Mountain, an ecotourism and conservation organization.\nUnder new management\nThe need for connectivity applies to the administration of the park as well, which is why, under the new park name, the Chinese government is working to streamline oversight and management of panda conservation areas.\nIn fall 2018, officials established a national administrative bureau to act as the heart of park management; provincial and local reorganizations are set to follow.\nThe master plan will lay out the government\u2019s steps toward more effective conservation, such as consolidation. Previously, protected areas fell into a dozen categories, while numerous government entities managed the lands with no single vision, according to Luo Peng, of the Chengdu Institute of Biology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and an author of the plan.\n\u201cLocal governments, which have local-development priorities, sometimes had too much say over the natural [areas],\u201d he said in an email. \u201cCoordination was not always effective.\u201d (Learn about the dramatic measures taken to get pandas to mate.)\nNow, management of the park will be centralized under the new National Forestry and Grassland Administration, and protected-area designations will be consolidated into fewer categories.\nThis new structure could smooth the rough edges, making potential conflicts between conservation, development interests, and citizens easier to address, Peng says.\nIt should also help support local governments tasked with upholding the rules; critics have long held that China\u2019s protected areas suffer from weak enforcement.\nPrioritizing people\nAccording to Luo Peng, the park will be set up around core protected areas that prohibit farming, grazing, mining, logging, tourism, or other development. (Read why it\u2019s so difficult to photograph pandas.)\nFewer restrictions will apply to \u201cgeneral control zones,\u201d which will allow tourism and some farming and other local activities\u2014but only after \u201crigorous evaluation for environmental impacts,\u201d he says.\nBut Brody notes some proposals for tourism development, such as a railway through the Wolong Nature Reserve, \u201cmay only compound conservation and resource management challenges.\u201d\nFor each new large-scale tourism initiative, experts \u201cneed to examine if it provides a direct benefit to improving habitat for wild pandas,\u201d and if it brings real benefits to local communities, says Brody.\nHistorically, local people have not often benefited from tourism, and by some calculations, as many as 170,000 people live within or near the new park boundaries, according to the Associated Press.\nSee 10 of the Rarest animals on Earth Please be respectful of copyright.

Photograph by Joel Sartore\nAnd while a person\u2019s decision to move appears to be voluntary so far, the Chinese government has a long history of relocating citizens for conservation or development projects.\nJianguo \u201cJack\u201d Liu of Michigan State University\u2014whose research on the human impact on panda habitat is helping inform park planners\u2014says the government is providing financial incentives, like paid college tuition, to people living in affected regions as a way to encourage \u201cnatural relocation.\u201d\nThe approach \u201chas [already] been very successful,\u201d with many youths leaving rural areas for college, technical training, or jobs in cities, he says.\nFor those who don\u2019t want to go, however, \u201cit is critical that villagers get the opportunity to stay on their ancestral lands,\u201d says Brody.\nHe suggests the government could train and employ those citizens to restore degraded panda habitat, replacing exotic-tree plantations with native flora, for example.\nA time for national parks\nChina already has hundreds thousands of protected areas covering about 18 percent of its land surface, but critics say many have lacked proper planning at inception and fail to truly protect biodiversity.\nThat\u2019s why the panda park is one piece of a broader effort to create a national park system in China, modeled in part on the U.S. national parks system.\nAfter President Xi Jinping announced such intentions in December 2013, Chinese delegations visited Yellowstone, Yosemite, and other U.S. parks to kick start their own planning, says Rose Niu, chief conservation officer of the Paulson Institute, a think-tank dedicated to U.S.-China relations that hosted the U.S. park visits.\nNow, eleven new parks (including the panda park) are in their pilot phase, and as many as a hundred others, plus a dozen marine and coastal protected areas, are in consideration, according to Niu.\n\u201cThere\u2019s greater prosperity in China now, and there\u2019s a natural progression toward conservation,\u201d says TNC\u2019s Tansey. \u201cA park system\u2019s time has come.\u201d (See beautiful photos of all 61 U.S. national parks.)\nNiu agrees, noting Chinese policy has shifted in that \u201clocal governments still may prioritize economic growth, but higher up, conservation is winning over development.\u201d\nAnd the guiding principle, she says, \u201cis to engage with local communities and let them benefit from the changing conservation landscape.\u201d\nNow comes the real test of whether the government\u2019s newest aspirations become effective actions, Brody adds.\n\u201cIt\u2019s significant that for [the panda park], the government is specifically targeting habitat rather than focusing solely on the animals,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why this park\u2019s mission really matters.\u201d"}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant Panda Snail - The Australian Museum", "url": "https://australian.museum/learn/animals/molluscs/giant-panda-snail/", "text": "Seasonality\nGiant Panda Snails are active year round, however they are unlikely to be found since they are mostly nocturnal. In addition to this, like other land snails they only forage during or after rain.\nFeeding and diet\nIn the wild this species feeds on the fruiting bodies of fungi on the forest floor, one study found indications that Giant Panda Snails feeding on the fruiting bodies of the fungus Polyporus varius (Order Aphyllophorales). Only part of the snail's foot is exposed and out of the shell while feeding, even the mouth remains hidden while the animal eats.\nThe captive diet for Giant Panda Snails kept at the Australian Museum includes mushrooms, some soft fruit and and an artificial mixture called 'Mollusc Mix' which was originally produced by the Zoological Society of London to raise the endangered Partula Snails of French Polynesia. Mollusc mix is specially formulated to provide protein, vitamins, calcium and other nutrients to snails and slugs which usually feed on fungi and algae in the wild. Additionally, Cuttlebone (the hard internal skeleton of another kind Mollusc; Cuttlefish) is provided as a source of calcium which snails need for healthy shell growth.\nLife history cycle\nGiant Panda Snails begin life as an egg, hatching snails are tiny, hatching from their translucent eggs at about 15mm in length. Young snails grow relatively slowly and may not even double this size within the animal's first year. Like all gastropods the shell of the snail grows in a spiral fashion adding a new ring of calcium carbonate around the opening at each growth stage.\nBreeding behaviours\nGiant Panda Snails are hermaphroditic, meaning that individuals possess both sperm and eggs. Mating occurs over night whereby the two snails exchange sperm to fertilise each others eggs. Fifteen to 20 cream coloured eggs are laid over a period of a few days in a shallow burrow (about 50mm deep) and are left covered with leaf litter. These nest sites have been recorded in open areas, not under logs or amongst tree roots. These eggs are relatively large in size for snails, at around 18mm long and 2g in weight, they are truly giant.\nBreeding in the wild has been recorded in the warm and humid conditions during February, however the species can breed year round in captivity if the right conditions are supplied.\nPredators\nThese relatively large meals are favoured by birds such as the Albert's Lyrebird, Menura alberti, Superb Lyrebird, Menura novaehollandiae, and the Noisy Pitta, Pitta versicolour, which will smash snails open by slamming them down onto a rock acting like an anvil.\nLand snails are host to parasites such as Nematodes (roundworms) which occur within the snail\u2019s digestive system and can be passed on to other hosts.\nReferences\nFurther reading"}

The panda is found in the bamboo forests of south central China. Its distinctive coat is white with black markings around its eyes, ears, and front and back legs.\nThe canine teeth of the panda are pointed like a lion. However, the panda prefers a diet mainly of bamboo instead of meat. Its teeth are designed to chew and crush the thick bamboo, and it can chew more than 3,000 bamboo stalks in one day.\nPandas are very flexible so that they can do amazing twists and turns. They even do somersaults. They were designed with a special wrist bone to keep bamboo stalks in their fingers.\nPandas are generally solitary and do not hibernate in the winter but continue to forage the forest for food. They do not mind the snow at all and have even been observed playing in it.\nBabies are born between July and September, most often in a hollow tree. As many as two babies are born, but generally only one survives. They are very tiny when born but grow rapidly. Baby pandas cannot run, climb trees, or eat bamboo until they are about 7 months old. They will stay with their mother until they are 18 to 20 months old.\nThe panda\u2019s enemies include leopards and wild dogs. Pandas have very powerful jaws and teeth which they use to protect their young.\nThe estimated panda population is fewer than 1,500. Farming and housing have replaced much of its original habitat. Also endangering their population is the bamboo plant itself. From time to time, certain types of bamboo will flower and die, leaving no bamboo for the panda. This has caused many pandas to die of starvation.\nPandas do not survive well in captivity. The first pandas to be shipped to zoos lived only four or five years and died without producing any offspring. It is still rare to see a panda in a zoo and even more rare to see a baby panda.\nGiant Panda\nCarnivora \u2022 Procyonidae \u2022 Ailuropoda melanoleuca\nHeight: 6 feet (1.8 m)\nWeight: 200 pounds (90 kg)\nLength: 5 feet (150 cm)\nLife Span: 26 years\nSpecial Design Feature: Pandas have a very special wrist bone to help keep the bamboo in their fingers.\nDid You Know?

(Must Read!)", "url": "https://bestofpanda.com/are-giant-pandas-dangerous-to-humans/", "text": "Cuddly and lovely that\u2019s how we commonly see pandas in the animal centers or the zoo.\nJust like any other animals, pandas came or originated from the wild and they are part of the bear family. So, if that is the case, are giant pandas dangerous?\nThe quick answer would be, YES. However, every story has two sides that we should know about.\nAfter reading this article, you will know why our lovely and cuddly bears could be dangerous to humans.\nPerhaps, this one is of the most commonly asked questions about pandas.\nBut worry no more, because I am here to provide you with a clear answer to this question. Sounds good?\nLet\u2019s go ahead and find the answer to the following questions about pandas.\nWhy Do Giant Pandas Attack Humans?\nIrritation and threat are the main reasons why a giant panda attacks humans.\nWe are fully aware that the real nature of a panda is solitary, which means they love to be alone and they are comfortable with it.\nBut, why those panda bears in the animal centers do not attack their human nannies?\nLet\u2019s find out the answer.\nThe concept of nature and nurture applies to all living creatures.\nAlthough the natural instinct of any living creature is still there, the environment from where a living creature was raised will affect its behavior too.\nNonetheless, let\u2019s keep in our minds that giant pandas are still wild animals with wild instincts. It means they can attack anyone once they feel they are in danger.\nMoreover, it is simply a natural response to protect yourself from the enemies around you, right?\nThe same is true with the animals like giant pandas. But, there are rare cases of pandas attacking humans for they don\u2019t have any natural enemies.\nIn addition, the giant pandas are very protective of their babies. It means they will protect them no matter what.\nSo, if some humans try to hurt their babies, their maternal instinct will work and will attack them. The same is true with the way humans protect their young ones, right?\nThe giant pandas are known for being one of the cutest animals in the world. They have been loved by many people all around the globe.\nBut, let\u2019s keep in mind that they are still wild animals and approaching them in the wild is a big mistake.\nRecommended Reading: Do Giant Pandas Eat Humans?\nHow Often Do Giant Pandas Attack Humans?\nThe best answer to this question is RARELY. Throughout history, there were rare cases of reported incidents of pandas attacking humans.\nIn fact, they would not exceed the number of your fingers.\nGiant pandas are known to have solitary nature.\nThey love to be alone to the point that they stay miles away from each other and they only meet during their mating season.\nFrom September 2006 to June 2009, there are three recorded incidents of giant panda attacks against humans.\nThe Panda House in Beijing China presented these rare incidents to warn people of the potentially dangerous behavior of giant pandas.\nHas A Giant Panda Ever Killed Anyone?\nThere has been no clear news or incidents where a giant panda has completely killed anyone.\nWhile they have been subjected to part of the potentially dangerous animals, there are no data that show that they have killed any human beings.\nJust like what was mentioned earlier, giant pandas are wild animals.\nYes, they may have turned themselves to be herbivorous animals but still, they are wild and unpredictable animals if you have pushed their buttons.\nLet\u2019s keep in mind that without expert assistance or guidance never ever approach a giant panda.\nSimply because you might irritate or threaten them and they might just give you the worst nightmare you have ever expected to happen.\nLet\u2019s keep our boundaries. Yes, they are cute. But, the possibility of them attacking you is so unpredictable.\nHere is the article that contains sensitive content about humans who were attacked by giant pandas. Viewing this requires parental guidance for very young audiences.\nAre Giant Pandas Friendly?\nPhoto Source: ELLE\nYes, giant pandas are friendly animals. In fact, you can interact with them. But only if they are under human care or they stay in animal facilities with professional panda caregivers.\nWhile it may sound contrasting with the first question, it is real. Are you familiar with the concept of nature vs. nurture? Well, it applies the same principle to pandas.\nIn the wild, you cannot approach a wild panda because it might attack you.\nBasically, a wild panda will attack you because it is his nature to protect themselves when they feel like they are in danger.\nPlus, they are not used to interacting with people, and they might feel threatened by human presence.\nHowever, it is a completely different story if we are talking about the pandas in the animal centers.\nHumans nurtured them. So, they are used to interacting with humans without developing any sense of threat.\nThe pandas in the animal centers are very fond of the nannies who take good care of them. You can also do a lot of interactions with the pandas like feeding, playing, or taking selfies or photos with them.\nThat\u2019s how friendly a panda could be if nurtured by humans.\nHow Deadly Are Panda Bears ?\nPanda Bears, also known as Giant Pandas, can be deadly for some reasons. Let\u2019s go over them one by one.\nGiant Pandas Have Strong Jaws\nYou should never underestimate the biting power of a giant panda. They have very strong jaws and teeth that can crunch a bamboo as if they are just eating a crunchy biscuit.\nWhat more if they will bite our soft flesh, right?\nMoreover, the large physique of giant pandas also includes large teeth and strong jaws. This means they possess powerful jaws that are equipped with thick and heavy muscles on the top of their skulls.\nThey also have the sagittal crest, which gives them incredible jaw strength.\nYou can check this article that talks about a detailed explanation of how strong panda jaws could be.\nGiant Pandas Have Sharp Paws\nTheir paws may be soft and lovely to touch when they are babies, but definitely not when they are fully grown.\nThey definitely have sharp paws that can rip your skin and flesh like Wolverine. So, if you have irritated a panda, get ready to face a lot of scratches and bloody cuts.\nFurthermore, the giant pandas are part of the bear family. The bears like grizzly and polar bears are known for their strong biting power and sharp claws or paws.\nThe danger that their sharp paws may cause is off the chart.\nThose are enough reasons to consider a panda dangerous. And that is why it is highly prohibited to approach a panda in the wild.\nOn the other hand, pandas that grew up in animal centers are not that dangerous.\nJust like what was mentioned earlier about the concept of nature and nurture, the creature\u2019s behavior depends on his environment.\nFrequently Asked Questions:\nHere are some of the most frequently asked questions about giant pandas. We already provided you with relevant answers.\nSounds great? Let\u2019s go over them one by one.\nDo Giant Pandas Bite?\nYes, giant pandas do bite. They have strong jaws and teeth to bite and crush bamboo. So, they definitely bite.\nBut do pandas bite humans? In history, there are few recorded incidents about it. Just like what was mentioned, if they feel threatened, they might attack you as their natural reaction to what they consider as danger.\nNonetheless, pandas are herbivores so the fear that they will bite because they want to eat you is far from reality.\nThey rather stay in the forest and eat as much bamboo as they want than eat humans.\nCan You Pet A Panda?\nYou cannot pet a panda. Here is the main reason why you simply can\u2019t do it.\n\u201cPandas are not pets and they are not for sale.\u201d\nNo matter how much money you have, you cannot buy a giant panda. All of them are properties of China. Buying them would be against the law of China.\nMoreover, if there are people who are offering you to have a panda as your pet, do not accept it. That is definitely a scam, and you should report it because it is illegal.\nOn the other hand, you can rent them. You just have to pay $1,000,000 every year.\nPlus, you should have a qualified facility and a massive amount of bamboo food supply that would cost you 0,000 a year.\nTo know more about the true cost of a panda read this article.\nCan I Adopt A Panda?\nYes! You can actually apply for adoption. You may be asking HOW, right? If they are not for sale how come they are open for adoption?\nThis instance is called symbolic adoption. It is where you can apply for adoption but you cannot really have them physically at home. They will stay in China under the care of panda experts.\nIt\u2019s more likely a donation drive wherein you are given recognition as the adoptive parents of the pandas in China.\nDoes that mean you can\u2019t really see or touch them? Well, you can. If you go to China. But the interaction you will have with the pandas depends on the level of adoption you applied for.\nThe higher the level is the more interaction you would have.\nIf you would ask me, I suggest that you buy the best panda stuffed animals online instead. You can have it all you want, with no restrictions at all.\nEven if you want to hug it while you sleep, there will be no trouble at all.\nTo know the best panda stuff animals that you can buy online you can check this article.

Moreover, you found out that they can never be a pet.\nDomesticated animals stay with humans in their daily living. It includes the dogs and cats that are usually found at home. These animals are meant to live with humans, unlike the other animals like lions and more.\nOn the other hand, even if they go along with humans there are still incidents where they attack people. What more for the wild animals like pandas that always want to be alone, right?\nEven humans would attack other humans if they feel like they are in danger. So the nature of attacking others to protect oneself is quite normal and very evident to all living creatures.\nSo if you will ask me for the last time if pandas are dangerous, I will say NO. They want to live peacefully in nature.\nLet\u2019s respect each other\u2019s territory to avoid any form of danger.\nWhat do you think of this article?

The name \u201carse-feet\u201d was used for any bird that had its feet close to its rear, although it originally applied to the little grebe, a type of water bird that is still known as the arsefoot.\nThe penguin was first described in the 16th century when Admiral Francis Fletcher referred to it as \u201cfowle,\u201d although he noted that the Welsh called it Pengwin. Pengwin is believed to have been from the Latin pinguis (\u201cplump, dense, or fatty\u201d) and referred to the animal\u2019s plump stature. Otherwise, it may have been a variant spelling of the Welsh pen gwyn (\u201cwhite head\u201d), which originally referred to the now extinct great auk.\nIf this is so, then it means that the great auk (which resembled the penguin) lost its name to the penguin. The penguin and the great auk are not the only animals mired in a naming controversy. Here are 10 other animals that used to be called something else.

Rather, it is the lesser-known guinea fowl that was named after Turkey.\nThe guinea fowl is native to Africa and was introduced into Europe through the Ottoman Empire, a now-defunct empire that included today\u2019s Turkey. Europeans called the guinea fowl \u201cturkey cock\u201d or \u201cturkey hen\u201d because they thought it was from Turkey.\nWhen Europeans arrived in North America, they sent today\u2019s turkey back to Europe. It looked so similar to the Ottoman Empire turkey that they also started calling it turkey. It later maintained the name while the original turkey was renamed after Guinea, the West African empire where it was originally found.\nIn some other languages, the turkey is named after the region from which it supposedly originated. Its Portuguese name means \u201cPeru bird\u201d while its Malay name means \u201cDutch chicken.\u201d In Turkey, it is called hindi (\u201cIndian\u201d). However, in France, it is called coq d\u2019Inde (\u201crooster of India\u201d), which has been shortened to dinde. Both names came about because America used to be confused for India at that time.\n9 Turtle (Sea Turtle)\nFormerly Called Marine Tortoise\nTurtle and Tortoise Differences\nWatch this video on YouTube\nBefore we delve into this fact, it is important that we know the difference between a tortoise and a turtle. Without going into scientific details, tortoises and turtles can be easily distinguished just by looking at them.\nTortoises have big, dome-like shells as well as short legs and feet. Meanwhile, turtles have flatter, streamlined shells and bodies as well as flippers and webbed feet. Tortoises are terrestrial animals. However, turtles are aquatic animals, although they lay their eggs on land.\nHowever, their differences could understandably become confusing when we realize that some turtles live on land and are called tortoises. The turtle and tortoise problem becomes even more confusing because all tortoises are technically turtles. When we decide to call both animals turtles, it is advisable to refer to the land-dwelling tortoise as a land turtle while the sea-dwelling turtle should be called a sea turtle.\nThe confusion between turtles and tortoises has been going on for centuries. In the past, sea turtles or turtles (if we\u2019re calling the land-dwelling variant, tortoise) were called \u201cmarine tortoises.\u201d The name is from either the French tortue (\u201cturtle\u201d) or tortre (\u201ctortoise\u201d).\nIt is important that we know the difference between the tortoise and the turtle so that we don\u2019t repeat the action of the lady who threw a tortoise into a pond, thinking it was a turtle. She must have killed the poor animal that she thought she was saving.\n8 Cheetah And Leopard\nCheetahs Were Formerly Called Leopards And Leopards Were Formerly Called Pards\nCheetahs were originally called leopards, while leopards were called pards. Cheetahs were called leopards because they were thought to be the hybrid offspring of a lion (leo) and a pard (today\u2019s leopard). The pard, which originally referred to leopard, is from the Latin pardus (\u201cmale panther\u201d).\nThe cheetah got its own name in 1704 when the Hindi chita, which ironically means \u201cleopard,\u201d was introduced into English. The Hindi chita is from the Sanskrit chitraka, which means \u201chunting leopard\u201d although it also referred to \u201ctiger.\u201d\nThe confusion between the naming of the leopard and the cheetah is not yet over because cheetahs are still called \u201chunting leopards.\u201d\n7 Killer Whale\nFormerly Called Whale Killers\nKiller whales are also called orcas. Despite their name, they\u2019re not whales but dolphins. Their original name didn\u2019t even try to pass them off as whales. They were originally called \u201cwhale killers\u201d by sailors who had observed them preying on much bigger marine animals, especially whales. Whale killer was later reversed to form the better-sounding killer whale. In Spanish, they are called ballena asesina (\u201cassassin whale\u201d).\nThe name \u201corca\u201d could either be from the Latin orca (large-bellied pot or jar) or orc- (\u201cwhale\u201d). The scientific name is Orcinus orca. Orcinus means \u201cbelonging to Orcus.\u201d Orcus was the Roman god of the underworld. It is believed that the name was given to these animals because of their aggressive and daring method of hunting.\n6 Rabbit\nFormerly Called Coney\nThe animals called rabbits today were originally called coneys. At the same time, the term \u201crabbit\u201d specifically referred to a young coney, which we now call kit or kitten. \u201cConey\u201d was derived from conis, the plural of the Anglo-French conil, which means \u201clong-eared rabbit.\u201d\n\u201cRabbit\u201d overtook \u201cconey\u201d sometime in the 19th century when \u201cconey\u201d acquired some other meanings. Specifically, \u201cconey\u201d had become a variant spelling of cunny, which meant \u201cc\u2014nt.\u201d\nConey wasn\u2019t entirely removed from the English language because it already appeared in the Bible. So, the pronunciation was changed from rhyming with \u201choney\u201d and \u201cmoney\u201d to rhyming with \u201cboney.\u201d\nIt is believed that New York\u2019s Coney Island was named after coney (the original name for rabbits) because it had a large rabbit population. The Dutch were the first to land on the island, and they called it \u201cConey Eylant.\u201d\n5 Red Panda\nFormerly Called Panda\nRed pandas are the original pandas. The name is believed to have been from the Nepalese nigalya ponya (\u201cbamboo eater\u201d). Classification problems and the previous (but erroneous) belief that the giant panda (which also goes by the name \u201cpanda\u201d) was related to the red panda made the red panda lose its name to its supposedly older brother.\nThe giant panda and the red panda were believed to belong to the same family. They were also thought to be closely related to bears and raccoons. Both animals were only proven to be unrelated in 2000. However, the red panda never got its name back.\nThe red panda was almost called the \u201cwha.\u201d It was first described in 1821 by Major General Thomas Hardwicke who wanted it to be called \u201cwha\u201d because it made calls that sounded like \u201cwha.\u201d\nHowever, French zoologist Frederic Cuvier had already described and named the red panda by the time Hardwicke\u2019s paper was published six years later. Cuvier also gave the red panda its scientific name, Ailurus fulgens (\u201cred shining cat\u201d).\n4 Panda\nFormerly Called Parti-Colored Bear\nAs we already mentioned, red pandas were the original pandas. If that is so, then shouldn\u2019t giant pandas have been called something else? Sure! Giant pandas were called parti-colored bears. Again, the name is of Nepalese origin, although the English language borrowed it from French. The giant panda was first described in 1901 even though it was first seen by a Westerner in 1869.\nThe giant panda was already known by the 20th century, although it still remained unseen. A Popular Science magazine from September 1920 featured a picture of the giant panda, which it called the \u201craccoon bear.\u201d It stated that the giant panda was related to the raccoon despite being the size of a black bear.\n3 Giraffe\nFormerly Called Camelopard\nA giraffe was called a camelopard or a cameleopard until the late 19th century when it took the name \u201cgiraffe.\u201d Camelopard is from the Greek kamelopardalis, which came from the merger of kamelos (\u201ccamel\u201d) and pardalis (\u201cleopard\u201d).\nThe Greek gave the animal this name because they thought it resembled a camel and a leopard. Some even believed that a giraffe was the offspring of a camel and leopard.\nThe term \u201cgiraffe\u201d was first used in the 16th century. It is from the French girafe, which is from the Arabic zarafa (which itself is believed to be from the Persian zurnapa). The Persian zurnapa is the merger of two words: zurna (\u201cflute\u201d) and pa (\u201cleg\u201d), which referred to the giraffe\u2019s long legs.\nThe giraffe still maintains its supposed camel-leopard hybrid origins. Its scientific name is Giraffa camelopardalis.\n2 Duck-Billed Platypus\nFormerly Called Duck Mole Or Water Mole\nThe duck-billed platypus (aka platypus) was originally called \u201cduck mole\u201d or \u201cwater mole.\u201d Both names were derived from the belief that it was some kind of amphibious mole. This shouldn\u2019t be surprising because the platypus generated a lot of curiosity after its discovery.\nIn 1799, biologist George Shaw received a preserved sample and suspected that it was the handiwork of some taxidermists who were up to some pranks. He\u2014or anyone else for that matter\u2014definitely wasn\u2019t ready for a strange animal with a duck bill, cat skin, and beaver tail.\nIt also had webbed feet and claws. When it was discovered to be real, there was confusion over whether the platypus was a mammal, a bird, a reptile, or a different kind of animal entirely.\nIn 1793, Australian Governor John Hunter believed that the platypus was the product of a series of matings between all the animals it resembled. Meanwhile, David Collins called it an \u201camphibious creature of the mole kind\u201d in 1797. Today, we know that the platypus is an egg-laying mammal.\n1 Walrus\nFormerly Called Morse, Sea Cow, And Sea Elephant\nThe walrus was originally called morse, although it was sometimes called the sea cow or sea elephant. Today, sea elephant is another name for elephant seal while sea cow (or Steller\u2019s sea cow) refers to a now-extinct large mammal that used to live around the shores of the Komandor Islands in the Bering Sea. The sea cow was hunted into extinction in the 18th century, 30 years after it was discovered.\nThe origin of the name \u201cwalrus,\u201d which first appeared in the 1600s, is somewhat murky. Its etymology was researched for the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary by J.R.R. Tolkien (of The Lord of the Rings fame) between 1919 and 1920.\nTolkien concluded that \u201cwalrus\u201d was derived from the Dutch walros or walrus, which came from hrosshvalr (\u201chorse whale\u201d). Hrosshvalr is believed to have originally referred to a whale and not a walrus. But the Dutch switched the words so that it became \u201cwhale horse\u201d in Dutch. Alternatively, the name could be from the Old English horschwael (\u201chorse-whale\u201d) or the German rosswal."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant Panda National Park (Official GANP Park Page)", "url": "https://national-parks.org/china/giant-panda", "text": "Giant Panda National Park is located in Central China stretching across Sichuan, Ningxia, and Shaanxi provinces. The national park is in development and will encompass 67 existing panda reserves.\nThe giant panda is an iconic symbol of China and one of the most adorable creatures across the globe. This national park features a population of 1,864 giant pandas. The national park accounts for 80% of the Chinese giant panda population. Apart from the small number of pandas located in zoos around the world, all other giant pandas are found within China.\nConnecting the 67 existing reserves and establishing protected areas between them allows the pandas to navigate between the different regions and hopefully crossbreed and strengthen the panda population. This stipe is an investment in the panda population and a focused effort to help the species thrive.\nPhotos Giant Panda National Park Photo Gallery\nHighlights\nGiant pandas are often one of the highlights of zoos that are fortunate enough to display these beautiful creatures. They are probably the most popular wildlife species within and of China\u2019s animal diversity.\nAccordingly, the giant panda is the highlight of the park as well. The mountainous and forested landscapes are only enhancements to the giant panda and wilderness experience.\nGiant Panda\nThe Giant Panda is probably considered one of the cutest of all bear species. It is not hard to find videos of giant pandas on Youtube and other video sources of giant pandas playing in the snow, rolling around, and just apparently being goofy. People often characterize them as the playful bears.\nThe giant panda is renowned for its black and white coloring. The predominantly white head is highlighted by black patches around the eyes as well as black pointy ears. The arms and legs are usually all black with the main part of the body displaying white fur. You might say they are large furry dominoes.\nAdult giant pandas typically reach a length between 3 feet 11 inches to just over 6 feet (1.2 - 1.8 m). The males can weigh as much as 350 lbs (160 kg) while females are smaller weighing as little as 150 lbs (70 kg) although usually closer to 220 lbs (110 kg).\nThe giant panda is like the otter in that it seems like it is always playing even when it comes to eating. The favorite food is bamboo and it will eat between 20 to 30 lbs (9 to 14 kg) a day.\nGiant Panda National Park Trails\nThe trails of the national park are not known at this time. If hiking opportunities are part of the national park, we will update you here on the more popular trail options. The larger national park is still in development and we are confident that walking safaris and hiking will be part of the adventure offered in the national park.\nPark Protection\nThe combination of these over 60 panda reserves is a dedicated commitment by the Chinese government to invest and protect these magnificent creatures. The good news is there is evidence that it appears that the population is growing. The IUCN has upgraded the species from endangered to threatened. Although this improvement is positive, there is much the world needs to do to help secure the survival of the species."}

She holds a B.A. in Creative Writing and English.\n10 Things You Probably Didn't Know About Pandas Jennifer Wilber\nPandas: Misunderstood Gentle Giants\nPandas have long captivated children and adults alike. These gentle giants are one of the most iconic exotic animals around the world, despite their status as an endangered species. Though these animals are well loved, there are many things about these creatures that may surprise you. Though they seem docile and simple, there are many surprising facts about these gentle giants that you might not have known.\nPandas are well-known for their distinctive black and white markings. PixaBay\nIt Took Scientists Years to Discover Why Pandas are Black and White\nFor years, scientists didn\u2019t have an answer for what caused the unusual black and white coloring of giant pandas. In 2017, scientists finally figured out that their coloring is the result of a low-calorie diet that requires pandas to stay active year-round, rather than hibernating like most other bear species. Pandas are unable to molt quickly enough to change their fur color to blend into different types of surroundings, so their black and white pattern is an evolutionary compromise to help them to blend into different backgrounds throughout the year.\nThe black markings on their heads also help pandas to communicate with each other. The black markings on their faces may help pandas to recognize each other, and their black ears may help them to communicate aggression to would-be predators.\nThough pandas don't hibernate, they do spend much of their day sleeping. PixaBay\nPandas Don\u2019t Hibernate\nUnlike most other bears, pandas do not hibernate. Though they sleep for 12 hours a day, they cannot use hibernation to escape cold winters the way other bears can. Pandas\u2019 diets do not consist of enough fat to allow them to hibernate during the winter. Because of their low-fat diets, pandas have relatively little body fat, despite their pleasantly plump appearance. Rather than burrowing into caves or dens the way most bears do at the first sign of winter\u2019s approach, pandas simply find a comfortable spot to relax, and do the thing they do best: eat bamboo.\nBecause pandas live in mountainous regions, they are able to simply migrate to the elevations that have the most comfortable temperatures for them throughout the year. During the hot summer months, pandas move to higher elevations where the temperatures remain cooler. During colder winter months, they return to lower, warmer elevations and continue foraging for bamboo.\nPandas love bamboo, even though their digestive systems are ill-designed to process a vegetarian diet. Panda\nPandas Are Ill-Equipped to Eat Bamboo, and Do Sometimes Eat Meat\nThough pandas\u2019 diets consist of 99% bamboo, a panda's digestive system is more like that of a carnivore than an herbivore. Even though panda\u2019s favorite food is bamboo, their digestive systems are notoriously bad at processing this food source. Because of this, much of what a panda eats is passed as waste. To make up for this inefficiency, panda's must consume around 40 pounds of bamboo each day.\nPandas do, occasionally, eat meat. While they won\u2019t hunt down their own prey, they also won\u2019t turn down meat when given the opportunity to partake. In the wild, pandas may eat birds, rodents, and carrion. Pandas in captivity have been known to eat eggs and fish when offered.\nPandas spend most of their time looking for food and eating. PixaBay\nPandas Spend Most of Their Time Eating or Looking for Food\nPandas spend 10-16 hours a day foraging and eating. The rest of the day is mostly spent sleeping. Because pandas derive so little nutrition from their preferred food, they must eat massive amounts of bamboo each day to survive. Because pandas have short digestive tracts and lack special bacteria and protozoans that herbivores use to break down the cellulose in plants, pandas barely received any nutrition from bamboo, despite having evolved a culinary preference for this plant. To make up for this lake of nutritional absorption from bamboo, each panda eats, on average, about 40 pounds of bamboo every day, which takes up much of its waking life.\nIn addition to eating massive amounts of bamboo, pandas spend much of the rest of their days asleep in order to conserve energy. Because they don\u2019t get much energy or nutrition from bamboo, pandas must conserve what energy they have by sleeping for much of the day.\nMother pandas often crush their tiny babies under their own body weight. PixaBay\nMother Pandas Won\u2019t Win Any \u201cMother of the Year\u201d Awards\nIf a mother panda has twins, usually only one of the cubs will survive in the wild. The mother panda can only produce enough milk for one cub, so she will select the stronger of the twin cubs and allow the other to die. Even in zoos, mother pandas have a natural instinct to abandon one of their babies when they have twins, caring for only the stronger of the two. Because pandas are so endangered, zoos must take special precautions to ensure the survival of every panda cub. When twin panda cubs are born, zoos rotate the two babies between the mother and an incubator, switching the cubs every few hours.\nIf purposely abandoning their babies wasn\u2019t bad enough, it also isn\u2019t uncommon for mother pandas to accidentally crush their cubs under their own body weight. Newborn panda cubs weigh only three-five ounces at birth, 1/900th of the size of their 200-pound mothers. Sometimes mother pandas will accidentally crush their tiny babies as the babies nurse. In the wild, most baby pandas die from disease or from being crushed by their mothers.\nBaby pandas don't become cute until they are several weeks old. PixaBay\nBaby Pandas Barely Look Like Pandas at Birth\nPanda cubs are born pink, blind, and toothless. Newborn pandas have only a few hairs and are mostly bald. Weighing only three to five ounces, newborn giant pandas don\u2019t exactly live up to their species\u2019 name.\nA week or two after birth, the baby panda's skin will turn grey where the fur will eventually become black. Black hairs soon begin to grow during this stage. A chemical reaction from the mother panda's saliva may cause the cub's fur to turn slightly pink. About a month after birth, the color pattern of the baby panda's fur will become fully developed.\nBy three weeks, panda cubs begin to look more like miniature versions of their mothers. Their black markings are more apparent, and their eyes begin to open.\nPandas aren't interested in mating with each other. PixaBay\nPandas Aren\u2019t Interested in Mating\nPandas in captivity seem to have little interest in mating. This has led to scientists taking extreme measures to attempt to get pandas to reproduce, such as showing them videos of panda's mating and giving the male pandas \u201cenhancement\u201d medications. Many male pandas in captivity don\u2019t seem to understand how to mate, and it is difficult to get two pandas together without them attempting to kill each other, as they are very solitary animals.\nTo further complicate things, Female pandas only ovulate once every year and are only fertile for two or three days during this time. Because it is difficult to get pandas to mate naturally, zookeepers often have to resort to artificial insemination. It is difficult for zookeepers to know if a female panda is pregnant until she is about ready to give birth. Pandas have no set term for their pregnancies and may be pregnant for anywhere from three to six months. Because adult pandas are so big and baby pandas are so small, it is difficult to see panda fetuses on an ultrasound. Female pandas produce the same hormones whether they are pregnant or not.\nPandas prefer to be left alone. PixaBay\nPandas Live a Lonely Life\nPandas are generally solitary creatures. Adult pandas have their own defined territory and females are not tolerant of other females in their territory. Because it is so difficult for pandas to eat enough food to meet their energy requirements, adult pandas prefer to have their own territory, and are not welcoming of other pandas who may try to compete with them for food. Pandas may, however, communicate periodically via scent marks, calls, and occasional meetings in the wild. For the most part, though, pandas prefer to keep to themselves.\nPandas are bears, though they share some similarities with raccoons. PixaBay\nAt First, Scientists Weren\u2019t Sure if Pandas Were Bears or Raccoons\nFor years, there was much debate amongst scientists as to whether giant pandas were more closely related to bears or to raccoons. While pandas share many characteristics of bears, they also have some traits in common with raccoons. The bear family and the racoon family are closely related. Recent DNA evidence has shown that giant pandas are more closely related to other bears than to racoons (red pandas, on the other hand, are now known to be more closely related to raccoons). Some people, however, still believe that pandas should be considered their own separate family.\nEvery panda in the world is owned by China. PixaBay\nEvery Panda in the World Outside of China is on Loan from China\nEvery captive panda in zoos outside of China is owned by the Chinese government and is displayed in the foreign country on loan. Pandas are China\u2019s national symbol, and the country is very protective of this endangered species. China lends its pandas to zoos in other countries as a gesture of goodwill. The first giant panda to leave China was named Su-Lin, who arrived at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago in 1936.\nPandas love to eat and sleep, and dislike mating and socializing. PixaBay\nGiant Panda Preservation\nThough scientists and zoo keepers are doing everything they can to reestablish panda populations, pandas are notoriously difficult to breed. There are many strange characteristics about giant pandas that contribute to their declining populations, including their lack of interest in mating, their strange dietary preferences, their fragility at birth, and their solitary natures. Pandas are often misunderstood, but as scientists learn more about these majestic creatures, perhaps their numbers in the wild and in captivity can rise.\nResearch Sources\nnpr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123132770?storyId=123132770\nlivescience.com/58206-why-pandas-are-black-and-white.html\nanimals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/panda-hibernation.htm\npandafacts.org/\nsmithsonianmag.com/smart-news/breeding-pandas-insanely-hard-1-180956401/\nscienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=358\nQuestions & Answers\nQuestion: What is the oldest panda that lived or is living?\nAnswer: The oldest known panda was 38 years old when she passed away. Jia Jia, who was held in captivity at Ocean Park in Hong Kong, was put to sleep in 2016 after her health rapidly declined. The average lifespan of a wild panda is about 20 years, but they can live much longer in captivity with humans caring for them.\nQuestion: Can a panda drink too much water?\nAnswer: It's possible since even humans can experience water intoxication when drinking too much water, but it is extremely rare. It is highly unlikely that a wild animal like a panda would drink too much water, since their natural instincts would prevent overindulgence. Thirsty pandas seek water from rivers, streams, melting snow, and rainfall. Their favorite food, bamboo, can contain up to 90% water in new shoots.\nQuestion: Are pandas quiet?\nAnswer: Pandas are typically quiet, solitary creatures, though they are capable of making a number of noises and vocalizations to communicate with one another. Pandas are able to make squeaking, growling, barking, and huffing sounds.\n\u00a9 2018 Jennifer Wilber\nEmily kitty on November 30, 2019:\nHi can i ask a qustion how many fingers do pandas have\na kid doing an assingnment on pandas on November 06, 2019:\ndo male pandas leave their wife after mating?\nteanatoney on August 26, 2019:\nwhy do pandas eat bamboo and not anything else.

But, after decades of intensive conservation programs, pandas are no longer endangered .\nWith a relatively small population though, pandas are not out of the woods -- or the bamboo forest -- just yet.\nThe biggest threat to the wild panda population is habitat loss. Its reliance on bamboo for sustenance has made the species particularly vulnerable to environmental changes, and China's rapid urban development over the past century has pushed pandas into a fraction of their historic range . And while around 54% of its wild habitat is protected, these areas are still vulnerable to natural disasters, such as wildfires.\nNow, conservationists hope that smart tech can help to safeguard the panda's future.\nTo protect panda habitat the \"Digital Panda System,\" developed in a joint venture between the Sichuan Forest and Grassland Administration and Chinese tech giant Huawei, was deployed across forest and grasslands in Sichuan province in February 2021. The instant reporting system helps to detect wildfires in hard-to-reach areas, alerting rangers and fire departments so they can intervene quickly, as well as monitoring wildlife.\nMeanwhile, another smart technology -- facial recognition -- could help identify individual pandas more accurately. To the human eye, their fur-covered faces all look the same, but computer algorithms are able to distinguish the differences.\n\"Digital technology will play a greater role in biodiversity (and) conservation in the future,\" says Zhao Jian, a solutions expert at Huawei's Sichuan office who oversaw the development of the Digital Panda System.\nA \"Digital Panda System\"\nThe system collects data from 596 cameras, 45 infrared cameras, drones and satellites, which it stores in the cloud. Conservationists and researchers use this data to monitor, track and study wildlife, as well as detect wildfire hotspots.\nJUST WATCHED Smart tech is helping to protect China's giant pandas Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Smart tech is helping to protect China's giant pandas 04:27\nBecause the cameras are used in remote areas where there is little or no power supply, the system is solar powered and uses microwave transmission, which doesn't require cables and is more reliable in complex terrain, says Zhao.\nAccording to Huawei, the system assists 140,000 forest rangers, grassland managers, conservationists and researchers in Sichuan. In its first five months of operations, it detected 651 wildfire hot spots, reducing forest fires by 71.6% compared to the same period the previous year, according to Huawei.\nDespite its name, the Digital Panda System offers protection to more than just pandas, says Zhao. The system covers the Sichuan section of the newly established Giant Panda National Park -- an area of nearly 10,500 square miles that connects 67 reserves across three provinces. The park is home to most of China's 1,800 wild pandas -- along with a further 8,000 animal and plant species , including endangered animals such as red pandas and the golden snub-nosed monkey.\nThe new Giant Panda National Park is expected to benefit other endangered species too, like the golden snub-nosed monkey (pictured).\nZhao says that in the future, the Digital Panda System could be extended across the sections of the national park that lie in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, creating more \"success stories\" for other endangered species.\nA growing population\nWhile pandas are no longer endangered according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), their population is still considered vulnerable and numbers in the wild have not yet recovered to their pre-1980 level.\nBut captive breeding efforts could help to boost the population. The Chengdu Panda Base in Sichuan province, has been leading the way in panda conservation and breeding since it opened in 1987 with just six sick and starving pandas. The base is now home to more than 200 pandas, and through partnerships with other zoos and reserves, the global captive population stood at 673 in October 2021, says Hou Rong, deputy director at the Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Research Base.\nThis video shows the Digital Panda System capturing a wild panda for the first time in August 2021. Credit: Sichuan Administration of Giant Panda National Park, Sichuan Provincial Bureau of Forestry and Grassland, and Huawei\nTechnology such as IVF has been vital in efforts to increase panda numbers, while GPS has been used to track and monitor the few captive pandas that have been released into the wild.\nNow, smart tech offers \"new tools and possibilities,\" says Hou, and could help conservationists return even more pandas to their natural habitat.\n\"My colleagues are working on the protection, recovery, and monitoring of their local habitats,\" she says. \"We are also exploring the rewilding of giant pandas.\"\nPicking a panda out of a lineup\nHou hopes that smart tech can help to solve a major daily challenge for researchers: identifying individual pandas.\n\"Even at the giant panda base, no staff member knows all of the individuals,\" she says.\nCurrently, microchips are embedded in pandas' necks to identify individuals, allowing researchers to track important health information like vaccinations. But this method is invasive, requiring the carer to get up close with a card reader and it can interfere with the panda's daily activities, says Hou.\nHou has worked with a team for five years to develop a facial recognition system for pandas. The algorithm was tested and refined using a database of over 6,400 images taken from 218 pandas in captivity.\nConservationists hope that smart technology will give a more accurate idea of wild panda population numbers.\nEach panda has a unique facial structure and hair pattern, says Pranjal Swarup, co-author of the panda facial recognition study . \"(We) are unable to recognize and memorize finer facial features, even in humans,\" says Swarup. But for computers, which can pick up on slight differences and convert them into a numerical system, recognizing individual pandas is much easier, he adds.\nFacial recognition could help researchers build a more accurate picture of the number of pandas in the wild, too, says Swarup. Currently, population surveys -- conducted every decade since 1974 -- are carried out on foot, with the latest in 2014 involving 2,000 people, examining 4.36 million hectares of land over three years.\n\"These tools are definitely going to support us in doing this (conservation) work better,\" says Hou."}

Challenge your animal awareness with this quiz.\nBears are generally omnivorous, but dietary preferences range from seals for the entirely carnivorous polar bear to assorted vegetation for the largely herbivorous spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus). The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) eats only bamboo . Usually gaining weight beforehand, most bears sleep fitfully through much of the winter, but they do not truly hibernate . Despite their bulk, most bears climb with ease and swim strongly.\nNatural history\nUrsids are mainly animals of northern temperate regions and are found farther north than any other mammal. The Arctic fox is found as far north on land, but the polar bear regularly roams on sea ice hundreds of kilometres from shore. Africa and Australia lack bears entirely. The spectacled bear of South America\u2019s Andes Mountains is the only bear species that lives south of the Equator.\nWatch young male polar bears displaying their strength as they wait for Hudson Bay to freeze so they can hunt for food on the ice Learn about young polar bears testing their strength. Contunico \u00a9 ZDF Enterprises GmbH, Mainz See all videos for this article\nAlthough clumsy in appearance, bears can move surprisingly fast, even through dense cover that would seriously impede a human or a horse. Their senses of sight and hearing, however, are poorly developed, and most hunting is done by smell. Some, such as black bears and spectacled bears, are strong climbers, and all are strong swimmers, most notably the polar bear. Bears do not generally communicate by sound and usually are quiet, but they do growl at times when feeding, when being challenged by another bear or by humans, and when competing for mates.\nspectacled bear The spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus) of South America's Andes Mountains is the only bear species that lives south of the Equator.

Ants, bees, seeds of trees, roots, nuts, berries, insect larvae such as grubs, and even the dainty dogtooth violet are eaten. Many bears relish honey, and the sun bear is sometimes called the \u201choney bear\u201d because of this. Prey taken by bears includes rodents, fish, deer, pigs, and seals. Grizzlies (a North American subspecies of the brown bear, Ursus arctos) are known for their skillful fishing during the spawning runs of salmon. The polar bear\u2019s diet is dictated by the Arctic environment, as little vegetation grows within its range. The Asian sloth bear (Melursus ursinus) delights especially in raiding and destroying termite nests, sucking up termites and larvae with its funnel-like lips. The giant panda has a special bone formation of the forefoot that functions as a sixth digit; it is opposable to the other five and thus is useful in handling bamboo.\nsun bear (Helarctos malayanus) Sun bears (Helarctos malayanus) inhabit Southeast Asia and the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo. Anthony Mercieca\u2014Root Resources/EB Inc. sloth bear Sloth bears (Melursus ursinus) are primarily found in India, and their geographic range extends from northern India and Nepal southward to Sri Lanka and eastward to Bangladesh. Bucky Reeves\u2014The National Audubon Society Collection/Photo Researchers\nMost bears, including the American and Asiatic black bears (Ursus americanus and U. thibetanus), eat large amounts of food before entering a den for a period of deep sleep during the winter. The polar bear digs a den in the snow, whereas grizzlies build large mounds of dirt in front of their dens. Bears, however, lack the physiological characteristics (lower heart rate, body temperature, breathing rate, and blood pressure) exhibited by animals that truly hibernate.\nAsiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) The range of the Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) extends from southern Iran to eastern Asia. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. American black bear American black bears (Ursus americanus) are found throughout North America as far south as central Mexico. Leonard Lee Rue III\nWatch polar bear cubs leaving their den, emerging into the outside world for the first time Polar bear cubs leaving their den for the first time. Contunico \u00a9 ZDF Enterprises GmbH, Mainz See all videos for this article\nMale polar bears sometimes congregate, but otherwise bears are solitary except during the mating season. Then they tend to congregate, pair off, and mate in seclusion. The male leaves the female soon after mating and plays no role in raising the young. Gestation periods vary, the fertilized egg remaining dormant in the uterus (delayed implantation), which ensures the birth of young while the female is in the winter den and guarantees that the cubs will emerge from the den in the spring, when food is abundant. Ursids breed once per year at most, and many bears breed only every two to four years. The breeding season is usually in late spring or early summer. Delayed implantation results in most births occurring in January or February. Newborn bears weigh about half a kilogram (one pound) and are about 23 cm (9 inches) long from the nose to the tip of the short tail. Twins are most common in bears, but up to five young may be produced. The cubs nurse for a few months and stay with the female until the next breeding (about a year and a half or more after birth). Most young, however, can get along on their own by about six months of age. Bears reach breeding condition at three and a half to six years of age, males usually maturing later than females. Longevity of bears in the wild ranges from 15 to 30 years, but in captivity they can live considerably longer.\nBecause of their large size, bears have few natural enemies in the wild. Most mortality occurs because of hunting by humans. On occasion, bears that fail to accumulate enough fat to last throughout the winter may die of starvation. Young bears are more vulnerable to predation because of their smaller size and thus may be killed by other carnivores such as wolves or cougars but most importantly by other bears, especially males. For this reason, females with cubs are highly protective of their young in the vicinity of males.\nHome ranges occupied by individual bears vary in size depending on the abundance of food, and larger areas are used when food is in short supply. Although highly variable among geographic areas and even among seasons, American black bears roam areas of 40 to 200 square km (15 to 77 square miles), grizzlies about 300 to 700 square km (115 to 270 square miles). Some polar bears trek across ranges of more than 125,000 square km (48,000 square miles)."}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Panda Facts - China Internet Information Center", "url": "http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/panda/37997.htm", "text": "Panda Facts Giant Pandas Giant pandas are black and white bears that live in temperate-zone bamboo forests in central China. Among the best recognized but rarest animals in the world, they have come to symbolize endangered species and conservation efforts. Scientific Classification (Genus and Species, Family, Order): Ailuropoda melanoleuca, Ursidae, Carnivora. Geographic Distribution Giant pandas live in a few mountain ranges in central China\ufffds Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. They once lived in lowland areas, but farming, forest clearing, and other development now restrict giant pandas to the mountains. Habitat Giant pandas live in broadleaf and coniferous forests with a dense understory of bamboo, at elevations between 5,000 and 10,000 feet. Torrential rains or dense mist throughout the year characterizes these forests, often shrouded in heavy clouds. Physical Description A giant panda is bear-like in shape. It has black fur on ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white. Although scientists do not know why these unusual bears are black and white, some speculate that the bold coloring provides effective camouflage into their shade-dappled snowy and rocky surroundings. The panda's thick, wooly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat. Giant pandas have large molar teeth and strong jaw muscles for crushing tough bamboo. Many people find these chunky, lumbering animals to be cute, but giant pandas can be as dangerous as any other bear. Size About the size of an American black bear, giant pandas stand between two and three feet tall at the shoulder (on all four legs), and reach four to six feet long. Males are larger than females, weighing up to 250 pounds in the wild. Females rarely reach 220 pounds. Status The giant panda is listed as endangered in the World Conservation Union's (IUCN's) Red List of Threatened Animals. It is one of the most critically endangered species in the world. There are about 1,000 left in the wild. About 140 pandas live in zoos and breeding centers around the world, mostly in China. Life Span Scientists are not sure how long giant pandas live in the wild, but they are sure it is shorter than lifespans in zoos. Chinese scientists have reported zoo pandas as old as 35. Diet A wild giant panda\ufffds diet is almost exclusively (99 percent) bamboo. The balance consists of other grasses and occasional small rodents or musk deer fawns. In zoos, giant pandas eat bamboo, sugar cane, rice gruel, a special high-fiber biscuit, carrots, apples, and sweet potatoes. Social Structure Adult giant pandas are generally solitary, but they do communicate periodically through scent marks, calls, and occasional meetings. Offspring stay with their mothers from one and a half to three years."}

The giant furballs look as if they\u2019d like nothing better than to chew some bamboo and watch a re-run of Mad Men with you on the couch. Maybe order a pizza, vegetarian-style. But contrary to their adorable appearance, giant pandas are actually quite ornery according to many keepers\u2019 accounts. One Beijing Zoo panda named Gu Gu has attacked three visitors, one of which entered his cage specifically to hug him. In his most recent attack, the 240-lb Gu Gu \u201cclamped down on the intruder\u2019s leg and refused to let go\u2026 Zookeepers had to use tools to pry open the animal\u2019s jaws.\u201d\nFortunately for China, which rents out panda bears to various zoos for approximately $1 million a year, Americans and people around the world still love the panda. With their big dark eyes and baby-like body shape, pandas are easily anthromorphized and seem to breed well in captivity. In fact, 25 were born near Sichuan since the May 12 earthquake there.\nWhile doubtlessly pandas will continue to prosper in captivity, their fate in the wild looks bleak. About 1,600 wild giant pandas continue to be endangered due to their restrictive diet, poaching, and encroachment on habitat by human development. A recent report by WWF says that the wild giant panda is facing extinction in just a few decades: as China\u2019s economy continues to ramp up, it is fueling development and fracturing panda habitat to the point where inbreeding, stress, and disease risk makes the wild population unviable.\nIf there is good news to report about the giant panda, it\u2019s only that many conservation groups are working to preserve its habitat in China. And that at $1 million a pop, it\u2019s unlikely that the Chinese government will let them go extinct. For an example of their global appeal, gratuitously cute video below:"}

But while some of these species have populations that are thriving, others are endangered, facing various threats that that risk wiping them off the face of the Earth.\n1. Malayan Tapir\nThe Malayan Tapir is an endangered mammal in the tapir family, native to southern Thailand, southern Myanmar, the Malayan Peninsula, and the southern and central parts of Sumatra in Indonesia. It looks a bit like a cross between a pig or an anteater with its distinctive snout whose upper lip curves and hangs over the lower lip. Usually at least 6 feet long and weighing up to roughly 720 pounds, it\u2019s the largest of the four Tapir species.\nThe Malayan Tapir is a solitary animal except when reproducing, and tapirs are generally aggressive towards humans and other animals, although they are herbivores. It also whistles, clicks and makes hiccup-like calls to communicate. Rainforests, lower montane forests, scrublands and grasslands are the ideal habitats for the Malayan Tapir. There are about 2,000 of this species remaining, and their population is decreasing. This is due to habitat loss from illegal logging, and hunting.\n2. Indian Rhinoceros\nUnlike other rhino species, the Indian Rhinoceros has a single horn. This herbivorous grazer has a distinctive grey-brown hide with folds on the neck, shoulder, and rump. The folds make the Indian Rhinoceros appear to be wearing armored plates\u2014and in a way, it is, as the supple skin of the folds allows the rhinoceros to move, while the rest of its skin is thick for protection. The male\u2019s head and body length is 12 to 12.5 feet with a shoulder height of about 6 feet, while a female is 10 to 11 feet long and 4 to 5.5 feet tall to the shoulder. They are definitely heavy-set creatures: a mature male weighs 2,200 kg, roughly 2.5 tons, and a female weighs 1,600, so close to 2 tons. That is about the weight of an SUV!\nIndia and Nepal are countries where the Indian rhinoceros is found, but in the past there have been populations in Bhutan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. These countries have tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, shrublands, forest, and swamps, all ideal habitats for the Indian rhinoceros. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies the Indian Rhinoceros as a vulnerable species, but luckily its population is increasing. It faces threats from sport hunting, human-rhino conflicts, and habitat encroachment for agriculture and development. The Indian rhinoceros is a solitary animal except when mating, and males are territorial, marking their territories with dung piles. To communicate, the Indian Rhinoceros snorts, roars and honks. It has a lifespan of 40 years.\n3. Slow Loris\nThe slow loris is an omnivore forager, and one of three loris species. It is found in southern Asia, China, western Indonesia, parts of India, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. These countries have tropical rainforests, bamboo groves and mangrove forests suited for it. The slow loris lives in hollowed out trees, tree crevices, and branches. Its eyes are round and owl-like, and the head is round with tiny ears obscured by fur. Its unthreatening appearance is deceiving: this is the only known venomous primate. It secretes venom from a gland in its underarm it can quickly suck into its mouth before biting, which has even caused death to humans in the past.\nThe Slow Loris' fore and rear limbs are similar in size, it only weighs about 2 pounds. Its omnivorous diet comprises of fruits, insects, and bird and reptile eggs. The slow loris is nocturnal, and researchers believe it leads a solitary lifestyle, only coming together to mate. They communicate with each other by urine marks, after urinating on their hands and wiping them on branches to mark their territory. It is a critically endangered species according to the IUCN, facing threats from illegal pet trade, deforestation leading to habitat loss, and making traditional medicines.\n4. Asian Elephant\nThe Asian elephant is the largest of the continent\u2019s terrestrial mammals, but smaller than its African sibling. The Indian, Sumatran, and Sri Lankan are the 3 subspecies of Asian Elephants. It can weigh up to 11,000 pounds, reach a length of 21 feet (6.4 meters), and stand 11.5 feet (3.5 meters) tall. Its skin is dark grey to brown, with pink patches on the forehead, ears, chest and the base of the trunk. The Asian elephant has one finger on the upper lip of the trunk, unlike the African species with a second one on the lower lip. This gentle giant's populations are spread in the Eastern Himalayas and Greater Mekong regions in countries like India, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. These countries have tropical and subtropical, moist and dry broad-leaf forests suited to sustain the Asian elephant.\nFemale Asian elephants are more social than males, and form herds led by the oldest female. The males live alone, but on occasion group up with other males. Grass is the primary diet of an Asian elephant but also feeds on tree barks, roots, leaves, small stems and farmed crops. In a day, they eat up to 300 pounds of food, and they must drink water daily so they are always near a water source. The average lifespan of the Asian elephant is up to 60 years. The IUCN classifies the Asian elephant an endangered species with a decreasing population facing threats from habitat loss and fragmentation, due to rapid infrastructure development. There are only about 40,000 to 50,000 Asian elephants left.\n5. Giant Panda\nThe Giant Panda is an omnivore native to south-central China and a member of the bear family of animals. It lives in a habitat of temperate broad-leaf forest or mixed forest, where it forages for bamboo. The giant panda\u2019s thick and woolly fur coat is black and white, and when fully mature it weighs up to 330 pounds. From the nose to rump its length is 5 feet (1.5 meters) on average and has a small 5 inch (15 cm) tail.\nBamboo leaves, stems, and shoots are the primary diet of the giant panda, but it also feeds on meat from birds and small rodents. In a day it eats at least 28 pounds of bamboo in order to satisfy its diet. The giant panda leads a solitary lifestyle, avoiding confrontations except when cubs are threatened. Still, it marks its territorial routes by spraying urine, clawing trees, and rubbing against objects, and can spend 12 hours daily eating. The IUCN classifies the giant panda as a vulnerable species, previously classifying it as endangered, whose habitat over the years has been encroached on due to agriculture and logging. There are about 1864 giant pandas left in the wild, and luckily, its numbers are increasing. In captivity, pandas can live up to 30 years old.\n6. Indian Cobra\nThe Indian Cobra is a venomous snake native to the Middle East, India, China, Bangladesh, and Indonesia in their tropical environments. At full maturity, this reptile can grow to be 6 to over 7 feet (1.8 to 2.22 meters) long. Its body color ranges from cream-white, brown, to black, and others have half-ring patterns on the back of the neck. The Indian cobra lives anywhere it finds shelter, even in human settlements.\nIn India, its bites kill 10,000 people annually on average and many of those who are bitten work on rice paddies. In such environments, the Indian cobra eats mice, rats, lizards, birds and their eggs, frogs and other snakes. It is most active during the evening and early mornings. When threatened it hisses, sways its hood to seem larger and appear aggressive, and bites or spits venom. The Indian cobra reproduces sexually, and the female fiercely guards the eggs in hollow trees or in the earth, until they hatch, in about 50 to 60 days. In captivity, it can live for up to 30 years. The Indian Cobra is not an endangered species, but it is protected in India.\n7. Lesser Bird-of-Paradise\nThe Lesser Bird-of-Paradise is found in pacific countries like Papua New Guinea, eastern Australia, and Southeast Asia, mainly Indonesia. In these regions, lowland and tropical rainforests, and swamp forests are its habitats. This bird is one of about 40 Bird-of-Paradise species. The lesser bird-of-paradise is 12.5 inches (32 cm) long, tail wires not included. The male weighs between 6.5 to 10.5 oz (183-300 g), and females 5 to 7.5 oz (141-210 g). The lesser bird of paradise plumage is very bright and colourful, with black, white, grey, green, brown, blue, yellow, and red all appearing depending on sex and age.\nBeing polygynous, a male lesser bird-of-paradise mates with several females while perched on trees, and the most dominant male get the most copulation, while the females only mate with one male in a season. Its omnivorous diet consists of fruits, arthropods, insects, and snails. This bird is not threatened, hence classified as of least concern by the IUCN. As collective Birds of Paradise. In the zoo, they can live up to 30 years.\n8. Japanese Macaque\nAlso called the snow monkey, the Japanese Macaque is native to Japan on the Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu islands, and the smaller Yakushima Island. Its head and body length is about 20-22 inches (52-57 cm) and they have a small tail is 2.5 4 inches (7-12 cm). The male Japanese Macaque is sometimes almost twice the size of the female, weighing an average 25 pounds compared to the females at 18 pounds. Its fur is dense and brown to grey in color. The face and rump of a mature Japanese macaque is red, and the face also has whiskers and beard. The diet of a Japanese Macaque depends on seasons. It can feed on leaves, berries, seeds, small animals, insects, tree bark, buds, crabs, bird\u2019s eggs, and fungi, making it omnivorous.\nThe Japanese Macaque habitat is broad-leaf, deciduous, and evergreen forests. It is also a social animal and lives in troops with about 20-40 monkeys or at times even 100. Male Japanese Macaques can move within troops, but the females don\u2019t, and there is an established social hierarchy with daughters taking the places of their mother, so it is a matrilineal society. Access to food in these troops is determined by this hierarchy, but these monkeys demonstrate impressive levels of kindness and cohabitation. The IUCN classifies the Japanese Macaque as of least concern, and not globally threatened. In the wild, it lives on average 6 years, but in a zoo it can live for up to 30 years.\n9. Bactrian Camel\nThe wild Bactrian camel with two humps is native to the deserts of southern Mongolia, northwestern China, and Kazakhstan. Bactrian camels migrate and exist in habitats like the rocky mountain massifs, flat arid deserts, stony plains, and sand dunes in those countries. This camel weighs 1,800 pounds, is 3 meters long, and is over 7 feet tall (2 meters) to the hump. The Bactrian camel\u2019s fur is light grey-brown and beige in color. The thick fur is unkempt during winter and gets rapidly shed in spring.\nShrubs and grass are the primary diet of the Bactrian camel, but they can also feed on thorny, dry, and salty plants. In one intake, the Bactrian camel can drink 20 gallons (75 litres) of water\u2014up to 30 gallons if they are extremely thirsty. It\u2019s also adapted to drink salty or brackish water without being harmed because human settlements have forced this animal to move to areas where only salty water is available. Bactrian camels are social and live in flocks of 5 to 30 animals, led by a dominant male in grazing areas. This camel species is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN and with a decreasing population, facing threats from poaching for meat and hides, sport hunting, habitat destruction by toxic illegal mining, and loss of water sources due to drought.\n10. Bengal Tiger\nIndia is where large populations of the Bengal tiger are found, others are in Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, China, and Myanmar. These countries have dry and wet deciduous forests, grassland and temperate forests, and mangrove forests, all ideal habitats for this tiger. An adult male Bengal tiger weighs up to 500 pounds and a female about 310 pounds. Its fur is usually orange with thinner black stripes, but there is also the rare white Bengal tiger, with thin brown or black stripes, or the golden tabby Bengal tiger with a whitish-yellow color and amber stripes on the side, even more rare and caused by a recessive gene.\nDeer, antelope, hogs, buffalos, monkeys, birds, and livestock are among the Bengal tiger's prey. This tiger is nocturnal and hunts at night, and can swim and climb trees. The Bengal tiger leads a solitary life, but at times they move as 3 to 4 tigers, and cubs will stay with its mother for two to three years before leaving to find their own territory. It\u2019s also an endangered species with only around 2,500 of them left due to habitat loss and fragmentation caused by human development and poaching. In the wild it can live for 10 to 15 years, but in captivity up to 20 years, according to the Indian Tiger Welfare Society."}

They are not quite as cuddly as dogs or cats; not quite as dangerous as wolves or mountain lions; but they are decidedly ever-compelling objects of fear, admiration, and even envy. Found in a variety of environments from Arctic ice pack to tropical forests, bears live on every continent except Antarctica.\nFast Facts: Bears Scientific Name: Ursus spp\nUrsus spp Common Names: Bear, panda\nBear, panda Basic Animal Group: Mammal\nMammal Size (length): Sun bear: 4\u20135 feet; brown bear: 5\u201310 feet\nSun bear: 4\u20135 feet; brown bear: 5\u201310 feet Weight: Sun bear: 60\u2013150 pounds; brown bear 180\u20131300 pounds\nSun bear: 60\u2013150 pounds; brown bear 180\u20131300 pounds Lifespan: 20\u201335 years\n20\u201335 years Diet: Omnivore\nOmnivore Habitat: Woodlands, grasslands, deserts, temperate and tropical forests, on all continents except Antarctica\nWoodlands, grasslands, deserts, temperate and tropical forests, on all continents except Antarctica Conservation Status: Least Concern: Brown bears, American black bear; Vulnerable: sloth bear, polar bear, giant panda, sun bear, spectacled bear, Asian black bear\nDescription\nWith some minor exceptions, all eight bear species have roughly the same appearance: large torsos, stocky legs, narrow snouts, long hair, and short tails. With their plantigrade postures\u2014walking upright on two feet\u2014bears walk flat-footed on the ground like humans but unlike most other mammals.\nBears range in color with species: Black, brown and Andean bears are typically red-brown to black; polar bears are generally white to yellow; Asiatic bears are black to brown with a white patch and sun bears are brown with a yellow crescent on their chest. They range in size from the sun bear (47 inches tall and weighing 37 pounds) to the polar bear, (nearly 10 feet tall and weighing 1,500 pounds).\nBuck Shreck/Getty Images\nSpecies\nScientists recognize eight species as well as numerous subspecies of bears, which live in different regions, that have differences in body shape and coloration.\nAmerican black bears (Ursus americanus) live in North America and Mexico; their diet consists primarily of leaves, buds, shoots, berries, and nuts. Subspecies of this bear include the cinnamon bear, the glacier bear, the Mexican black bear, the Kermode bear, the Louisiana black bear, and several others.\nAsian black bears (Ursus thibetanus) live in Southeast Asia and the Russian Far East. They have blocky bodies and patches of yellowish-white fur on their chests, but otherwise resemble American black bears in body shape, behavior, and diet.\nBrown bears (Ursus arctos) are some of the world's largest terrestrial meat-eating mammals. They range across North America, Europe, and Asia and include numerous subspecies, such as the Carpathian bear, the European brown bear, the Gobi bear, the grizzly bear, the Kodiak bear, and several others.\nPolar bears (Ursus maritimus) rival brown bears in size. These bears are restricted to a circumpolar region in the Arctic, reaching south into northern Canada and Alaska. When they're not living on pack ice and shorelines, polar bears swim in open water, feeding on seals and walruses.\nGiant pandas (Aeluropoda melanoleuca) feed almost exclusively on bamboo shoots and leaves in the central and southern regions of western China. These distinctly patterned bears have black bodies, white faces, black ears, and black eyespots.\nSloth bears (Melursus ursinus) stalk the grasslands, forests, and scrublands of Southeast Asia. These bears have long, shaggy coats of fur and white chest marks; they feed on termites, which they find using their acute sense of smell.\nSpectacled bears (Tremarctos ornatos) are the only bears native to South America, inhabiting cloud forests at elevations over 3,000 feet. These bears once lived in coastal deserts and high-elevation grasslands, but human encroachment has restricted their range.\nSun bears (Helarctos malayanos) live in the lowland tropical forests of Southeast Asia. These small ursines have the shortest fur of any bear species, their chests marked with light, reddish-brown, U-shaped patches of fur.\nDiet and Behavior\nMost bears are omnivorous, feasting opportunistically on animals, fruits, and vegetables, with two important outliers: The polar bear is almost exclusively carnivorous, preying on seals and walruses, and the panda bear subsists entirely on bamboo shoots. Oddly enough, though, pandas' digestive systems are relatively well adapted to eating meat.\nBecause the vast majority of bears live in high northern latitudes, they need a way to survive the winter months when food is dangerously scarce. Evolution's solution is hibernation: Bears go into a deep sleep, lasting for months, during which their heart rates and metabolic processes slow drastically. Being in hibernation isn't like being in a coma. If sufficiently roused, a bear can wake up in the middle of its hibernation, and females have even been known to give birth in the deep of winter. Fossil evidence also supports cave lions preying on hibernating cave bears during the last Ice Age, though some of these bears woke up and killed the unwelcome intruders.\nBears may be the most antisocial mammals on the face of the earth. Full-grown bears are almost entirely solitary. This is good news for campers who accidentally encounter lone grizzlies in the wild, but quite unusual when compared with other carnivorous and omnivorous mammals, ranging from wolves to pigs, that tend to congregate in at least small groups.\nDepending on species, a bear's basic communication needs can be expressed with about seven or eight different \"words\"\u2014huffs, chomps, groans, roars, woofs, growls, hums, or barks. The most dangerous sounds for humans are roars and growls, which denote a frightened or agitated bear defending its territory.\nHuffs are generally produced during mating and courtship rituals; hums\u2014a bit like the purrs of cats, but much louder\u2014are deployed by cubs to demand attention from their mothers, and moans express anxiety or a sense of danger. Giant pandas have a slightly different vocabulary than their ursine brethren: In addition to the sounds described above, they can also chirp, honk, and bleat.\nEvolutionary History\nGiven the proliferation of so-called bear dogs millions of years ago\u2014including the standard-bearer of the family, Amphicyon\u2014you might assume that modern bears are most closely related to dogs. In fact, molecular analysis shows that the closest living relatives of bears are pinnipeds, the family of marine mammals that includes seals and walruses. Both of these mammalian families descend from a last common ancestor, or \"concestor,\" that lived sometime during the Eocene epoch, about 40 million or 50 million years ago. The exact identity of the progenitor species, however, remains a matter of speculation.\nGiven that the populations of medieval Europe didn't have much contact with polar bears or panda bears, it makes sense that European peasants associated bears with the color brown\u2014which is where the English name of this animal derives, from the old Germanic root bera. Bears are also known as ursines, a word that has ancient roots in Proto-Indo-European languages that were spoken as far back as 3500 BCE. The long history of this word makes sense, given that the first human settlers of Eurasia lived in close proximity to cave bears and sometimes worshiped these beasts as gods.\nAmphicyon, the \"bear dog\". Wikimedia Commons\nReproduction and Offspring\nLike their close cousins seals and walruses, bears are some of the most sexually dimorphic animals on earth\u2014that is to say, male bears are significantly bigger than females\u200b, and, what is more, the bigger the species, the larger the disparity in size. In the largest brown bear subspecies, for instance, males weigh about 1,000 pounds and females only slightly more than half that.\nHowever, even though female bears are smaller than males, they're not exactly helpless. They vigorously defend their cubs from male bears, not to mention any humans foolish enough to interfere with the child-rearing process. Male bears, however, will sometimes attack and kill cubs of their own kind, in order to induce females to breed again.\nAlthough there are some differences among the species, in general, female bears generally become sexually mature at between 4 and 8 years of age and have litters every three or four years. Bear breeding occurs during the summers\u2014it is the only time when adult bears get together at all\u2014but implantation doesn't typically occur until late autumn. Total gestation time is 6.5\u20139 months. Cubs are born singly or up to three at a time, generally in January or February, while the mother is still in hibernation. The young usually stay with their mother for two years. After mating, females are left to raise the young by themselves for a period of about three years, at which point\u2014eager to breed with other males\u2014the mothers chase the cubs away to fend for themselves.\nJames Hager / Getty Images\nThreats\nConsidering that early humans used to worship bears as gods, our relationship with ursines hasn't exactly been stellar over the last few hundred years. Bears are especially susceptible to habitat destruction, are often hunted for sport, and tend to become the scapegoats whenever campers are attacked in the wild or garbage cans are overturned in suburbs.\nToday, the largest threats to bears are deforestation and human encroachment, and, for polar bears, climate change which is reducing the environment in which they live. On the whole, black and brown bears are holding their own, even though adverse interactions with humans have increased as their habitats become more constricted.\nConservation Status\nAccording to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the sun bear, sloth bear, Asiatic, and spectacled bears are all listed as Vulnerable and decreasing in population; the polar bear is also listed as Vulnerable but its population status is unknown. The American black bear and brown bear is considered Least Concern and increasing in numbers. The giant panda is Vulnerable but increasing in population.\nBears and Humans\nWithin the past 10,000 years, human beings have domesticated cats, dogs, pigs, and cattle\u2014so why not bears, an animal with which Homo sapiens has coexisted since the end of the Pleistocene epoch?\nOne explanation is that since bears are intensely solitary animals, there's no room for a human trainer to insert himself into the \"dominance hierarchy\" as the alpha male. Bears also pursue such varied diets that it would be difficult to keep even a tame population well-supplied. Perhaps most importantly, bears are anxious and aggressive when stressed, and simply don't have suitable personalities to be house or yard pets.\nSources"}

A discussion of efforts to save endangered species, notably the giant panda, at the... Great Museums Television (A Britannica Publishing Partner)\nTranscript\n[Music in]\nSUZAN MURRAY: When people come to the zoo it's not just the one animal that they're seeing or the two animals that they're seeing. Those animals are representative of a story we're trying to tell. They're representative of their species. And they're also representative of a lot of the scientific work we're doing to help save these animals, both in captivity and in the wild.\nNARRATOR: There is no better ambassador for the cause of conservation than the charismatic giant panda.\nSTEVE MONFORT: Well, giant pandas are\u2014are really the\u2014they're the rock stars of the animal world.\nDON MOORE: Black and white just does something for every human on the planet, and these pandas are the ambassadors not only for panda bears in the wild as a species but for bamboo habitat, for all that is China.\nNARRATOR: Lisa Stevens is curator for giant pandas at the National Zoo.\nLISA STEVENS: The cute factor is a great factor to have when you're dealing with an endangered species, because cuteness is a great hook to get people interested and to get them to care.\nThat's our famous Tai Shan doing what he does best, which is sleep.\nZOO VISITOR: Oh, I wanna touch him.\nNARRATOR: The panda cub Tai Shan was born at the National Zoo in 2005, using artificial insemination.\nZOO VISITOR: Oh, look!\nLISA STEVENS: Oh, look, he's gonna wake up! Aren't you lucky.\nZOO VISITOR: Please get back up, get back up!\nLISA STEVENS: He might eat some bamboo for us.\nNARRATOR: Tai Shan was the first surviving panda cub born at the National Zoo after 30 years of captive breeding trials, tribulations, and disappointment.\nSTEVE MONFORT: Pandas are a tricky, tricky lot. Evolutionarily, they don't do themselves any favor. They ovulate once a year. They generally have one cub every other year under the best of conditions. They're specialized feeders. They need a certain type of bamboo or they starve in the wild. This\u2014so they're a real challenge.\nNARRATOR: The bamboo the giant pandas need to survive only grows naturally in certain temperate forests in China.\nLISA STEVENS: Through fossil evidence we know that pandas ranged all the way down into Southeast Asia and all throughout China. But with the disappearance of their temperate forests, their numbers are now down to just a mere 1,600.\nDON MOORE: We have done a ton of work on pandas: We've done the biological science of pandas; we've done the nutrition of pandas; we've done the reproductive biology of pandas; and we have trained over a 150 Chinese scientists to preserve and conserve pandas in the wild.\nNARRATOR: Of course, reproduction is the essence of survival.\nJOGAYLE HOWARD: The goal of any breeding program in a zoo is\u2014is really an insurance policy against extinction. And so a lot of the techniques that are used in human reproduction and infertility now\u2014procedures like artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization\u2014we're applying to the endangered species.\nNARRATOR: Unlike human females, who ovulate monthly, a panda female has just one chance a year to get pregnant.\nJOGAYLE HOWARD: The female only comes in estrus once a year, and so she has a very small window of fertility; it may be 24 or 48 hours. And so not only did we have to develop the technology to do the artificial insemination, we had to really get the\u2014the\u2014the window of fertility down.\nNARRATOR: To further complicate matters, most giant panda males in the captive population just aren't interested in sex. Only about 15 males in the world will breed naturally in captivity.\nJOGAYLE HOWARD: They may be the best genetic match, but they may not necessarily want to breed on their own. And so if the natural breeder male does not breed, then we're ready for artificial insemination with the semen from another male.\nNARRATOR: The National Zoo's famous female panda Mei Xiang, came into estrus in 2005.\nCARLOS SANCHEZ: Mei Xiang is a\u2014a excellent animal to work with. She's one of the high-profile animals, not for the zoo only but for the whole D.C. area.\nNARRATOR: Dr. Carlos Sanchez led the anesthesia team for the artificial insemination of Mei Xiang.\nCARLOS SANCHEZ: We zoo vets and wildlife vets are\u2014our job is based on anesthesia. We're trying to do conservations; we cannot afford to lose an animal under anesthesia. You know, it's the\u2014the other part that not a lot of people see, because they just see the end result, the cute baby panda. But a lot of people get involved for that kind of procedure.\nNARRATOR: Dr. JoGayle Howard performed the artificial insemination.\nJOGAYLE HOWARD: We used a laparoscope, which is a\u2014an instrument that's used in human medicine a lot to visualize the reproductive tract of the female, go through the cervix so that the sperm could be deposited in the uterus.\nNARRATOR: The video on the monitor is actually giant panda sperm. Part was used for the insemination; the rest was frozen, or cryopreserved.\nJOGAYLE HOWARD: It goes into the genome resource bank here at the National Zoo, which is a\u2014a repository of sperm, embryos, even eggs now. So this semen could be shipped internationally. It could be shipped nationally, say, to other facilities that have\u2014that\u2014that have giant pandas, like Zoo Atlanta or Memphis Zoo. So it's just another tool we have for the genetic-management program of endangered species.\nLISA STEVENS: I have to say that the birth of Tai Shan is one of the greatest moments of my career. It was the ultimate reward, you know. It was the ultimate reward for all the hard work that so many people put toward saving this species.\nNARRATOR: Tai Shan and his parents live along the Asia Trail at the National Zoo, where the giant panda exhibit is designed to mimic wild panda habitat in China.\nLISA STEVENS: It's very rocky; it's hilly. The tree species that you see here are comparable to the species that would occur in panda habitat. And this is Tai Shan's favorite tree. He likes to climb up and perch right in the middle of this tree.\nCRAIG SAFFOE: Asia Trail is a complete immersion. We have tried to make people feel like they're really in Asia. Everything from the landscaping to the exhibits themselves to the colors reflect what Asia is.\nNARRATOR: Most importantly, the six-acre Asia Trail is designed to make the endangered species who live there feel at home, like these intriguing little red pandas with their ringed raccoon-style tails.\nCRAIG SAFFOE: Red pandas are very similar to\u2014to giant pandas in that they're developed to eat bamboo. But they eat the leaves off the bamboo instead of the stems.\nJOGAYLE HOWARD: Well, historically, zoos have been menageries of animals, but now there is a lot of science behind living museums.\nCRAIG SAFFOE: If someone was of the mind frame that zoos were circuses or just for entertainment, I would initially tell 'em that's what zoos used to be. That was in the 1800s, when zoos first started coming up.\nNARRATOR: But the original idea behind the Smithsonian National Zoo was different. Concerned about the rapid disappearance of American wildlife, like the bison and the beaver, zoo founder William Hornaday envisioned a facility that would breed endangered animals in captivity and educate the public about conservation. In 1889 Hornaday opened a small trial zoo on the Mall outside the Smithsonian Castle. Three years later the Smithsonian National Zoological Park, designed by America's premier landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted, opened in D.C.'s Rock Creek valley.\nCRAIG SAFFOE: And you can see remnants of zoos of old, especially in a zoo the age of this zoo. That's one of the things I love about working at this zoo is you can see the history, you know, of this place.\nNARRATOR: Some of the zoo's early features are still in place. The walkways, the landscaping, the magnificent reptile house. With its intricate brickwork, relief carvings, columns, and other ornamentation, the reptile house looks quite reptilian.\nCRAIG SAFFOE: In zoos of past, you know, these exhibits were concrete and steel. People would come by, look in the cage, see the animal, and go to the next exhibit. Now we're asking you to open your eyes and look.\nSTEVE MONFORT: We're part of the Smithsonian Institution. And so having the backup of the largest museum complex in the world really adds value to what we can do as a zoo. No other zoo in the world has that.\nSUZAN MURRAY: It is our nation's zoo; we're free. So, as such, we're available to everybody. But we're also available to people around the globe, both through our international programs as well as the Web site.\nDON MOORE: The National Zoo can also be watched from somebody's home computer. We have the panda cams. There are over 40 cameras in the panda habitat alone. There are dozens of cameras elsewhere in the zoo\u2014in the cheetah habitat, in the elephant habitat, and some of the bird habitats. And you can go to your computer at home, and you can find out lots of stuff about the National Zoo. And you can watch pandas 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n[Music out]"}

Learn more about this species on our Grand Cayman blue iguana page.\nWhat do Zoo visitors want to know about this species?\nThe most common question visitors ask me about the blue iguana is, \u2018Why is his head bobbing?\u2019 For this species, head bobbing is a form of communication; it can be a threat or a breeding display. However, our male iguana will start bobbing rapidly in excitement when I walk by with his tray of food!\nDo iguanas participate in training?\nPart of managing animals is keeping track of their weight and ensuring they are in the best condition. For the past couple of years, we have been training our male and female Grand Cayman blue iguanas to climb upon a scale and station (hold still). Both iguanas tend to be curious when it comes to new items being presented to them, especially if food is involved. When they climb on the scale, I offer fruit rewards\u2014they will do just about anything for a piece of banana! This positive reward helps establish a consistent, stress-free and fun way to weigh our iguanas. The male weighs 20.9 pounds and the female weighs 10.3 pounds. The next step in this training is to incorporate voice cues; ideally, I\u2019d like to say \u201cscale\u201d and have them associate that with climbing on the scale for a reward.\nHow smart are they?\nGrand Cayman blue iguanas are fairly intelligent, considering the size of their brain. These animals recognize their keepers and are capable of learning a wide variety of behaviors, as exemplified by the scale training sessions.\nDo blue iguanas have any special adaptations?\nUnlike some of their green relatives, blue iguanas are not adapted for life in the trees\u2014though they can climb if needed. Instead, these animals are terrestrial. And, their heavily-built bodies are designed for life in a harsh environment. Some can grow up to 5 feet long and can weigh up to 25 pounds.\nWhat's your favorite fact about iguanas?\nOne of my favorite facts about Grand Cayman blue iguanas is that they are pollinators. In their native habitat, they eat a variety of leafy plants and fruits. They play an important role in the ecosystem just by dispersing seeds through their poop."}

But a new study finds that the iconic markings actually provide effective camouflage and help them disappear into their surroundings.\nMost mammals have relatively drab coloring, which helps them match their backgrounds and avoid detection by predators. There are a few notable exceptions like giant pandas, skunks, and orcas. Scientists have long wondered what function the black-and-white coloring plays.\nFor their study, researchers analyzed photos of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in their natural habitat. They found that the animals were very well camouflaged \u201cbecause they use habitats with dark and lighting conditions, and also encounter snow during some of the year,\u201d study author Tim Caro of the University of Bristol and the University of California, Davis, tells Treehugger.\nThey found that the black patches of fur blend primarily into shade and dark tree trunks. But it also matches the ground, rocks, and foliage.\nThe white fur patches match snow, rocks, and waxy, bright foliage (due to light reflecting from the leaves). Sometimes pandas also have patches of pale brown fur and those blend into rocks, ground, foliage, and shady background areas.\nThe researchers also explored a type of environmental camouflage known as disruptive coloration. That\u2019s when highly contrasting patterns or very visible boundaries on an animal break up its body outline. They found that the black and white borders on the panda\u2019s coat make it less visible, particularly from farther away.\nAs a last step, the researchers used a color map technique to compare how giant pandas resemble their background with more than a dozen other species that are considered able to visually hide in their environments. They found that pandas fell in the middle of this \u201cconspicuity spectrum,\u201d between shore crabs and rodents called jerboas.\nThe results were published in the journal Scientific Reports.\nThrough Different Eyes\nIt might seem a bit baffling because giant pandas are very easy to spot at a zoo, for instance. But the environment and the viewer make a difference.\n\u201cWe modelled their coloration through predators' eyes as well as how humans see them so we are sure of the results,\u201d Caro says. They used canine, feline, and human vision models to view each image.\nDespite the fact that humans see things differently from panda predators, there are also the situations where people usually see the black-and-white animals.\n\u201cIt seems that giant pandas appear conspicuous to us because of short viewing distances and odd backgrounds: when we see them, either in photographs or at the zoo, it is almost always from close up, and often against a backdrop that doesn\u2019t reflect their natural habitat,\u201d says author Nick Scott-Samuel of the University of Bristol.\n\u201cFrom a more realistic predator\u2019s perspective, the giant panda is actually rather well camouflaged.\u201d"}

Just like a lion is known as Panthera leo scientifically, pandas also have a scientific name. If you adore pandas, you might be wondering, what\u2019s the scientific name of a giant panda?\nYou might be amazed to know that the scientific name of a giant panda is Ailuropoda melanoleuca.\nA scientific name consists of two parts-genus and species. The first part is the genus name and the second part is the species name. Similarly, the genus name of giant pandas is Ailuropoda and the species name is melanoleuca.\nA bit complicated, right? Since the scientific name of a giant panda sounds hard to understand, you might be curious to know what it means. Let\u2019s see what\u2019s the meaning of Ailuropoda melanoleuca!\nWhat Does the Giant Panda\u2019s Scientific Name Mean?\nThe scientific name of a giant panda literally means \u201ccat-footed, black-and-white animal.\u201d The genus name Ailuropoda is derived from the Greek term a\u00edlouros that stands for \u201ccat\u201d, and pod\u00f3s, meaning \u201cfoot\u201d.\nWhereas, the species name melanoleuca is formed from the combination of two ancient Greek terms melano and leukos, which means \u201cblack\u201d and \u201cwhite\u201d respectively.\nTake Note: The first part of a scientific name (i.e. genus) always begins with a capital letter. Whereas, the second part (i.e. species) starts with a small letter.\nHow to Pronounce the Giant Panda\u2019s Scientific Name?\nThe scientific name of giant pandas is hard to pronounce. If you face difficulty while saying the name, do watch the video below.\nWhat is the Scientific Classification of the Giant Panda?\nImage Source: BrainStudy.Info\nAre you interested to know what the classification of giant pandas is? Before that let\u2019s see what animal classification actually means.\nClassification or taxonomy (as it is called scientifically), is the science of placing organisms into five kingdoms, among which the one for animals is called Kingdom Animalia or Animal kingdom.\nThere are further sub-categories in the Animal kingdom based on common features that include Phylum, Class, Order, Suborder, Family, Subfamily and Genus.\nBased on the above information, let\u2019s see the classification of giant pandas.\nKingdom Animalia Phylum Chordata Class Mammalia Order Carnivora Suborder Caniformia Family Ursidae Subfamily Ailuropodinae Genus Ailuropoda\nFinal Thoughts\nIn this article, we have learned the scientific name of giant pandas. Cute pandas are scientifically known as Ailuropoda melanoleuca, which means \u201ccat-footed, black-and-white animal.\u201d To learn how to pronounce this difficult name and know more about the classification of pandas, do read this article.

On Friday, Washington, D.C.'s National Zoo welcomed the most recent arrival to the captive population\u2014a healthy infant born to Mei Xiang.\nBut is the considerable effort and millions of dollars put into breeding the animals in captivity really worth it? (Read more about the costs of breeding pandas in National Geographic magazine.)\nSome conservationists say yes, claiming public \"pandamonium\" can translate to real conservation action. But others argue that the money could be better spent on other things, such as preserving threatened habitat.\n\"Everyone is enormously excited about baby pandas because they are undeniably attractive,\" said Stuart Pimm, a conservation ecologist at Duke University and contributor to National Geographic's News Watch blog. \"So by having pandas in zoos it really engages people\u2014it really is about getting people to care, and that's important.\"\nFor instance, the Chinese government has protected a substantial fraction of the pandas' range in Sichuan Province (map), where people can visit the protected areas and see pandas in captivity.\n\"That's an amazing conservation achievement\u2014more of the pandas' range is protected than for many other large endangered species, and it comes from the fact the pandas have this public presence,\" Pimm said.\nThe giant panda is also the logo of WWF, the world's largest conservation organization, and \"acts as a symbol of hope for conservation,\" Barney Long, head of Asian species conservation at WWF-US, said by email.\nPutting Pandas Back\nBut Marc Bekoff, an ethologist at University of Colorado, Boulder, said there's little evidence that pandas serving as inspirational icons for conservation\u2014or, as the zoos refer to them, ambassadors\u2014does anything for the bottom line: Boosting panda populations in the wild.\n\"I love pandas and I wish that they were in a better state in the wild ... but I'm just not convinced that these [captive-breeding] programs work out well in terms of getting pandas out there,\" Bekoff said. (See more panda pictures.)\nThe goal of most captive-breeding programs is to eventually reintroduce the animals back into China's bamboo forests. Although the pandas' range is mostly preserved, much of it is still fragmented in pieces, so that there are only a few large continuous tracts where the animals can roam freely.\nSo far, scientists have attempted two reintroductions of captive-bred pandas into Sichuan Province: Xiang Xiang, who died in 2007 after being beaten up by wild resident males in Wolong, and Tao Tao, who's been living in the Liziping Nature Reserve since 2012. Pandas that live in captive-breeding facilities outside China are on loan, and their offspring is returned to China.\n\"I think these programs have been going on long enough that we should see more progress made,\" Bekoff said. \"It's almost like: Breed and pray that something works out.\"\nBekoff believes that no more captive pandas should be born, and that existing animals should be put in refuges out of the public eye, since it's unknown what kind of stress they endure due to such exposure, he said.\nWill Travers, CEO of the wildlife-advocacy group Born Free USA, added that captive-breeding programs spend a significant amount of money on pandas, yet don't have much to show for it.\n\"Pandas [are the] poster animal for the zoo industry\u2014[they] receive millions and millions worth of support, and some of this is directed in a wasteful way,\" he said. He claims the money would be better spent preserving their habitat.\n\"Just because we can take pandas and put them in the middle of D.C. or Edinburgh, that doesn't mean we should,\" he said.\nBBC wildlife expert Chris Packham, who could not be reached for comment, said in 2009 that \"we should pull the plug\" on panda conservation because their habitat is not great enough to sustain them, according to the Telegraph.\n\"Let them go with a degree of dignity.\"\nHabitat Focus\nMarc Brody, senior advisor for conservation and sustainable development at China's Wolong Nature Reserve, agreed that the emphasis should be on saving panda habitat.\n\"The bigger question is not can we breed an animal in captivity, but can we give him a home in the wild\u2014and that means restoring degraded and fragmented habitat,\" Brody said.\nBut captive breeding is an integral part of that goal, he argued. Breeding animals for reintroduction \"gives us a compelling reason to restore the habitat to give these captive-born pandas a home.\"\n\"Bemoaning that too much money is spent on captive-panda programs is akin to shooting the panda messenger,\" Brody said. \"And this particular messenger, among the most beloved of all animals, has the magnetic power to galvanize greater public and political support for increased funding for a wide range of conservation programs.\"\nGeorge Schaller, a longtime biologist and photographer who has studied pandas in the wild, said that reintroduction efforts are not as robust as they should be because the panda is a \"political animal.\"\nThere's \"so much publicity on the panda, that [Chinese] officials are afraid if a panda is released and it dies for whatever reason, they get criticized,\" said Schaller, who's now vice president of Panthera, a global wild-cat conservation organization.\nOfficials in China \"feel that animals are better off in captivity: They get plenty to eat, they don't get wet and cold\u2014so there's a great reluctance to release them,\" he said.\nCurrently the plan is to release one panda a year into the wild, but that won't contribute much to growing the animals' population in their native habitat.\nChina \"doesn't need 300 [pandas] in captivity\u2014it needs to restock the forests [with pandas] and protect them,\" Schaller said.\nWhich Species to Save?\nMuch of the panda debate comes down to prioritizing which species to save\u2014a persistent challenge for conservationists.\nIn 2011, University of York environmental scientist Murray Rudd conducted an online survey of 583 conservation scientists and their views on managing biodiversity.\nSixty percent of respondents agreed that criteria should be established for deciding which species to abandon in order to focus on saving others.\nAs well-known cultural icons both in China and worldwide, pandas are usually top of mind.\n\"Nobody would ever commit this kind of money to any other species,\" David Wildt, head of the National Zoo's reproductive sciences program, said in a 2006 article in National Geographic magazine.\nBut other species, such as the endangered Ethiopian wolf, are not so lucky, Travers of Born Free noted. There are about 500 Ethiopian wolves left, and the species has little funding and no captive-breeding programs.\nChoosing which species get which funds is a \"very difficult debate\u2014you're practicing a form of conservation triage,\" he said. \"No one wants to do that.\""}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "The 10 Weirdest Animal Facts - ThoughtCo", "url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/weirdest-animal-facts-4116013", "text": "Some animal facts are weirder than others. Yes, we all know that cheetahs can run faster than motorcycles, and that bats navigate using sound waves, but those tidbits of information aren't nearly as entertaining as immortal jellyfish, butt-breathing turtles, and three-hearted octopuses. Below you'll discover 10 truly weird (and true) facts about 10 truly weird (and real) animals.\n01 of 10 Female Spotted Hyenas Have a Penis Getty Images Okay, it may be a bit of an overstatement to say that the female spotted hyena has a penis: more accurately, the clitoris of the female closely resembles the penis of the male, to the extent that only a very brave naturalist (presumably wearing gloves and protective headgear) could hope to tell the difference. (For the record, the female's sex organ is slightly thicker, with a more rounded head than that sported by males.) Only slightly less weirdly, spotted hyena females are dominant during courtship and mating, and prefer to hook up with younger males; clearly they're the \"cougars\" of the mammal family.\n02 of 10 Killer Whales Experience Menopause Getty Images The menopause of human females is one of the mysteries of evolution: wouldn't it be better for our species if women could give birth throughout their lives, rather than becoming infertile around the age of 50? This enigma isn't diminished by the fact that only two other mammals are known to experience menopause: the short-finned pilot whale and the orca, or killer whale. Female killer whales stop bearing children when they reach their 30's or 40's; one possible explanation is that elderly females, undistracted by the demands of pregnancy and birth, are better able to guide their pods. This is the same \"grandmother effect\" that has been proposed for elderly human females, who provide inexhaustible supplies of wisdom (and babysitting).\n03 of 10 Some Turtles Breathe Through Their Butts Wikimedia Commons A handful of turtle species\u2014including the North American eastern painted turtle and the Australian white-throated snapping turtle\u2014have specialized sacs near their cloacas (the organs used for defecating, urinating, and copulating) that collect air and filter out oxygen. However, these turtles are also equipped with perfectly good lungs, which begs the question: why breathe through your butt when your mouth will do? The answer likely has something to do with the tradeoffs between hard, protective shells and the mechanics of respiration; apparently, for these turtles, butt-breathing is less metabolically demanding than mouth-breathing.\n04 of 10 One Species of Jellyfish Is Immortal Getty Images Before we talk about immortal jellyfish, it's necessary to define our terms. Turritopsis dohrnii will definitely kick the marine bucket if you step on it, pan-fry it, or torch it with a flamethrower. What it won't do, however, is die of old age; the adults of this jellyfish species can reverse their life cycles all the way back to the polyp stage, and (theoretically) repeat this process an indefinite number of times. We say \"theoretically\" because, in practice, it's virtually impossible for a single T. dohrnii to survive for more than a few years; that would require a given individual (either polyp or adult) to avoid getting eaten by other marine organisms.\n05 of 10 Koala Bears Have Human Fingerprints Getty Images They may seem cute and cuddly, but koala bears are extremely devious: not only are they marsupials (pouched mammals) rather than true bears, but they have somehow managed to evolve fingerprints virtually indistinguishable from those of human beings, even under an electron microscope. Since human beings and koala bears occupy widely separated branches on the tree of life, the only explanation for this coincidence is convergent evolution: just as early Homo sapiens needed a way to firmly grasp primitive tools, koala bears needed a way to grasp the slippery bark of eucalyptus trees.\n06 of 10 It's Almost Impossible to Kill a Tardigrade Getty Images Tardigrades\u2014also known as water bears\u2014are microscopic, eight-legged, vaguely repulsive-looking creatures that can be found pretty much everywhere on earth. But the weirdest thing about tardigrades, apart from their nightmarish appearance, is that they're pretty much indestructible: these invertebrate animals can survive prolonged exposure to the vacuum of deep space, endure bursts of ionizing radiation that would fry an elephant, go without food or water for up to 30 years, and prosper in terrestrial environments (Arctic tundra, deep-sea vents) that would kill most other animals, including human beings.\n07 of 10 Male Seahorses Give Birth to Young Getty Images You might think the spotted hyena (previous slide) is the last word for gender equality in the animal kingdom, but you don't know about seahorses yet. These marine invertebrates pair up for elaborate, intricately choreographed mating rituals, after which the female deposits her eggs into a pouch on the male's tail. The male carries the fertilized eggs for two to eight weeks (depending on species), its tail slowly swelling up, and then releases up to a thousand tiny seahorse babies to their fate (which mostly involves being eaten by other marine creatures; sadly, only one-half of one percent of seahorse hatchlings manage to survive into adulthood).\n08 of 10 Three-Toed Sloths Wear Algae Coats Getty Images Just how slow is the three-toed sloth? Not much faster than you saw in the movie Zootopia; this South American mammal, when it isn't entirely motionless, can hit top speeds of a blazing 0.15 miles per hour. In fact, Bradypus tridactylus is so crepuscular that it can easily be overtaken by unicellular algae, which is why most adults sport shaggy green coats, making them (for all intents and purposes) equal parts plant and animal. There is a good evolutionary explanation for this symbiotic relationship: the green coats of three-toed sloths provide valuable camouflage from jungle predators, notably the much, much faster jaguar.\n09 of 10 Octopuses Have Three Hearts and Nine Brains Getty Images There's a reason vaguely octopus-like creatures often feature in science-fiction movies as super-intelligent aliens. The anatomy of octopuses is alarmingly different from that of humans; these invertebrates have three hearts (two of which pump blood through their gills, the other to the rest of their bodies), and nine aggregations of nerve tissue. The primary brain resides, appropriately enough, in the octopus' head, but each of its eight arms also contains its share of neurons, which allow for independent movement and even primitive \"thinking.\" (Let's keep things in perspective, though: even the smartest octopus only has about 500 million neurons, one-twentieth the amount of the average human.)\n10 of 10 Dugongs Are Closely Related to Elephants Getty Images You might naively assume that dugongs\u2014the awkward-looking marine mammals that drunken sailors once mistook for mermaids\u2014are most closely related to seals, walruses, and other pinnipeds. The fact is, though, that these ocean dwellers descend from the same \"last common ancestor\" that spawned modern elephants, a tiny quadruped that lived on dry land about 60 million years ago. (Dugongs belong to the same family, the sirenians, as manatees; these two mammals went their separate ways about 40 million years ago.) The exact same pattern was repeated by (unrelated) whales, who can trace their ancestry to a population of dog-like mammals that lived during the early Eocene epoch."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Giant Armadillo images!\nThe giant armadillo, also called tatou, ocarro and other names come by its common name honestly. It is a huge animal for its order, Cingulata, and can weigh well over 71 pounds and be over 3 feet long without the tail, which can add another 20 inches to its length.\nIt also has a huge central claw on both forefeet. The claws can grow as long as 8.7 inches in length, and even lions and tigers don\u2019t have such long claws proportional to their size. The armadillo\u2019s claws are one of the adaptations nature gave it for its termite-eating lifestyle. The claws tear into termite mounds and are used to dig burrows where the armadillo rests for much of the day.\nGiant Armadillo Facts\nSome facts about this remarkable animal are:\nThe giant armadillo has more teeth than any other land mammal. It can have from 80 to 100 teeth. They grow all the time like the teeth of rodents, look alike, and lack enamel. Since they don\u2019t help the armadillo catch or eat its prey, scientists aren\u2019t sure what that many teeth are good for.\nA captive ocarro sleeps on average about 18 hours a day.\nUnlike some smaller armadillos, the giant armadillo can\u2019t completely roll itself into a protective ball.\nAn armadillo can eat all the termites in a single mound in one sitting. Then, they\u2019ll rest in what\u2019s left of the mound for about a day.\nMore facts: Glyptodonts are extinct, prehistoric armadillos that were even bigger than the giant armadillos. The glyptodont could be as big as a car and weigh over 2 tons. Its scientific name is Greek for \u201cgrooved tooth.\u201d\nGiant Armadillo Scientific name\nThe tatou\u2019s scientific name is Priodontes maximus. Maximus means \u201cthe biggest,\u201d in Latin, as it is the biggest living armadillo. Priodontes means \u201cfirst tooth\u201d in Latin. The giant armadillo is the only member of its species and genus.\nGiant Armadillo Appearance\nOther than its size, the giant armadillo is like other armadillos in that it has a carapace, much like a turtle. The carapace is made of scutes, which are bony scales made of the same substance as fingernails. These scales are large and cover the top of the animal\u2019s head and the top of its body. However, because the scales extend halfway down the sides, it\u2019s impossible for the armadillo to curl up into a ball. The tail and legs are protected by smaller, five-sided scales. Males are larger than females, and females have two teats.\nThe tatou is dark brown on top, with a band of yellow along its flanks. The head is cream-colored, long and narrow, and the underside is pale. Beneath the carapace, the animal\u2019s skin is nearly hairless, pink, and wrinkled.\nThe giant armadillo also has about a dozen bands made of tiny plates over its body and three to four bands on its neck. These hinged bands are adaptations that allow the animal to be more flexible than a turtle or even a glyptodont. Its tongue is long and wormlike. Its shape allows it to get into the nooks and crannies of termite and ant colonies and capture the insects.\nThe animal walks on the tips of its powerful third claws.\nGiant Armadillo displayed at the Harvard Museum of Natural History in Boston, MA.\nGiant Armadillo Behavior\nThe giant armadillo is nocturnal and spends most of its day in its burrow. When it leaves its burrow to find food, it does so alone. It uses its enlarged claws to tear apart even the toughest and driest termite mound and can balance on its tail and back legs to get to the top of some of them. The animal will also use this stance to protect itself against would-be predators while brandishing its dangerous claws. Even the smaller claws of the giant armadillo are formidable. The animal can also climb and is believed to know how to swim.\nAfter the armadillo has destroyed the termite nest, it will rest in the ruins for as long as 24 hours before returning to its burrow or finding another termite mound.\nGiant Armadillo Habitat\nThe ocarro is found throughout the northern part of South America save the eastern areas of Paraguay and Brazil. It\u2019s not found west of the Andes Mountains, though it\u2019s been discovered at elevations of up to 1640 feet above sea level. It prefers grasslands, forests, scrub forests, and cerrado grasslands. Cerrado grasslands are tropical savannas found in Brazil, particularly in the highlands, or Planalto. A giant armadillo usually has a range of at least 1112 acres.\nInterestingly, the large burrows of the giant armadillo are used by a variety of species, including birds, ocelots, small-eared dogs, and other mammals. Animals dust bathe in front of these burrows and check them for prey.\nGiant Armadillo Diet\nThe giant armadillo eats termites and certain species of ants. It is partial to the termite species Nasutitermitidae and Termitidae. It will also eat scorpions, millipedes, spiders, cockroaches, and beetles. The animal also eats worms, small snakes, and even carrion and has rarely been seen to eat fruit and seeds.\nGiant Armadillo Predators and threats\nThe armor of the giant armadillo is one of the adaptations that makes it nearly impervious to all but the largest predators, such as pumas and jaguars. Humans are the biggest threat to the animal, for humans alter their natural habitat, hunt them and run them over on the roads.\nThe giant armadillo has a low body temperature for a mammal, and its immune system is weak. Yet, it seems fairly resistant to diseases and parasites, though ticks have been found on some specimens.\nGiant Armadillo Reproduction and Life Cycle\nScientists aren\u2019t entirely sure how giant armadillos court and mate. From research on other types of armadillos, they assume that a pair stays together for the breeding season then parts ways after sharing a burrow. It\u2019s not known if there\u2019s a breeding season, and scientists don\u2019t know what the interval between breeding seasons is.\nThe female is pregnant for about 4 months then gives birth to one or rarely two pups. A pup weighs about a quarter of a pound and is weaned when it\u2019s between four and six months old. After they are weaned, the juvenile giant armadillo is independent. However, at least one juvenile armadillo called Alex was living with his mother in the Brazilian Pantanal even though he was over a year old and probably reproductively mature himself. Scientists believe that giant armadillos live about 12 to 15 years in the wild.\nScientists do not know if giant armadillo fathers have any role in the raising of their offspring.\nGiant Armadillo Population\nScientists aren\u2019t sure what the population of wild armadillos is, and the animals are difficult to keep in captivity. Many that are captured die on their way to a zoo or other facility. If they survive, they may refuse food, and even if they survive, no giant armadillo has ever bred while in captivity. Since they are excellent climbers, they can climb out of an enclosure and injure themselves, sometimes fatally. The best way to protect them is when they are in the wild. The giant armadillo is now protected in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, and Suriname. The conservation status of the animal shows as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.\nView all 111 animals that start with G"}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Pandas no longer endangerd; gorrilla numbers decline | CNN", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2016/09/04/world/giant-panda-endangered-downgrade-gorillas-decline/index.html", "text": "(CNN) There's mixed news in the animal kingdom, as one beloved species celebrates increased numbers and another slips closer to extinction.\nThese developments come from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species , which assesses a species' conservation status.\nFirst, the good news:\nThe giant panda is no longer an endangered species\nThanks to an increase in available habitat, the population of the giant panda rose 17% from 2004 to 2014, leading the IUCN to downgrade it from endangered to vulnerable.\nA nationwide census in 2014 found 1,864 giant pandas in the wild in China, up from 1,596 in 2004, the IUCN said in its report on the animal.\nRevered in Chinese culture, the giant panda was once widespread throughout southern China.\nSince the 1970s, it has been the focus of one of the most intensive, high-profile campaigns to recover an endangered species, after a census by the Chinese government found around 2,459 pandas in the world -- proof of its precarious position, according to the World Wildlife Fund\nGiant panda cub Nuan Nuan lives at the National Zoo in Kuala Lumpur.\nChina banned trading panda skins in 1981, and the enactment of the 1988 Wildlife Protection Law banned poaching and conferred the highest protected status to the animal. The creation of a panda reserve system in 1992 increased available habitats; today, there are 67 reserves in the country that protect 67% of the population and nearly 1.4 million hectares of habitat.\nMeanwhile, partnerships between the Chinese government and international conservation nongovernmental organizations and zoos have spread research, conservation and breeding efforts. Zoo Atlanta announced Saturday that 19-year-old Lun Lun, originally from China's Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, had given birth to twins\nThe improved status confirms that the Chinese government's reforestation and forest protection efforts are working, the IUCN said. But climate change still threatens to eliminate more than 35% of the panda's bamboo habitat in the next 80 years; hence the \"vulnerable\" designation, which means it's still at risk of extinction.\n\"The recovery of the panda shows that when science, political will and engagement of local communities come together, we can save wildlife and also improve biodiversity,\" said WWF Director General Marco Lambertini.\nNow, the bad news:\nThe eastern gorilla is critically endangered\nEastern gorillas populate the mountainous forests of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, northwest Rwanda and southwest Uganda, making them another victim of the region's civil wars.\nHunting of eastern gorillas, fueled by the spread of firearms, has led to a population decline of more than 70% in the past 20 years for the world's largest living primate, the IUCN said.\nThe eastern gorilla population, made up of two subspecies, is estimated to be fewer than 5,000, bumping it from endangered to critically endangered.\nOne of those subspecies, Grauer's gorilla, lost 77% of its population since 1994, declining from 16,900 individuals to just 3,800 in 2015, the IUCN said. The second subspecies, the mountain gorilla, is faring better, increasing its number to around 880 individuals, reversing a decline that began in 1996.\nThe mountain gorilla, seen here, is doing better than its counterpart, the Grauer's gorilla.\nThe change in status means four of six great apes are critically endangered, the eastern gorilla, western gorilla, Bornean orangutan and Sumatran orangutan. The chimpanzee and bonobo are considered endangered.\nIn the past 20 years, Grauer's gorillas have been severely affected by human activities, the victim of poaching for bushmeat for those working in mining camps and for commercial trade, the IUCN said.\n\"This illegal hunting has been facilitated by a proliferation of firearms resulting from widespread insecurity in the region,\" said the IUCN in a report on the animal . \"This rate of population loss is almost three times above that which qualifies a species as critically endangered.\"\nAdditional threats include habitat loss and degradation through agricultural and pastoral activities in DRC, along with extraction of resources, which puts added stress on natural habitats.\nIllegal mining has decimated the lowlands of Kahuzi-Biega National Park, a Grauer's gorilla habitat. Destruction of forest for timber, charcoal production and agriculture continues to threaten isolated gorilla populations in North Kivu and the Itombwe Massif."}

It is easily distinguished by its black eye-patches. A solitary animal, the giant panda mainly eats bamboo shoots. It may spend up to 16 hours a day feeding. Despite its diet being almost entirely herbivorous, the giant panda is classified as a carnivore. Once widespread in China, this shy animal is now very rare. As people have taken over more of the bamboo forest for farmland, the giant pandas have lost vital sources of their food. It is estimated there are around 1800 giant pandas still living in the wild."}

To celebrate 50 years of giant panda care, collaboration and conservation, we\u2019ve curated a collection of cute Cam moments from the past decade that connected viewers with nature, sparked pure panda joy and broke the internet.\nAug. 23, 2013 | Bao Bao is Born\nWitnessing a conservation success as rare as a giant panda birth \u2014 in real time, no less \u2014 makes the joyous event all the more special. In summer 2013, lucky Giant Panda Cam viewers watched Mei Xiang give birth to a bouncing baby Bao Bao. The cub\u2019s first on-screen appearance happened in the blink of an eye, but her loud squeals confirmed that the \u201cprecious treasure\u201d had arrived! Mother Mei Xiang gently picked up little Bao Bao \u2014 who was no bigger than a stick of butter \u2014 and immediately began cradling and caring for her.\nSept. 12, 2013 | A Sleepy Bao Bao\nGiant panda moms spend most of their time cradling their cub in its first weeks of life. When a cub is 3 weeks old, as Bao Bao is here, it weighs about 1.5 pounds. In this video, Bao Bao is tucked between Mei Xiang\u2019s arm and her chin. Thanks to the Giant Panda Cam, viewers could clearly see the cub as she snuggled with mom and gave an unbearably cute yawn.\nJan. 12, 2014 | Bao Bao Bites Her Foot\nWhile entertaining herself in the den, 4.5-month-old Bao Bao took a nibble of her rear paw. Young panda cubs explore the world with their mouths. Often, they initiate play sessions with a few not-so-ferocious bites. They chomp on everything from their paws and enrichment toys to Mei Xiang\u2019s ears!\nSept. 25, 2015 | Bei Bei Choo\nThe Giant Panda Cam offers a glimpse into the quieter moments of a day in the life of these beloved bears. Sometimes, it\u2019s these small moments that spark the most joy \u2014 like the time Bei Bei\u2019s peaceful slumber was briefly interrupted by a surprising sneeze!\nNov. 9, 2015 | Bei Bei\u2019s First Steps\nThe first years of a giant panda\u2019s life are a whirlwind of new experiences. Under mother Mei Xiang\u2019s watchful eye, 2.5-month-old Bei Bei took his first steps. It was one small step for panda \u2026 one adorably wobbly moment for all of us!\nBei Bei\u2019s Famous Falls\nOnce a giant panda cub has mastered walking, they start practicing their climbing skills. As they explore their surroundings and reach new heights, panda cubs may take a tumble. Luckily, they are physically robust and have thick, dense fur to cushion the landing. As Bei Bei grew, we watched him tumble out of many trees, only to get right back up and try again.\nJan. 31, 2021 | Panda Parents Sled in the Snow\nAs snow blanketed the Washington, D.C. region, the Smithsonian's National Zoo's animals woke up to a winter wonderland. For giant panda parents Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, the snow day brought slides, somersaults and pure panda joy.\nMay 9, 2021 | Like Mother, Like Son\nAt 8.5 months old, Xiao Qi Ji branched out into new places to play! He climbed up a tree while Mei Xiang sat near the base. While he was in the canopy, he dropped some small branches and twigs onto his mother below. She seemed to relish his mischievous play because she picked up the branches and scent-anointed with them!\nSep. 16, 2021 | A Splashing Good Time\nWhile keepers were cleaning the outdoor patio, curious 1-year-old Xiao Qi Ji jumped in the hose spray and had a splashing good time! Just like his parents, Xiao Qi Ji seems to enjoy playing in water, though each bear has his or her own unique style. In his update, keeper Marty Dearie remarked that the way Xiao Qi Ji interacted with the hose spray was similar to the way his older brother, Bei Bei, used to play. However, licking the spray \u2014 as he did Sept. 16 \u2014 is a trait that is unique to Xiao Qi Ji!\nJan. 3, 2022 | Snow Day for Xiao Qi Ji\nThere\u2019s something magical about watching giant pandas play in the snow. On Jan. 3, Washington D.C. experienced its first snow storm of 2022. Although Xiao Qi Ji was unsure of what to think of the snow in 2021, there was no denying his excitement about it this time around. He had a lot of fun rolling around, wrestling with Mei Xiang and even belly-sliding in the snow!\nThis story appears in the April 2022 issue of National Zoo News. Read previous panda updates here. On April 16, the Zoo will celebrate an enormous milestone \u2014 the 50th anniversary of its giant panda program!

Giant pandas keep contact by scent markers which have been left in their habitat. They use scent markers in their living area so that they can lead a peaceful coexistence. In this way, giant pandas will recognize and find their companions or keep their distance from each other.\n6. How good is pandas' vision?\nTheir vision is poor, because they usually live in deep valleys and lush forests with dim light.

Are there any pandas in other countries?\nNo, wild pandas only inhabit China, but other countries have borrowed animals from China.\n9. How often do pandas excrete?\nThey excrete 40 times a day.\n10. Are pandas easy to get along with for a human?\nNo, their cubs are not easy to get close to, and panda keepers have to wear panda costumes in order to take care of them.\n11. Do pandas easily reproduce?\nNo, it is very difficult for them, because the estrus cycle of female giant pandas only lasts for 3 days in a year. The courtship usually falls in March to May. According to scientific statistics, infertility rates are 78% and 90% in female and male giant pandas respectively.\n12.

Facts For All Kung Fu Panda Fans", "url": "https://kidadl.com/fun-facts/what-animal-is-master-shifu-facts-for-all-kung-fu-panda-fans", "text": "Every one of us has watched the Kung Fu Panda series and has at least once wondered what kind of animal is Master Shifu.\nThere are many different animal characters featured in the DreamWorks animated film franchise, the Kung Fu Panda trilogy - Kung Fu Panda, Kung Fu Panda 2, and Kung Fu Panda 3, television shorts and specials, two tv series - Kung Fu Panda, The Paws of Destiny and Kung Fu Panda - Legends of Awesomeness, digital comics, and various video games. We will dive deeper into the kind of animals featured in the series here.\nThe Kung Fu Panda series garnered a lot of success and made sense in a way as the animated movies showed the true sense to find the power within and people actually resonated with that. The title revolves around the dragon warrior Po and the furious five and their adventures with lots of antagonists. Master Shifu and Master Oogway are the two of the mentors of the protagonists seen in the movie since the first film. Dustin Hoffman plays the character of Master Shifu. However, Hoffman himself was not sure what kind of animal Shifu is. He thought Shifu was a raccoon when actually the species is a red panda.\nIf you enjoyed this article, why not also read about what animal is Arthur and what animal is Uniqua here on Kidadl?\nWhat is Master Shifu from?\nWe all know and love Master Shifu despite the character not being the center of the show. Remember when he taught our beloved Po the art of inner peace?\nMaster Shifu is Po's master in all the Kung Fu Panda series of feature films, video games, TV shows, and comics. The character is the headmaster of the Jade Palace and also the teacher/trainer of the Furious Five. Dustin Hoffman has done justice to the character and you will know this the moment you hear Shifu speak. DreamWorks has always been good when portraying talking animals in movies, like the Madagascar series and they have knocked it out of the park with Kung Fu Panda too. The first film revolves around a giant panda named Po who lives with his father and runs a food stall. Po dreams of becoming a kung fu master and training along with the furious five and Master Shifu teaches him the ways along with Master Oogway's inner peace technique. Po dreams of becoming the Master of the Valley of Peace.\nWhat kind of red panda is Shifu and why?\nAlthough many people do not know that Shifu is a red panda, people thought the character to be a raccoon.\nThe character of Master Shifu, although it looks like a raccoon, is actually a red panda as confirmed by the production house.\nHow old is Master Shifu?\nThis cannot be confirmed as it was not shown in any of the movies, the age of Master Shifu is a mystery.\nOnly Master Oogway's age was said to be thousands of years old and that is all we know. In the movie, Shifu has helped Master Rhino, Master Croc, and Master Ox before training Tai Lung. Shifu was shown of a younger age during flashback scenes in Kung Fu Panda 2 and the age can be considered to be around 60-70 years. Despite being a younger master, Shifu was a fearless trainer and molded Po in the franchise.\nWho plays Master Shifu?\nEveryone has wondered what kind of animal is Master Shifu. Dustin Hoffman, who gave his voice to the character, seemed confused himself when asked this question during an interview.\nMaster Shifu is voiced by Dustin Hoffman in the movies. Po is voiced by Jack Black in the movie among many other prominent names like Jackie Chan, Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, Lucy Liu, and David Cross.\nOther Animals That Feature In Kung Fu Panda\nThere are various animals shown in the Kung Fu Panda series. The series garnered a lot of success.\nPo is a giant panda who is the main protagonist of the series.\nMaster Shifu is a red panda and the main trainer of Po.\nGrand Master Oogway is a sage and the greatest kung fu master in history. The character is portrayed by a Galapagos tortoise. He was the headmaster of the Jade Palace before Shifu. He was attacked by his former friend, Kai who steals his chi and escapes. Kai is portrayed by a Chinese Black Pied cattle and is the villain in Kung Fu Panda 3.\nMaster Tigress is a South China tiger and part of the furious five.\nMaster Viper is a green tree viper.\nMaster Monkey as the name suggests is a Gee's golden langur.\nMaster Mantis is a Chinese mantis.\nMaster Crane is a black-necked crane.\nTai Lung is the protagonist of the first film and is portrayed as a snow leopard.\nLord Shen is the villain of the second installment of the film and is portrayed by a peacock.\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly facts for everyone to enjoy!

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Penguin Facts - Fact Animal", "url": "https://factanimal.com/penguins/", "text": "Penguin Profile\nPenguins are flightless, aquatic birds that spend half their lives in water, and on land. They mainly habitat the Southern Hemisphere, with only the Galapagos penguin, north of the equator.\nThey are members of the order Sphenisciformes and family Spheniscidae, and the number of extant penguin species is debated, somewhere between 17 \u2013 20 current living species in total.\nPenguin Facts Overview\nHabitat: Southern Hemisphere & Galapagos Islands Location: Angola, Antarctica, Argentina, Australia, Chile, Namibia, New Zealand, and South Africa Lifespan: 6 \u2013 25 Years (Depending on Species) Size: 1.3 \u2013 3.7 ft (0.4 \u2013 1.1 m) Weight: 2 \u2013 78 Pounds (1 \u2013 35 kg) Color: Black on their back, and white on their front. Some species have distinct markings or colors, such as yellow and orange. Diet: Seafood, such as fish, krill, squid Predators: Seals, Sea Lion, Killer Whales. Top Speed: 6 \u2013 9 kph (4 \u2013 6 mph) No. of Species:\n17 \u2013 20 Conservation Status:\n5 Species Endangered: Northern Rockhopper, Erect-crested, Yellow-eyed, African, Galapagos. 5 Species Vulnerable: Humboldt, Macaroni, S. Rockhopper, Fiordland, Snares. 3 Species Near-Threatened: Emperor, Magellanic, Royal.\nThey range from the Little Blue (or Fairy) Penguin (Eudyptula minor) which stands just 40-centimetres tall to the Emperor Penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) which averages just over 1-metre tall.\nDepending on the species, Penguins can weight from as little as 1-kilogram up to 40-kilograms and can live to 20 years. These meat eaters are usually found in coastal waters as well as areas that that are covered in ice.\nOne misconception about Penguins is that they are all cold weather creatures. They are native to the southern hemisphere and are found not just in the Antarctic. Many species inhabit warmer climates with one in particular \u2013 the Galapagos Penguin \u2013 that calls the region near the Equator home.\nInteresting Penguin Facts\n1. Penguins can\u2019t fly, but they sure can swim.\nThe wings of the Penguin have actually become flippers. This means they are somewhat clumsy on land, but can really move underwater. In fact, they are so agile ducking and weaving about that their actions in water look much like a bird in flight in air.\n2. Penguins are speedy underwater and are deep sea divers.\nWhen a Penguin dives into the water it can reach a speed of up to 12-kilometres per hour and when in high gear, some can reach up to 27 km/h. As for diving, the larger penguins can go deeper, with Emperor Penguins capable of diving down to depths of 565-metres \u2013 with dives lasting up to 22-minutes.\n3. The average Penguin spends as much time on land as it does in the water.\nActually, they will spend half of their life in one or the other.\n4. Penguins have devised ways to travel on land that would otherwise be hampered by their overall body shape and length of their legs.\nThey slide across snow on their bellies in a move known as tobogganing. When upright, Penguins waddle on foot or jump with both feet together in order to navigate terrain.\n5. Although the actual number is not clearly known, there are many Penguin species.\nThe common belief is that there are between 17 and 20 different Penguin species on the planet.\n6. Penguins use a layer of air for various benefits.\nWhen underwater, the layer of air that is trapped in the smooth plumage of the bird provides buoyancy. The air layer also acts as an insulator when in cold water.\n7. The diet of the Penguin is met with underwater diving.\nIt may look like they are playing, but since the Penguin feeds on sea life while swimming, it spends a lot of time in the water. One species, the Gentoo Penguin, can make up to 450 dives in a day when foraging for food.\n8. Penguins have special underwater vision.\nThe eyes of the Penguin have special adaptations which provide superior underwater vision. It assists in finding food and spotting predators.\n9. Penguins are highly social.\nBecause they tend to live in large colonies, Penguins have constant opportunities for social interaction and as a result have a number of vocal and visual signals that they have developed in order to communicate with one another.\n10. They have large extended families.\nPenguins also breed in large colonies. The Gentoo Penguin colonies can number just 100 pairs where other species have colonies in the size of several hundreds of thousands.\n11. Penguins know the value of working together.\nIn harsh environments, Penguins will huddle together to stay warm and conserve energy. Once a bird in the centre has warmed up, it moves to the perimeter and this continues so that each Penguin gets a turn in the centre of the huddle.\n12. Monogamy is common in the Penguin world.\nPairs will stick together during the breeding season. Often they will re-couple afterwards, or it depends. Sometimes a couple just goes their separate ways after the young have hatched and grow old enough to take care of themselves.\n13. Homosexuality is part of the Penguin culture.\nPenguins have the distinction of having the most widely publicized homosexual relationships of the entire animal kingdom.\n14. Penguins have small families.\nA typical clutch is two eggs however, the King and Emperor \u2013 the largest of the Penguin species \u2013 only have a single egg in a clutch. When measured proportionately to the adult Penguin body weight, these birds have the smallest eggs of any bird species on the planet.\n15. Roughly 99.999% of the Penguin species will share the incubation duties.\nIt\u2019s true, males take on as much of the work as females in the care of the eggs of their young. Well, that is with one exception. The male Emperor Penguin does not participate in this process.\n16. It\u2019s a good thing that most of the male Penguins pitch in with incubation shifts.\nWhen one part of the Penguin couple ventures off to sea in order to feed, the incubating egg is left with the other partner. Sometimes the shift can go days and even months simply because the ice pack can form leaving open ocean as much as 80-kilometres away from the colony.\n17. Penguins have incredible hearing.\nIt is with their sensitive hearing that parents and chicks are able to locate each other in a crowded colony.\n18. Penguins have a built-in camouflage.\nThe counter shading of the Penguin plumage \u2013 black backs with white fronts \u2013 protect these birds from most prey that cannot distinguish a swimming Penguin from sun shimmering on the water surface when viewed from deep in the water below. The dark plumage on their backs helps to \u2018hide\u2019 them from above.\n19. They have no land predators.\nPenguins are safe in colonies on land as they have no predators except those living in the water. This is very likely why Penguins have little or no fear of humans. Humans have taken advantage of this and have been able to conduct many studies on these interesting birds without much problem.\n20. The size of the Penguin can tell you where they are from.\nThe larger Penguin species inhabit the colder climates. This obviously means that the smaller Penguin species would live in the warmer climates of the world.\nPenguin Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification\nKingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Sphenisciformes Family: Spheniscidae\nGenus & Species List"}

They are endangered because people are cutting down the bamboo that pandas eat to make farms.\nPandas can eat more than 10,000 kilograms of bamboo a day.\nThe mother panda can only take care of the baby panda for half a year (6 months).\nPeople can\u2019t tell if a baby panda is a girl or a boy for four years.\nThe mother panda only has one baby every two years.\nPandas have black on their eyes.\nPandas live in China on the mountainsides.\nIf all the bamboo is covered in snow the pandas will eat little mice or uncovered leaves.\nPandas are pink when they are born.\nPanda mothers nurse their babies. Pandas are mammals.\nPandas are black and white.\nThe Giant Panda is found exclusively in China where it inhabits mountain forests that are dense with bamboo and conifers. They thrive in altitudes of 5,000 to 10,000 feet in cold, damp forest. Which makes them accustomed to torrential rains and dense mist throughout the year.

(2) These are typically located in mountain ranges in central China. (4)\nleesonphoto.photoshelter.com\nThese pandas have black fur on their ears, legs, shoulders, muzzle, and around their eyes, and they have white fur covering the rest of their body. These colors could be used to provide camouflage in their snowy and rocky habitat. They also have thick fur, which keeps them warm in their cool environment.(2)\nPandas usually stick to bamboo as their meal choice (99% of the time), however, they also eat small rodents and musk deer fawns occasionally. (2) When eating, they position themselves like a human sitting down. (2,3)\nwww.desk7.net\nDespite their diet that is mainly vegetation, pandas have a digestive system like that of a carnivore. Because of this most of what they eat is digested as waste, so they have to consume 20-40 pounds of food a day. This means they have to eat for 10-16 hours a day. The rest of their day is usually spent sleeping and resting. Most of the water pandas consume come from the bamboo they eat. However, the bamboo does not provide enough water to sustain them so they also drink fresh water from rivers and streams. (2)\nThe species of the giant panda has been endangered for almost 30 years. There are only about 1,800 pandas left in the world. Their slow population rate makes it hard for them to procreate faster than they are dying.\nThreats to the Giant Pandas\nThe giant pandas\u2019 main threats are hunting and habitat loss. The region of China where most of the pandas are located is growing, and there are many roads and railroads being built within their forests. These developments isolate panda populations and decrease breeding. Although the Chinese government has established panda reserves, forest destruction is still a huge threat. The reserves only protect about 61% of the panda population in China. One of the giant pandas\u2019 biggest threats used to be poaching them for their fur. This happens less because of strict laws and public awareness of the pandas\u2019 protected status, however, hunters still accidentally kill pandas while hunting for other animals in their habitat. (1)\nWhy Are They Important?\nwww.worldwildlife.org\nThe greatest consequence of letting the giant panda become extinct would be the impact it will have on its surrounding ecosystem. The elimination of the panda from its habitat will throw everything around it off balance. Pandas help the bamboo forests by spreading seed and facilitating the growth of vegetation. Besides the other wildlife that are dependent on this, nearby communities also use the forests for food, income, fuel, and medicine. The habitat of the pandas is a huge part of the economy of China. It brings economic benefits to China through ecotourism. (1,2)\nHow Can They Be Saved?\nPandas can be saved through a number of things, many of which involve saving their habitat. Things like putting a larger amount of the panda habitat under legal protection and creating green corridors to provide a safe passageway for panda populations that have been separated. (1)\nTo prevent extinction from hunting, the area could be patrolled. There are organizations,like the World Wildlife Fund,that work to provide protection for endangered species like the giant panda.\nSources\nDillon, Tom, and Colby Loucks. \u201cGiant Panda.\u201d WorldWildlife.org.

They are black and white bears that live in temperate-zone bamboo forests in central China. Among the best recognized but rarest animals in the world, they have come to symbolize endangered species and conservation efforts. Here are some facts about this lovely animal:\nScientific Classification\nKingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Carnivora Family: Ursidae Genus: Ailuropoda Species: A. melanoleuca\nBinomial Name: Ailuropoda melanoleucaGiant Panda Range Subspecies: A. melanoleuca melanoleuca ; A. melanoleuca qinlingensis\nGeographic Distribution\nGiant pandas live in a few mountain ranges in central China's Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. They once lived in lowland areas, but farming, forest clearing, and other development now restrict giant pandas to the mountains.\nHabitat\nGiant pandas live in broadleaf and coniferous forests with a dense understory of bamboo, at elevations between 5,000 and 10,000 feet. Torrential rains or dense mist throughout the year characterizes these forests, often shrouded in heavy clouds.\nPhysical Description\nA giant panda is bear-like in shape. It has black fur on ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white. Although scientists do not know why these unusual bears are black and white, some speculate that the bold coloring provides effective camouflage into their shade-dappled snowy and rocky surroundings. The panda's thick, wooly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat. Giant pandas have large molar teeth and strong jaw muscles for crushing tough bamboo. Many people find these chunky, lumbering animals to be cute, but giant pandas can be as dangerous as any other bear.\nSize\nAbout the size of an American black bear, giant pandas stand between two and three feet tall at the shoulder (on all four legs), and reach four to six feet long. Males are larger than females, weighing up to 250 pounds in the wild. Females rarely reach 220 pounds.\nStatus\nThe giant panda is listed as endangered in the World Conservation Union's (IUCN's) Red List of Threatened Animals. It is one of the most critically endangered species in the world. There are about 1,000 left in the wild. About 140 pandas live in zoos and breeding centers around the world, mostly in China.\nLife Span\nScientists are not sure how long giant pandas live in the wild, but they are sure it is shorter than lifespans in zoos. Chinese scientists have reported zoo pandas as old as 35.\nDiet\nA wild giant panda's diet is almost exclusively (99 percent) bamboo. The balance consists of other grasses and occasional small rodents or musk deer fawns. In zoos, giant pandas eat bamboo, sugar cane, rice gruel, a special high-fiber biscuit, carrots, apples, and sweet potatoes.\nSocial Structure\nAdult giant pandas are generally solitary, but they do communicate periodically through scent marks, calls, and occasional meetings. Offspring stay with their mothers from one and a half to three years.\nGiant Panda FAQs:\n-Does the panda hibernate for the winter?\nUnlike the other bears, the giant panda does not hibernate for the winter.\nHow to say panda in Chinese?\nIn Chinese, panda is spelled in xi\u00f3ng m\u0101o. The characters are \u718a\u732b\n-The panda likes hot or cold?\nThe panda has no fear of the harsh winter, but the hot summer.\n-Can the panda climb trees?\nAll the pandas are experts for climbing trees.\n-Can the panda swim?\nThe panda like water, it can swim.\n-How about the panda's hearing and smell?\nThe panda has got very sensitive hearing and a good nose.\n-How about the vision of the giant panda?\nNaturally, the giant panda has poor eyesight for always living in the dense forests.\n-The pandas eat flesh?\nThe progenitors of pandas were carnivorous. Today, they still keep some habits from their progenitors. Provided circumstances permit they will eat flesh.\n-How many pandas are left in the world?\nChina currently has about 1,000 giant pandas in the wild, most of them living on the mountains around the Sichuan Basin, southwest China\uff0caccording to the Ministry of Forestry.\n-What is being done to save giant pandas?\nCurrently, the Chinese government in conjunction with the WWF are doing all that is possible to save the giant panda. This includes further research on how to manipulate bamboo to be sturdier and faster to recover after die-off cycles. In addition the following is being done:\nConservation education and public awareness activities; international breeding programs in zoos around the world. Creation of 14 new panda reserves in China bringing the total of giant panda reserves to 26. Corridors, forest links, between the isolated populations are being constructed to help increase the range in which the panda lives in order that the exchange of genetic material between wild populations will increase. Continued research and artificial insemination of giant pandas attempt to continually increase their numbers.\n-What are giant panda's enemies?\nMan is the giant panda's most dangerous. The adult giant panda has very few natural enemies. One of the known enemies of the giant panda is the snow leopard, which may seize a baby panda that has wondered away from its mother or a pack of wild dogs may also capture a wondering cub. The continued population growth in China slowly and steadily depletes the bamboo forests and replaces them with cities or additional farming areas. To a lesser degree the Bamboo Rat which burrows underground, eats the roots of the bamboo growth which obviously kills the plant, leaving one less plant for the giant panda to eat.\n-What is the life span of a giant panda?\nThe average life span of the giant panda, in the wild is about 15 years, but in captivity they have been known to live well into their 20's and rarely into their 30's.\n-How does that giant panda protect itself against its enemies?\nGiant pandas signify aggression by lowering their heads and staring at their opponents. The giant panda is a generally a passive animal and not initiate to attack man or other animals. Giant pandas, however can become violent when provoked or surprised. Generally when hearing abnormal sounds the giant panda will escape the area immediately or they will climb the nearest tree. Should they become trapped the giant panda will cover their face with their paws often hiding its eye-patches and curl up. This gesture states that they are scared and/or angry. At close range, aggression is signaled by a swipe with a paw, or by a low-pitched growl or bark that will generally send an opponent (another giant panda) scampering up the nearest tree.\n-Why are giant pandas endangered?\nHabitat encroachment and destruction are the greatest threats to the continued existence of the giant panda. This is mainly because of the demand for land and natural resources by China's one billion plus inhabitants. In addition giant pandas are also susceptible to poaching, or illegal killing, as their dense fur carries a high price in the black markets in the Far East.\n-How can I help save or assist in financing research for giant pandas?\nYou can adopt the giant panda in four places south China's Sichuan Province: The Fengtongzhai Natural Reserve, Chengdu Zoo, Bifengxia Panda Base, Chengdu Giant Panda Base, and the Wolong Panda Reserve.\nThe below tour packages are perfect for travelers who want to learn more fact about China pandas\n5-Day China Panda Tour\n8-Day Grand Sichuan Tour\n10-Day Best Of Sichuan\n15-Day China Panda Trip\n30-Day China Panda Bear Tour"}

There are an estimated 1,800 pandas left in the wild with the numbers increasing.\nThreats\nThe improved status shows that the government's efforts to help conserve the panda have been somewhat effective. But there are still obstacles to overcome, including habitat loss and the impact of the climate crisis on bamboo, the panda's main food source.\nHabitat Loss\nAlthough the giant panda has experienced a recent increase in some habitat in China, habitat loss continues to be the primary threat facing the species, according to the IUCN. Giant pandas lived in China's bamboo forests for several million years, but their numbers were decimated as humans cleared acres of habitat for homes and agriculture, roads and mining.\nIn 1988, the Chinese government banned logging in the panda\u2019s habitat.\ufeff\ufeff But new roads and railways are still being built in the area. That not only clears trees, but also fragments the forests, isolating small groups of panda populations.\nFragmentation\nThe panda population has as many as 33 subpopulations, and more than half of those contain fewer than 10 individuals, reports the IUNC. These small groups are often cut off from habitat, food sources, and from other pandas.\nBecause some of these subpopulations are so small, conservation geneticists are concerned about inbreeding in these groups.\ufeff\ufeff It\u2019s often linked with decreased fertility and can impact survival rates.\nClimate Crisis and Bamboo\nBamboo makes up about 90% of a panda\u2019s diet, according to the WWF.\ufeff\ufeff Because bamboo is low in nutrients, pandas eat a lot of it, spending about 12 hours a day munching on the thick stalks and leaves.\ufeff\ufeff\nBut bamboo may be quite vulnerable to the climate crisis. Depending on the species, some bamboo only reproduces every 15 to 100 years. Others only thrive at certain temperatures or elevations.\nBamboo makes up about 90% of a panda's diet. Craig Sellars / Getty Images\nWith warming temperatures and changing habitats, pandas have limited access to bamboo, says the IUCN.\ufeff\ufeff One study published in the journal Nature Climate Change predicted that global warming will wipe out much of the bamboo the bears rely on for food.\ufeff\ufeff\nThe IUCN says the climate crisis is predicted to eliminate more than one-third of the panda\u2019s bamboo habitat in the next 80 years. As a result, they expect the panda population to decline, \"reversing the gains made during the last two decades.\u201d\nPoaching\nPoaching was a problem in the past, as the animals were hunted for their fur. But China passed the Wildlife Protection Law, enacted in 1988 and revised in 2016, which banned the breeding, hunting, and selling of hundreds of animals including the giant panda.\ufeff\ufeff However, the IUCN points out that pandas are sometimes still accidentally caught in traps set out for other animals.\nWhat We Can Do\nA census in the mid-1970s found only 2,459 pandas in China, according to the WWF, which alerted the government to the species' precarious position.\ufeff\ufeff Since then, the panda has been the focus of a high-profile campaign to save the species.\nSince that eye-opening report, poaching has been banned, panda nature reserves have been created, and partnerships between the Chinese government and zoos around the world have assisted with breeding and research efforts.\nChina now has a network of 67 panda reserves, which protect more than 66% of the giant pandas in the wild and nearly 54% of their existing habitat.\ufeff\ufeff In partnership with the WWF, the Chinese government has developed bamboo corridors to allow pandas to more easily move to new areas, find more food, and meet more potential mates, which will also help improve genetic diversity.\nAlthough recent population increases show that some success has been achieved, the panda still needs help. The IUCN notes that the Chinese government plans to continue to protect panda habitat and monitor population. \u201cThey recognize the challenges the future holds, and in particular will seek to address problems of habitat connectivity and population fragmentation.\u201d\nTo help giant pandas, you can donate to the WWF to conserve the species and their habitats."}

[Explained] - BestofPanda", "url": "https://bestofpanda.com/do-giant-pandas-have-sharp-teeth/", "text": "Pandas look so adorable, cute, and fluffy. Whenever we think of them, we picture them eating bamboo or cuddling around with each other. But is this all they do? I was wondering that do giant pandas have sharp teeth like carnivorous animals?\nIn this article, we are definitely going to have an insight about giant pandas having sharp teeth.\nSo, let\u2019s look into the matter that do giant pandas have sharp teeth, and if they have them, what do they do with them.\nDo panda bears have sharp teeth?\nGiant pandas actually have very sharp teeth, including incisors and canines. If we look into their mouth, we will find out that an adult giant panda has 42 teeth.\nSurprising, isn\u2019t it? Even humans have only 32 teeth, and they have 42 \u2013 just to eat bamboo!\nThe upper jaw alone consists of six incisors, two canines, eight premolars, and five molars. The lower jaw follows the same dental formula, and both of them together contribute to the total number of 42 teeth.\nMost of us might have the idea that canines are very strong and sharp teeth that are mostly present in carnivorous animals. The main purpose of canines is to crack the bones and tear the flesh away.\nThe teeth of giant pandas still show that they were originally carnivorous \u2013 but later changed into herbivorous animals. Now, with these pairs of canines, they can easily bite the hard bamboo stalks. The jaws of giant pandas are also very strong to facilitate them in chewing bamboo.\nThese canines are one reason why people consider giant pandas as ferocious and wild animals. Little do they know that even after nature made them carnivorous, just to avoid the fight, they adapted themselves as herbivorous. Such is the nature of giant panda bears!\nWhat do giant pandas teeth look like?\nNow when we know the answer to the question that \u201cdo giant pandas have sharp teeth?\u201d we must talk about what do they actually look like.\nHaving a closer look at the giant pandas\u2019 jaw will reveal a lot upon us. It\u2019s quite surprising that their jaws do not quite complement their innocence. They do look quite dangerous with this set of teeth.\nThe incisors are relatively very small. After the six incisors in the middle, there is a little space between incisors and canines. Four canines are present \u2013 two in the upper jaw and the other two in the lower jaw.\nThey look very sharp and pointed. The canines are quite longer and stronger than the other teeth. They were actually meant for tearing flesh and breaking bones.\nJust after the canines, there are premolar and then molars. Molars have quite a broad surface that aids in the proper chewing of food \u2013 particularly bamboo.\nSince it\u2019s difficult for the giant panda bodies to metabolically digest bamboo, they do so by chewing it properly between their teeth so that it does not cause any trouble.\nOn the whole, the giant panda teeth do look a bit too scary for such a cute and adorable animal. But, what can we possibly do? As long as they do not harm us, we are good!\nWhy do giant pandas have canine teeth?\nGiant pandas\u2019 canines were essentially meant to make them adapt to the carnivorous lifestyle. The strong canines were so sharp that they could easily crack bones of other animals and tear away the flesh as well.\nHowever, ever since the giant pandas moved away from the carnivorous lifestyle, they utilize their two pairs of canines to break and bite the hard and stiff bamboo stalks.\nThus, the giant pandas are very effectively making use of their canines. For this reason, they are still present in the giant pandas\u2019 mouths \u2013 otherwise, they would have been subject to evolution and eventually would have disappeared with time.\nHow strong are giant pandas teeth?\nAccording to a study, it is suggested that the giant panda teeth are so strong that they have the teeth bite force of 2603.47 newtons and a bite force quotient of 292. This is enough evidence to tell how it is possible for the giant pandas to break away and chew bamboo so easily.\nGiant panda teeth are undoubtedly so strong to crack the bones of other animals. Probably that\u2019s one reason why they easily prey on small animals such as rats, rodents, and squirrels. Even if they try to break bones, it won\u2019t be a problem for them.\nIn some cases, these strong teeth might help giant pandas save themselves from predator attacks. Although it is very unlikely, they must use them. So, that\u2019s another answer for do giant pandas have sharp teeth, and even it tells how sharp and strong they actually are!\nDo red pandas have sharp teeth?\nAlthough both of them are known as pandas, they are not each other\u2019s close relatives. Red pandas come from the family Ailuridae, whereas giant pandas belong to the class Ursidae. However, since both of them eat bamboo \u2013 they are generally termed \u201cpandas.\u201d\nIt is quite important to notice that if both the red and giant pandas eat bamboo, do they have the same structure of teeth as well?\nAlthough the red panda is smaller than the giant panda, and its jaw appears to be small, it possesses razor-sharp teeth. Just like the giant pandas, they were also carnivorous, feeding upon large animals that needed preying.\nThe red pandas teeth \u2013 like the giant pandas\u2019 teeth \u2013 can easily tear flesh or break bones of other animals, but pandas use it for chewing bamboo. So, it\u2019s kind of justified that why do giant pandas have sharp teeth and what do they use them for.\nConclusion\nToday, we learned that giant pandas indeed have sharp teeth. The bite force of giant pandas is definitely somewhat closer to that of a lion. This is because both of them are essentially carnivorous animals.\nThe total number of teeth is well adapted to kill any animal that comes across its way.\nThe strength of giant pandas\u2019 teeth is undoubtedly so high as to break bones, they still tend to feed on bamboo. Thus, they do not quite admire their carnivorous side more than their herbivorous side.\nFor this reason, we will find giant pandas eating fruits, vegetables, cakes, pastries, and other stuff \u2013 but not what they should eat \u2013 raw meat. Probably, the fact that they do not eat meat is responsible for their lesser wildness than other carnivorous animals.\nFor more interesting facts about giant pandas, where they live, what they eat, whether they have thumbs or whiskers, or whatever comes to mind, you can visit our blog and read on it.\nWe update our blog with the latest and new information about giant pandas and their lifestyle."}

It has also been the logo of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) since 1961.\nDespite its exalted status, the giant panda is a victim of indiscriminate human interference with wildlife. Previously classified as Endangered, the giant panda population in the wild has increased by around 17 percent in the last decade. It has been made possible by the combined conservation efforts of the Chinese government, the WWF, and local communities. Hence, although they are no longer tagged as Endangered, giant pandas are still vulnerable to the loss of natural habitats.\nHowever, people often get confused as to whether the giant panda and red panda are truly bears. If it baffles you as well, you'll find all your answers right here. So, read on to find out how a giant panda is different from a red panda and which one of them is really a bear!\nFurther reads such as do pandas have tails and red panda adaptations will help you discover more about the red pandas.\nWhy are they called pandas?\nThe giant panda is a bear of the bear family Ursidae. Even though it shares a common name with the red panda, the latter is not a bear and belongs to a distinct family of its own called Ailuridae.\nThe term panda is believed to have its roots in the Nepalese word 'nigalya ponya', which translates to 'bamboo eater' in English. Thus, the name panda essentially refers to the bamboo-based diet of both giant and red pandas even though the two animals are classified separately. In fact, the red panda was described way before the giant panda, and the latter was named 'panda' due to the similarities the two species share, like feeding on bamboo shoots. The giant panda is also known as the bamboo bear, panda bear, or in Chinese as 'Daxiongmao,' which means 'the large bear cat.'\nAre pandas considered a bear?\nIf we go by common names, there are two types of pandas: the giant panda and the red panda. However, only of them is considered a bear species.\nThere has been a long drawn debate among scientists as to whether the giant panda is a bear, a raccoon, or has a separate family of its own. Why? The giant pandas and red pandas have characteristics common with both a bear and a raccoon. However, with evidence from recent genetic studies indicating that the giant panda is more closely related to a bear, it is categorized in the bear family Ursidae.\nThe giant pandas are bears with an unmistakable black and white fur-covered body. Their eye patches, muzzle, ears, legs, and shoulder band are black, with the rest of the pelage whitish. Since these gentle giants inhabit the mountains, they have thick, woolly coats to keep them warm in their cold habitat. In addition, the giant pandas have two distinctive physical features adapted to a bamboo-based diet. First, their enlarged wrist bone works like an opposable thumb, and second, they have flat, broad, molar teeth for efficiently holding, crushing, and eating bamboo.\nIs a red panda a bear?\nThe red panda is not a bear and is the only living member of its family, Ailuridae.\nThe giant panda's lineage is not the only thing that has baffled scientists for centuries. The red pandas have been a subject of much speculation since the animals share characteristics with both a bear and a raccoon. Even though red pandas have earlier been placed in the bear and raccoon families, later phylogenetic studies have classified them into a separate family Ailuridae. The Ailuridae family is part of the Musteloidea superfamily and also includes the families of raccoons, weasels, and skunks. So, the red panda is more closely related to a raccoon than a bear while having its own identity.\nThe red pandas have a bear-like body with a thick covering of reddish-brown fur. They are slightly larger than a domestic cat, with the males slightly heavier than the females. While most of its pelage is reddish-brown, the limbs and belly are black with white markings on the sides of the head, above the ears, and around the snout. The red pandas are endemic to the Himalayan temperate forests and mostly eat bamboo along with birds, small mammals, flowers, berries, and eggs. They are skilled climbers.\nDifference Between Pandas and Bears\nEven though the giant panda is classified as a bear, the two animals have their differences.\nGiant pandas differ from other bear species in several aspects. For example, while most bear species hibernate, such as the grizzly bear and the American black bear, the giant panda does not. Moreover, the giant pandas have a modified bone or thumb in their paw, which helps the animals to hold bamboo while eating. Bears, on the contrary, have this bone, but it is very small. Another difference between pandas and bears is in terms of their diet. While giant pandas mainly eat bamboo, other bears have a diverse diet comprising small mammals, insects, fish, larvae, berries, roots, grass, and succulents. Bears may also prey on deer, moose, elk, or other hoofed wildlife. Besides eating the shoots, leaves, and stems of various bamboo species, giant pandas may also supplement their diet with fish, small rodents, and mammals.\nCaptive Vs Wild Pandas\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List categorizes the wild population of giant pandas as Vulnerable. Keeping them in captivity is the only way to save these wild animals.\nCaptive pandas are found in zoos and breeding centers both inside China and outside the country. While giant pandas in the wild typically have a lifespan of around 20 years, those in captivity live for 30 years or more. Mimicking its wild diet, giant pandas in a zoo are provided a bamboo diet along with other dietary supplements. In the wild, the breeding season of pandas occurs between March and May. The normal reproductive rate is pretty low, with females producing one giant panda cub every two years. A newborn panda is no bigger than a stick of butter, and if twins are born, the weaker of the two young cubs die in the wild due to starvation. However, captive breeding programs have proved fruitful in saving and reclaiming their numbers. The giant panda is solitary in nature and will hardly ever be seen with other pandas, except during the mating season. Although captive pandas are shown as cuddly creatures, they are essentially bears and can turn aggressive towards humans if threatened.\nHabitat Of Pandas\nGiant pandas inhabit the mountainous bamboo forests of southwest China.\nThe primary habitat of giant pandas is the temperate forests located high up in the mountains of southwest China. These forests are abundant with bamboo trees, the panda's predominant food source. Currently, the giant panda population is restricted to 20 isolated patches in six mountain ranges in China's Sichuan, Gansu, and Shannxi provinces. Other than humans, the adult giant pandas have few natural predators in the wild. However, panda cubs are vulnerable to predation by the Asian black bear, eagles, yellow-throated martens, snow leopards, and feral dogs.\nHow can I help red pandas?\nThe red panda is an Endangered animal with less than 10,000 individuals left in the wild. The WWF is actively involved in conservation efforts geared towards protecting the red pandas and their habitat. Here's what you can do to help save the red pandas:\nMake a symbolic red panda adoption and support WWF's conservation efforts.\nJoin WWF in a pledge to protect forests and solve the world's greatest environmental problems.\nSpread awareness, donate, raise funds, take part in ecotourism, and stand against the red panda trade in association with non-profit organizations such as the Red Panda Network.\nDid you know?\nPandas don't hibernate because their bamboo diet provides almost zero fat reserves to last through the winter months.\nBesides protecting from the cold, the fluffy tail of red pandas helps the animals keep a steady stance while walking along tree branches or rock ledges. Plus, they love the snow!\nRed pandas communicate with each other through grunts, hisses, squeals, twitters, and huff-quacks. They are mostly solitary, but a group of them can be called a pack. Despite being adorable, they are wild and wouldn't make good pets.\nGrizzly bears are more than thrice the size of giant pandas!\nHere at Kidadl, we have carefully created lots of interesting family-friendly facts for everyone to enjoy!

Not actually big cats, these American lions are known for their uniqueness: from their world records to their house-cat-like qualities. Don\u2019t believe us? Here are 11 mountain lion facts that will show you we aren\u2019t \u201clion\u201d about how incredible these cats are!\n1.Mountain lions have more names than any other animal in the world\nMountain lions are known by many names Ultrashock/Shutterstock.com\nDid you know that mountain lions, pumas, and cougars are all the same animal? As of now, mountain lions hold the record for having the most names with 40 different nicknames. Some of the most common mountain lion alternative names are\nPuma\nCougar\nPanther\nCatamount\nPainter\nMountain screamer\nMexican lion\nRed lion\nGhost cat\nAmerican lion.\nWhile you may see it known mostly as a mountain lion in day-to-day life, often, scientists prefer to call these stealthy predators \u201cpumas\u201d. This is because of their scientific name, which is Puma concolor.\nMountain lions have lots of names, but it\u2019s important not to get them confused with other American cats, such as bobcats or lynxes. While still cool cats, these are different animals than the mountain lion.\n2. Mountain lions don\u2019t roar\n\u2026but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t communicate in plenty of other ways! Mountain lions\u2019 have a different larynx than most of the big cats you may be used to, such as tigers and lions. As a result, they communicate in different ways, such as chirping, growling, shrieking, and even purring.\n3. Mountain lions live in nearly every ecosystem in America\nA mountain lion feeding Ipatov/Shutterstock.com\nWith a diverse diet and the ability to live in everywhere from rain forests to deserts to snowy mountains, you\u2019ll be able to find mountain lions in almost every ecosystem in North and South America.\n4. The largest mountain lion ever recorded weighed 276 pounds\nWhile mountain lions rarely weigh over 200 pounds, one record-holding ghost cat weighed in at 276. pounds! For comparison, that\u2019s more than a giant panda, which averages at about 245 pounds. It\u2019s also about the average size of a female lion, which weighs about 280 pounds.\n5. Mountain lion cubs have blue eyes and spots\nA mountain lion cub showing off its distinctive spots Chris Desborough/Shutterstock.com\nIf you ever found a mountain lion cub out in the wild, you probably wouldn\u2019t recognize it!\nWhen mountain lions are first born, and even while they\u2019re growing up, they look vastly different than their adult counterparts. The most noticeable differences? Their blue eyes and dark spots on their fur. As they mature, their eyes will shift to yellow and their spots will fade into their iconic tawny coat, becoming almost unrecognizable over the course of just a few weeks. If you enjoyed this fun fact, baby lions exhibit the exact same traits!\n6. One subspecies of the mountain lion is highly endangered\nWhile mountain lions are known for their ability to live in almost every ecosystem found in North and South America, there is one subspecies that has been endangered for several decades.\nThe Florida panther, one subspecies of the mountain lion, has been listed as endangered since 1967. One of the main causes identified has been human development, which is destroying the mountain lion\u2019s habitat and making it more difficult for them to access food. Roads also pose a large threat to mountain lions, especially since they tend to roam at night where they may not be seen by drivers until it\u2019s too late.\nHowever, decades of conservation efforts have helped the population increase from a few dozen to the 120-230 adult mountain lions currently alive as estimated by Florida Wildlife Control in 2021.\n7. Mountain lions can run up to 50 mph\nMountain Lion Close Up (Felis Concolor) Kwadrat/Shutterstock.com\nOne of the coolest facts about mountain lions? Proportionally, they have the largest legs out of all of the members of the feline family. This helps mountain lions adapt to a variety of situations and terrains \u2013 but most importantly, it helps them reach impressive speeds of up to 50 miles per hour!\nEven though they can only maintain this top speed for a short period of time, they are able to maintain speed up to 10 mph for long-distance sprints.\nThis is one reason why if you ever encounter a mountain lion, you should never run away \u2013 after all, at 50mph, they won\u2019t let you get too far. Instead, stay calm, stay upright, and back away slowly. Making yourself as large and loud as possible can also help, since mountain lions are opportunistic hunters and most likely won\u2019t want to put up a fight.\n8. Mountain lions attack are rare\nThey\u2019re so rare, in fact, that many statistic experts say that you\u2019re more likely to be struck by lightning than suffer a mountain lion attack. This is mainly due to the fact that human and mountain lion encounters are so rare, and when they do occur, mountain lions are easily startled off.\n9. Mountain lions are great at jumping\nMountain Lion (Felis Concolor) Jumping a Canyon Christina Moraes/Shutterstock.com\nMountain lions\u2019 large legs allow them to do more than just run fast \u2013 they can also jump up to 18 feet off the ground! This is important for hunting, especially since mountain lions rely on ambushing their prey for success.\n10. Mountain lion tracks don\u2019t have claw marks\nOne of the easiest ways to identify a mountain lion track compared to other animals? Look for claws \u2013 or rather, the lack thereof.\nLike most other species in the cat family, mountain lions have the neat ability to retract their claws. This means that, unless you\u2019re looking on particularly rough terrain, you won\u2019t usually see the sign of claws in their tracks.\nAnother way to tell if the tracks you\u2019re dealing with are a mountain lion or not is to look for the notable \u201cM\u201d shape of their main paw pad. Remember: \u201cM\u201d is for mountain lion!\n11. Mountain lions are an important part of indigenous culture\nMountain Lion (Felis Concolor) Cub Nagel Photography/Shutterstock.com\nKnown for their power and grace, mountain lions are common symbols in indigenous American culture, from mythology to art. While some indigenous peoples view mountain lions as symbols of bad omens, many see these apex predators as sacred and revered animals, such as the Inca people and the Cherokee people."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Are Bears Endangered? (2022 Status Update) - Fauna Facts", "url": "https://faunafacts.com/bears/are-bears-endangered/", "text": "The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) estimates that five out of the eight bear species worldwide are vulnerable to extinction. This includes spectacled bears, sun bears, sloth bears, polar bears, and giant pandas.\nAs of now, the declining bear species are classified as vulnerable. That means their populations have declined by fifty percent, and the cause of the decline is known. If the species decrease continues and reaches seventy percent \u2013 they will be endangered.\nThis article will focus on why certain bear species are dwindling and what conservationists are doing to protect them.\nWhich Bears are Endangered?\nSpecies IUCN Conservation Status Estimated Population Range Threats Grizzly Bear Least Concern 110,000 North America Hunting, Deforestation Black Bear Least Concern 850,000-950,000 North America Hunting, Deforestation Giant Panda Vulnerable 1,800 China Climate Change, Low Birth Rates, Deforestation Sun Bear Vulnerable Unknown South-East Asia Agriculture, mining, hunting, roads Sloth Bear Vulnerable 10,000-20,000 India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka Human development, agriculture, mining, roads Spectacled Bear Vulnerable 2,500-10,000 South America Deforestation, infrastructure development, mining Polar Bear Vulnerable Climate Change\nAccording to the IUCN, all bear species except the Brown bear and American black bear are vulnerable or close to being endangered. Below are the details on each bear species and their official conservation status.\n1. Spectacled Bears (Vulnerable)\nScientific Name Tremarctos ornatus IUCN Conservation Status Vulnerable Population Estimate 2,500-10,000 Range South America Threats Deforestation, infrastructure development, mining\nSpectacled bears are classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Endangered Animals List. Their population is decreasing with about 2,500-10,000 spectacled bears left in South America.\nSpectacled bears are native to countries like Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia, and Northern Argentina. These bears are omnivores and survive mainly on a diet that consists of fruits, plants, insects, and small rodents.\nSpectacled bears inhabit grasslands, shrublands, and forests, which is why it\u2019s not surprising that one of the biggest threats to the survival of this species is the loss and fragmentation of their natural habitat.\nThe World Wildlife Fund (WWF) states that some of the main threats to the Spectacled Bear species include timber extraction, unchecked infrastructure development, mining, and petroleum exploitation.\nRelated Article: Bear vs Wolf Pack\n2. Sun Bears (Vulnerable)\nScientific Name Helarctos malayanus IUCN Conservation Status Vulnerable Population Estimate Not available Range South-East Asia Threats Agriculture, mining, hunting, roads\nSun bears are classified as vulnerable on the IUCN Endangered Animals List. Their population is believed to be decreasing based on population density studies, but there is no reliable survey of their total remaining population.\nSun Bears are native to Southeast Asia and countries like Malaysia and Thailand. These bears frequent tropical forests, swamp habitats, and their diet consists of insects, small rodents, and sweet fruits.\nApart from habitat destruction, Sun bears face dwindling numbers due to being poached for their organs \u2013 which some believe hold medicinal value.\nHowever, the claim that they have medicinal value has been denied and proven wrong by many scientists the world over. Sadly, that hasn\u2019t stopped this species from being hunted.\n3. Grizzly Bears (Least Concern)\nScientific Name Ursus arctos IUCN Conservation Status Least Concern Population Estimate 110,000 Range North America, Europe, Asia Threats Residential development, agriculture, mining, transport corridors, climate change, hunting\nGrizzly bears are listed as least concern by the IUCN endangered species list.\nThe species\u2019 population dropped significantly after European encroachment in North America. They are no longer found in many states, including California, where there was once a large population.\nThe main reasons for a historical decline in Grizzly bear numbers are poaching and human-animal conflicts, human encroachment, and habitat destruction.\nThe species are protected against harm under the Endangered Species Act. The US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFW) monitors the species\u2019 numbers of the six recovery ecosystems created for Grizzly bears. These include the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the Selkirk Ecosystem, etc.\nAccording to a 5-year study carried out by the USFW, there\u2019s not enough significant increase in the Grizzly bear population in North America, meaning more work is needed.\nThere are also small isolated populations of brown bears in parts of Europe and Asia.\nGo Deeper: Are Grizzly Bears Endangered?\n4. Giant Pandas (Vulnerable)\nScientific Name Ursus arctos IUCN Conservation Status Vulnerable Population Estimate 1,800 Range China Threats Deforestation, Poaching, Climate Change\nPanda bears are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN endangered species list. While they are not listed as endangered (due to a rise in population and re-introduction to several habitats in China), their overall population is still dangerously low.\nPanda bears are native to China and are considered one of the country\u2019s national treasures. Pandas were listed as endangered by the IUCN until recently. But, in September of 2021, IUCN upgraded their status to vulnerable.\nThat means the efforts being taken to rebound the Panda population are working \u2013 to the delight of conservationists everywhere.\nHowever, the WWF states that Pandas still need to be protected from habitat destruction and poaching to ensure their numbers don\u2019t decrease again.\nClimate change may also be a threat to their population. As temperatures rise, the bamboo forests that they rely on may disappear or retreat further into the mountains.\nGo Deeper: Are Giant Pandas Endangered?\n5. Black Bears (Least Concern)\nScientific Name Ursus americanus IUCN Conservation Status Least Concern Population Estimate 850,000\u2013950,000 Range North America Threats Hunting, Agriculture, Transport Corridors\nBlack bears are not endangered. They are listed as least concern by the IUCN endangered species list.\nHowever, their population almost certainly has declined since European development in North America. They have been extirpated from central and southern United States (e.g. Texas) since European encroachment.\nConflict with humans, hunting, and human encroachment on their habitats remain significant threats.\nHumans can help protect black bears by ensuring they don\u2019t attract them to their homes or campsites. Locking food in bear bins, keeping your yard clean and clear, and never feeding bears can ensure they move along and don\u2019t stay in the same area.\nUnfortunately, if a bear persistently returns to a campsite or home, it may be euthanized to prevent human-bear conflict.\nGo Deeper: Are Black Bears Endangered?\n6. Sloth Bears (Vulnerable)\nScientific Name Melursus ursinus IUCN Conservation Status Vulnerable Population Estimate 10,000-20,000 Range India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka Threats Human development, agriculture, mining, roads\nSloth bears are not considered endangered but they are listed as vulnerable and their population is declining.\nThey are locally extinct in Bangladesh and their population is declining throughout India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Unfortunately they\u2019re known to raid crops and attack humans, which can lead farmers to poach them.\nThe best way to conserve sloth bears going forward is to ensure they have protected habitats. If they can live in remote protected regions, human-bear conflicts should go into decline.\n7. Polar Bears (Vulnerable)\nScientific Name Ursus maritimus IUCN Conservation Status Vulnerable Population Estimate 26,000 Range Arctic Circle Threats Climate Change\nPolar bears are not considered endangered but they are listed as vulnerable.\nThe greatest threat to the polar bear is climate change. As the climate heats up, ice caps are melting, and bears are struggling to catch seals at the same rate as previously.\nThis has had many flow-on effects, including increased interactions with humans, and changes in the Polar Bear\u2019s diet.\nIn recent years, they have taken to raiding the nests of arctic terns, causing devastation to the arctic tern population in several regions.\nThis shows how climate change can cause a domino effect that can cause devastation not only to bears but the whole ecosystem.\nGo Deeper: Are Polar Bears Endangered?\nWhat are the Major Threats to Bears?\nThere are several reasons why bears are being pushed towards being endangered. But it all seems to be connected to one primary cause \u2013 humans.\nThe United States Endangered Species Act 1973 lists out that wildlife species are at risk of extinction due to unchecked economic growth and activity \u2013 without sufficient conservation. And that pretty much sums up why bear populations are reducing the world over.\nBelow are some of the secondary concerns of excessive economic activity that are adding to the bear problem.\n1. Loss of Natural Habitat\nHuman-activity-related problems like agricultural spread, deforestation, dams, and other sources of water management are destroying the natural habitat of bear species the world over.\nThe loss of habitat can affect species decline in several ways. For instance, it can affect animals\u2019 food sources, forcing them to find alternative and less suitable means of sustenance. It also increases the chances of conflict between humans and bears, putting the species at risk.\n2. Low Birth Rates\nImage: Giant pandas are known for their low birth rate\nBears have very low birth rates which makes it hard for their populations to recover after a decline. In fact, Giant Pandas rarely reproduce in captivity, which makes it hard to regenerate their population.\nGenerally, bears reach the age of maturity between three to five years. And even then, a female bear will only give birth every two to four years. If one compares that to standard bear lifespan in the wild \u2013 which is 25 years, their reproduction rate is very low.\nReproduction among bear species can get even trickier because reproduction ages and rates can vary within members of the Ursidae family.\nThe pressure on the bear species brought about by the loss of habitat, pollution, depletion of food sources, human-animal conflict, etc., can affect the already slow rate of reproduction in bears.\nAdditionally, the loss of life among the species (for various reasons) unbalances the mortality and birth ratios, meaning the species aren\u2019t growing as fast as they\u2019re dying out.\n3. Pollution\nAnother significant factor affecting the bear species decline is pollution. For example, polar bears survive on a diet of seals and fish, which are increasingly polluted.\nAquatic creatures in the Arctic contain high levels of toxic chemicals because the Arctic basin acts as a type of reservoir for agricultural and industrial chemicals from Europe and other parts of the world.\nWhen Polar bears consume these animals, the toxins enter their bodies, causing problems like low levels of vitamins, antibodies, and even thyroid hormones.\nIn short, consuming tainted food affects Polar bears in multiple ways \u2013 including reduced immunity, stunted growth, and reproduction. Other species of bears are affected in similar ways, but the results are often the same.\nConclusion\nAll members of the Ursidae family are essential parts of our natural ecological system. Six of eight bears species around the world are inching towards extinction due to the unchecked growth of human activities. The endangered bear species include Polar bears, Panda bears, Asiatic black bears, Sun bears, Spectacled Bears, and Sloth bears. If a joint conservation effort isn\u2019t initiated, conservationists are concerned the situation could grow worse."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "5 Fun Facts About the Red Panda - AnimalWised", "url": "https://www.animalwised.com/5-fun-facts-about-the-red-panda-993.html", "text": "Have you ever seen the logo of the well-known browser Firefox? What animal do you think it is, a red fox or a raccoon? Some people argue that it is a red panda, which in fact is not related to any of the previous species - and it's also unrelated to the giant panda. Red pandas (Ailurus fulgens) have been reclassified by biologists many times. Decades ago, red pandas were classified as Procyonidae, the raccoon family, and as Ursidae, the bear family. Scientists now believe that the red panda belongs to a family of species that is almost extinct, the Ailuridae. Red pandas are the only surviving species of the Ailuridae, and this makes them very special. Do you want to discover the most interesting traits of this Asian endangered species? Stay with us at AnimalWised and learn 5 fun facts about the red panda.\nWhat do red pandas look like?\nThis adorable mammal is also called \"lesser panda\", \"red cat-bear\" and \"red bear-cat\". This can give you an idea about how do red pandas look like: a mixture of other species! Their size is similar to that of a large domestic cat, while their characteristic face mask inevitably reminds us of its raccoon relatives. The coat of red pandas is longer and softer than it may look. It is mostly red or reddish brown, but the extremities are darker. Its ringed tail can also lead to confusion, as it can look like that of the ring-tailed lemur for non-trained eyes. The lighter rings are useful for camouflage, but red pandas use their ringed tail to provide warmth through the cold winter months in the high mountain: they need a temperature of between 10\u00b0 C and 25\u00b0 C (50\u00ba F and 77\u00ba F) to be at ease. The tail also helps them to keep balance when moving through the treetops, where they are really skilled. Red pandas have scent glands, like other species in the Musteloidea superfamily, which includes weasels, otters and skunks. Red pandas do not have opposable thumbs as such, but they do have a long bone in the wrist that completes the task of clinging to branches and carrying food to the mouth, as in the case of the giant panda. This bone is called a \"false thumb\".\nWhat do red pandas eat?\nRed pandas are omnivorous animals, although they prefer vegetables. The red panda shares with the giant panda its preference for bamboo as a staple food, but our smaller friend is much more versatile in its diet, supplementing it with eggs and baby birds. Insects and some rodents can also be part of a red panda's diet.\nWhy are red pandas endangered?\nDespite being more adaptable than its very distant relative the giant panda, the red panda is an endangered species, the stage previous to being considered in critical danger of becoming extinct. In the case of the red panda, their greatest threat is not problems in reproduction - although in the wild they die at faster rates than they are born - but the destruction of their natural habitat. Red pandas can be found in Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Tibet, where they inhabit the temperate forests of the Himalaya range. These forests are being degraded by livestock or completely destroyed, which has caused the red panda population to become fragmented. Another reason for their being endangered is poaching. Red pandas are captured to be kept in zoos or as illegal pets, and also hunted for fur and body parts.\nAre there different red panda subspecies?\nThere are actually two red panda subspecies, the Western red panda (A. f. fulgens) and the Styan's red panda (A. f. styani). The former has a less marked mask on its face and is of a slightly smaller size, and it can be found in Bhutan, northwestern India and Nepal. The latter is a bit larger and darker, and it inhabits Sichuan and Yunnan in China and northern Myanmar.\nWhat do red pandas do all day?\nRed pandas usually spend the day snoozing in the treetops and become active at dusk, when they get to work to seek more food. It might seem that the red panda is a lazy animal, but in fact the problem is that it cannot digest cellulose. As the red panda's diet consists largely of bamboo leaves and shoots, its adaptation has lead to it having a slow metabolism. Still, a red panda of an average size may need to eat around 3 kg of leaves and bamboo shoots a day if it does sot eat more caloric food. Lesser pandas are shy and evasive animals that, when feeling threatened and trapped, will adopt a bipedal posture to try and appear larger and more intimidating - although we're not sure that a snow leopard would feel too impressed. They are not usually sociable when out of the breeding period, and they mostly live alone. At most, you can have small groups of a mother and her grown cubs. However, except when feeling threatened, red pandas are fairly friendly and they are not aggressive animals. In the mating season, males tend to mark their territory by rubbing against trees an abdominal gland that secretes an odorous substance. They may also rub their genitals or use urine markings. It is not uncommon that a male and a female mate with more than one partner during a single mating period. Intercourse takes place on the ground and the cubs reach adult size when they are one year old, although they will not be sexually mature until 18 months.\nWhat else should you know?\nTo end this article on fun facts about the red panda, we'll leave you with some extra data that perhaps you did not know: The red panda's mask is different in each individual. The red panda has semi-retractable claws that are reminiscent of cats. It also cleans its face with saliva and a leg as if it were a cat. Red pandas have a whole repertoire of actions to communicate with each other, such as raising the tail, arching the back, adopting a bipedal posture or head movements accompanied by sounds. A red panda's life expectancy almost doubles in captivity. In the wild, it is normal that specimens do not exceed 8 or at most 10 years. A captive specimen's average life expectancy is fourteen years. Today, breeding programs are conducted in captivity in an attempt to curb the threat surrounding this species. Still, if we continue with the destruction of their natural habitat, the future of the species will not be a hopeful one. Unlike its cousin the raccoon, the red panda is not an adaptable animal."}

How do panda families live in the wild?\nWild panda like being along. Wild panda like being along.\nPanda families don\u2019t live together. Giant pandas like being alone. It is very rare to see two pandas together, except for during the short breeding season (March to May).\nAfter mating, the male and female pandas will part and the female panda will raise her baby panda alone.\nWild pandas have a heightened sense of smell that lets them know when another panda is nearby and they try to avoid direct contact with others.\nIf a panda comes into contact with another one, they'll growl, swat, and bite each other until one gives up and leaves.\n6. Are wild pandas dangerous?\nThere is no doubt that the giant panda is one of the loveliest animals in the world. But don't take it lightly if you see a wild panda, even though the chance of this happening is almost zero.\nDon't forget they are bears and they can be dangerous.\nWhen you join in a panda volunteer program at a panda base, please do not wear perfume or nail polish, and do not make any noise or sudden movements that might startle or irritate the pandas.\nRecommended tours:\nContact us for a private tour of Leshan and Mount Emei.\n7. How do they survive in the winter?\nMany bears hibernate but giant pandas don't. One reason is that bamboo doesn't provide enough nutrients for them to be able to live through the winter.\nIn the winter, they go down to lower mountains for the warmer temperature and more bamboo.\n8. How long does a wild panda live for?\nWild pandas live for up to 20 years in the wild. With medical and nutritional help in captivity, pandas can live for more than 30 years.\nRead on to learn more about a giant panda's life cycle."}

WWF was the first international conservation organization to work in China at the Chinese government's invitation.In, WWF-funded research and satellite imagery show that suitable habitat for pandas in Sichuan Province has shrunk by 50 percent since 1974.Ina management plan for the panda is launched following a decade of cooperation between WWF and the Chinese Ministry of Forestry. Upon completion of the plan, 60 percent of all panda habitat will be included within protected areas.InWWF files a lawsuit related to the process of loaning pandas to US zoos, which results in a policy requiring zoos importing pandas to ensure that more than half of the funds associated with each loan are channelled into the conservation of wild pandas and their habitat."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Why don't pandas hibernate? | HowStuffWorks - Animals", "url": "https://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/panda-hibernation.htm", "text": "\" \" Pandas love sleep, but they don't hibernate. Instead they seek more comfortable altitudes. See more pictures of endangered animals. Keren Su/Stone Collection/ Getty Images\nBears are notorious for their hibernation habits. As most of us learned early in school, bears, as well as several other animal species, undergo this long-term, sleep-like phase to escape from the bitter cold during winter months. And can we blame them? After all, winter can't be fun when there's little food and bitterly uncomfortable temperatures. Many sun-loving humans would much rather sleep through the icy, snow-shoveling season and wake to a warm spring. Would you be surprised to learn that, curiously, the giant panda, also called the \"panda bear,\" abstains from this ancient, protective ritual?\nIf you've read How Hibernation Works, you know that the process can take on a variety of forms. But pandas don't take part in any kind of hibernation, even under the loosest definitions of the term. It's not that they don't like sleep -- far from it. Giant pandas sleep for about eight to 12 hours a day. And it's not that their bodies can take the cold -- they actually have relatively little body fat with which to insulate themselves from low temperatures [source: Stone]. But, rather, when the weather gets tough, the pandas get going. Instead of burrowing away at the first sign of uncomfortable temperatures, like many bears do, giant pandas simply find a more comfortable place to relax and eat bamboo.\nAdvertisement\nLiving near mountains conveniently allows giant pandas to find refuge in more comfortable temperatures. In the summer, giant pandas like to seek out cooler temperatures at high elevations. Though typically they live at around 9,000 feet (2,743.2 m) above sea level, during a hot summer they will typically climb up as high as bamboo still grows -- to elevations of 11,500 feet (3,505 m) [source: Stone]. And, when cold seasons ensue, they'll head back down to warmer elevations, sometimes about 4,000 feet (1,219 m), if necessary.\nBear or not, there's more at work behind a giant panda's preference to migrate rather than snooze away the winter. It turns out that the giant panda's peculiar diet excludes the possibility of hibernation. Read on to find out why."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Tai Shan (giant panda) - Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_Shan_(giant_panda)", "text": "Tai Shan (Chinese: \u6cf0\u5c71; pinyin: T\u00e0i Sh\u0101n, pronounced [t\u02b0\u00e2i\u0282\u00e1n], also known as Butterstick after birth and before naming) is a giant panda born at the National Zoo in Washington D.C. on July 9, 2005. He is the first panda cub born at the National Zoo to survive for more than a few days. He is the oldest brother of Bao Bao, Bei Bei and Xiao Qi Ji.\nLineage [ edit ]\nTai Shan (7 months old in picture) with his mother Mei Xiang on February 16, 2006\nTai Shan is the first cub born on July 9, 2005 at 3:41 AM to Mei Xiang ( [m\u00e8i\u0255j\u0251\u0301\u014b]) and Tian Tian ( [t\u02b0j\u025bnt\u02b0j\u025bn]), the National Zoo's second pair of giant pandas. (The first pair, Ling-Ling (female) and Hsing-Hsing (male), were donated to the United States by China in 1972, shortly after Richard Nixon's historic visit. Ling-Ling died in 1992 and Hsing-Hsing in 1999 without producing any cubs that survived for more than a few days.)\nBoth of Tai Shan's parents were born at the China Research and Conservation Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong, Sichuan Province. Mei Xiang, his mother, was artificially inseminated in March 2005 with sperm from Tian Tian after natural mating between the pair appeared unsuccessful. Per the agreement with China, the Chinese government can require that Tai Shan be sent to China any time after he reaches the age of two as he, like his parents, is the property of China. (Mei Xiang and Tian Tian are technically being \"leased\" to the National Zoo by the Chinese government in a ten-year, $10 million agreement, with the money to go to panda conservation research in China.) The National Zoo announced in April 2007 that it reached an agreement with the Chinese government to let Tai Shan remain at the National Zoo until at least July 2009. The announcement was made when Chinese Ambassador Zhou Wenzhong presented Tai Shan a \"passport\" with an extended stay period to July 2009, without extra charge.\nNaming [ edit ]\nTai Shan on July 8, 2006.\nFollowing a Chinese tradition, panda cubs are not named until they are 100 days old. Before he got a name, the cub was popularly referred to as Butterstick because immediately after his birth, a zoo worker described him as being about the size of a stick of butter. The name caught on with bloggers, and became quite popular.\nIn fall 2005, the National Zoo announced that the cub's name would be chosen through an Internet poll. There were five names included on the poll; all were traditional Chinese names approved by the China Wildlife Conservation Association. The choices were Hua Sheng (\"China Washington\" and \"magnificent\"), Sheng Hua (\"Washington China\" and \"magnificent\"), Tai Shan (\"peaceful mountain\"), Long Shan (\"dragon mountain\"), and Qiang Qiang (\"strong, powerful\"). \"Butterstick\" was not included as an option. Some bloggers protested this decision; there was even an attempt to hack the poll, allowing voters the option of selecting the name Butterstick. Despite these efforts, the name Tai Shan was eventually chosen, as it had won 44 percent of the 202,045 total votes cast.\nMedia attention [ edit ]\nTai Shan in his favorite tree in June 2006\nTai Shan and mother in February 2006\nTai Shan made his public debut on December 8, 2005, after the National Zoo issued 13,000 free timed entry tickets. These tickets were gone within 2 hours, and some were quickly offered for sale on eBay and craigslist, with an asking price as high as $500 apiece.\nThe cub became widely popular; he was frequently mentioned on D.C.-oriented websites, such as DCist and Wonkette, as well as traditional media outlets, including National Public Radio, The Washingtonian, The Washington Post, and The Washington Times. Fans set up sites selling cub-related merchandise, including one partnered with cafepress.com that donated approximately $1,900 in profits to the National Zoo.\nThe panda cub was featured in an Animal Planet documentary titled A Panda Is Born, which follows the National Zoo's giant panda breeding efforts and Tai Shan's birth. A few months after Tai Shan's first birthday, Animal Planet premiered a documentary titled Baby Panda's First Year, which followed him during his first 12 months at the National Zoo.\nFirst birthday [ edit ]\nAt the National Zoo in Washington D.C., Tai Shan and thousands of fans celebrated his first birthday on July 9, 2006. As early as 7 a.m., National Zoo visitors started to line up outside the panda exhibit, with the opening three hours away.\nOne of his gifts was a giant custom-made fruitsicle with the number \"1\" on top. Such ice treats gave Tai Shan some gastrointestinal problems which he has now recovered from.[citation needed]\nAfter 2007, Tai Shan lived on his own at the zoo, because cubs leave their mothers at about 2 years of age and fathers play no role in cub rearing.\nMove to China [ edit ]\nThe National Zoo announced on Dec. 4, 2009, that Tai Shan would leave the zoo and be sent to China, in accordance with previous agreements. Zoo officials had asked for Tai Shan to remain in Washington for another year, but China declined the request. According to the original agreement, Tai Shan was to return to China two years after he was born. China had already allowed him to stay for another two and a half years beyond the initial agreement. He left D.C. for China on February 4, 2010 (on the same flight as Mei Lan from Zoo Atlanta). He moved to the Bifengxia Panda Base, in Ya'an, Sichuan, but in 2014 moved again to the Dujiangyan base of Sichuan Province's China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda.\nFatherhood [ edit ]\nTai Shan recently made his first few steps of fatherhood by mating with Wen Yu. Tai became the father of twin cubs, a boy and a girl, by female panda Xiao Bai Tu. (This content has yet to be validated by something other than rumor.)\nReferences [ edit ]"}

They may have diminished senses of hearing and sight, but they have a highly developed sense of smell.\nThese anteaters are distinctively patterned in various shades of brown with wide, black stripes that run from their upper front legs toward their spine. Their front legs are white, and they have a bushy tail. They have no undercoats to provide warmth; instead they have bristly, short hair on their shoulders and longer hair on their legs and tail, which resembles the texture of a horse's mane.\nGiant anteaters protect their sharp front claws by tucking them into their palms and walking on their front knuckles. Their back feet and claws are more similar to bears (they only knuckle walk with their front feet). They walk in a slow, shuffling gait but when necessary can gallop at over 30 miles per hour (48 kilometers per hour). They can also climb and swim."}

Europe is the only continent that they don\u2019t natively live in.\nThey are members of the order Crocodilia, which also includes alligators, caimans, and gharials.\nCrocodile Facts Overview\nHabitat: Wetland areas \u2013 Freshwater rivers, or lakes. Or saltwater \u2013 residing in estuaries, lagoons, or mangrove swamps. Location: Africa, Asia, The Americas, Australia Lifespan: 35 \u2013 75 Years Size: 4.9 \u2013 23 ft (1.5 m \u2013 7 m) Weight: 40 \u2013 2,600 lb (18 \u2013 1,200 kg) Color: Dark green when adult. Yellow with black striples when young. Diet: Fish, Amphibians, Birds, Reptiles, Mammals Predators: Other crocodiles. Big cats, such as jaguars and leopards. Anacondas and pythons. When small, large birds, such as heron or shoebill. Top Speed: 35 Kph (22 Mph) Swimming No. of Species:\n14 Conservation Status:\n4 Species Endangered: Orinoco, Philippine, Cuban, Siamese 2 Species Vulnerable: American, Dwarf.\nCrocodiles are semi-aquatic and live in wetland areas, freshwater rivers or lakes, or saltwater \u2013 residing in estuaries, lagoons, or mangrove swamps, rather than far out at sea.\nThere are 14 species of crocodiles, which vary in lifespan between 35 \u2013 75 years, and considerably in size. The smallest, the Dwarf Crocodile, grows to an average 4.9 feet (1.5 meters) in length, and weighs 40 \u2013 71 pounds (18 to 32 kg, or 3 to 5 stone).\nThe largest crocodile is the Saltwater Crocodile, which can grow up to 23.0 ft (7.0 m) in length, weighing 2,200 \u2013 2,600 lb (1,000 to 1,200 kg, or 150 to 190 stone).\nSome species are active during the day, while other species are only nocturnal. Crocodiles mostly hunt at night, are carnivorous animals and very efficient hunters, with excellent hearing and eyesight.\nThey are aggressive, ambush predators, waiting for their prey to venture close to their hiding position, before rushing to attack. A crocs diet mostly includes other animals, reptiles, birds and fish.\nInteresting Crocodile Facts\n1. Crocodiles are carnivores, which generally means they eat only meat. However, a recent study proved they also enjoy an occasional taste of fruit.\nThe 2013 study concluled \u201cthere is little doubt that on occasion, fruit is deliberately consumed, often in large quantities\u201c, along with their normal meat-heavy diets of mammals, birds, and fish.\n2. Crocodiles can go through 4,000 teeth over a lifetime.\nCrocodiles have between 60-110 teeth. When a crocodile loses a tooth, there is a small replacement already on standby. They are able to replace each of their 80 teeth up to 50 times over their lifespan.\n3. A crocodile\u2019s jaws can apply 5,000 pounds of pressure per square inch \u2013 the strongest bite of any animal in the world.\nA human\u2019s jaw only produces 100 pounds of pressure per square inch in comparison. A crocodiles bite is 10 times more powerful than a great white shark.\n4. Crocodiles have relatively weak jaw opening muscles, which can be held shut with just a rubber band, or your bare hands.\nAlthough, that\u2019s not advisable! However, it has enabled scientists to study them closer!\n5. An easy way to tell the difference between a crocodile and an alligator, is when a crocodile closes it\u2019s mouth, all teeth are visible \u2013 as the upper and lower jaw are the same width.\nWhereas an alligator possesses small depressions in the upper jaw for the lower teeth, meaning they are not visible when their mouth is shut.\n6. Another key difference to an alligator is snout shape. Alligators have wider, U-shaped snouts, while crocodiles are more pointed and V-shaped.\nCrocodiles are generally a little more aggressive, and often larger and stronger, too.\n7. The longest crocodile captured alive measured 6.17 m (20.2 ft) and weighed at 1,075 kg (2,370 lb) by a National Geographic team in Agusan del Sur Province, Philippines.\n\u2018Lolong\u2019 was a saltwater crocodile and the largest ever in captivity.\n8. Crocodiles don\u2019t sweat. To keep cool, they open their mouths which is known as \u201cmouth gaping,\u201d very similar to panting.\nThey are not displaying aggression when you see them with their mouths wide open! They often sleep with their mouths wide open to release heat.\n9. Crocodiles are extremely fast in the water, swimming up to speeds of 35 kilometers per hour (22 mph).\nThey use their powerful tails to propel themselves through water, and their feet as rudders to steer.\n10. It\u2019s a common myth that crocodiles can run fast on land. They can \u2018belly run\u2019 up to 17 kilometers per hour (11 mph) for short distances.\nCrocs tire easily on land and prefer to stay in water, coming ashore only to bask in the sun, or to lay eggs.\n11. Crocs can hold their breath underwater for more than an hour.\nCambridge researchers have shown that this ability depends on a tiny fragment of the animal\u2019s haemoglobin, which is the protein that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.\n12. Crocodiles swallow small stones to improve digestion. These stones help grind up the food in their stomachs.\nSwallowing stones (known as \u2018gastroliths\u2019) is especially beneficial for crocodiles that eat their prey whole, or for tougher animals with shells and bones. A gastrolith can remain inside the stomach for years.\n13. The expression to cry \u2018crocodile tears\u2019 (to display insincere or a false display of emotion), derives from crocodiles shedding tears, while they eat their prey.\nWhile this was originally an ancient belief, studies have shown that crocodiles eyes do water while they eat, but not with remorse \u2013 for biological reasons, due to the hisses and huffs during feeding.\n14. Crocodiles have acute senses, an evolutionary advantage that makes them highly successful predators.\nCrocodiles are mainly nocturnal hunters and have excellent night vision. Their sense of smell and hearing are also extremely well developed.\n15. Crocodiles have been known to occasionally cannibalize smaller crocodiles.\nThere have been recorded cases of larger crocodiles eating smaller, or younger crocs.\n16. Crocodiles are ambush and opportunistic predators, capable of preying upon large mammals, such as smaller elephants, hippos, sharks or big cats.\nSome species like the freshwater crocodile will mostly eat fish, while larger species like the saltwater crocodile or the Nile crocodile, will consume buffalo, zebra, deer and wild boar.\n17. Crocodiles have the most acidic stomach of any vertebrate.\nThis allows them to dissolve and digest bones, hooves and horns or shells from their prey.\n18. Crocodiles perform a \u2018death roll\u2019 to overcome prey, clamping on using their jaws, and spinning around powerfully.\nThe spinning motion of the roll disorientates the prey, dragging them under the water and helps separate limbs from the body of larger animals to easily ingest.\n19. Crocodiles vocalize to communicate. The young of some species squeak and grunt, while adult crocs can growl, hiss or roar at each other.\nMany species will also respond to other noises, such as engine noise, gun shots or even people mimicking crocodiles.\n20. Crocodiles can sleep with one eye wide open.\nOnly some other reptiles, birds and dolphins can do the same. They generally sleep with two eyes closed, though.\n21. Larger crocodiles can go for over a year without eating a meal.\nA croc\u2019s metabolism is super efficient, using and storing nearly the entirety of the food it consumes. In extreme circumstances, they are able to shut down and live off their own tissue for a long period of time.\n22. Worldwide, crocodiles are estimated to kill about 1,000 humans per year.\nHundreds of those crocodile attacks occur in Africa, often in small commuinities where they not widely reported.\nCrocodile Fact-File Summary\nScientific Classification\nKingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Reptilia Order: Crocodilia Family: Crocodylidae Subfamily: Crocodylinae\nSpecies List & Habitat"}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "panda | FactMonster", "url": "https://www.factmonster.com/encyclopedia/ecology/animals/vertebrates/panda", "text": "name for two unrelated nocturnal Asian mammals of the order Carnivora, red pandas, genusand the giant panda,\nRed pandas, also known as lesser pandas and cat bears, are found in forest at high elevations in the Himalayas and the mountains of S China and N Myanmar. There are two species (formerly considered subspecies), the Chinese red panda, A. styani, found in Yunnan and Sichuan prov., and the Himalayan red panda, A. fulgens, found in NE India, Nepal, Bhutan, N Myanmar, Tibet, and W Yunnan. Red pandas resemble raccoons but have a longer body and tail and a more rounded head. They are about 3.5 ft (105 cm) in total length and weighs about 12 lb (5.5 kg). The very thick fur is rust color to deep chestnut, with black on the under parts, limbs, and ears; there are dark eye patches on the white face. The Chinese species has a redder forehead and more pronounced tail rings. Red pandas spend much of the time in trees but feed on the ground, eating primarily bamboo leaves but also fruit, roots, and other plant matter. They are the sole members of the family Ailuridae.\nThe giant panda superficially resembles a bear, but its classification has been disputed; genetic research, however, indicates it is related to the bears, family Ursidae. The body is chiefly white, and the limbs are brownish black, with the dark color extending up over the shoulder. The ears and eye patches are black. Adults weigh from 200 to 300 lb (90\u2013140 kg) and are from 4.5 to 5 ft (140\u2013150 cm) long with a 5-in. (13-cm) tail. Giant pandas live in restricted areas of the high mountain bamboo forests of central China; their diet consists almost entirely of bamboo shoots. Rare in the wild, they breed poorly in captivity, but using artificial insemination and techniques designed to enable a female panda to raise twins, Chinese scientists have greatly improved the reproduction rate of captive pandas. Giant pandas are protected by law in China.\nPandas are classified in the phylum Chordata, subphylum Vertebrata, class Mammalia, order Carnivora, families Ailuridae and Ursidae.\nSee E. B. Schaller et al., The Giant Pandas of Wolong (1985); D. MacClintock, Red Pandas (1988).\nThe Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed. Copyright \u00a9 2012, Columbia University Press.

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Panda \u2013 Spirit Animal, Symbolism and Meaning", "url": "https://dreamingandsleeping.com/panda-spirit-animal-symbolism-and-meaning/", "text": "Panda is one of the most adored animals in a whole world. But, did you know that panda is also one of the most powerful spirit animals or animal totems?\nThe Panda as a spirit animal is a symbol of determination and safety. If the panda is your animal totem, then you may be searching for a balanced and peaceful life.\nIn this article you will find out more about the symbolism that panda has as a spirit animal. We will tell you something more about its symbolism and meaning.\nWhat Does Panda Mean?\nAs we have already mentioned, the Panda is a very powerful spirit animal, so the Panda symbolism can have many different meanings. In the first place, the panda as a spirit animal symbolizes peace and gentle strength.\nAlso, it is a symbol of good luck and positive thoughts. If the panda is your animal totem, then you will be able to understand how important are the emotions in your life.\nAlso, you will be calm and determined, so you will be able to wait as long as it is necessary to achieve your goals. The Panda as a spirit animal also symbolizes how important are personal boundaries of each person.\nThe Panda as a Spirit Animal \u2013 Emotional Personality\nIf the panda is your spirit animal, then you may be a very sensitive person. Actually, you need your private space, so you may become very nervous and stressed when there are changes in your environment.\nAlso, it is important to mention that almost all people feel compassion and love when they see panda, either alive or in television. It means that if the Panda is also your animal totem, it will certainly melt your heart and cause compassion and caring. If panda is your spirit animal, you may be too sensitive, so you are probably trying to help all innocent people around you.\nThe Panda as a Spirit Animal \u2013 Personal Boundaries\nIf your animal totem is panda, then it means that personal boundaries may be very important for you.\nThey are important if you want to feel safely and protected. It is known that panda lives a solitary life, so if you think that the panda is your spirit animal, it means that you also need to establish your personal boundaries.\nIt is necessary for you to keep a certain distance in a relationship or in a social life.\nThe Panda as a Spirit Animal \u2013 Nurturing\nIf the panda appears in your waking life or in yor dream, it can mean that it is your spirit animal. This may be the sign that you should nurture yourself and your loved people more.\nYou should give them more love and more support.\nThe Panda as a Spirit Animal \u2013 Gentle Strength\nIf the Panda is also your animal totem, it means that gentle strength is one of your most important traits. You are probably a very firm and determined person, but you are also gentle.\nYou should have in mind the physical look of the panda because it is an animal with gentle appearance but it is very strong and determined.\nIf you think that the panda is also your spirit animal, then you will show your strength in many situations, but at the same time you will stay gentle and calm.\nThe Panda as a Spirit Animal \u2013 Wisdom and Peace\nWisdom is also one of the traits typical for the panda. When there is a problem, the panda will stay calm and determined. It is known that the Panda as a spirit animal also symbolizes peace and harmony.\nSo, if you have the panda as your animal totem and if you have any problem in your life, most important is to stay calm and steady.\nThe Panda as a Spirit Animal \u2013 Patience\nOne of the most important traits of panda bear is a patience. Pandas are patient enough to wait what they want. In this case we will mention bamboo, which is the main food for panda.\nBut, did you know that the panda bear has to wait a few years for the bamboo to start to grow?\nSo, if the panda appears as an animal totem in your life, it means that you should slow down. There\u2019s no need to rush in your relationship or in your work. You should do things slowly and think well before you say or do something.\nPanda is known as a very slow animal, so it means that you should do all the things slowly and methodically. You should focus yourself on your goal and make a strategy. Then you should be patient and wait until the results come.\nThe Panda as a Spirit Animal \u2013 Enjoyment\nYou may have noticed that a panda bear feels so comfortable with itself. This bear simply enjoys its own nature and existence. A panda is always satisfied with itself and it has created a comfortable environment around him.\nSo, if the Panda appears as your animal totem, it means that you should make a comfortable environment in yourself and also around you.\nMost important is to feel comfortable with yourself. You should appreciate yourself more and you should have more self-confidence. It is important not to pay attention to what other people say about you.\nMost important are your own feelings and your happiness. You should find more time to relax and to enjoy your life.\nThe Panda as a Spirit Animal \u2013 Abundance and Prosperity\nSeeing the Panda in your life or in your dream can be a very good sign. The Panda is also a symbol of prosperity and abundance. As we have already said, the panda bear has to wait for years until the bamboo starts to grow.\nBut, when it finally starts to grow, it grows very fast and it becomes abundant, so there is a lot of food for panda bears.\nIt can be the same in humans life. Sometimes it is necessary to be patient and to wait for the good things to happen, as we have already mentioned above. But, when good things come in your life, then you can enjoy completely.\nIf the Panda appears in your life as your spirit animal, there is no doubt that you will enjoy in abundance and prosperity. You should only read the messages that the Panda is giving to you and listen to him carefully. If you have the Panda as your animal totem, you will certainly achieve your goals easily and you will have a lot of success.\nUnfortunately, pandas become endangered because of the hunting and also because of the habitat loss. Actually, bamboo forests are becoming limited nowadays, so it may be the answer why are pandas endangered.\nThe Panda as a Spirit Animal \u2013 Fierceness\nAlthough the Panda is considered a cute and lovely bear, sometimes it can also symbolize fierceness. Actually, in Chinese symbolism it is believed that the panda is very fierce and dangerous. So, what does it mean and how can we understand it?\nThe Chinesse Symbolism of the Panda is actually telling us that the things are not always as they appear. So, if the Panda appears as your animal totem, it is a warning for you to be more careful in a future period.\nActually, you should not trust too much to other people, especially to those who you have recently met. Remember that not all people are good people, so you need time to get to know someone well.\nIt is possible that there are many false friends around you, so be careful. Don\u2019t talk too much about yourself because someone may use it against you later.\nConclusion\nYou have seen in this article that the Panda may also be your animal totem. If you choose the Panda as your spirit animal, you will have a lot of success and you will maintain your calmness.\nAs we have mentioned, the panda is doing all the things slowly, calmly and methodically, so the success is guaranteed.\nIf the Panda is your spirit animal, you may be too sensitive, but you should always keep your personal boundaries and private space. You should nurture more yourself and your loved ones and you should feel comfortable with yourself. We have also said that the Panda is a symbol of enjoyment, wisdom, nurturing and gentle strength.\nWe hope this article has been interesting for you. We also hope that now it will be much easier for you to find out if the Panda is also your animal totem."}

The giant panda is the national animal of China. Panda activities are also great for a study of bears. Today, I\u2019m sharing both panda activities and free panda printables, including my new Montessori-inspired panda pack (subscriber freebie)!\nIn addition to our new panda pack, I have a special instant download from The Montessori Company with a hand-painted panda culture card!\nThe links are for free panda printables for preschoolers through 1st graders. To keep my list manageable, I don\u2019t share coloring pages unless a page has a specific educational purpose related to pandas. To keep this post focused, I\u2019m also not sharing Kung Fu Panda printables here unless they aren\u2019t identifiable as the Kung Fu Panda.\nFree Printables + Materials Used in the Pictured Panda Activities for Preschoolers-First Graders\nDisclosure: This post contains affiliate links (at no cost to you).\nMontessori Shelves with Panda-Themed Activities\nMy shelves with panda-themed activities include a free panda culture card designed by The Montessori Company. You\u2019ll also find Montessori-inspired panda numbers, letters, spinners, and and more (part of my subscriber freebie pack, so just sign up for my email to get the link and password \u2026 or check the bottom of your latest newsletter if you\u2019re already a subscriber)\nI always have related books available throughout a unit. On my top shelf, I have the Scholastic Pandas, 40 Panda Facts for Kids (no longer available through Amazon), and a homemade Giant Panda book using the free printable Giant Panda by A Special Day in College and Career Readiness at Teachers Pay Teachers. A free printable reader with more words is the Panda Bear Nonfiction Reader from Simply Kinder.\nI have a number of other panda books in a book basket. I love the National Geographic animal books. There are a number of great National Geographic bear books. I have both Pandas and Mission Panda Rescue for this unit. I also have the National Geographic Red Pandas book. Even though red pandas belong to their own family, I think it\u2019s important to read about them since they share the name \u201cpanda\u201d with the giant panda and also like to eat bamboo.\nI have fictional panda books in our book basket, too. I even have two books for babies and toddlers. My 4-year-old granddaughter, Zoey, loves to share books with her month-old sister, Sophia, so these are especially fun for Zoey. Sophia loves having Zoey read to her, although I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t care if her books fit with a theme! I have the adorable Little Panda Finger Puppet book and Bill Martin, Jr.,/Eric Carle\u2019s Panda Bear, Panda Bear, What Do You See? They aren\u2019t Montessori-style books, but they\u2019re favorites at my house.\nZoey, loves puzzles, so I have a giant world foam puzzle with 54 pieces in a large basket (not shown in my photos). That\u2019s great for using with Safari Ltd. or Schleich animals. When Zoey was younger, I used the puzzle that I have displayed for animal geography. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s available any longer. For home use, I don\u2019t use the traditional Montessori continent puzzle, which is a bit too large and impractical for my space. I do have a smaller version of it that I love, although it\u2019s not available on Amazon currently. I like to get world puzzles that are less expensive and can be changed according to the child\u2019s developmental level. On another shelf, I have the beautiful world map from Pin It! Maps that\u2019s perfect for animals of the continents as well as other geography activities.\nYou could mix your panda-themed activities among your shelves according to curriculum area. Or you could have a special panda-themed area something like the one pictured. My shelves this month have a mixture of skill levels. Many of the activities can be adapted for a variety of levels. If you\u2019re a homeschooler, just choose the activities that work for your child\u2019s interests and ability levels. If you don\u2019t have room for all the activities you\u2019d like to do, simply rotate them.\nPanda Culture Card (on Shelf Introducing the Panda Theme)\nI\u2019m happy to share with you this hand-painted panda culture card from The Montessori Company. You can use it on your shelves to introduce a panda unit or as part of a bear unit. I\u2019m hosting the free printable as an instant download at Living Montessori Now. You can always access the free panda culture card here.\nThe description says: \u201cPandas are a bear native to China. They eat almost only bamboo. They live mostly solitary lives except when raising cubs.\u201d\nI displayed the card with a Schleich giant panda, Schleich giant panda cub, and Pandas book.\nPanda Same or Different Activity\nFree Printable: Panda Same or Different Cards from Wise Owl Factory\nThis activity just uses the printable and a Montessori Services basket. It\u2019s simply a fun way to discuss panda photos and visual differences.\nPanda Skip Counting Puzzles\nFree Printable: Panda Skip Counting Puzzles from Wise Owl Factory\nThere are a number of different skip counting puzzles in this printable. I used two puzzles, counting by 2s and counting by 10s, to make it more challenging. That way, Zoey has to sort out the two puzzles before putting them together. For a younger child, just use one puzzle in your basket, pencil box (often a good size for these types of puzzles), or other container.\nP is for Panda Salt Tray and Movable Alphabet Work\nFree Printables: Panda Letters for Letter P Salt Tray (part of my subscriber freebie pack, so just sign up for my email to get the link and password \u2026 or check the bottom of your latest newsletter if you\u2019re already a subscriber)\nFor the salt tray, I used the wooden tray from the Melissa & Doug Lace and Trace Shapes. You can use whatever tray or container work best for you, though. I added a Safari Ltd. panda and cub from the Pandas TOOB for interest.\nFor the movable alphabet work, I used the panda movable alphabet cards from our subscriber freebie pack for matching or spelling along with a traditional small wooden movable alphabet. I also used Montessori Services language objects pin, pin, peg, pan, and pot as objects for spelling with the movable alphabet. For children working on their phonetic sounds, they the /p/ objects could be used in an object basket.\nIf you would like help with introducing phonetic sounds, introducing objects with sounds, or beginning phonics in general, check out my DIY Beginning Montessori Phonics with Preschoolers.\nParts of a Giant Panda Activity\nFree Printable: Label the Parts of a Giant Panda by Green Tree Montessori School at Teachers Pay Teachers\nThis can be a cut-and-paste activity or word tracing and writing activity. The control page is shown in the photo. I\u2019m using the cut-and-paste page on a Multicraft tray.\nHeart Panda Paper Craft\nFree Printable: Heart Panda Paper Craft from DLTK\u2019s Crafts for Kids\nI typically encourage process art activities, although it\u2019s fun to have a more structured craft sometimes for holidays or as an activity for following directions. As a child, I always loved making heart animals for Valentine\u2019s Day, so I couldn\u2019t resist this heart panda paper craft. It can be a simple cut-and-paste activity. Older kids can learn to cut out the hearts and create a panda without a printable. For young children who have difficulty cutting, you could have an activity simply for pasting. The results wouldn\u2019t need to look like the model!\nAdding with Pandas Activity\nFree Printable: Adding with Pandas from China Printable Pack at Every Star Is Different\nThis is a fun hands-on addition activity. It uses the Safari Ltd. Pandas TOOB. (Mine had 11 pandas when I got it a few years ago, but now there are 9 in the TOOB. Use whichever cards work best with your TOOB.) I also used Montessori Services baskets, whatever size of clothespin you prefer (I like small clothespins, such as 1\u2033 clothespins for interest and extra fine-motor work), and a small container for the clothespins. I use a small dot to mark the back of the correct number on each card. Then the child can turn the card over to check his or her answer.\nMatching Teen Numerals with Miniature Pandas and Bead Bars\nFree Printable: Panda Numbers (part of my subscriber freebie pack, so just sign up for my email to get the link and password \u2026 or check the bottom of your latest newsletter if you\u2019re already a subscriber)\nThis activity uses a piece of felt for a table mat (I used the Montessori Services felt table mat) and bead bars from the decanomial box in a Multicraft tray and a condiment cup (what I used here) or Montessori Services basket. (My bead bars, which I love, are from Alison\u2019s Montessori. You can get bead bars on Amazon, although I haven\u2019t personally used materials from those companies.) I also added 20 Safari Ltd. Good Luck Mini Pandas. Update: Most places are out of stock of the Good Luck Mini Pandas now, but you could use bead bars for 1-9 or 1-10 and Safari Ltd. Pandas TOOB (depending on how many pandas are in your TOOB or if you have a tenth panda from another TOOB).\nFor the activity, you could start with a column of 10 bears and then spin the spinner to find the units. Zoey loves the Safari Ltd. Good Luck Minis, and she enjoyed lining them up and counting them before adding the bead bars. In my Montessori-inspired bear activities, I had another way to do the activity if you don\u2019t use the spinner.\nFree Panda Printables for Preschoolers-First Graders\nMontessori-Inspired Panda Pack for DIY Cards and Counters, Number or Letter Matching, Number or Letter Basket, Bead Bar Work, Hands-on Math Operations, Number or Letter Salt/Sand Writing Tray, Letter Tracing, DIY Movable Alphabet, and Creative Writing (subscriber freebie, so just sign up for my email to get the link and password \u2013 or check your inbox if you\u2019re already a subscriber)\nPandas and Ten Frames Counting Activity using Free Ten Frame Cards from Teacher Blog Spot to prepare a counting activity for preschoolers with 10 of the pandas from the Pandas TOOB (all but the mother/baby pandas). This is in my \u201cMontessori-Inspired Continent Activities with Animal Figures and Landmarks \u2013 Asia\u201d post.\nFREE Panda Do-a-Dot Printable (Montessori-Inspired Instant Download)\nFREE Panda Cutting Strips (Montessori-Inspired Instant Download)\nMore Bear Posts\nFree Bear Printables and Montessori-Inspired Bear Activities\nHere\u2019s a fun geography activity combining themes from my winter sports unit and this panda unit. It uses the Asia map from Pin It! Maps, the China (panda) and South Korea (2018 Winter Olympics) country and flag pins, a panda from the Safari Ltd. Pandas TOOB, National Geographic Pandas book, and 2018 Winter Games book. This could easily be adapted for a general panda/China/Asia theme.\nHELPFUL ANIMAL CLASSIFICATION POSTS\nLearn more about my eBook Montessori at Home or School: How to.

These cautious and shy creatures are usually active early in the morning and in the evening. During the midday, they rest in tree holes or large, globe-shaped nests, constructed out of twigs and leaves and typically located in trees. Each squirrel has 2 - 5 nests, found within a small territory. One of these nests is made exclusively for producing and nursing the young, while others are used as sleeping sites. The Indian giant squirrels also very agile animals, able to take leaps of up to 6 meters when travelling among trees."}

They primarily live in North America, Europe, Russia and Asia, and prefer semi-open landscapes such as tundras, prairies, coasts and mountains. Solitary animals, brown bears are active at twilight and night.\nBear Family\nThere are 12 different subspecies of brown bear. The most well-known brown bear is the north American grizzly bear. It\u2019s stronger and heavier than the European brown bear. The Kodiak bear (also a brown bear) and the polar bear are the largest and heaviest bears in the world.\nBrown Bear Species\nThere are eight species: American black bears, collar bears, brown bears, polar bears, sloth bears, sun bears, spectacled bears, and giant pandas. Despite their names, red panda bears and koala bears aren\u2019t actually bears.\nBehavior\nWhat Do Brown Bears Eat?\nBrown bears may be predators but their diets aren\u2019t full of meat. In actual fact, they mostly eat grasses, plants, roots, nuts, mushrooms and berries. They also hunt small insects, birds, small rodents and sick, weak or young moose, reindeer, deer and bucks. They only eat salmon in coastal regions.\nAre Brown Bears Dangerous?\nBears are calm, gentle and social animals, but brown bears - and especially grizzly bears - are prone to attack, especially if a mother bear has cubs. Bears actually prefer to stay out of humans\u2019 way. But their habitat is becoming smaller and smaller as houses and roads are being built, meaning that bears accidently happen upon humans while searching for food.\nBrown Bears Hibernate\nBefore the icy cold winter months, bears gain 2 lb (1 kg) of body weight a day. This means they have enough reserves to rely on while they sleep, so they don\u2019t need to find food in the snow. With plenty of time, they withdraw to a cozy hide-away padded with plants. During hibernation, they make use of their \u201cextra padding\u201d, losing 20-40% of their body weight.\nEnemies and Threats\nAre Brown Bears Endangered?\nThe European brown bear and grizzly bear are not endangered. Some brown bears have already died out, e.g. the Atlas bear, Californian and Mexican brown bears. The Himalayan brown bear is endangered.\nSenses and Abilities\nBrown Bears Have a Keen Sense of Smell and Hearing\nThe brown bear\u2019s sense of smell is 100 times better than a human\u2019s. They can hear very well.\nBrown Bears Are Intelligent\nBrown bears have good memories (they remember where food can be found) and can even count - like primates!\nImportance for the Ecosystem\nBrown bears eat fruit and nuts that are excreted along with their feces. This way, they spread seeds all around the place, planting new plants and trees. Bears also keep nature in balance as they get rid of sick, weak and young animals and pick the bodies of dead animals clean.\nThe Brown Bear Is Related To:\nAnimals in the Same Biome:"}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Are Giant Pandas Carnivores, Herbivores, or Omnivores?", "url": "https://bestofpanda.com/are-giant-pandas-carnivores-herbivores-or-omnivores/", "text": "Giant Pandas eat bamboos all the time \u2013 which is enough evidence to support the fact that they are herbivores. However, did you know that they can eat meat too?\nThat being said, are panda bears really herbivores, carnivores or omnivores?\nHere is the quick answer \u2013 pandas are still considered herbivores because they mainly feed on bamboo stalks and leaves.\nFor starters, it can be confusing. How are they herbivores if they can eat meat?There is a whole background story behind giant pandas possessing many characteristics of carnivorous animals and still ending up herbivorous.\nSo, without any further, let\u2019s move to the part where we answer them!\nWhy is a Giant Panda Considered an Herbivore?\nGiant pandas are considered herbivores because of the fact that they solely feed on bamboo. Physiologically, they are carnivorous, with their bodies having the ability to digest meat.\nHowever, specific evolutionary incidences made them herbivorous.\nThis confusion often leads to the question if giant pandas are carnivores, herbivores, or omnivores?\nIt\u2019s true, that\u2019s a fair question. It\u2019s super confusing to have giant panda\u2019s physiology and anatomy resembling those of carnivores \u2013 with their nutrition confined to nothing more than bamboo stalks.\nKeeping giant panda\u2019s diet in mind, we tend to call and consider them herbivores. However, if they ever eat meat (that they do once in a while), they can digest it as well.\nAccording to many researchers, the giant pandas used to be carnivores in the beginning. However, with the passage of time, their peaceful nature made them adapt to this change.\nBecause of the high competition between carnivorous animals, the giant panda bears shifted their mode of nutrition to bamboos.\nSince they are generally peace-loving animals, they could not stand the idea of fighting with other carnivorous animals.\nWhat is the Difference Between Carnivore, Herbivore, and Omnivore?\nWe have been talking about the question that are giant pandas carnivores, herbivores, or omnivores? But do we even know what that means?\nGenerally speaking, animals that feed on other animals by preying on them are known as carnivores.\nThey possess sharp teeth and keen senses for efficient hunting. The metabolic systems of such animals are adapted to digest a high amount of protein that is present in their diet.\nExamples of carnivorous animals are as follows:\nLion\nWolf\nLeopard etc\nOn the other hand, herbivores are animals that feed on plants or herbs. These animals have blunt teeth that have a large surface area to help them chew their food properly.\nMoreover, they can usually digest vegetables and plant-based diets more efficiently than a high protein diet.\nTypical examples of herbivorous animals include the following:\nCow\nGoat\nHorses etc\nOmnivores are those animals that feed on plants, animals, algae, and fungi.\nThey range from small animals such as insects to larger ones, including humans. What makes omnivorous animals different is the fact that they have metabolic systems adapted to digest both high protein and high fiber diets. In this way, they can feed on both types quite easily.\nSome of the examples of omnivorous animals include:\nHumans\nBears\nBirds\nDogs\nRaccoons\nFoxes\nWhat do Pandas Eat Besides Bamboo?\nGiant pandas are very low-maintenance animals. They do not have any specific dietary requirements. Although they love to eat bamboo, and 90% of their diet comprises bamboo leaves and stalks, they will practically eat many other fruits, vegetables, and even cakes and puddings as well!\nSo, the question that are giant pandas carnivores, omnivores, or herbivores will be answered by considering things that they usually eat. Some of the fruits that giant pandas eat include the following:\nApples\nBananas\nMangoes\nBerries\nGrape wines\nSpeaking of vegetables, you will find a lot of giant pandas eating vegetables such as:\nGreen corn\nBroccoli\nZucchini\nCarrots\nString beans\nOther root vegetables.\nOccasionally, they will eat small animals such as fish, squirrels, lizards, and rats as well. They do not quite like the idea of hunting, but they can hunt small animals if they ever need to.\nWhat might take you by surprise is the fact that giant pandas have a sweet tooth. Are you wondering what it actually means to possess a sweet tooth for a giant panda?\nWell, that means they would happily eat cakes, puddings, and many other sweet dishes! Isn\u2019t it cute?\nCan Giant Pandas Eat Meat?\nMetabolically and physiologically, giant pandas can definitely eat meat. Although the answer to the famous question \u201care giant pandas carnivores, herbivores or omnivores?\u201d is \u201cherbivores,\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean that they cannot eat meat.\nGiant pandas can eat and digest meat because of the presence of Clostridium in their gut or digestive system. However, they prefer not to. Once in a while, you will come across giant pandas getting their hands dirty of small animals to fulfill their nutritional (protein) requirements.\nWhat Kind of Meat Do Pandas Eat?\nGiant pandas can eat any type of meat they want. However, in times of emergency or need, they mostly eat small animals or insects. This is because they only attempt to hunt small insects such as lizards or rats.\nIt is their personal choice to skip the meat and prefer bamboo over it. However, it has nothing to do with their physiological and anatomical structures.\nThey still possess the teeth and metabolic systems to feed and digest meat. Therefore, if you give them the meat of small or large animals or even anything made from it, they will not only eat it but will digest it as well.\nDo Pandas Eat People?\nThe very straight answer to this is a big no! Giant pandas are very peaceful and affectionate animals.\nThey keep themselves away from any activity that involves danger. This is the very obvious reason why they switched their carnivorous lifestyle to a herbivorous one.\nGiant pandas are quite lazy and slow animals because of their diet confined to bamboo. They prefer to spend time in solitude under the shady trees and rarely attack any animal, let alone human beings.\nHowever, some people tend to irritate them. Once provoked, like any other animal, they\u2019d react to attack.\nWhy Did Pandas Stop Eating Meat?\nThere are quite a few reasons why giant pandas moved to a herbivorous lifestyle and quit meat.\nAccording to researchers, the pseudogenes of the taste receptors Tas1r1 in giant pandas decreased their reliance on meat. This is because they can\u2019t get the same taste of meat anymore.\nTherefore, the attraction for it decreased with time. Now they find bamboo tastier and love to rely mostly on it.\nSpeaking of the behavioral lifestyle, there is another reason. Since giant pandas are amicable and do not want to get in any type of predator-prey activity, the hunt for animals did not suit their nature.\nTherefore, instead of fighting fierce animals like Lions or Tigers, they sufficed on bamboo shoots and leaves.\nSlowly, their reliance on bamboo increased, and they switched themselves to a more vegetarian lifestyle.\nFinal Thoughts\nToday we have learned that giant pandas are classified as herbivorous because they mainly rely on bamboo shoots and leaves to meet their nutritional requirements.\nHowever, giant pandas are very kind and affectionate. They would love a nice gentle cuddle and would happily spend time alone under a shady tree.\nGiant Pandas love to eat a lot of Bamboo, and that\u2019s the reason why you\u2019d mostly find them sitting between lots of bamboo stalks and leaves. Well, that certainly makes them more loveable!\nIf you have a thirst for learning and knowing more about giant pandas, you must visit our blogs.\nWe update about our favorite animal because there still a lot more to know about these cuddle bears!"}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Red Panda Facts \u2013 Red Panda Rescue", "url": "https://redpandarescue.org/about-red-panda/", "text": "Red Pandas live in the Eastern Himalayas in places like Nepal, Bhutan, and south western China living at altitudes of 7,000 to 12,000 feet in temperate forests. Primarily a herbivore, the name panda is said to come from the Nepali word \u2018ponya,\u2019 which means bamboo or plant eating animal.\nDespite them both being found in the same continent and both sharing a name and feeding mainly on bamboo \u2013 the red panda has little resemblance to its distant cousin: the giant panda. It is also of the same taxonomy as the raccoon, with which it shares a ringed tail and similar size. However, red pandas are considered members of their own unique family \u2014 the Ailuridae."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Red Panda vs. Giant Panda | Paradise Wildlife Park", "url": "https://www.pwpark.com/news/red-panda-vs-giant-panda/", "text": "As their name would suggest, you would think that Red Pandas and Giant Pandas are long distance cousins. However, their relationship is an unusual one, as yes, there are many similarities in terms of diet and appearance, but there are also significant differences between the two iconic creatures.\nIn their very genus there are striking differences. Even though they are both called \u2018pandas\u2019 they belong to different family groups. Giant Pandas belong to the Urisdae or \u2018bear\u2019 family, whereas red pandas belong to the Ailuridae family. The Ailuridae family is taxonomically unique because it is monotopic \u2013 there is only one animal consisting of the species. Research has found that despite the two animals belong to different families today, they have a common ancient ancestor.\nHowever, just to make things complicated, scientists Wilson and Reeder found that there are two distinct species of Red Pandas. These species are the Himalayan Red Panda and Chinese Red Panda. Both regions are shown to produce Red Pandas that differ in morphology and biogeography.\nDespite Red Pandas being known as a \u2018lesser\u2019 panda, they are in fact the original panda. French zoologist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cuvier first described the western Red Panda Ailurus fulgens in 1825, 48 years before the black-and-white bear was catalogued. As Giant Pandas dwarf Red Pandas, we can suspect that Red Pandas are known as \u2018lesser\u2019 purely due to their small size.\nThe name \u201cpanda\u201d is believed to be derived from the Nepalese words: \u201cnigalya ponya\u201d meaning \u201cbamboo eater.\u201d Bamboo is a huge part of both Giant Pandas\u2019 and Red Pandas\u2019 diets. However, Giant Pandas eat up to 20kg of bamboo a day, while Red Pandas only eat 2-3kg of bamboo a day, along with fruit and insects. Both the Red Panda and the Giant Panda have an enlarged wrist bone, engineered to hold bamboo stems while they eat! This is also described as a \u201cfalse thumb.\u201d\nSadly, both animals are threatened by human impacts on their natural environments. Deforestation is the major threat to these species, as well as being poached for the illegal wildlife trade. As a result, Red Pandas are classified as \u2018Endangered\u2019 and Giant Pandas as \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 by the IUCN Red List. Paradise Wildlife Park\u2019s Red Pandas Nam Pang and Tilly are excellent ambassadors for their wild counterparts. We hope that by visiting Nam Pang and Tilly, adopting them, or having an animal experience with them, we can help educate the wider general public about the threats wild Red Pandas face.\nOne way of saving the species is by keeping a healthy and genetically diverse population of captive Red Pandas and Giant Pandas. The international breeding programme is the governing body that ensures the safe and sustainable breeding of animals for conservation purposes. Nam Pang and Tilly are part of the breeding programme, and we hope that one day they will have cubs. In general, zoos would say that Red Pandas breed very successfully whilst in captivity. However, Giant Pandas are a bit trickier. Female Giant Pandas only ovulate once a year, which means they only have 2-3 days available for conception. This makes the breeding of Giant Pandas significantly more difficult, whether this is in the wild or in captivity.\nWe hope that you visit our beautiful Red Pandas here at Paradise Wildlife Park! Make sure to book your tickets in advance as to not miss out. We cannot wait to welcome you."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "17 Critically Endangered Species in 2022 \u2013 Fauna Facts", "url": "https://faunafacts.com/endangered-species/", "text": "17 Critically Endangered Species (2022)\nBy Dr. Chris Drew, PhD in Education\nIn 2022, there are 37,400 species threatened with extinction, with 3,483 classified as critically endangered[source]. These animals all have a 50% probability of going extinct within 10 years or 3 generations.\nHuman-caused reasons for species decline include over-hunting, deforestation, agriculture expansion, urbanization, mining, construction of road and rail corridors, introduction of invasive species, and human induced climate change.\nAmong the most critically endangered species on this year\u2019s official IUCN Red List are the Orangutan, Javan Rhinocerus, Hawksbill Turtle, and the Eastern Lowland Gorilla.\nList of Critically Endangered Species in 2022\n1. Orangutans\nScientific Name Pongo Conservation Status Critically Endangered Range Remote Forests in Indonesia, Borneo, and Malaysia Estimated Population (2022) 120,000 Key Threats Batang Toru hydropower project, Exotic pet trade\n1. About\n2. Range\n3. Threats\n4. Conservation About The heart-warmingly playful orangutan can be found in Indonesia, Borneo, and Malaysia. This gentle creature has had its habitat encroached upon by human activities in recent decades, while climate change has also posed a growing threat. Its population is in severe decline despite extensive efforts to protect it. There are three species of Orangutan \u2013 the Sumerian, Bornean, and Tapanuli Orangutans. All three are considered to be critically endangered. Across all three species, there are estimated to be less than 120,000 Orangutans left in the world[source]: Tapanuli Orangutan (P. tapanuliensis) \u2013 Fewer than 800\n(P. tapanuliensis) Fewer than 800 Sumatran Orangutan (P. abelii) \u2013 About 13,500\n(P. abelii) About 13,500 Bornean Orangutan (P. pygmaeus) \u2013 Between 55,000 and 105,000 Considering that in 1976, there were over 280,000 Bornean Orangutans alone[source], this population decline is a serious concern. Orangutan Range Threats The Batang Toru hydropower project is one of the Orangutan\u2019s greatest threats. This power plant is being built in the heart of the Tapanuli Orangutan\u2019s only habitat. The enormous project will deliver reliable power to the North Sumatran province, but has an huge footprint. The project requires the redirection of a river and construction of a large man-made dam. This project is expected to split the Orangutan\u2019s population of just 800 into three smaller groups which will be unable to sustain themselves due to forced inbreeding[source]. Conservation Efforts The Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme[source] is the preeminent NGO working to protect Orangutans. The organization rescues and confiscates Orangutans illegally held as pets, rehabilitates them, and reintroduces them to the wild. They release them into two protected habitats in areas where the Orangutans once lived but are no longer found. The intention of the project is to create a new genetically viable population that can remain active, even if other wild populations die out. To achieve this, they need as much genetic diversity in the new population as possible. Other NGOs, such as The Orangutan Project, focus on protecting existing forests that are not currently protected. Up to 80% of Orangutan territory is unprotected. This organization monitors illegal activities, takes legal action where it can, and lobbies for forest protection. Individuals can also \u2018adopt an orangutan\u2019 through The Orangutan Project.\n2. Hawksbill Turtles\nScientific Name Eretmochelys imbricata Conservation Status Critically Endangered Range Tropics and Subtropics Estimated Population (2022) 15,000 to 23,000 nesting females Key Threats Illegal Turtle Shell Trade\n1. About\n2. Range\n3. Threats\n4. Conservation About The iconic Hawksbill Turtle has seen 84% of its population decline within three generations. Estimates place the current population at 15,000 to 23,000 nesting females[source]. Hawksbill turtles roam all of the world\u2019s tropics and subtropics. You can find them anywhere from Yemen to Mexico to Vietnam. Major populations are found in North-Eastern Australia, the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico, and on Cuba\u2019s coastlines. Hawksbill Turtle Range Threats The turtle shell trade is a major existential threat to the Hawksbill turtle. The trade of turtle shells was made illegal in 1977 when turtle shells were added as a banned product to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)[source]. However, Japan carved out an exception and continued to hunt Hawksbill turtles up until 1993. Cuba followed Japan\u2019s lead and imposed a moratorium on the hunting of turtle shells in 2008[source]. Unfortunately, huge stockpiles of Hawksbill shells have allowed the illegal trade to continue. It is hard to tell the difference between stockpiled shells and newly hunted shells, making it harder to police poaching. The illegal trade is most visible in Nicaragua and Colombia[source] where unwitting tourists \u2013 often from the United States \u2013 buy the beautiful jewelry made from the shells and bring them back to America. Conservation Efforts Conservation efforts fit into two camps. The first is education of tourists and the second is habitat regeneration. Tourist education is most prominently promoted through the Too Rare to Wear campaign. They primarily aim to educate tourists to Central and South America about buying ethically sourced jewelry. The second conservation effort is habitat regeneration. While there is substantial evidence of steep overall population decline, conservation efforts have seen populations stabilize in some areas[source]. Major conservation efforts are concentrated in Florida, Thailand, and Queensland Australia [source]. Conservation is focused on reducing populations of invasive predators such as feral pigs from around nesting habitats and cleaning the oceans of deadly plastic waste.\n3. Gorillas\nScientific Name Gorilla gorilla, Gorilla beringei Conservation Status Critically Endangered Range Sub-Saharan Africa Estimated Population (2022) Less than 320,000 Key Threats Poachers, Mining, and Road Construction\n1. About\n2. Range\n3. Threats\n4. Conservation About The Eastern Lowlands, Western Lowlands, and Cross River Gorillas are all critically endangered with extremely low and declining wild populations. There are estimated to be 2,600 Eastern Lowlands Gorillas and 316,000 Western Lowlands Gorillas. The Cross River Gorilla is a sub-species of the Western Lowlands Gorilla with a population estimated at 250-300. The Mountain Gorilla, a subspecies of the Eastern Gorilla, has a population of around 1,000, which has risen from 600 in 2015. The rising population has justified placing the Mountain Gorilla in the \u2018endangered\u2019 rather than \u2018critically endangered\u2019 category. All Gorillas are found in Sub-Saharan Africa, including in nations such as Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Gorilla Range Threats Gorillas are threatened by poachers, mining, and new road construction. New roads, constructed to build new mines, fragment gorilla habitats. They also give poachers easier access to deeper into Gorilla territory. Poachers hunt gorillas for bushmeat as well as their use in traditional medicines. Unfortunately, gorillas have a low reproduction rate. A mother has just one baby every four to six years[source]. This means it doesn\u2019t require many poachers to cause serious damage to the Gorilla population[source]. Conservation Efforts The International Gorilla Conservation Programme (IGCP), established in 1979, is the premier conservation program for protecting Gorillas and their habitats[source]. Interestingly, a key focus of conservation efforts is to support ethical tourism. When people go to visit the Gorillas, the tourism money is used to protect the Gorillas and support local communities, which decreases the temptation to hunt these great creatures. Ethical tourism also aims to ensure the Gorillas are protected from human diseases such as influenza, which can be spread to the great apes during human contact.\n4. Rhinos\nScientific Names Rhinoceros sondaicus, Dicerorhinus sumatrensis, Diceros bicornis Conservation Status Critically Endangered Range Eastern Africa, Southern Africa, South-East Asia Estimated Population (2022) Less than 30,000 Key Threats Poachers, Forest Fires, and Habitat Destruction\n1. About\n2. Range\n3. Threats\n4. Conservation About There are three of five species of Rhinoceros who are critically endangered. These are the Black Rhino, Javan Rhinoceros, and Sumatran Rhinoceros. The White Rhino is \u2018near threatened\u2019 and the Greater One-Horned Rhino is \u2018vulnerable\u2019. Across these populations, the Sumatran Rhinoceros is in extreme danger, with many remaining pockets of population being too small to be considered viable in the long-term. There are less than 80 Sumatran Rhinos left in the world, although it is very difficult to accurately assess the population due to the animals\u2019 elusive nature. The largest pocket is thought to be a group of 12-33 Sumatran Rhinos in Way Kambas, Indonesia[source]. The estimated species populations in 2022 are as follows: Black Rhino: 5,366 \u2013 5,627\n5,366 \u2013 5,627 Javan Rhino: 74\n74 Sumatran Rhino: <80\n<80 Greater One-Horned Rhino: 3,588\n3,588 White Rhino: 17,212 \u2013 18,915 While there are more Black Rhinos than Greater One-Horned Rhinos, the precipitous population decline of the Black Rhino makes scientists increasingly concerned about their survival. Rhinoceros Range Threats Rhinos are exposed to an array of threats. The Rhino horn trade is an overarching threat for all species, with demand for Rhino horn in Vietnam and China still driving much of the illegal poaching[source]. Sumatran Rhinos have had the unique threat of forest fires destroying their habitats in recent decades, while Javan Rhinos have had their habitat reduced by up to 60%[source] due to the spread of the Arenga palm tree whose thick growth on forest floors restricts the growth of Rhino food sources. Conservation Efforts Conservation efforts focus on eliminating rhino horn trade, protecting and regenerating habitats, and promoting breeding in rhino sancturaries. The Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary (SRS) in Way Kambas provides a protective semi-wild existence for the animals that gives veterinary care and protection from poaching. There are currently 7 Rhinos in their sanctuary, and there have been two captive births. Save the Rhino also works on suppressing demand for rhino horns by educating the public on the dangers of poaching and dispelling myths about health benefits of rhino horn. They also fund habitat regeneration in Indonesia.\n5. Hammerhead Shark\nScientific Name Sphyrnidae Conservation Status Critically Endangered Range Tropics Estimated Population (2022) Unknown Key Threats Fishing Nets\n1. About\n2. Range\n3. Threats\n4. Conservation About The Smalleye, Scalloped and Great Hammerhead Sharks are all critically endangered, while the Smooth Hammerhead is listed as vulnerable. The overall population of hammerhead sharks is unknown due to a lack of measurement methodology. However, studies[source] have demonstrated the great hammerhead\u2019s catch rate, which correlates with population density, has decreased by between 50% \u2013 80% since the 1970s. The iconic shark is found throughout the world\u2019s tropics, including the coastlines of Australia, Mexico, South America, South Asia, and Africa. Sadly, fishing of the shark continues today, and remains legal in even developed areas, such as some jurisdictions in Australia[source]. Hammerhead Shark Range Threats The key threat to the hammerhead shark is over-fishing. Commercial nets catch the shark by accident, while they\u2019re also intentionally hunted for their fins. Shark fin soup is a delicacy in South-East Asia, but can also be found in restaurants in North America[source]. Shark fins are often cut off and the shark released into the ocean where they die due to their inability to swim[source]. Conservation Efforts Sadly, there are minimal conservation efforts to protect the hammerhead shark. Efforts to protect them from over-fishing vary by jurisdiction. Florida insists on instant release[source] while most jurisdictions in Australia have annual catch limits[source]. The IUCN recommends banning retention of hammerheads and instant release of sharks caught in nets. However, proposals to ban \u2018hammerhead landings\u2019 (taking bycatch to shore) through the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) have repeatedly failed.\n6. Macaws\nScientific Name Anodorhynchus glaucus, Ara glaucogularis, Ara ambiguus Conservation Status Critically Endangered Range Pockets of Central and South America Estimated Population (2022) Varied \u2013 See Explanation Below Key Threats Habitat Destruction, Poaching\n1. About\n2. Range\n3. Threats\n4. Conservation About Three of 19 species of Macaw are critically endangered. These are the Blue-Throated Macaw, Great Green Macaw, and Red-Fronted Macaw. The Cuban Macaw is already extinct. The Macaw of most concern is the Glaucous Macaw which hasn\u2019t been seen since 2001. Estimates place the probability of them still existing being at around 40%[source]. The critically endangered population estimates stand at: Glaucous Macaw 0-20\nGreat Green Macaw 500-1000\nRed-fronted Macaw 200-600 The Glaucous Macaw and Red-Fronted Macaw were once widely found in pockets of South America, particularly around Bolivia and Uruguay respectively. The Great Green Macaw\u2019s geographic range is Guatemala down to Colombia and Ecuador. Macaw Range Threats All three critically endangered macaw species face the dual threats of deforestation and poaching. Deforestation for the expansion of agriculture continues to pose a significant threat, particularly to the imperiled Glaucous Macaw. Pineapple farming fields have expanded dramatically, leaving the macaws with increasingly smaller habitats to roam[source]. Similarly, agricultural expansion and deforestation for firewood continue to threaten the Red-fronted and Great Green Macaws[source]. Wild macaws are captured in order to be traded as cagebird pets. Researchers scouring pet markets have found numerous red-fronted Macaws being illegally sold in Bolivia and Peru[source]. Conservation Efforts Conservation efforts have been slow and led by NGOs rather than governments. One of the most active conservation foundations is Armon\u00eda Bolivia. They focus their efforts on protecting macaw habitats and establishing breeding boxes to facilitate population growth. They actively protect one particular breeding cliff where a flock of Red-fronted Macaws are known to live[source]. Protection of Cerro Blanco and surrounding forests is also underway to protect and expand the Great Green Macaw habitat[source].\n7. Bumble Bees\nScientific Name Bombus Conservation Status Critically Endangered Range Europe and North America Estimated Population (2022) Unknown Key Threats Climate Change, Pesticides, Pathogens\n1. About\n2. Range\n3. Threats\n4. Conservation About Bumble bee species listed as critically endangered include the Suckley Cuckoo Bumble Bee, Franklin\u2019s Bumble Bee, and the Rusty Patched Bumble Bee. Other populations, such as the Common Eastern Bumble Bee, remain stable. Overall bumble bee populations are falling worldwide. One influential US study[source] looking at four bumble bee species found that their populations have fallen by up to 96%, with their geographical ranges contracting by 23\u201387%. Another study[source] of 66 species in Europe and North America found a less extreme but still concerning 17% decline over 100 years. This is part of a broader phenomenon known as pollinator decline. Beginning in the 1990s, most of the world\u2019s pollinator species have experienced rapid population loss[source]. As an important intermediary for flora reproduction, the loss of pollinators is having extremely concerning flow-on effects for entire ecosystems. Bumble Bee Range (All Species) Threats Climate change is known to be a key cause of pollinator decline. Bumble bees are highly susceptible to small changes in temperature and are known to prefer cooler climates overall. Scientists have found correlation between areas with extreme temperature swings and higher overall temperatures and bumble bee population decline[source]. Loss of habitat due to agricultural expansion, use of agricultural pesticides, and spread of pathogens from commercial to wild bee populations are also cited as threats[source]. Conservation Efforts Bumble Bee conservation is something everyone can participate in. Despite their decreasing abundance, remaining populations of bumble bees still frequent backyards across Europe and North America. To encourage their presence, plant native flowers and avoid use of pesticides in your own gardens[source]. Both North America and the United Kingdom have apps for anyone to take photos of bumble bees in their gardens which are then uploaded to the app. These citizen science projects allow scientists to find and monitor rare bumble bee species. On a governmental level, reduction in pesticide use in agriculture remains key. Many pesticides are still in use on farms, while many others have already been banned[source].\n8. Sumatran Elephant\nScientific Name Elephas maximus sumatrensis Conservation Status Critically Endangered Range Remote Forests in Indonesia Estimated Population (2022) Less than 2,800 Key Threats Deforestation, Palm Oil Plantations, Poachers\n1. About\n2. Range\n3. Threats\n4. Conservation About The most up-to-date survey of Sumatran Elephant populations was in 2008 when it was estimated that there were between 2,400 and 2,800 left in the wild. However, given the rapid decline of their population over recent decades, this is likely an overestimate [source]. They once roamed all over the Indonesian island of Sumatra, but today their populations are split, dispersed, and declining. Dozens of herds have died out in the past 40 years and they became locally extinct in 23 of their 43 known ranges[source]. There was 50% population loss between 1985 and 2007 alone[source]. The Sumatran Elephant shares similar habitats to the Sumatran Tiger, Sumatran Orangutan, and Sumatran Rhino who are also on this list as critically endangered species due to Sumatra\u2019s long-running deforestation practices. Sumatran Elephant Range Threats The primary threat to the Sumatran Elephant is the depletion of their habitats. An estimated 69% of their habitat had been depleted between 1980 and 2007. This habitat has been overtaken for agriculture and palm oil plantations. Poaching for elephant tusk also remains a serious problem with estimates taken between 2012 and 2015 showing 10% of all wild Sumatran Elephants had been killed for ivory in just that 3 year period[source]. As humans move deeper into forests and clear land for agriculture, elephant populations become separated, fragmented, and too small to be viable in the long-term. Unfortunately, proposed roads through Leuser National Park will only open up the elephant\u2019s habitat to more human contact[source]. Conservation Efforts The greatest hope for the preservation of a viable wild Sumatran Elephant population is Tesso Nilo National Park which was established in 2004 and has since doubled in size[source]. There are an estimated 150 Sumatran Elephants in the park. However, illegal palm oil plantations continually appear in the park and wildfires exacerbated by climate change have recently ripped through large swathes of the park. Furthermore, nearby villagers continue to kill elephants that roam too close to their plantations as the elephants are considered pests by locals[source]. Everyday citizens can choose not to purchase palm oil products to deplete demand, which can in turn deter farmers from clearing more land for palm oil plantations. Even companies who claim to ethically produce palm oil are suspected of buying their oil from the illegal plantations owned by former military brass[source].\n9. Sumatran Tiger\nScientific Name Panthera tigris sondaica Conservation Status Critically Endangered Range Remote Forests in Indonesia Estimated Population (2022) 328 \u2013 908 Key Threats Deforestation, Palm Oil Plantations, Poachers\n1. About\n2. Range\n3. Threats\n4. Conservation About It is estimated that there are just 328 \u2013 908 Sumatran Tigers left in the wild today[source]. Recent surveys have demonstrated a population decline of 16.6% between 2000 and 2012. Of most concern is the fact that the subpopulations have become so fragmented that there are only two viable populations left, defined by the presence of 30 or more females of breeding age[source]. They have traditionally inhabited forested areas in both the lowlands and mountains on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. Like the Sumatran Elephant and Sumatran Orangutan, with whom they share a habitat, agriculturalists and palm oil farmers have been their greatest threat. The majority of the remaining Sumatran Tigers live in a series of dispersed but fragmented national parks, although about 100 remain in unprotected forest that is rapidly being eroded. Sumatran Tiger Range Threats Deforestation and poaching are two the major threats faced by the remaining Sumatran Tiger populations. Poachers continue to hunt the tiger to use its bones for jewelry, tiger skin rugs, and tiger bone wine. Tiger bone wine is a delicacy among ultra-rich Chinese consumers. It is believed by some that tiger bone wine gives the drinker the traits of the tiger[source]. The unbridled growth of palm tree forests for the production of palm oil has also encroached on the Sumatran Tiger\u2019s habitat. Western appetite for palm tree oil, found in many shampoos and foods such as pizza dough, encourages the growth of palm tree plantations. Meanwhile, due to the shrinking habitat, the tiger\u2019s traditional prey is also dwindling, which can affect the tiger population density a forest can carry[source]. Conservation Efforts Within national parks, illegal poaching and even deforestation still occur. To combat this, anti-poaching patrols have been set up to remove snare traps and deter poachers by ensuring law enforcement is visible around the forest. Furthermore, a fatwa (Islamic religious degree) has been ordered against poaching by religious authorities. Rapid response teams have also been set up by Flora and Fauna International to minimize human-tiger conflict. When there are tiger-human encounters, trained personnel attend the scene to ensure the tiger is moved along swiftly rather than being killed by the local population. There is also a reserve of Sumatran Tigers in zoos around the world whose population is slowly growing. However, the captive population suffers from inbreeding, which is hard to counter given the low remaining population worldwide[source].\n10. North Atlantic Right Whales\nScientific Name Eubalaena glacialis Conservation Status Critically Endangered Range North Atlantic Coastline Estimated Population (2022) 400 Key Threats Commercial Fishing Nets, Collisions with Vessels\n1. About\n2. Range\n3. Threats\n4. Conservation About Multiple whale species are listed as endangered by IUCN, but that of most concern is the North Atlantic Right Whale. Once abundant in the Atlantic Ocean, it became one of the most heavily hunted species by whalers in the 18th and 19th Centuries[source]. Labeled the \u2018right\u2019 whale because whalers thought it the best whale to catch, it\u2019s got a high blubber count and swims close to the surface of the water. Both these features made it an attractive animal to hunt. Until recently there were two populations of North Atlantic Right Whales, although the eastern population has not been sighted in a number of years. The remaining population numbers about 400 and are observed up and down the east coast of North America as well as Iceland and Greenland[source]. Between 2017 and 2019, several of these whales were found dead, causing heightened concern within the scientific community[source]. North Atlantic Right Whale Range Threats While historically whaling was the biggest threat to the North Atlantic Right Whale, today whaling has been banned throughout the whale\u2019s range. The biggest threats today are commercial nets thrown to catch fish and collisions with ships. Because North Atlantic Right Wales swim close to the surface, they will often encounter both boats and nets. Surveys have found that most (82%) North Atlantic Right Wales have scars from being caught in nets, indicating very frequent annual encounters with commercial fishing vessels[source]. Furthermore, 52% of autopsied North Atlantic Right Whales in one study were found to have died from blunt trauma consistent with collisions with large commercial vessels[source]. Conservation Efforts The most effective step to reduce the precipitous decline in the Right Whale population was a moratorium on whaling which extends back to the 1930s. More recently, conservation has primarily been the concern of the Canadian and US governments. Both governments have initiated large vessel speed restrictions during migratory season. Some evidence[source] suggests these speed restrictions have helped reduce collisions between whales and vessels. Some types of fishing nets have also been banned in migratory routes. In particular, fixed snow crab and lobster fishing gear have been limited in parts of Canadian water[source].\n11. Philippine Crocodile\nScientific Name Crocodylus mindorensis Conservation Status Critically Endangered Range Mindanao (Philippines) Estimated Population (2022) 100 Key Threats Dynamite Fishing, Human Killing\n1. About\n2. Range\n3. Threats\n4. Conservation About The Philippine Crocodile is the most endangered crocodile species in the world. Despite this, it remains under-researched and its conservation status is unknown to many locals. This freshwater crocodile is only found on the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. There are estimated to be about 100 adults left in the population, despite once being abundant. Hatchlings are not counted in the population due to their high mortality rate. Philippine crocodiles are understood to be very good for the local ecosystem. They keep local fish stocks in a healthy ecological balance by eating slow, sick and abundant fish. This ensures the fish stock is overall in good condition while also ensuring no one fish species becomes too dominant. Philippine Crocodile Range Threats Dangerous fishing methods such as dynamite fishing pose a serious threat to crocodiles in the Philippines. Many locals also consider the Philippine Crocodile to be a threat to their safety, despite the fact it will rarely attack humans. Nonetheless, other larger and more dangerous saltwater crocodiles that inhabit the Philippines give all crocodiles in the nation a bad name. This can lead locals to kill any crocodile on sight[source]. Conservation Efforts Laws protecting the Philippine Crocodile were put in place in 2001. Several zoos in the Philippines and Australia have sustainable captive breeding programs for a safety net population. This population may be used for genetic diversity in the future. The Mabuwaya Foundation also offers people the chance to \u2018sponsor a croc\u2019. Through this program, the foundation goes into local schools and has students measure captive bred crocodiles to determine their age and health. The foundation helps to educate locals about the importance of preserving the endemic species.\n12. Vaquita Dolphin\nPublic Domain Image by Paula Olson, NOAA\nScientific Name Phocoena sinus Conservation Status Critically Endangered Range Northern Gulf of California Estimated Population (2022) 0 \u2013 20 Key Threats Commercial Fishing Nets, Sharks\n1. About\n2. Range\n3. Threats\n4. Conservation About The Vaquita Dolphin have been spotted exclusively in a pocket in the northern end of the Gulf of California. This is the inner coastline of the Baja California peninsula in Mexico, just south of the state of California. Unfortunately, the Vaquita is expected to go extinct imminently, with rapid population decline occurring in recent decades. Population estimates showed the population dropped from 567 in 1997 to 19 in 2018[source]. Based on this rapid decline, it is probable that this dolphin will never be seen again. Vaquita Dolphin Range Threats The Vaquita dolphin was faced with the twin effects of over-hunting by sharks, and incidental capture during commercial fishing. Gillnet surveys published in 2000 found that fishing nets were depleting the population by 7%-15% per year. Due to the low population, they have been considered to be an unsustainable population, and inbreeding is likely to render extinction unavoidable. Conservation Efforts The International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita has since 1997 recommended banning large fishing nets in the gulf. From 2008 to 2017 the Mexican government slowly introduced some laws to similarly restrict the use of gillnets, but illegal gillnet fishing has continued every year since. The US government banned seafood caught in the Vaquita range in 2020, clearly far too late for the species\u2019 survival. Sea Shepherd, a conservation organization famous for attempting to sabotage commercial whaling vessels, sent ships to the Vaquita habitat to remove illegal gillnets, in response to the Mexican government\u2019s lack of enforcement.\n13. Peacock Tarantula\nScientific Name Poecilotheria metallica Conservation Status Critically Endangered Range A single forest in Andhra Pradesh (India) Estimated Population (2022) Unknown Key Threats Habitat Destruction, Poaching\n1. About\n2. Range\n3. Threats\n4. Conservation About The Peacock Tarantula got its name from its remarkable blue coloration. This tarantula was believed to be extinct for over 100 years before it was rediscovered in 2001[source]. The population of the Peacock Tarantula is unknown due to lack of sufficient measurement methodology and the secretive pet trade. However, it is known to be critically endangered due to its very small range in the wild. It only exists in a small forest in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh which is less than 100 km2 [source]. The spider has not been bred in captivity in a zoo. The one known captive male died within 2 years of its capture without breeding. However, there are underground breeders in Europe and the United States who are believed to be successfully breeding and selling the spider to exotic pet enthusiasts [source]. Peacock Tarantula Range Threats The key threat to the species is habitat destruction. The spider was re-discovered in a highly disturbed forest that was not sufficiently protected from human activities. Local villagers would use the wood in the forest for firewood and construction timber[source]. Rare spider breeders have also been caught poaching Peacock Tarantulas and smuggling them to Europe to sell for a premium. Poaching remains a significant threat. Conservation Efforts Unfortunately, there is minimal conservation effort underway. There is a protected forest area called the Gundla Brahmeshwaram Wildlife Sanctuary just 20 km from the location where the Peacock Tarantula is known to live. Conservationists believe there is potential for the tarantula to continue to thrive if it were to develop a substantial population in the sanctuary[source]. However, relocation is difficult because it may diffuse the local population, and the local population is already small and very hard to find. The best prospects for survival may, ironically, be through the breeders who illegally poached the tarantula from its habitat.\n14. Red Wolf\nScientific Name Canis lupus rufus Conservation Status Critically Endangered Range South-Eastern United States Estimated Population (2022) <300 Key Threats Landowners, Hybridization, Vehicles\n1. About\n2. Range\n3. Threats\n4. Conservation About Wolves once roamed Europe, Asia, and North America in far greater numbers and across significantly wider regions than they do today. Several wolf species in North America were hunted to extinction, including the Newfoundland wolf, Southwestern wolf, Cascade Mountain wolf, Great Plains wolf, and Rocky Mountain wolves. In Europe, the six subspecies were near extinct before they were bred in captivity and released into protected lands[source]. Today, the wolf of most concern is the critically endangered red wolf of North Carolina. There is a stable captive population of about 245 wolves, but reintroduction to the wild has been mired with a range of problems including conflict with humans and hybridization due to breeding with coyotes. Red Wolf Range Threats The Red Wolf\u2019s greatest threat is conflict with humans. The carcasses of released wolves are frequently identified, often within weeks of release, on roadsides after collisions with vehicles[source]. Furthermore, attempts to re-introduce the red wolf in North Carolina has been met with backlash from local populations. Landowners view them as unwelcome pests and they are regularly shot. Backlash from local populations has consistently hindered reintroduction efforts and diluted their effect. Another major threat is hybridization due to breeding with coyotes who have moved into their traditional lands[source]. Successive attempts to re-introduce the Red Wolf to the wild have led to sufficient hybridization that scientists have been concerned that the genetically pure red wolf would not survive in the wild. In 2015, the US Fish and Wildlife Service also discontinued coyote sterilization programs, and since, purebred Red Wolves have become scarce[source]. Conservation Efforts Repopulation efforts have been in place since the 1970s, but most have been unsuccessful. The first attempt was a failed reintroduction to the Texas and Louisiana wilderness in 1972. Around the same time, captive breeding programs were ramped-up to create a sustainable captive population[source]. Reintroduction in North Carolina has been ongoing since the late 1980s. The wild population reached a high of about 130 individuals in 2011, but has since fallen dramatically due to human-wolf conflict. Despite successive attempts to reintroduce the Red Wolf to the wild, there are just 20 red wolves roaming as part of a nonessential experimental population in North Carolina. The Red Wolf will continue to survive in the captive population stock held by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and in partnership with zoos. This population is rising and is currently sitting at 245[source]. With over 50 breeding pairs, there should be enough genetic diversity for the wolf to survive long-term, but successful reintroduction to the wild remains elusive.\n15. Northern Hairy-Nosed Wombat\nScientific Name Lasiorhinus krefftii Conservation Status Critically Endangered Range Epping Forest National Park (Queensland, Australia) Estimated Population (2022) 250 Key Threats Cattle, Bushfires, Climate Change, Natural Disasters\n1. About\n2. Range\n3. Threats\n4. Conservation About The Northern Hairy-Nosed Wombat was thought to be extinct after the two known populations disappeared sometime in the late 19th Century. But in 1930, a single remaining population was found in Queensland Australia. That remaining population was estimated to be as few as 30 wombats in 1982 when an initial survey was undertaken. To protect the creatures, all cattle were removed from the area immediately[source]. Subsequently, each new survey revealed increased populations. In 2000, a survey found 113 northern hairy-nosed wombats, in 2010 there were 163 found, and in 2016, 250 were identified[source]. Northern Hairy-Nosed Wombat Range Threats The cause of the Wombat\u2019s decline was cattle grazing. Wombats are shy nocturnal creatures who do not wander far from their burrow. When food is scarce near their burrow, they will die. This is what occurs when cattle graze over their habitat. Despite the slowly growing population within the protected reserve, the Northern Hairy-Nosed Wombat is still considered critically endangered because it is only found in one very small area[source]. A natural disaster, epidemic, or even a sustained period of extreme drought may lead to extinction. It is believed that the population only increases during good wet years. In 2000, a pack of dingoes came across the wombats and killed nine of the wombats, which was a nearly 10% decrease in the remaining population at the time[source]. Conservation Efforts Conservation efforts are focused on protecting the wombats from predators and developing new sites for the wombats to flourish. To protect the wombat from future dingo attacks, a fence was constructed around the entire wombat habitat[source]. The greatest concern for the wombats, however, is that they are only found in one place, leaving them vulnerable to disasters. To mitigate this concern, scientists identified a new reserve for them in 2009. Fifteen wombats were relocated to the new reserve where breeding took place. However, due to several deaths, only ten remain in the second site[source].\n16. Jamaican Iguana\nScientific Name Cyclura collei Conservation Status Critically Endangered Range Hellshire Hills (Jamaica) Estimated Population (2022) 500 Key Threats Dogs, Cats, and Mongooses\n1. About\n2. Range\n3. Threats\n4. Conservation About The Jamaican Iguana was declared extinct in 1948, but in 1990, a pig hunter walked a live one into a local zoo. His dog had caught it and carried it in his mouth back to the hunter. Today, the population has been replenished up to above 500 Iguanas, with about 200 in the wild and the remainder in zoos[source]. The Iguana was once found throughout Jamaica as well as Little Goat Island and Great Goat Island. However, it is now only found in the small Hellshire Hills area on the south coast of Jamaica. They prefer dry, rocky forested areas. Interestingly, they\u2019re known to have very placid, friendly personas that draw similarities to dogs. Jamaican Iguana Range Threats When Jamaica was settled by Europeans, the Iguana was thought to have been endemic throughout the island. In the centuries after, the Jamaican Iguana\u2019s population was depleted due to attacks from dogs used during pig hunts in the hills, and attacks from cats and mongooses. Today, the northern and eastern Hellshire Hills are extensively logged for charcoal production and human settlements surround the forest, further restricting the Iguana\u2019s habitat range[source]. Conservation Efforts Conservation and population regeneration is driven by a captive headstarting program at Hope Zoo[source]. The captive Iguana Head Start Program occurs because young Jamaican Iguanas die at unsustainably high rates. So, the Zoo captures baby Iguanas, protects them for 4 to 6 years until they are at a healthy strength and weight, then releases them where they can live and breed in the wild. There are also several captive populations in zoos in the United States which act as a safety net population. This population protects genetic diversity in case natural disasters hit the Hellshire Hills[source].\n17. Giant Panda\nScientific Name Ailuropoda melanoleuca Conservation Status Vulnerable Range Qinling Mountains (Sichuan, China) Estimated Population (2022) 1,800 Key Threats Deforestation, Poaching, Climate Change\n1. About\n2. Range\n3. Threats\n4. Conservation About The Giant Panda\u2019s status was lowered to \u2018vulnerable\u2019 on the IUCN red list in 2016, but this list would not be complete with an update on the Panda\u2019s condition. The Giant Panda was on the brink of extinction for much of the 20th Century. The population dropped to a low of 1,216 in 1988[source]. Its demise prompted global interest in endangered species in the mid-20th Century. The World Wildlife Foundation even chose the Panda as the animal on its logo, which is a sign of how much the Panda galvanized the world behind animal conservation[source]. The population has recently risen to about 1,800 and the Chinese government also downgraded its status from Endangered to Vulnerable in July 2021[source]. The Giant Panda is found in the hills of the Qinling mountains in Sichuan province in China. Its habitat is bamboo forests which were rapidly deforested throughout the 20th Century. While the Panda population is increasing in some areas, it is also declining in Liangshan, Xiangling and Niuweihe, prompting concerns about local extinctions in those areas. Giant Panda Range Threats Throughout the 20th Century, the major threat to the Panda was deforestation of the bamboo forests in the Qinling mountains in central China. Poaching was also a major threat in the 20th Century. While direct poaching of Pandas is now very rare, they can still get caught in traps and snares set for other animals[source]. In the 21st Century, the Panda is faced with evolving threats. Climate change is now believed to be a possible cause of habitat loss over the medium term[source]. As temperatures rise, bamboo forests will retreat further into the mountains, leaving less habitat range for the Panda. Conservation Efforts After the 1988 survey that found a depleted population, the Chinese government rapidly banned Panda poaching and developed 66 protective reserves for the creature. In 2017, the government also announced a new 10,476-square-mile reserve to further bolster the Panda\u2019s prospects[source]. The protection of the Giant Panda is generally understood to have been good for many other species in the region. Classified as an \u2018umbrella species\u2019, the protection of its habitat often leads to healthier populations of many other species who thrive in the same areas. Nevertheless, studies[source] have found the prioritization of Giant Pandas has led to population declines for large carnivores in the region, including leopards, snow leopards, wolves and dholes. Within the 66 Panda reserves, leopards have disappeared from 81% of the reserve area and wolves have disappeared from 77% of the area[source].\nList of 82 Other Endangered Species\nConclusion\nA remarkably common theme across the list of vulnerable, endangered, and critically endangered species is the role of humans in the decline of important species in the global exosystem. It is clear from the research from expert conservation organiations \u2013 from IUCN to WWF \u2013 is that we live in the age of the anthroposcene. This is the era in which humans are the driving force behind changes in the earth\u2019s ecosystem.\nIt is therefore contingent upon humans as individuals \u2013 and our government representatives \u2013 to take urgent action to seek ways in which we can live more sustainably and in harmony with the animals on our planet. In particular, there are the dual urgent needs to expand wildlands that are untouched by human expansion and to reduce global carbon emissions.\nTo take further action, focus on ethical consumption (including buying palm oil free products), join local conservation groups, sponsor an animal, and participate in ethical tourism."}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Ecological Niche | Giant Panda Bear", "url": "https://thegiantpanda.wordpress.com/ecological-niche/", "text": "The Giant Panda, a warm blooded mammal originating from Southern and Eastern parts of China, along with most other animals, are heterotrophs. Heterotrophic organisms consume other organisms in order to acquire energy, rather than making their own energy. Unlike most bears, these pandas are neither nocturnal or diurnal, they are crepuscular, which means that they are both active during the day and night. The typical lifespan of a Giant Panda living in the wild is 20 years, though in captivity they are able to live up to 30-35 years.\nOnce a panda is born the mother cares for her young until they are able to venture out independently. Most mothers spend their time nurturing their cub, cradling it, and nestling it in the grass. These panda\u2019s eyes do not open for about 6-8 weeks, and they are not mobile for about 3 months. Panda cubs tend to crawl at 10 weeks, and by 21 weeks these cubs are able to confidently walk on their own. This special bear species nurses for about 18 months but at 6-9 months also begins to eat bamboo. When they are about 2 years old they usually leave their mothers. After leaving their mother, they will wander for about 2-3 years until they are sexually mature enough to mate. During mating season, which is typically Autumn and Spring, the panda loses its appetite completely and the male pandas fight viciously to find a mate. The females usually stay around the same territory as their mother, while the male goes off to find a good feeding/breeding area.\nAlthough Giant Pandas evolved from carnivores, and have the digestive system of a carnivore, they depend almost exclusively on bamboo in their diet, and are therefore, more like herbivores. On the food pyramid, Giant Pandas are found at the second trophic level, which are the primary consumers, for they only eat bamboo and no other organisms eat them. Giant Pandas feed on different parts of the bamboo plant during different parts of the year in order to get the most out of the bamboo stick. They are also known to consume about 30 different species of the bamboo plant. These animals are able to consume 30 kg of bamboo a day as well and use their strong jaws to crush the plant to make it easier to consume. The Giant Panda also has symbiotic relationships with the bacteria and microorganisms in its stomach. The bacteria helps break down nutrients and vitamins that shape their immune system and aid in digesting food, which is known as commensalism.\nThe giant panda has many adaptions that help with its survival, due to the bamboo shoots that they consume daily. One of the most visually obvious adaptions this bear has is its sixth thumb used to pull the leaves and the shoots off of the bamboo stem. Another adaption the panda has is its digestive system. Due to the rough texture of bamboo, the panda\u2019s esophagus and stomach contains a thick lining to protect it from getting cut by the bamboo, along with it\u2019s larger colon and smaller intestines used to help digest the bamboo easier. Lastly, the panda bear\u2019s large head is another important adaption that helps it eat bamboo. Their large jaw muscles and molar teeth allow them to break down the rough bamboo much easier, as well.\nDue to their large size and isolated habitat, adult pandas have no predators though cubs are helpless until they are at least a year old. The cubs, in most cases, are preyed upon by leopards and different large birds of prey. The biggest predator of Giant Pandas happen to be humans, as humans are an extreme threat due to habitat loss through deforestation and land clearance for agriculture and farming. The threat of humans has become so great, that currently only 20 isolated mountain patches are left in the wild for these pandas to live.\nGiant pandas typically spend around 12 to 15 hours a day munching on bamboo. Although it seems as if these animals only spend their days either sleeping or eating, they are known to be good at climbing trees and swimming. These pandas usually keep to themselves, for they mark their defined territory by spraying urine and clawing trees. They can find shelter in crevices of rocks or hollow trees, but they do not maintain a permanent den for living in. This is because they do not hibernate all year long, they move to different elevations where the weather is warmer.\nThis is a video of a Giant Panda using its teeth to eat bamboo shoots in China."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "History of the Giant Panda Bear - Gityasome", "url": "http://www.gityasome.com/PandaBearHistory.shtml", "text": "HISTORY OF THE GIANT PANDA BEAR Giant Pandas were first introduced to the West in 1869 when a panda pelt and skeleton were sent to Paris by the French botanist, zoologist and priest Father Armand David. He compared it to the Red Panda which looked like a cross between a raccoon and a fox and which was thought to be a relative of raccoons, skunks and weasels, but not bears. The earliest panda bears were no bigger than housecats and grew to their giant sizes over many millions of years. It's hypothesized that they grew to their giant sizes to adapt to poor nutritional diets such as bamboo, the mainstay of today's Giant Pandas. In order to compensate for their carnivore digestive system eating a plant diet, pandas must eat incredible quantities of food. They eat up to 83 lbs. of bamboo a day to glean the nutrition they need. Long before the Western cultures embraced the lovable black and white panda, they were revered in Chinese art dating back thousands of years. Giant Pandas achieved world reknown in 1936 when Ruth Harkness captured a nine week old panda cub and brought it to the USA. Her husband Bill had previously traveled to China to search for a living panda but failed to find one before he died. Ruth took up the search with the help of Chinese-American explorer Quentin Young and their search produced the panda cub they named Su-Lin. World love for the unusual black and white panda was borne. Originally believed to be a member of the raccoon family or even the cat family it wasn't until decades later in the 1970's that DNA showed the Giant Panda to be a member of the bear family. It was estimated that only 1100 pandas existed in the wild and all around the world conservationists worked to prevent the extinction of these strange, beautiful creatures. Later surveys estimated about 1600 pandas in the wild, the increase due to better methods of estimation rather than an increase in population. In the 1980's they were officially declared an endangered species. According to satellite images taken in 1989, the habitat for Giant Pandas in one Chinese province had shrunk to 50% of it's size just 15 years earlier. In addition, every 20-40 years the bamboo flowers and then dies off. This is normal for the species of bamboo but devastating for the pandas who rely on bamboo as their primary food source. Normally the pandas migrate to a new area when the bamboo dies off but with the dwindling patches of forest where the bamboo grows, the pandas find it harder to migrate and will sometimes starve to death. The giant panda of today eats almost exclusively bamboo, preferring umbrella bamboo and arrow bamboo, with an occasional dessert of eggs, yams, plant bulbs, insects, fish, honey or the occasional small rodent. Their digestive system is still that of a carnivore so their bodies have not fully adapted to their current diet. Pandas in captivity have a broader diet with more fruits and veggies, rice gruel, sugar cane and fiber biscuits. Most panda bears live high in the dense rainforests of China at 5,000-11,000 feet where the rains fall year round and the air stays laden with water. Unlike many other bears, pandas do not hibernate, though they will seek shelter in hollow trees or caves. In the winter they migrate to lower elevations. They can climb and swim. The Giant Panda is regarded a symbol of peace in China though they've been hunted to near extinction for their unusually colored pelts. Between the deforesting of the rainforests and the hunting of the pandas, populations have decreased to near extinction numbers. Poaching was so devastating on the panda population that the government put a death sentence on poachers and panda hunters. Even the death penalty did not stop the killing of pandas. Their value was so high that the sale of a single panda pelt would equal the lifetime earnings of the average peasant. The panda skin is believed to have supernatural powers against ghosts and to bring prophetic dreams to the person who sleeps upon it, making the pelt highly valuable and hence, highly poached. In the late 1990's the death sentence was changed to 20 years in prison. The Chinese people became aware of the rarity and embraced the panda as a national treasure. Fewer poached the panda and more tried to help the panda, bringing sick and injured panda bears to reserves where they could be cared for and nursed back to health. In China the panda is called Da Xiong Mao, meaning giant bear cat. The pupils of their eyes instead of being round like other bears are vertical slits like the eyes of a cat. It has also been called the Spotted Bear, Bamboo Bear and Cat Bear. Another unique trait of panda bears is their voice. They often make a bleating sound similar to a lamb or kid goat. They also growl, honk, huff, croak and squeak but they do not roar. A full size male panda weighs about 250 lbs. and stands 6 feet tall when standing. Panda's in the wild live about 20-25 years. In captivity they can live as long as 30. Pandas are solitary creatures coming together only to mate. Females usually give birth to two panda bear cubs but generally only one survives. A newborn panda weighs about 8 ounces and is about the size of a stick of butter. Cubs stay with their mums for up to 3 years though some leave the den in half that time. 1999 studies showed that only 12 pandas have been born in captivity in 60+ years and only 12% of captive-born pandas survived to a year old. Many attempts have been made to breed pandas in captivity and return them to the wild to replenish their populations. The first attempt was made in 2006 when captive bred Xiang Xiang was released. He was found dead less than a year later. It is believed he died from a fall from a tree while being chased by wild pandas. While repopulation efforts have not been successful, the Chinese government has created over 50 panda reserves covering 4000 square miles which protect about 45% of the existing panda habitat and bamboo logging laws have been enacted. In addition, several organizations worldwide have undertaken efforts to protect the Giant Pandas. They are officially declared an endangered species. If pandas are your passion, we offer pandas on tshirts, sweatshirts, coffee mugs, posters, mousepads and other goodies. Pandas are currently available in the following categories: Badminton, cricket, hockey, lacrosse, ping pong, racquetball and tennis."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Mekong Giant Catfish images!\nThe Mekong giant catfish is the largest purely freshwater fish in the world\nThe Mekong giant catfish is widely regarded as the largest purely freshwater fish in the world (excluding the species that migrate between saltwater and freshwater like the sturgeon). With their huge mouths and low-set eyes, these large shark catfish trawl the waters of the mighty Mekong, feeding on huge quantities of plant matter every day.\nUnfortunately, due to years of exploitation and neglect, this species is now a sad reminder of the need for more sustainable fishing practices and development. There is still a lot we don\u2019t understand about this species, and it may become extinct before we can learn more.\n3 Incredible Mekong Giant Catfish Facts!\nAncient images of the Mekong giant catfish line the walls of Buddhist temples in Thailand. Special rituals and offerings were made before people fished it.\nThe Mekong giant catfish does not have scales of any kind. Its skin is completely bare.\nBased on genetic analysis, scientists now believe that the shark catfish family (of which the Mekong giant catfish is a member) probably first evolved some 40 million years ago. They appear to be closely related to other Asian catfish. It is not exactly known when the Mekong giant catfish first evolved though.\nClassification and Scientific Name\nThe scientific name of the Mekong giant catfish is Pangasianodon gigas. It\u2019s not entirely clear where the genus name Pangasianodon comes from. It may be a combination of Pangasius, a local word for the shark catfish, and a Greek term meaning without tooth (referring to its toothless mouth). The species name gigas simply means giant in Greek. The only other living member of the genus is the iridescent shark catfish. Both species belong to the family of Pangasiidae, or the shark catfish, which are endemic to southern Asia.\nMekong Giant Catfish Appearance\nThe Mekong giant catfish is thought to be the largest freshwater fish in the world. One specimen was documented to be about 10 feet long and some 646 pounds in weight, but it\u2019s been suggested that they can grow even larger than this. Featuring a round, blunt head and a long body, the Mekong giant catfish has a dull gray or white appearance, usually darker on the upper half. Another distinguishing feature is the low-set eyes, which actually appear below the mouth line.\nUnlike other types of catfish, the adults of this species do not have whiskers (also called barbells) or teeth of any kind, perhaps on account of their herbivorous diet. The juveniles are born with whiskers (which help them find food in the underwater environment), but they slowly diminish with age.\nMekong Giant Catfish Swimming tristan tan/Shutterstock.com\nDistribution, Population, and Habitat\nThe Mekong giant catfish is endemic to the lower Mekong River of Southeastern Asia. It was once more widespread throughout the entire river system, perhaps reaching as far as China, but population numbers have fallen by around 90% since the 20th century.\nIt\u2019s thought that only a few hundred individuals may be remaining; this is based on the number of fish caught rather than a true population estimate. The culprits for its decline appear to be infrastructure development, overfishing, pollution, and mineral runoff, and dam construction, which diverts its natural spawning route. Habitats are also fragmenting, which makes it more difficult for the fish to congregate together in the spawning season.\nThe Mekong giant catfish is currently classified as a critically endangered species by the IUCN Red List. Conservationists have tried to breed this fish in artificial ponds as a last-ditch effort to save the entire species, but so far all efforts to introduce them back into the wild have met with failure.\nPredators and Prey\nThe Mekong giant catfish occupies an unusual place in the freshwater food chain. Despite being large and intimidating, this species shows no predatory behavior at all. They are kind of like any large herbivorous animal, not to be messed with by potential predators.\nWhat eats the Mekong giant catfish?\nOn account of its size, the Mekong giant catfish has very few natural predators in the wild besides humans.\nWhat does the Mekong giant catfish eat?\nAdult giant catfish largely feed on plants and algae. The juvenile feeds on tiny animals floating in the water.\nReproduction and Lifespan\nThe Mekong giant catfish is a migratory species. At the beginning of the rainy season, they will travel upstream to reach the spawning locations from their childhood. Scientists believe that the species once had a much larger migratory range, depending on their location. Today the few remaining specimens move between the Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia and the part of the Mekong River in Thailand.\nUpon hatching, the young fish feed on small zooplankton (tiny water-based animals), and if food is scarce, they will sometimes even cannibalize each other. After a year, they will switch to their adult herbivorous diet and start eating plants.\nThese are among the fastest-growing fish in the world, reaching more than 400 pounds in six years. It\u2019s estimated they have a total lifespan of about 60 years in the wild. There is presumably a lot of attrition in the first few days and weeks after hatching, so only a small number of fish ever reach full adulthood.\nFishing and Cooking\nThis creature has been harvested by local fishers in the region for many thousands of years. At the height of the overfishing craze, millions of tons could be caught every year. On account of the falling numbers, it is now illegal to catch this fish in Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. Enforcement can be spotty, however, and the rules don\u2019t necessarily stop poachers from killing them and selling them to Vietnamese restaurants.\nView all 111 animals that start with M"}

But he wasn\u2019t always so giant. The one-year-old cub, which lives at the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington, D.C., was about the size of a stick of butter when he was born. Cared for by zookeepers and his mom, Mei Xiang (may-SHONG), Bei Bei has spent the last several months going through a major growth spurt.\nAt birth Bei Bei was blind, furless, and weighed less than a third of a pound. Within 48 hours, white fur began to grow on parts of his wrinkly skin. Two weeks later, dark fur started cover the rest of his body.\nUp until then, Bei Bei\u2019s mom had been cuddling with the infant almost nonstop to keep him toasty. But Bei Bei\u2019s new coat kept him warm enough to allow Mei Xhang to slip out of her den for food breaks. Mei Xhang was never gone for long though.

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "How Do Giant Pandas Communicate? (The 5 Commons Sounds)", "url": "https://bestofpanda.com/how-do-pandas-communicate/", "text": "If you\u2019re watching the cartoon We Bare Bears, Panda loves to talk to his brothers (Grizz and Ice Bear) all the time. He likes to play, have fun or even go out with them.\nThis made me wonder, how do pandas communicate in real life?\nHere\u2019s a short answer, Pandas usually communicate by scent marking and vocalization. They can only do these because they can\u2019t make any facial expressions.\nThe pandas use a variety of sounds to communicate with each other, they may honk, huff, bark, and growl.\nNow that you know that pandas use scent and sound to communicate, your next question maybe what kind of sounds do pandas produce?\nLet us discuss the ways pandas use to communicate in detail.\nWhat Kinds of Sounds or Call Do Pandas Make?\nPandas use more than 11 different sounds to communicate. Here are the most common ones.\nBleating\nThis is considered a friendly vocalization, and they use it a lot in the breeding season. Sometimes they are single, short bleats, and sometimes they are drawn out, just like the sound sheep makes.\nPandas also bleat to attract babies\u2019 attention and other times to tell zookeepers that they are hungry.\nHonking\nThis is a rhythmic, sort of hiccup sound that pandas produce during stressful conditions.\nBarking\nThey also produce a dog-like barking noise mixed with a howling roar during the non-breeding season, telling other bears to back off.\nMoans and Whines\nThese are deep, high-pitched sounds they make as breeding season approaches. They moan, walking around their pen as other pandas pass by.\nIt isn\u2019t a friendly vocalization and neither an overly aggressive one, as they moan nonchalantly. They also moan when they are dozing off for a nap.\nChirp\nThese are short and high-pitched calls like a bird. Pandas often chirp, directing other pandas when they are interested in them. A chirp response is a positive sign of potential mating.\nThese were the most common sounds pandas produce.\nWhy Do Pandas Communicate?\nPandas communicate when they feel threatened, or when it\u2019s the mating season. They also bark to warn others of their kind to stay out of their way.\nFemale pandas communicate with their children, to show love and to guide them.\nPandas are usually quiet and solitary animals. They like to stay out of each other\u2019s way and avoid direct contact with each other.\nThey live in the wild with very dense vegetation, and each panda roams an area of 6 to 10 square kilometers, which is very large.\nThere are fewer chances that they meet another panda on their way. The pandas leave their odor marks, as well as claw marks, on trees and rocks that happen to be on their way.\nSo that any other panda that passes by detects the odor.\nPandas\u2019 scent marks embody a lot of information. It shows their gender, height, reproductive status, etc. Male pandas often mark odor as high as possible to tell others they are relatively tall.\nThey do all this so that other pandas detect them and if they are in the mating season, then mate.\nGiant pandas usually vocalize when playing. They become very vocal in mating season and express all their shades of mood from amorous to angry via detailed vocalizations.\nWhere Do Pandas Communicate?\nPandas live in high mountainous regions where they communicate during the mating season. Their habitat contains natural forested areas of fir, spruce, and bamboo. They scent mark the trees to let other bears know they are ready for mating.\nAccording to a study on Scent communication behavior by giant pandas, pandas mostly scent mark Faxon fir trees, which accounted for 60% of the marked trees, followed by Chinese Hemlock accounting for 14.3% of the total number of marked trees.\nThe commonly selected trees were located on ridges accounting for 19.7%, whereas non-ridge was 11.4%.\nPandas usually live in well-defined territories, male territories ranging from 1.5 to 2.5 square miles, often overlapping female dominions of about 1.8 square miles in area.\nHow Do Giant Pandas Communicate?\nPandas can only communicate via vocalization and scent marking. They can also use their body gestures to express anger or obedience.\nThey do not have crests or manes to stand upright, and they have stubby ears. Due to these limitations, they cannot make any facial expressions.\nAn interesting fact! Pandas produce specific sounds to express their feelings. Although complicated, it is still interesting to learn about how pandas communicate.\nScent Marking\nThe giant panda secretes a dark, thick, and sticky substance from her circumanal glands and then rubs it onto tree trunks and rocks.\nIt would demand a lot of hard work if someone wants to remove this sticky secretion. She does this to advertise that she is in heat and also, to mark her territory.\nThe scent mark tells other pandas about the gender, age, mood, and reproductive status of pandas. A panda scent marks in different positions, including a headstand or squat.\nVocal Communication\nBesides scent marking, giant pandas also communicate vocally. They bark to frighten other pandas. A mating pair makes a goat-like bleating sound in the reproductive period.\nThey use up to 11 different sounds to communicate. It includes:\nBleating\nHonking\nHuffing\nBarking\nGrowling Sounds.\nBody Language\nPandas also use body language to communicate. Aggressive pandas often bounce their head, showcasing their eyes and ears, whereas submissive pandas hide their eyes by their paws or turn their heads sideways.\nHow Does a Red Panda Communicate?\nRed pandas are quiet animals, but the main communication channels are acoustics, visual, chemical, and tactile. The red pandas have unique eye tracts and forehead patterns, which help in recognizing them.\nThey mark their territories with urine and feces.\nThey rub their anogenital gland secretions on rocks and raised sticks, which function as scent marking. Besides, they also use vocal communications.\nRoberts discovered seven different vocals in 1981. They whistle, snort, squeal, bleat, exhale, and quack-snort.\nREAD OUR FULL GUIDE: What Do Red Pandas Sound Like?\nHow Do Pandas Communicate with Humans?\nWith humans, pandas communicate via vocalization and gestures. They jump forward and fight to show aggression. While non-aggressive behavior includes turning heads and covering the face and muzzle with paws.\nThey sometimes respond, in their own language, when the keeper talks to them. They also cuddle with their keepers, with whom they develop close interactions.\nMost of the information we have discovered about the pandas is because of human interaction with them. But they may develop significant, although temporary and highly conditional, relationships with humans.\nHow Do Pandas Communicate with Other Species?\nGiant pandas don\u2019t usually interact with other animals. It\u2019s only when they feel threatened that they stare at other animals or signal threat via vocalization. Golden monkeys, takin, red pandas, Asiatic black bears, and pheasants live in their vicinity.\nIn a zoo, where they are in captivity, they like to play and fight each other.\nFAQ\nCan Pandas Talk?\nNo, pandas can\u2019t talk like humans. But they do communicate in their own unique ways. They also respond when someone talks to them.\nOnly other pandas and animals of their kind are successful in interpreting their language. If technology advances, humans may be able to communicate with pandas too.\nWhy Do Pandas Make a Honking Sound?\nPandas make a puffing sound of distress that is also referred to as honking. They use the honking sound if they get surprised, angry, or annoyed. Some pandas honk when they are asleep\nDo Pandas Interact with Humans?\nNo, pandas do not interact with humans. They live in the wild and are not very friendly. They like to live alone. Pandas can be very dangerous.\nOn the contrary, pandas living in the zoo are found to interact to a great extent with their keepers and caretakers.\nThey hide their face with their paws when they meet someone new. They even respond when their keepers talk to them.\nConclusion\nCute giant pandas are so compelling but have their quirky communication ways. To conclude, they use vocalization, different gestures, and scent marking to communicate with their own kinds.\nThey develop close relations with humans, but that is only with the zookeepers and caretakers.\nYou cannot expect a giant panda to make best friends with you on your first meeting. Since they are solitary animals, they do not interact with other species.\nIt is only when they feel threatened that they do so.\nIf you want to know more facts about giant pandas, you should check out our 29 Most Adorable Giant Panda Fun Facts."}

Read the legends on how the panda got his black marks, discover its etymology and symbolism and the use in traditional Chinese culture. Discover the History and Mythology of the xi\u00f3ng m\u0101o, Mo, Pixiu or Giant Panda.\nGiant Pandas are regarded as \u201csacred creatures of the forest\u201d and \u201cLiving Fossils\u201d and are the only mammal to have survived the Pleistocene, three million years ago, going back to the time of the saber-toothed tiger.\nChinese people adored this gentle giant, regarding them as a symbol of peace. As such, they are offered as valuable gifts to royalty or politicians and a gesture of goodwill to foreign countries, till today. Considered symbols of strength and bravery, the early Chinese emperors kept them to ward off evil spirits and natural disasters and warriors were often compared to giant pandas.\nCultural History and Mythology of the Pixiu, Xi\u00f3ng m\u0101o, Mo,\nPixiu, or Giant Panda\nLEGEND: The Pandas and the Shepherdess or\nHow the Panda got his marks\nO nce upon a time a beautiful shepherdess called Dolma, lived in Wolong Valley, beloved by everyone for her kind heart. The shepherdess always took her sheep into the hills surrounding the valley and every day a young panda bear cub, back then known as beishung would join her flock. In those days pandas were all white so possibly the panda thought the sheep were other pandas.\nHowever, one day the panda cub was gamboling with the sheep and lambs but suddenly a leopard attacked the panda. The shepherdess grabbed a big stick, and in turn attacked the leopard. The panda was able to escape from the jaws of the leopard but the leopard killed the beautiful young girl.\nThe other pandas heard of this terrible event and mourned the beautiful shepherdess who had saved the panda cub. They all came to her funeral and to show their respect they covered their arms with ashes, as was the custom at that time.\nThe funeral was a very sad affair and the pandas were overcome with grief and sadness.\nThey sobbed and wailed, sobbed and cried out in their painful sorrow, wiping their eyes with their paws. They cried so hard and their sadness was so loud that they covered their ears with their paws to block out the noise. Wherever they touched their white fur, the ashes stained their fur black.\nThat is why to this very day, all pandas bear the dark marks of the ashes on their fur in memory of the kind and loving shepherdess. The shepherdess\u2019s three sisters also overcome with grief and sorrow, threw themselves into her grave. The earth rumbled and shook and a huge mountain sprang up from the grave. That mountains, still stands there today and is known as the Four Sisters\u2019 Mountain (Siguniang). Each sister was transformed into one of its peaks, guarding and protecting the panda bears to this day.\nA Tibetan Variant of the legend:\nHow did Giant Pandas come to have such unique color markings?\nL ong, long ago, the Giant Pandas lived in the high mountains of Tibet. Their fur was completely snow white. They were friends with young shepherdesses, who watched their flock in the mountains around their village. One day a mother and her cub were playing with the shepherdesses and their flock when a strong and hungry leopard attacked the cub. The shepherdesses tried to save the cub but were unsuccessful and the leopard killed them.\nAll the Giant Pandas in the area were very sad and held a memorial service for the shepherdesses and to remember their sacrifice for the cub. The local custom in the mountains was to cover your arms with ashes to honor the deceased. The Giant Pandas wept. They wiped their eyes with their paws, covered their ears to block the sounds of crying and hugged each other for comfort. The ashes blackened their fur. The Giant Pandas did not wash the black off their fur as a constant reminder of the girls.\nSichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries\nAbout 20000 \u2013 30000 years ago, pandas were distributed across 16 provinces of China, including near Beijing. Today, wild giant pandas live only in three provinces, Sichuan, Shanxi and Guansu with eighty percent of the animals living on the Chengdu Plain in Sichuan.\nChina made giant pandas a protected species in 1962, the first captive-bred panda cub was born in 1963, and poaching was criminalized in 1987, setting strict new penalties of at least ten years in jail or even death. In 2005, the Chinese government created over 50 panda reserves in a conservation effort to preserve their national emblem.\nThe UNESCO world heritage site, Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries, are home to other globally endangered animals such as the red panda, the snow leopard and clouded leopard. They are among the botanically richest sites of any region in the world outside the tropical rain forests, with between 5000 and 6000 species of flora in over 1000 genera.\nThe Chengdu\u2019s Research Base we visited, houses more than 100 giant pandas in an immaculately landscaped park. Though the pandas mostly stay inside during the hottest summer months, the rest of the year they live outdoors in spacious playpens. During our visit we witness how they spent the day: chewing on bamboo shoots, climbing trees, sleeping and excreting waste. The museum at Chengdu has recorded the panda daily intake of about forty kilograms of bamboo shoots and an enterprising researcher had meticulously noted that this involved 150 droppings/day!\nI thought pandas are slow, calm animals, but at feeding time they got very active, especially the cubs frolicked \u2013 rolling around and chasing each other up trees, with one even doing a backward flip on a log platform. Most of the older pandas were snoozing, on the ground or perched in trees, the babies, tiny, blind, and pink, with few hairs, are on display in breeders.\nPANDA: Etymology and Symbolism\nThe giant panda, because of its much wider range of distribution, had more than a dozen regional names, such as Pixiu, Mo, Zouyu, Whitebear, Flowery-bear, Linyun \u2013 cloud in the forest and Iron-eating Animal.\nThey are also called Chinabear, Bamboobear, Silverdog and Giant raccoon.\nThe name giant raccoon came into being because the giant panda has a close blood relationship with a raccoon (even now, some scholars tend to classify it into the raccoon class), but the panda is bigger than the raccoon.\ncame into being because the giant panda has a close blood relationship with a raccoon (even now, some scholars tend to classify it into the raccoon class), but the panda is bigger than the raccoon. The name silver dog appeared because the Red Pandas are locally called golden dog, so giant pandas with white hairs are called silver dogs.\nappeared because the Red Pandas are locally called golden dog, so giant pandas with white hairs are called silver dogs. Bamboo-bear, we can easily guess, is because the giant panda eats bamboos; and\nwe can easily guess, is because the giant panda eats bamboos; and Chinabear was given to it because it is a rare animal peculiar to China.\nPIXIU\nIt is written in the Annals, Biographies of Five Emperors, that 4000 years ago, Emperor Huang used to have pandas (pixiu \u2013 ancient name for the Giant Panda) for the purpose of fighting.\nThe famous Chinese historian Sima Qian of the Han Dynasty notes in Records of the Five Emperors, as early as 4000 years ago, a head of a tribe, called Huangdi, used tamed wild animals to defeat another tribe headed by Yandi at Banquan (now Zhulu County of Henan Province). Among these animals, there were tigers, leopards, bears and \u8c94\u8c85 Pixiu.\nShang Shu (A High Official in Ancient China) and the Book of Poetry compiled in the early years of West Zhou Dynasty also recorded that the skin of the Pixiu was a tallage of rarity for the emperor. Giant Pandas were considered an animal that was brave and mighty as tigers and leopards; for that reason, ancient warriors were compared to Giant Pandas, whose name Pixiu was used to symbolize victory in all wars.\nIn the Book of Mountains and Seas, a classic of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States Period (2700 years ago), the Giant Panda is described as:\nwith white and black fur, it looks like bear; and found in Yandao County of Qionglai Mountain\n(the present Rongjing County, Sichuan Province).\nWhen the great poet of Tang Dynasty Bai Juyi was resting in a quiet residence, he felt cold and had a headache because of the chilly wind. Someone then gave him a screen on which a giant panda was painted. The bamboo screen brought about a magic effect to drive out his illness. Loving it very much, Bai Juyi wrote a poem, Ode to a Pixiu on the Screen. By saying that giant pandas need a peaceful environment for survival, the poet expresses his concern about the misfortunes and famines brought to the common people by wars. Bai Juyi considered that pandas had mystical powers capable of making natural disaster go away or evil spirits disappear.\nMO\nEssayist Sima Xiangru of the Han Dynasty (2000 years ago) recorded in On Shanglin Garden, the Emperor Hanwu once had many fowls and animals in Shanglin Garden for the emperor\u2019s hunting, and Mo (Giant Panda) was among the most important animals.\nAncient texts in China tell of a strange beast with remarkable toughness, whose name \u2013 \u734f \u2013 has been variously transliterated as \u201cmo,\u201d \u201cm\u00e9,\u201d or \u201cmih\u201d. This creature had teeth strong enough to bite through iron, copper, and the joints of bamboo, and could chew the nails off a city gate, its stomach acids could easily dissolve these tough items.\nHench the name Iron-eating Animal. Mo were said to have lived in the areas of Sichuan and Guizhou (especially on Mount Emei in Guizhou), and sometimes ate tripods and cooking utensils if these were mistakenly left out by travelers. The Mo was also believed to consume snakes and other reptiles. Its bones were said to be nearly solid, with very little space for marrow; and their teeth were strong enough that axes and knives could be broken trying to cut them; the teeth could not be destroyed by fire.\nIt is also said, that people feared pandas and described them as metal-devouring black-and-white \u201ctapirs.\u201d The Malayan tapir is likely the animal that the elephant-nosed panda was based on, because tapirs have a pig-like snout which could easily be imagined as a longer trunk; and the Malayan tapir in particular has the dark-light-dark coloration pattern described for the panda.\nLater texts describe the Panda as having a nose like an elephant, eyes like a rhinoceros, a tail like an ox, and paws like a tiger.\nZHOUYU\nIn the West Jin Dynasty (1700 years ago), Giant Panda was called \u5468\u745c Zhouyu. For it eats bamboo only, and does not hurt other animals, so it was seen as an \u201canimal of justice\u2019, that is, an animal of peace and friendliness.\nWhen warring armies took to the battlefield, if one army raised a flag with an image of the Zhouyu, the battle would immediately be called to a halt and a temporary peace would ensue.\nWHITEBEAR\nAccording to the Imperial Yearbook of Japan, on October 22, 658 A.D., the Empress Wuzetian sent a couple of Whitebears (Giant Pandas) and 70 pieces of panda fur to Emperor Tianwu of Japan.\nTo this day, the panda continues to be a symbol of peace, and China has gifted pandas to many nations, such as Soviet Union, Japan, North Korea, United States, Britain, France, Germany, Spain and Mexico, as a gesture of peaceful relations.\nIn Compendium of Materia Medica, the famous pharmacist Li Shizhen of Ming Dynasty recorded:\nbedding made of panda fur can prevent coldness and wetness, as well as pestilence and vice; oil of panda can penetrate the skin to cure tubers; and its urine, drunk together with water, can dissolve metal things eaten by mistake.\nRead more\nXIONG MAO\nThe Name \u5927\u718a\u732b Da Xiong Mao (Giant Bear-Cat) (now generally used in China) came from the original name Mao Xiong (Cat-Bear) or Da Maoxiong (Giant Cat-Bear), which referred to the round face like the cat and the fat figure like a bear.\nMost bears\u2019 eyes have round pupils. The exception is the giant panda, whose pupils are vertical slits, like cats\u2019 eyes. It is these unusual eyes that maybe inspired the Chinese to call the panda the \u201cgiant bear cat\u201d.\nLater on, the Chinese writing system underwent a reform, and people visiting the Beipei Museum read the sign in a wrong way. So, \u718a\u732b Xiong Mao became the Chinese name of Giant panda. Now, the Chinese official name of the Giant Panda became Xiongmao.\nOTHER NAMES FOR THE PANDA\nThe local name of the giant panda around Chengdu, however, is still white old bear or flowery bear.\nIn the Mingshan Mountain areas of the Tibetan people, it is called Dang or DuDongGa, or DongGa called by the BaiMaBuDa people of Pingwu County, or Equ called by the Li people of Liangshan Mountain. All of these local names, retain the meaning of a white or white-and-black bear-like animal.\nOne of the few candidates for the root of the word panda is \u201cp\u00f3nya\u201d or \u201cnigalya-ponya\u201d which means \u201cbamboo eater\u201c. Possibly derived from a Nepali word referring to the ball of the foot-perhaps a keen observation of how this bear eats bamboo with an adapted wrist bone that functions as an opposable thumb and sixth digit. Other writers believe that \u201cpanda\u201d came from wah , the Nepali name for the red panda (Ailurus fulgens), and originating from the childlike sound that this species sometimes makes.\nAiluropoda melanoleuca \u2013 How the Panda got his scientific name\nThe modern name giant panda can be attributed to the French missionary Armand Pere David (1826-19000), who lived in China for 12 years from 1862 to 1874. Preaching in Beijing and Shanghai, David was also a correspondent researcher of the National Museum of France. A natural historian, David has found 68 new species of birds, over one hundred species of insects, and many mammal species-including the Milu deer, golden monkey and the giant pandas- in various places of China. In March 1869, David came to the catholic church in Dengchigou of Muping (now Banshan County) of Sichuan and became the fourth preaching priest there. The Dengchigou Catholic Church was one of the earliest churches secretly built by the Cathedral Church of France in Sichuan.\nIn his journal, David writes:\n\u201cOn March 11, 1869, when I was on my way back to the Church, I was invited to have a rest in a Mr. Li\u2019s home. In his home, I saw the panda\u2019s skin. It\u2019s big and beautiful colored black and white. The skin was quite peculiar. Li told me that I would see this animal very soon, for his hunters were going to hunt this animal\u2013\nit seemed that a new species in the science domain will be found\u201d\n1869, David states:\n\u201cAfter leaving for 10 days, the hunters were back today. They brought a young whitebear to me. It was caught alive, but was killed only to bring it back more easily.\u201d\nDavid pitied the death of the young panda cub, and he wrote on:\n\u201cthey sold the young whitebear to me at a very high price. The body of the whitebear was all white except that the legs, the ears and the places around its two eyes are black. It has the same skin color as a grown-up bear that I have seen before. I believe it to be a new species, not only because of its skin color, but also because of the hair beneath its feet and other characteristics.\u201d\nDavid sent this specimen of whitebear to Melne Edwards, the director of the Natural Museum of Paris, who studied the skin and skeleton of the animal and published a paper in 1870, announcing\n\u201cin terms of external features, it is really very close to bears; but its skeleton and teeth are apparently different from bears\u2014actually very close to raccoons. It must be a new species, and I name it Ailuropoda.\u201d\nPaying tribute to David\u2019s contribution, Edwards named the scientific name of the Giant panda as Ailuropoda melanoleuca David, which has been used until now. The first giant panda specimen collected by David is still kept in the Natural Museum of Paris.\nPanda are a well-known symbol of Chinese culture and have various symbolic meanings worldwide:\nThe Han Dynasty\nJade objects, pottery, lacquer- work, bronze equipment, sculptures, and bronze mirrors of the Han Dynasty of 206 B.C. to 22 A.D., are often decorated with bears. That\u2019s because people of that period worshiped the bear and honored him by putting his image on many objects.\nThe Bear Emperor\nThe bear wasn\u2019t always the preferred totem of China. Emperors prior to the Han Dynasty used other animals symbolically. In the Shang Dynasty, the totem was a bird; the Shu emperor used the silkworm as his personal totem. The dragon was also imbued with significance. But it wasn\u2019t until the Yellow Emperor built his capital at Xinzheng, a place with some bears, that he became known as the Bear Emperor.\nFeng Shui\nF\u00eang-shui, \u201cthe art of adapting the residence of the living and the dead so as to co-operate and harmonize with the local currents of the cosmic breath\u201d, a doctrine which had its root in ancestor-worship, has exercised an enormous influence on Chinese thought and life from the earliest times, and especially from those of Chu Hsi and other philosophers of the Sung dynasty. It is the Chinese art of harmonizing humans with their environments. According to this philosophy, a bear represents masculine energies, and placing a figure of a bear in the home \u2013 particularly the main entrance- helps to protect the house and its inhabitants.\nAlso, placing a bear\u2019s image in the part of the home where children might reside helps parents to give birth to strong, healthy baby boys.\nYin and the Yang\nThe Chinese ascribe much importance to the Yin and the Yang, two opposing forces of the universe that are present in all aspects of nature. A common representation of the Yin and the Yang is a circle, half black and half white, depicting the dichotomy of the two colors but the interconnected nature of the two forces. The Giant Panda is thought to be a physical manifestation of the Yin and the Yang, as its body is both black and white, the two colors standing in stark contrast to one another on the animals pelt. The placid nature of the panda is a demonstration of how the Yin and the Yang, when perfectly balanced, contribute to harmony and peace.\nPandemonium\nThe word pandemonium was coined in 1936 to describe the reception a panda received when it was first shown in the West. The first panda to be seen in Europe and America was a cub named Su-Lin \u201csomething very cute\u201c, brought from Sichuan province by a rich socialite named Ruth Harkness. With extensive media coverage the cub was first displayed at the Chicago zoo, drawing a crowd of 54000, a number that has yet to be repeated. While cameras clicked away, Harkness, dressed in a fur with a cigarette dangling from her lips, fed the panda with a baby bottle. He eventually became a hot attraction in Chicago\u2019s Brookfield Zoo, where it died a year later.\nWWF\nIt was in London, however, that a stateless bear\u2019s sudden popularity made the panda the poster child for all things endangered. In 1957, Chi-chi, originally slated for sale to a U.S. zoo, found herself homeless when the United States, which had no formal relations with China, refused the panda entrance. But the London Zoo made a successful bid for Chi-chi in 1958, and she quickly became the zoo\u2019s star attraction. As it happened, London was also the home of the newly formed World Wildlife Fund (WWF), which still lacked a logo. Deciding that there was no better candidate than the lovable Chi-chi, the WWF chose the panda as its official logo in 1961, and the black-and-white bamboo-munching creature has been an international symbol of wildlife conservation ever since.\nPandas are the face of animal rights but in the popular imagination, they are not really bears at all \u2014 they are cartoon characters, a creation of movies like Kungfu Panda, the fuzzy panda hats sold at tourist attractions around China, and even Fuwa the Panda, one of the five mascots of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\nWhile the dragon has historically served as China\u2019s national emblem, the giant panda has served as an emblem for the country too in recent decades. Its image appears on a large number of modern Chinese commemorative gold, silver and platinum coins.\nThe giant panda made it even on red and gold cigarette packets, the brand is called GOLDEN PANDA.\nPanda- USE:\nDuring the Ming Dynasty, the panda was described as having great medicinal value. The famous pharmacist, Li Shizhen, wrote in the Compendium of Materia Medica (Bencao Gangmu), a record of traditional Chinese medicine,\n*that panda fur makes excellent dry bedding preventing coldness and wetness, as well as pestilence and vice.\n*Panda oil can penetrate the skin to cure tubers and panda urine and water, when drunk can dissolve metal things eaten or swallowed accidentally.\n*urine was prescribed when a person had swallowed iron or copper, for it would quickly dissolve the metals in the victim\u2019s stomach into harmless fluid\nIn addition to using its urine to dissolve metal, rubbing the mo\u2019s feces on a knife would make it sharp enough to cut through gemstones.\n*It is also said that the creature\u2019s fat was good for treating swellings, but very hard to keep because it could seep through containers made of copper, iron, or pottery; so it could only be stored in a stone container.\n*Sleeping on a mattress made from the pelt of a mo warded off diseases caused by bad air and dampness; in fact, illustrations of the mo were said to have the same effect\u2026 for this reason, an illustration of a mo was often put on window shutters during the Tang dynasty [618 CE \u2013 906 CE].\nIn his 1993 book The Last Panda, U.S. biologist and naturalist George B. Schaller explained how Chinese used to hunt pandas for their pelts because it was believed that sleeping on panda fur could ward off ghosts and help regulate a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle.\n*Traditionally, eating a bear\u2019s gallbladder and bile was said to have medicinal powers. Chinese today still consume the bile extracted from moon bears, sun bears, and brown bears; the substance is believed to be therapeutic and is an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine. Yet bile extraction is a painful and invasive process, and some bear bile farms keep bears locked in tiny cages for years at a time. Bear farming, which uses some 10,000 Asiatic black bears to harvest medicinal bile and which generates almost $1 billion a year.\nThough humans apparently ate panda in prehistoric times, contemporary Chinese have little taste for the animal. There is an oft-cited saying that Chinese people will \u201ceat anything with four legs except the table\u201d \u2014 including braised camel hump, monkey brains, and shark\u2019s fin on the occasional (luxe) Chinese menu. The liberal Chinese palate often extends to animals kept as pets, with dogs, rabbits, and even cats sometimes meeting their end as a soup or spicy dish. But panda banquets are unheard of. They are certainly too precious to eat, but their flavor might also have kept them off the dinner table.\nSchaller details the trial of 26-year-old farmer Leng Zhizhong, who unintentionally snared a radio-collared panda in the western province of Sichuan in January 1983 while trying to trap Musk deer and wild pigs. In a bid to dispose of the evidence, he chopped up the bear and stir-fried its meat with turnips. It was a dish so inedible he ended up feeding it to his pigs. (He also gave some to his sister.) The court sentenced Leng to two years in prison.\n~ \u25cb ~\nREFERENCES, ATTRIBUTIONS AND FURTHER READING A picture of 1600 pandas (maked in Thailand by the World Wide Fund for Nature) exposed in Boulogne-Billancourt (France), Saturday, 27th March 2010 on the occasion of Earth Hour.\nMerritt Christine.

Some appear quite dark, while others have lighter patches of browns. Like their North American cousins, Japanese giant salamanders have flat heads, elongated bodies and long, broad tails. They have small eyes and rely on their other senses to detect prey. This species does not exhibit sexual dimorphism (distinct differences in appearance between males and females), except during the breeding season when males develop a swollen cloaca.\nLike other salamanders, Japanese giant salamanders \"breathe\" primarily through their skin. The smooth skin acts as a respiratory surface for gas exchange, where oxygen enters the body and carbon dioxide is released. Flaps of skin, or wrinkles, increase the surface area for this respiration. These salamanders do have a single lung, but it is used primarily to control their buoyancy in the water.\nWhen aggravated or stressed, Japanese giant salamanders secrete a sticky, white mucus that may be toxic to predators. The sticky secretion has a pungent odor and smells like Japanese peppers. This has given them a common name in Japan that translates to \"big pepper fish.\"\nGiant salamanders have amazing regenerative capabilities and are able to regrow skin and bone, if necessary. Japanese giant salamanders belong to the Cryptobranchid family, which includes three regionally distinct salamanders: Japanese giant salamanders, Chinese giant salamanders and North American hellbenders."}

It has a characteristic elongated, narrow snout, similar only to the tomistoma (previously called the false gharial). Many sharp, interlocking teeth line the gharial's elongated jaws.\nGharials exhibit sexual dimorphism \u2014 or differences in characteristics between males and females of the same species \u2014 in both size and appearance. Adult males develop a bulbous growth at the tip of their snout, called a \"ghara\" after the Indian pot it resembles. The ghara has several functions. It partially covers the crocodiles nostrils and acts as a vocal resonator, creating a loud, buzzing sound when the gharial vocalizes. It is also a visual signal for females, helping males attract a mate.\nBecause of their weak leg muscles, gharialsare poorly equipped for locomotion on land. Most of their movement takes place in the water. When they do move across land, gharials push their bodies forward across the ground, a motion known as belly-sliding."}

Learn more about the quirky side of these interesting animals.\n1. Pandas Have an Extra Bone Just for Eating\nMichael Leidel/EyeEm / Getty Images\nPandas are known for their affinity for munching on bamboo. In order to get enough nutrition, pandas will spend upward of 12 hours a day feeding, eating as much as 20 to 40 pounds of plant material each day.\ufeff\ufeff In order to more easily feed on the stems and leaves, they have a special anatomical adaptation.\nPandas have an elongated wrist bone on each front paw, with padding on the end. This functions a bit like a thumb, offering a greater ability to maneuver bamboo stalks. It is not a true thumb, and the panda can't use it to grasp things, but the adaptation provides more stability when feasting on bamboo.\n2. Sloth Bears Use Their Lips Like a Vacuum\nMark Newman / Getty Images\nThe sloth bear has specially developed lips just for its eating habits, and the feature is so prominent that it has earned the creature the alternative name of the labiated bear.\nIn addition to eating fruits and flowers in its native India, the sloth bear loves to feast on ants and termites. It does so by using its long lower lip, which can be wrapped around the outer edge of its nose, creating a kind of suction hose out of the end of its snout. And because it lacks upper incisor teeth, it is able to easily suck up a meal of insects.\n3. Brown Bears Are the Most Widespread\nNative to Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America, the brown bear once roamed around the globe. Its range has shrunk significantly in modern times, with the species becoming locally extinct in certain areas. Still, it remains the most widespread of all the bear species.\nNow, the brown bear can be found throughout Europe, Asia, and North America. The largest populations are in Russia, the United States, and Canada.\n4. 'Grolar' and 'Pizzly' Bears Are Appearing\nPhilippe Clement / Getty Images\nAs the global climate shifts, brown bears and polar bears are wandering into each others' territory more often. The result is an increased occurrence of hybrid bears that are commonly called \"grolar\" or \"pizzly\" bears.\nIn 2006, a hunter killed what he thought was a polar bear but actually turned out to be a hybrid of a polar bear and a grizzly.\ufeff\ufeff This was the first confirmed instance of hybridization between the two species in the wild. Interestingly, these bears are fertile, meaning that polar bears and grizzly bears can affect the other species' gene pools.\n5. Black Bears Are Not Always Black\nRichardSeeley / Getty Images\nThe bears in this photo are not brown bears, as you might have guessed at first glance. They are actually a cinnamon-colored black bear sow and her blond cub.\nThough the species is called black bear, the animals within it come in a range of colors: black, brown, cinnamon, blond, blue-gray, or even white.\nThe variation in color has to do with the bears' environment. A lighter color is more common in black bears in the west of the United States, as the lighter shades help them blend in while in open meadows as well as reduce heat stress. Around half of the black bears there are shades of brown.\ufeff\ufeff Meanwhile, in the northeast, around 97 percent of black bears are black in color.\ufeff\ufeff\n6. White Bears Have Cultural Significance\nKenCanning / Getty Images\nThe most famous not-black black bears are part of the Kermode subspecies, found in British Columbia. Ten to 25 percent of creatures in this subspecies have an all-white or cream-colored coat, which is surprising considering they are technically black bears.\ufeff\ufeff\nBeyond its fascinating beauty, the white Kermode bear also carries cultural significance to the First Nations, earning it the nickname of spirit bear. One story told by the Kitasoo/Xaixais Nation tells of Raven (creator of all things) making the animal to remind him of snow and ice as the Ice Age reached its end. In another story, Raven makes an agreement with black bears that throughout time, some of their cubs would be white.\n7. Panda Babies Are Shockingly Small\nPanda cubs are famous for their cuteness, but there is something more special about them: They're shockingly small. Just 1/900th the size of their mothers, panda cubs are one of the smallest newborn mammals relative to the mothers' size.\ufeff\ufeff They weigh a mere 3.5 ounces at birth, which is equivalent to a stick of butter.\ufeff\ufeff\nAt such a small size, panda cubs are pretty much defenseless. That's why panda moms are highly protective.\n8. Polar Bears Are Marine Mammals\nspxChrome / Getty Images\nPolar bears are a special case among bear species because they depend on the ocean for food and a place to live. As a result, they are the only bear species to be considered a marine mammal; they even fall under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\nTo survive in their icy habitat, polar bears have a number of fine-tuned features. They have partially webbed forepaws that help them speed through the water at speeds reaching six miles per hour.\ufeff\ufeff Additionally, their layer of blubber and thick coat provide both buoyancy and protection from the cold water, and their nostrils close when underwater.\n9. Only 1 Bear Species Lives in the Southern Hemisphere\nAll of the world's bears live in the Northern Hemisphere, except one: the spectacled bear. This bear is found almost entirely in the Andes Mountains of South America, aptly giving it its other name of Andean bear. It ranges from western Venezuela down to western Bolivia, and sometimes into northwest Argentina.\nThe spectacled bear has cream-colored markings around its eyes, often resembling the frames of glasses, though the markings may extend down to the bear's neck and chest. This species is not only the last remaining bear species in the Southern Hemisphere, but it is also the last remaining relative of short-faced bears.\ufeff\ufeff\n10. Sun Bears Are (Falsely) Thought To Have Medicinal Properties\nMollyNZ / Getty Images\nThe sun bear is the smallest of the bear species, with a unique marking on its chest that resembles the rising sun and gives the bear its memorable name. However, that is not why these bears are sought after. They are often hunted and killed for their paws, gall bladders, and bile products to be used in traditional Chinese medicine.\nWhat's more, sun bears are one of the species used in bear bile farms, a cruel practice in which bears are kept caged to extract bile for the medicinal trade.\nIn each of these cases, there is no scientific evidence that these substances hold any medicinal value."}

But then ... whoops! The panda loses its footing. A fall from this height\u2014about a hundred feet\u2014could be deadly. But the panda quickly grips the branch with all four paws and some seriously sharp claws, steadies itself, and keeps moving.\nFOREST ACROBATS\nRed pandas and giant pandas share a similar name\u2014and a love for bamboo\u2014but they aren\u2019t closely related. Scientists think that red pandas are more closely related to weasels, raccoons, and skunks. And while giant pandas spend most of their time plodding around on the ground looking for food, red pandas spend about 90 percent of their time in the trees in the misty mountains of Nepal, Myanmar, and central China where they live.\n2:38\nIn fact, red pandas have adapted so well to life in the trees that they\u2019re famous for their incredible acrobatic skills. They even have a special thumb-like wrist bone that helps them get an extra grip when climbing. While they can\u2019t exactly extend their arms like an acrobat to keep their balance, they can use their tails. If a red panda starts to lean in one direction, it can swing its tail the opposite way to steady itself.\nSpending time in trees is how these animals avoid predators, such as snow leopards. Their reddish coats and white face markings provide camouflage in the red-brown moss and white lichen of trees where they live. About the only time red pandas go to the ground is to, um, go. And they scamper down tree trunks headfirst. How? They rotate their ankles 180 degrees\u2014that\u2019s like being able to turn your foot backward. The move gives their curved claws a better angle to hang on to the bark.\nSAVING RED PANDAS\nRed pandas are endangered. Their forest homes are being cut down, and poachers hunt them for their fur. And their adorableness might put them in more danger, since they\u2019re ideal targets for the illegal pet trade.\nLuckily people are trying to help. For instance, the Red Panda Network hires local people to be forest guardians. These panda pals keep watch over the red pandas in Nepal, replant bamboo, and help paying tourists observe them without disturbing the creatures. Other organizations are using high-tech methods to track poachers. By taking a DNA sample from a red panda rescued from the black market, conservationists can learn where the animals are being taken from."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "How America Fell in Love With the Giant Panda", "url": "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-america-fell-love-giant-panda-180956692/", "text": "On a chilly Wednesday in 1936, the day before Christmas Eve, a giant panda appeared in New York City. Its name was Su Lin. Two months earlier, the animal had been plucked from its jungle home, wailing, and swept halfway around the planet on airplanes and sea ships, wrapped inside blankets and baskets. No panda had ever survived a trip outside of East Asia. In the weeks before Su Lin's arrival, American newspapers reported each detail, every nugget of news, about his trip across the Pacific.\nFrom the first moment Su Lin was carried out into Grand Central Station and reporters instantly trumpeted the news of America's first panda, celebrity clung to his coat. He clung too: to Ruth Harkness, a widowed socialite-turned-explorer, who went to China without any wilderness experience, vowed to complete her late husband\u2019s hunt for a panda, and returned triumphant, nursing Su Lin from a baby bottle filled with instant milk. Harkness's journey sparked a \"happy furor\" across the country, as biologist George Schaller described in his book, The Last Panda.\nIt was the moment America fell in love with the giant panda.\nThe New York Times announced the news in a delightfully informative headline, \"BABY PANDA HERE, ENJOYS ITS BOTTLE.\" As Harkness held court at the Biltmore Hotel, a brisk December breeze drafting through open windows \"to preserve the native Tibetan climate,\" journalists gawked at the cub. \"What they saw bore a threefold resemblance to a sucking pig, a tiny lamb, and a puppy\" the Times reported. \"Its general coloring is white, but its ears are black and it had tiny black-rimmed eyes, dark brown paws and legs and a brown belly. It is about eighteen inches long and weights a little more than ten pounds.\" The photo that accompanied the article was one of the first of a live panda ever published in a newspaper.\n***\nIt may seem like a modern reaction, the cooing and the fawning and the aww-ing over cute animals \u2014 this website is no stranger to the art of leveraging panda cub photos for squee-hungry readers \u2014 but it\u2019s far from a contemporary trend. The first panda craze gripped the United States in the early 20th century, sparked by Harkness, and ballooned into a cultural phenomenon by the end of the 1930s. Explorers raced to China to capture pandas, then sell them for a small fortune. Zoos competed to host their own exhibits, eager to attract the paying crowds that were guaranteed to come. A giant panda was as good as gold. Within six months of his debut, for instance, Su Lin drew more than 300,000 people to suburban Chicago\u2019s Brookfield Zoo. Everyone from Helen Keller to Al Capone couldn't resist the chance to visit a panda.\nThis story, however, doesn't start with Su Lin, or with Harkness.\nIt starts with a 19th-century Lazarist priest named Armand David. In the 1860s, he worked as a missionary in China, where he studied hundreds of species of birds and animals. It was there, in March 1869, that a hunter brought him the skin of a young giant panda. No westerner had ever seen, as David wrote, evidence of the \"black and white bear.\" He arranged to send a skin specimen back to Paris, where it still remains, and wrote to French mammalogist Alphonse Milne-Edwards with glee: \"I have not seen this species in the museums of Europe and it is easily the most pretty I have come across; perhaps it will turn out to be new to science!\" (Milne-Edwards was the man who, years later, proposed that the panda was related to raccoons, not bears.)\nIn the decades after David brought news of the panda back to Europe, though, sightings remained few and far between. Even art depicting pandas was rare, according to Stephen Allee, associate curator for Chinese painting and calligraphy at the Freer and Sackler galleries. Schaller notes several cases in The Last Panda: a botanist named Ernest Wilson noted \"large heaps of its dung\" in 1908, but didn't spot their source; British explorer J.W. Brooke claimed his hunting party shot a \"parti-coloured bear\" the same year, though he was killed by locals before he was able to explain further; and in 1916, a German zoologist named Hugo Weigold purchased a cub, which died soon after. By 1919, when the American Museum of Natural History exhibited its first mounted specimen, the truth couldn't be denied: pandas were out there, they were unlike any animal seen in America or Europe, and the first people to bring one to the west would be met with unfathomable fame.\nUnless they already were famous. In May 1929, Teddy Roosevelt's sons, Kermit and Theodore Jr., became the first Westerners known to shoot and kill a giant panda. Their hunt was, in true Roosevelt fashion, something between sport and science; reports from the era claim they spent more than $10,000 on the ten-month trip through India, China, and Tibet, which was organized on behalf of Chicago's Field Museum. The panda they shot, along with another killed by a local hunter, are still on display at the museum today.\nThe press followed the exploits of their hunt with relish. \"ROOSEVELTS BAG A PANDA. Cat-Footed Bear of the Himalayas First Shot By White Men,\" the Times announced in a headline. Each brother took a victory lap upon return to the States, too, with extensive interviews about their accomplishment. \"We were extremely lucky, as a matter of fact, for after only four hours of tracking we discovered the beast taking its noonday siesta,\" Kermit said, apparently confusing East Asia with Latin America. \"My brother and I approached carefully, fired simultaneously and got him. The [hired locals] with us refused to bring the animal into their village. It seems the giant panda is a sort of minor deity among them.\" They even wrote a book, Trailing the Giant Panda, in response to the public's demand.\nFrom that point forward, the race was on. An eclectic collection of adventurers, including actor Douglas Fairbanks, struck out to China in search of giant pandas. Their expeditions led to an unprecedented number of collected specimens\u2014by 1936, roughly a dozen were exhibited in museums\u2014but still, no one had brought a living panda to the west. Until Ruth Harkness gave it a try.\nWhen Su Lin arrived in the United States, newspapers didn't hesitate to relay every scintillating detail of Harkness's journey. In 1934, her husband William, shortly after marrying Ruth, had travelled to China and his attempts to capture a panda were stymied by permit issues. A year later, as he waited for bureaucratic approval from the Chinese government, William fell ill with cancer. He died shortly thereafter, without ever beginning his hunt. That's when Harkness decided to realize her husband's dream. \"I inherited an expedition, and what else could I do?\" she later explained.\nThe trip had no shortage of scandals, to the delight of the press. Nearly every story about her expedition makes mention of Quentin Young, a 22-year-old Chinese naturalist, with whom she had a secret affair. Floyd Tangier Smith, a rival panda hunter who worked with her husband, claimed that Harkness didn't find the cub in the jungle, but instead, bought him from Chinese hunters. (She and others rigorously denied the charge.) Later, when she tried to sail back to America, custom officials detained her; the spat would ultimately be resolved after the state levied a $20 tax for \"one dog.\" By the time newspapers actually had an opportunity to photograph Su Lin, Harkness's story was already the stuff of gossip legend.\nAfter Harkness sold Su Lin to the Brookfield Zoo in 1937, months after her return, massive crowds rushed to gawk at the never-before-seen animal. By the end of the decade, six more pandas would be imported to American zoos: two more at Brookfield, two at the Bronx Zoo, and two for the Saint Louis Zoo. Each brought a new round of goofy press coverage. When that second panda arrived at the Bronx Zoo, in May 1939, the Times published details about the animal's mid-air tantrum: \"Chained in the rear of the pilots' cabin out of Kansas City, Bimbo lunged at M.H. Kassing [\u2026] according to Captain Don Terry, pilot of the plane, the panda tore out part of the trousers seat of Captain D.H. Tomlinson.\" The pandas were top attractions in all three zoos; one from the Bronx Zoo was even loaned out to headline the World's Fair.\nPandas were, and still are, big business. That's why whenever a panda died, the three zoos would rush to find a replacement as soon as possible. Between the late 1930s and early 1940s, a common pattern emerged: the old panda would be mourned, the zoo would announce it had purchased a new panda, and press coverage would erupt once the panda arrived. The pinnacle of the trend is this Times story about panda birthday party: \"The boy panda, perhaps because his birthday passed unheralded, took over the party [\u2026] He climbed into his chair, up onto the table and sat on the cake. Then he began throwing pieces of cake at the guest of honor. Both ate a little.\"\nBy the early 1950s, though, the Cold War made it difficult for zoos to import animals from China. The number of pandas in America had dwindled to zero: Su Lin and two others, Mei-Mei and Mei-Lan, had died at the Brookfield Zoo; the Bronx Zoo's four were dead; and the Saint Louis Zoo had recently mourned its last one, Pao Pei. In May 1958, when a panda was up for sale in Peiping, the federal government made clear that it wouldn't be allowed in America: \"The object of the ban is to deny United States dollars to Communist China,\" the Times reported. Another panda wouldn't step onto U.S. soil until 1972, when the Chinese government gifted two to President Richard Nixon.\n***\nThere's something about the panda that stirs people to love it. Maybe it's wired into American culture. Maybe it's science. When a new cub was born at the National Zoo last month, almost eight decades after Su Lin arrived in America, the news seemed like it was everywhere. How much had really changed?\nWell, at least one thing has. A panda's sex was notoriously hard to identify through the early 20th century. For years, Brookfield Zoo experts believed Su Lin was a female. It wasn't until 1938, after he died, that an autopsy concluded he was male. When Mei Xiang gave birth last month, veterinarians didn't have to worry about making the same mistake\u2014they tested genes before announcing the news. It's a boy."}

(Jessie Cohen/AFP/Getty Images)\nBill McShea, also known as the \u201cpanda guy,\u201d is a research scientist at the Smithsonian\u2019s Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Va.\nThe Smithsonian National Zoo\u2019s panda cam maxed out its bandwidth this past week as the saga of the giant panda family unfolded. There was celebration upon the birth of a cub, jubilant surprise at the arrival of a twin, then heartbreak when the smaller cub didn\u2019t make it and suspense over the true father. Despite the public fascination with these animals, certain misconceptions are stubbornly persistent. If you should find yourself discussing the latest panda news, please do not fall for the following myths.\n1. Pandas are cuddly, gentle creatures.\nOnline photographs of grinning people hugging baby pandas may suggest that giant pandas would make perfect pets. But make no mistake: They are bears and built to be aggressive. Their canines and claws are well developed, and the musculature in their limbs and jaws is sufficient to inflict serious damage.\nIndeed, they do harm one another, particularly when males are establishing dominance or competing for females. Males in China\u2019s Qinling Mountains are often observed with torn ears and bite wounds from tussling with other males. And in 2007, the first captive-born male reintroduced into the wild died after an apparent fight with other pandas.\nAttacks on humans are relatively unusual. In 1984, the National Zoo\u2019s Ling-Ling bit a keeper. Generally keepers do not enter the pandas\u2019 enclosures when the animals are there. They know that you should no more cuddle an adult giant panda than you should an adult black bear.\n2. Pandas are incompetent breeders.\nThe original power couple at the National Zoo, Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling, were a breeding pair for almost 20 years. Hsing-Hsing famously attempted to mate with Ling-Ling\u2019s foot and ear. They ultimately produced five cubs; none survived.\nSuch records have led to the hypothesis that reproductive incompetence is one factor behind the panda\u2019s endangered status. \u201cThey have no libido, no interest in repopulating the species,\u201d Brian Barrett wrote for Gizmodo in a typical rant. However, there is no evidence that giant pandas have any problems breeding in their natural habitat. (Their rarity in the wild has to do with too many people occupying the little remaining bamboo forest.)\nIn the wild, aggregations of male pandas form along ridge tops in the spring, and a stream of visiting females in heat keeps the mating activity intense. That\u2019s hard to mimic for zoo pandas. Rather, in most zoos one male is isolated from one female until the fateful day of estrus; and when the moment arrives, neither is socialized to know what to do.\nTechnology can help. U.S. zoos have embraced artificial insemination for their pandas, and all the cubs born in recent years at the National Zoo have been the result of it. Newborn cubs \u2014 tiny, hairless, helpless \u2014 remain vulnerable. But advances in veterinary medicine and primary care for infants are improving their chances.\n3. Pandas are rare in captivity.\nOnly 50 giant pandas live outside China. That includes the surviving cub at the National Zoo, which is one of only four U.S. zoos holding pandas.\nThe key phrase, though, is \u201coutside China,\u201d as there are approximately 345 captive pandas in China. Chinese breeding facilities have done a phenomenal job \u2014 a visitor to the Chengdu Research Base can see more than 50 pandas in a day. Given that success, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has been able to revise its goal upward from 300 to 500 pandas in captivity. That number will be reached within five years at the current growth rate.\nWild pandas remain endangered \u2014 there are only an estimated 1,800 \u2014 and there is a critical role for captive giant pandas in spreading a conservation message. But compare giant pandas with Sumatran rhinos, with only nine individuals in captivity worldwide, and the last one in United States about to leave for Indonesia. The worldwide population of captive pandas is healthy and thriving.\n4. Pandas are not your average bear.\nSince they were first described by Westerners in 1869, giant pandas have been placed in the bear family (Ursidae), the raccoon family (Procyonidae) and in their own unique family (Ailuropodidea), depending on whether researchers were looking at bone structure, behavior or penile characteristics. They share the name \u201cpanda\u201d with one other species, the red or lesser panda. Only in the 1980s was genetic analysis able to differentiate the two, with red pandas being placed within the procyonids and giant pandas within the bear family.\nAsk zoo visitors what makes pandas unique among bears, and they\u2019re likely to say something about the tiny cubs, black-and-white coloring or bamboo diet. But all bears give birth to altricial (underdeveloped) young. And five species of bears are some combination of black and white, while the remaining species are either all white (polar bears), all black (American black bears) or remarkably variable (brown bears).\nMeanwhile, although pandas do go heavy on bamboo, eating as much as 44 pounds a day, they retain the capacity to eat meat in both their tooth structure and gut flora. Chinese villagers report pandas breaking into livestock pens and consuming goats and sheep. In China, we recently photographed a giant panda feeding for several days on the carcass of a takin (a large goat-like ungulate). That places pandas at one end of a spectrum of omnivorous bear species, which eat a combination of plants, insects and meat. Only polar bears are all-meat eaters.\n5. Pandas are lazy.\nThe adult giant pandas you see at the zoo seem like they would be just as comfortable on a lounge chair as on a mountainside. Their top speed appears to just exceed an amble. They spend most of the day chomping bamboo. Contrast this with images of polar bears stalking prey among the ice floes or brown bears fighting along salmon streams. Giant pandas appear to live the life of Riley.\nWhat they lack in speed, though, giant pandas make up in endurance. They feed about 19 hours a day, 365 days a year. They do not go into an extended hibernation like other temperate bears; they do not lie in wait for prey or sleep off a big meal. Because they are unable to build up fat reserves, they must continuously hunt for food. Luckily, their food is usually nearby.\nBut seasonal movements up and down steep hillsides are the norm in their native habitat. Juveniles disperse from their mothers\u2019 home range, and everyone moves in response to bamboo die-offs after flowering events, with reports of six-mile treks over alpine mountains. Giant pandas are not lazy, just comfortable.\nTwitter: @NationalZoo\nFive myths is a weekly feature challenging everything you think you know.

But at the same time, they are also lazy. Sarcastically speaking, our cuddly pandas do some of the tough jobs in the world: eating and sleeping. We are fully aware that they need to eat a lot of bamboos every day. But have you ever wondered how many hours does a panda sleep?\nGiant pandas sleep for about 8 to 12 hours per day. However, these hours are not the same as what we think about the concept of sleep. There is a little more to understand about the giant panda\u2019s sleeping process.\nThe good thing is that we have prepared a clear explanation for you to understand even more. Sounds good? Let\u2019s keep going and learn more about a panda\u2019s sleeping time.\nWhy do giant pandas sleep?\nPhoto Source: Freepik\nGiant pandas sleep to conserve their energy. The same is true for all other living creatures. Sleep allows us all to renew our physical strength to perform or do all of our activities. Nonetheless, it flows differently for the giant pandas. Let\u2019s dig deeper.\nSince 99% of giant pandas\u2019 diet comes from bamboo that is very low in nutrients, they have to eat from time to time. The giant pandas can keep up with the nutrients they need in this way. Regardless if it is day or night, they have to wake up to eat over and over again. Thus, it affects their sleep.\nDo giant pandas sleep at night or day?\nPhoto Source: We Hear It\nThey sleep both day and night. Every 3-4 eating hours, the giant pandas sleep for 2-3 hours. With that sleeping condition, they don\u2019t mind if it\u2019s night or day. However, most of the sleeping time of the giant pandas happens during day time.\nConsidering giant pandas have solitary nature, they spend most of their time alone in the forest. Also, you can usually see them asleep in the daytime. On the other hand, they spend nighttime is mostly for eating purposes. It is because most of the animals sleep at night except for the nocturnal types.\nSince there are fewer distractions, they can do whatever they want without worrying about interference or uncomfortable interaction they might have. So, the answer is both. They only want to wake up during the times they can be completely alone.\nWhere do giant pandas sleep?\nPhoto Source: Time Magazine\nThe giant pandas are not picky in terms of their sleeping place. They can sleep on the forest floor, on rocks, and in trees. Moreover, giant pandas do not have any known natural enemies. It is the least of their concern. Therefore, they can sleep anywhere they fall asleep without worrying about their safety.\nIn captivity, they provide giant panda cubs places to sleep. Since they are completely helpless and vulnerable, they gave them special care. In the quarters, they observe their eating and sleeping routine. Moreover, they allow grown-up giant pandas to sleep anywhere in captivity. Although at night they have their sleeping dens.\nOn the other hand, the red pandas do not practice the same thing. They spend most of their lives in the trees. They do everything here, from eating, mating, and sleeping. These pandas are more prone to wild predators because of their size, unlike giant pandas.\nDo giant pandas sleep in trees?\nPhoto Source: iStock\nYes, they do. Just like what we mentioned before, the giant panda sleeps on trees. They can sleep in the hollowed-out logs or stumps of conifer trees. They can also sleep while balancing on the branch of the tree.\nFurthermore, trees are vital for most animals, including the pandas. The trees are what they consider homes. They do most of their activities in their tree dens.\nTo learn more about the question \u201cDo giant pandas sleep in trees?\u201d, CLICK HERE.\nWhen do giant pandas sleep?\nThe giant pandas sleep whenever they want after spending 3-4 hours eating. Most of their sleeping time lasts for 2-3 hours. Then they will wake up to eat again.\nDue to this reason, the giant pandas often stay near the understories of bamboo. It is for the ease of access to their food source. So, anytime they feel the need to eat, they can do it with fewer worries.\nHow do giant pandas sleep?\nVideo Source: YouTube (iPanda)\nPerhaps it is one of the cutest sightings ever. The giant pandas look so innocent when sleeping. So cute that you want to hug them while they are asleep.\nIf you watch videos about the sleeping giant pandas, you will see them doing different carefree sleeping positions. You can see them hanging like a teddy bear on a tree branch while sleeping. You can even see them sleeping while balancing on thick tree branches.\nMoreover, you can also see them lying like a human on the forest floor. Sometimes, they are curled up like a ball while deeply asleep. The same is true with the panda cubs. It is just that the cuteness doubles when you see the cute and cuddly baby pandas peacefully asleep.\nConclusion:\nIn this article, you learned that panda sleeps about 8-12 hours a day. You even knew the time and conditions they follow when they sleep. Also, you learned about how they sleep in captivity and the wild.\nSleep is a refreshing time. It is so important for both animals and humans. So let\u2019s always remember its importance. Due to the natural ways of living of giant pandas, they have developed a strange sleeping routine. It is something we cannot control no matter what we do.\nOn the other hand, the best that we can do for them is to keep their environment safe and suitable for sustaining their lives. We should not compromise or invade their habitat. Let us give them the peace of mind to worry less about their sleep or rest.\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

The DNA test identifies the baby porcupine's sex very rapidly.\nAt the Zoo, a prehensile-tailed porcupine female was trained to participate in ultrasounds, which enabled animal care staff to provide her with prenatal care and prepare for the porcupette\u2019s birth.

The growing bear played with his first enrichment toys, sampled his first sweet potato, took his first bite of bamboo, let fans into his habitat during his first livestream and experienced his first encounter with snow! Through each of these milestones, giant panda assistant curator Laurie Thompson and keepers Marty Dearie and Mariel Lally helped keep fans at home connected to our cub.\n1. Tumbles and Toys (Jan. 11, 2021)\nSpending more time out of the den presents our cub with more opportunities to explore \u2014 and play! While we have presented Xiao Qi Ji with enrichment items before (most notably a pumpkin for Halloween) we have seen his interest in them grow exponentially since the beginning of January. These items encourage our giant pandas to keep physically active and mentally sharp; they also give the bears an opportunity to use their natural behaviors and choose how to spend their time.\nWith Xiao Qi Ji becoming more aware of and interested in his surroundings, keepers gave him two toys to investigate: a small red Jolly Egg (perfectly sized for a panda cub) and an empty PVC puzzle feeder. When Xiao Qi Ji is exploring the habitat and happens upon them, he usually stops for a few minutes to paw at them, pick them up and give them a nibble.\nSome toys built for cubs are made from softer materials to help the animals grasp or chomp on them. Our team is very careful to watch Xiao Qi Ji as he plays during the day, since Mei Xiang\u2019s more powerful teeth and jaws could damage the toys. Before we leave for the day, we remove these toys from the enclosure. Neither Mei Xiang nor Xiao Qi Ji seem to mind, content to eat or play with their bamboo overnight.\nPersonality-wise, Xiao Qi Ji seems to take after his mother. Like Mei Xiang, he is careful and cautious when it comes to exploring his environment. Now that he has mastered walking, he has started to practice his climbing skills. He is very deliberate about the paths he takes when traveling up or down the rockwork\u2014more so than siblings Tai Shan, Bao Bao or Bei Bei were. He has taken a few tumbles here and there, but not nearly as many as his brothers and sister did at this age. Luckily, these bears are built to be robust and have thick, wooly fur to cushion their fall.\n2. A Playful Panda Cub (Jan. 15, 2021)\nGiant panda cub Xiao Qi Ji\u2019s word of the week seems to be: play! Our 4.5-month-old cub\u2019s interest in his surroundings really took off this week. He seems to explore the world with his mouth. He nibbles on everything from his paws and enrichment toys to mother Mei Xiang\u2019s ears. While she is eating bamboo, we often see Xiao Qi Ji try to initiate a play session with a few not-so-ferocious bites. After Mei Xiang shifts outside in the morning, he often emerges from the den to \u201csupervise\u201d the keepers as they clean and get the habitat ready for Mei Xiang\u2019s return.\nXiao Qi Ji received his first enrichment toys a few weeks ago and plays with them whenever they catch his attention. Those who have followed his siblings' stories have asked when Xiao Qi Ji will get a rubber tub. With the adults, we often put leaf-eater biscuits or sensory enrichment (like bubbles) into these tubs. Cubs, though, seem to enjoy the exercise of climbing in and out or just sitting in this cub-sized space.\nWe weigh Xiao Qi Ji in one such tub. This week, he tipped the scales at 19.8 pounds (9.04 kilograms). He also receives tubs to play in during the day. He is not quite big enough to get out from underneath a tub if it were to overturn on top of him, so he only receives this enrichment during the day when we can keep an eye on him.\n3. A Parcel of Sweet Potato (Jan. 22, 2021)\nJust like his mother, Mei Xiang, our giant panda cub Xiao Qi Ji is curious yet cautious about the world around him. Yesterday \u2014 the day our cub turned five months old \u2014 we decided to introduce him to something new. Using a piece of bamboo shred as a spoon, we scraped some cooked sweet potato onto the end, then handed it over to Xiao Qi Ji. He grabbed the bamboo in his mouth, paused for a moment to take in the new taste, then lay back and licked the remainder. When we offered him more, he wouldn\u2019t stop nibbling on it!\nXiao Qi Ji clearly enjoyed this new treat, which is not surprising since both Mei Xiang and his father, Tian Tian, are also fond of sweet potatoes. In addition to bamboo, nutrient-rich biscuits, carrots and apples, sweet potatoes are part of our pandas\u2019 balanced diet.\nEven though Xiao Qi Ji is beginning to sample some new foods, Mei Xiang\u2019s milk is still his main source of nutrition. Around 1 year old, bamboo and other solid foods make up the majority of a panda's diet. However, Xiao Qi Ji may nurse for comfort up to 18 months of age. He typically nurses at night and in the early morning. On Wednesday, Jan. 20, he weighed 20.79 pounds (9.45 kilograms), and continues to make good gains.\n4. Livestream with Xiao Qi Ji (Jan. 27, 2021)\nThis was a big week for our little panda cub! On Wednesday, Jan. 27, the giant panda team hosted our first-ever virtual encounter with Xiao Qi Ji. An important part of saving species is being able to tell their stories, and it was wonderful to see in the comments that many of you are as enamored with our adorable ambassador as we are. Your kind words and support for our bears and our team are much appreciated, especially as the Zoo remains closed and we continue to navigate this \u201cnew normal\u201d brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nXiao Qi Ji\u2019s newest enrichment toy made an appearance in Wednesday\u2019s broadcast. This week, we gave him a bright green ball with a small handle. Since it is made from a softer material than the adults\u2019 toys, it\u2019s perfect for him to chew on and sink his claws into. It is also scented like green apple, providing some olfactory enrichment, too!\nDuring the livestream, this ball was at the center of a friendly game of tug-of-war between Xiao Qi Ji and keeper Marty Dearie. Don\u2019t let Xiao Qi Ji\u2019s small size fool you\u2014he is remarkably strong! Just before Xiao Qi Ji stole everyone\u2019s hearts \u2014 and wrestled his new green ball away from Marty \u2014 we placed him on a scale for his weekly weigh-in. Since his last measurement seven days prior, our 5-month-old cub gained another two pounds. This week, he weighed 22 pounds (10 kilograms).\n5. A Bear's First Taste of Bamboo (Jan. 29, 2021)\nThis week, bamboo was on the menu. We saw Xiao Qi Ji munching on some of his mother Mei Xiang\u2019s leftover leaves. As Xiao Qi Ji\u2019s walking and climbing skills improve, we are starting to see him explore more and more of his habitat. Yesterday, he walked out of the den, through both indoor enclosures, and over to the opposite den. He sat up and pressed his face against the \u201ctake out window\u201d where we routinely feed Mei Xiang. It was hilarious to see our curious cub waiting at the same window for us!\n6. First Encounter With Snow ( Jan. 31, 2021)\nAs snow blanketed the Washington, D.C. region, the Smithsonian's National Zoo's animals woke up to a winter wonderland. With this weather event came another significant milestone\u2014giant panda cub Xiao Qi Ji\u2019s first encounter with snow! Keepers say although he seemed nervous at first, eventually he worked up the courage to take a little nip at the fresh powder.\n7. Mei Xiang and Tian Tian Enjoy the Snow (Jan. 31, 2021)\nSlides, somersaults and pure panda joy. Happy snow day from giant pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian!\n8. Tian Tian Has a Ball (Feb. 2, 2021)\nGiant panda Tian Tian had a ball in the snow. Literally.\nThis story was featured in the February 2021 issue of National Zoo News. Behind these 'aww\u2019-inspiring moments, an expert team works tirelessly to provide our panda family with everything they need to thrive, ensuring a bright future for this species. If this cub sparks joy for you, please consider making a donation to the Zoo. On behalf of the animals we care for and protect: thank you! Please note that the Zoo is temporarily closed as a public health precaution to help prevent the spread of COVID-19."}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Difference Between Red Panda and Giant Panda", "url": "https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-red-panda-and-vs-giant-panda/", "text": "Red Panda vs Giant Panda\nPandas have been winning the key attention of people and organizations from all around the world. They are interesting and specialized animals in terms of their food habits. Despite the classification states that they belong in the Order: Carnivora, pandas could be either omnivorous or herbivorous in food habits. It is not that hard to distinguish a red panda from giant pandas because of the contrasting differences in their appearances.\nRed Panda\nRed panda, Ailurus fulgens, is a small tree-living mammal live exclusively in Southern China and Himalayas. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) lists red panda in the category Vulnerable, as there are less than 10,000 estimated individuals in the wild. They have a shiny reddish-brown coat, which gives them the commonly referred shining cat. Their tail is long and shaggy that is characteristic for them. The length between head and the base of the tail is more than a half a metre and the tail is almost a half a metre long. Their long tail has white and reddish-brown rings. The body weight is almost same in both male and female that ranges between four and six kilograms. Red panda ears are upright, small, and whiter at back with darker to front. They mostly eat bamboo and which covers almost two third of a red panda diet. Other than bamboo, their diet consists of other vegetarian food as well as insects, small mammals, and fish. Males and females get together during mating season, despite their solitary lifestyle. Both males and females mate with more than one partner in the first quarter of the year (from January to March), and pregnancy lasts for about 4 \u2013 5 months. The cubs are blind and deaf with a black coat, and they open their eyes around 18 days from birth. A healthy red panda would live up to 10 or sometimes 15 years in the wild.\nGiant Panda\nThis is one of the most specialized and a unique animal in the world and IUCN categorizes giant panda as Endangered. Their wild population could be between 1,500 and 3,000. They are large in stature; with an adult male has a weight of almost 150 kilograms, a length of almost two metres, and a height of 75 centimetres. Usually, a female is about 10 \u2013 20% less than the size of a male. Their colouration of fur is characteristic; white body and face with black shoulders, limbs, ears, and eyes. Giant pandas are solitary and territorial animals, and live in bamboo forests of Central China. They have a highly specialized diet that is bamboo shoots. Almost 99% of their diet consists of bamboo, but very rarely, they would eat other vegetarian or meat food. Usually, their daily consumption of bamboo shoots could go up to 14 kilograms. However, they mate during the second quarter of the year (from late March through May) and the gestation period could last from 95 to 165 days. Newborn cubs are very small, which is 1000 times smaller than the mother\u2019s weight. They live up to 20 years in the wild and many more years in the captivity."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Irresistible Facts About Baby Animals - Factinate", "url": "https://www.factinate.com/things/40-irresistible-facts-baby-animals/", "text": "What is more adorable than baby animals?\nIt\u2019s okay, you can take a second to think.\nBaby humans? Sorry, no. Putting your dog in a funny costume? Getting there, but still a ways off. An elderly couple walking down the street holding hands? Close, but no cigar. It turns out there is actually nothing more adorable than baby animals. Yup, that\u2019s right, NOTHING! And we consider ourselves authorities on this matter. This is part of why the internet exists: to brighten up your day with the miniature versions of full-grown beasties.\nSo, if the world has been getting you down a bit (or even if it hasn\u2019t) let\u2019s take a break from all the chaos and learn some charming facts about our favorite subject in the world: baby animals.\nBaby Animals Facts\n40. Alpha Betta Momma\nBefore they are even born, Siamese fighting fish need all the help they can get. For whatever reason, female fighting fish have an innate hankering for the taste of their own eggs (caviar anyone?), meaning that in almost every instance, the Siamese father must step in and fight their right to live a life aquatic.\nOk so that one was\u2026 maybe not so cute. But stick with us! It gets better from here on out.\n39. Parrot Names\nBaby parrots are all essentially given names at birth. After giving birth, a parrot will develop a particular call for its offspring, who will then adopt the same call, with some slight variation to make it its own.\nAdditionally, parrots experience a phenomenon common to most species of birds called \u201cimprinting\u201d, whereby new-born parrots latch on to the first moving/living thing they lay eyes on, and accept it as their parent. Most often, of course, this is their mom or dad\u2026 but if a parrot opens its eyes to see a human being, they\u2019ll often assume the person is their family.\n38. Consider us Lucky\n97% of the animal kingdom does not experience the privilege of a childhood under the care of both mom and dad. For the vast majority of creatures on Earth, the responsibilities of parenthood fall primarily on one gender.\nHowever, puffin babies are just like us in this regard: they almost invariably get the full benefits of two parents growing up.\nPuffins are monogamous maters and after childbirth\u2014the male will usually stick around to raise the child in tandem with the mother.\n37. Lizard Lunch\nBasically no-one on Earth spends enough time being thankful that they weren\u2019t born a Long-Tailed Skink Lizard. Heck, many of us don\u2019t even think about it at all. But, if you happen to have a spare 5 minutes right now, it might be worth saying a quick thanks to the universe for making you a person. It might not be all fun-and-games in a typical human life\u2026 but at the very least, most of us avoid being eaten by our moms.\nSee, unlike most lizards, skink moms do hang around long enough to ensure their babies grow up, if not happy, at the very least healthy and strong. So far, so good right? Well\u2026 not so much. When the going gets tough, the skink mom has basically only one trick up her sleeve: if their nest is threatened before the babies grow to maturity, they will waste no time in devouring children, presumably with the idea that consuming the extra calories will give them enough energy to make a successful escape.\nImagine if every time your mom got scared, she gave serious thought to eating you. Welcome to the wonderful world of the Skink.\n36. Cotton-Top Cooperative\nIf born as a baby cotton-top tamarin, the chances are that you are one of a pair of twins, as these monkeys have twins babies more often than single babies. After being born, babies are raised cooperatively by the entire group.\n35. It\u2019s Not a Contest\u2014Except for When It Is\nMale pipefish are held solely responsible for the carrying and birthing of their offspring. However, they don\u2019t receive female eggs from just one other pipefish, but many others as well. The babies that end up being born are those from the more attractive female. The male selects which embryos to nourish based on how attracted they were to their mother.\nLove is a cruel game for the lady pipefish.\n34. Helplessly Adorable\nA giant panda isn\u2019t so giant when it is a baby\u2014it\u2019s actually about the size of a stick of butter. They are also completely hairless and vulnerable, making them, somehow, even cuter.\n33. Baby Horns\nFully-grown rhinos are a confusing animal to behold, if only because they sit directly on the line between being adorable and fascinating\u2026 while they\u2019re simultaneously entirely capable of squishing you like a fly. If any animal is worthy of the description, \u201cbasically an actual tank\u201d, it\u2019s these guys.\nWhich may be why it\u2019s so surprising that baby rhinos aren\u2019t actually born with a horn. Instead, it takes the calves about five months for their horn to begin emerging from their snout. And in the meantime, they look like the most adorable, fat, and wrinkly little ponies that nature ever accidentally created.\n32. Practice Makes Elephants\nBaby elephants try to grow up fast. They spend their childhood days practicing all their mechanics in order to blossom once they reach adulthood.\nWhich, in case you\u2019re ever interested in losing 5 hours to a life-changing Youtube binge, makes for absolutely adorable videos. A baby elephant in the process of figuring out what their trunk is, makes for one of life\u2019s greatest little joys. \u201cWhy is there another arm on my face???? Who owns this thing????\u201d\nSign up to our newsletter. History\u2019s most fascinating stories and darkest secrets, delivered to your inbox daily. Making distraction rewarding since 2017.\n31. Bonobo Bonds\nBonobo babies learn the importance of community and kinship early on in their youth. They form emotional bonds through touch and the relationships they build will last long, throughout their youth into their adult life.\n30. No Smell Deer\nIn order to help their chances of survival (because that\u2019s the name of the game) baby deer do not have a scent.\nIt\u2019s a pretty cool trick of evolution. Given how much of animal hunting is based on smell, most hungry predators would find a fawn to be essentially invisible. That\u2019d be like if human babies were designed to be un-kidnap-able, by having the ability to camouflage themselves like chameleons.\nOnce again, we have proof that other animals get all the cool superpowers.\n29. Meerkat Kindergarten\nThe Meerkat social order is intensely co-operative. Seriously: if you\u2019re ever looking for a real team-building exercise, you might consider pretending to be Meerkats.\nThese little guys spend their entire lives working as a unit. And nowhere is this more evident than in the way their babies are raised. Meerkat parents essentially form collective clubs, in which the duties of raising and teaching the young are shared amongst the adults. Young ones are raised together as if they were in a school, as the pups learn all their skills through this upbringing.\n28. Gray Flamingo\nThat beautiful fluorescent pink flow of the flamingo must look incredibly on baby flamingos, right? Nope. When a flamingo is born it a small gray ball of feathers, like a tropical version of the old ugly duckling story.\n27. Arrested Development\nOf all the great apes, orangutan babies take the longest time to mature. It takes up to eight years for a baby orangutan to be weaned from their mothers and truly escape the bonds of childhood.\nAnd never has it been better for our reputation as a species to not be considered a \u201cgreat ape\u201d. We are simply regular apes\u2026 which might normally feel like a bit of an insult, but in this case might be for the best. Seeing as our transition out of childhood takes a cool\u2026 10 years longer than these guys? At the best? It\u2019s probably good that we\u2019re not comparing ourselves directly to them.\n26. Milking It\nGiven the outrageous amount of growing they\u2019ve got to do, a baby elephant must drink a ton of milk, right? Well, they actually, quite literally, drink over two tons of milk! As a calf, elephants drink as much as 2,200 gallons of milk from their mother.\nIf you are a lactose-intolerant baby elephant, life is really, really, really unpleasant.\n25. Color Doesn\u2019t Matter\nMany monkey babies are born a different color than their parents. The langur, for instance, is colored black, but their babies are orange.\nWhich is why the langur version of the Jerry Springer Show is so famously confusing. \u201cYou are\u2026 maybe the father? Honestly, we can\u2019t tell.\u201d\n24. Joey Beans\nBaby koalas, known as joeys, are particularly fragile babies. They\u2019re born blind, deaf, and almost the exact size of a jelly bean (although presumably less delicious).\nOnce bigger, they will stay with their moms by attaching themselves to her back.\n23. Teeth the Shell\nEver wonder how a baby reptile breaks out of their shell in order to actually be born? Many reptiles, including baby crocodiles, have what is called an \u201cegg tooth\u201d that allows them to crack the shell and break free into the world. Two months after hatching, this tooth will be resorbed back into its body.\n22. Big Babies\nLiving for up to as many as 75 years, ostriches are the world\u2019s largest bird. But it doesn\u2019t take them very long to grow up, as baby ostriches hatch larger than chickens and nearly reach full-grown height after only six months.\n21. Do You Wanna Build a Snowman?\nMacaques are playful animals, but in their youth, they take it to another level. When it snows, they will often roll up snowballs for fun and have a grand old time with them.\n20. Chimp Barbies\nOne way in which baby chimpanzees will get ready for when it is their time to raise their own offspring is by making dolls to play with as if they had babies of their own. They will gather together sticks and rocks to build their dolls and then raise them in reflection to their own parents.\n19. Not Rittens?\nDon\u2019t get confused\u2014baby rabbits are also called kittens! I mean, even if you were to confuse them, the result is still tiny adorable animal friends. It\u2019s a win-win situation.\n18. Limited Resources in Hotel California\nEagles are nothing to mess with, so it shouldn\u2019t be any surprise that neither are their chicks. After hatching, baby eagles will sometimes go to extreme measures in order to get privileged access to the resources their mother provides. \u201cWell that\u2019s not so bad,\u201d you might be thinking, \u201cafter all, what siblings don\u2019t squabble a little bit. Fair enough. But eagles do take it a little far. In this case, \u201cextreme measures\u201d means killing and maiming their brothers and sisters in the nest.\nOh\u2026\n17. Watching the Youth\nWhen elephants are still in their baby calf stage, other female elephants in the herd will often babysit them. Though all of the female elephants will look after the youth, it is mostly young females (who have yet to have any calves of their own) who will babysit. These babysitters are called \u201callomothers\u201d and the act proves to be beneficial for the entire herd.\nLittle did I know that my dream job title is Allomother. Now I\u2019ve got something to strive for.\n16. Trunk Comfort\nMuch like a baby human sucking its own thumb, baby elephants will wrap their trunk around and suck on it as a way to comfort itself.\n15. Poor Baby Earwig\nThe earwig is an animal that is all about survival\u2014after all, is there a human on Earth who wouldn\u2019t kill one on sight? After giving birth, the mother earwig will gravitate to the healthiest of her nymphs through scent, and nurture them with more care than the others. Because the earwig gives birth to as many as 60 children at a time, some babies will inevitably die, so it makes sense to give more attention to those who have a better chance at survival.\n14. Deadbeat Dads\nMale seahorses get a lot of credit for giving birth to their offspring, rather than the females. After birthing their babies and keeping them comfortable in his pouch until they are healthy enough to deal with the salinity of the surrounding water, the male disappears and leaves his seahorses babies to grow up fatherless.\n13. Water Wings\nDue to being born in the arid climate of Southern Africa, sandgrouse bird chicks aren\u2019t able to get much water. In comes dad to the rescue, who travels far distances in order to soak himself in water and then fly back to allow his babies to drink from his feathers which have coiled up water in them. Now that\u2019s how you father your kids, seahorses!\n12. Panda Survival\nSure, there are few things cuter than a baby panda, but each one who makes it actually only has a 50/50 shot at being raised by their panda mother. Though they often give birth to two offspring, the panda mother will focus exclusively on one of her children. As she has to expend an enormous amount of energy to raise her cub, she doesn\u2019t have much of a choice if she wants to ensure survival for her offspring.\n11. Like Man, Like Dog\nLike humans, dogs are born with fewer teeth. Puppies have only 28 teeth, but as they grow, so do their teeth, and they up with 42 in the mature adulthood.\n10. Straight From the Source\nDespite the whole \u201cliving their entire lives underwater\u201d thing, baby dolphins have to somehow drink their mother\u2019s milk\u2014remember, dolphins are mammals\u2014without getting any salt water in it.\nWhat to do?\nEvolution solved this one by fitting them with spines on the sides of their tongue, which mold into a sort of straw for them to drink their milk directly from their mother without any contamination.\n9. Babbling Marmosets\nWhat can be cuter than a baby pygmy marmoset? Listening to it babble! Much like how human babies babble themselves into oblivious in order to develop their language and communication skills, so too do infant pygmy marmosets.\n8. Pouch Life\nAll baby marsupials are born prematurely. This is why they all have pouches, ensuring that they can live in a safe, warm, comfortable place and be nurtured by their mother until they can fully develop into a strapping youth marsupial.\n7. Chivalrous Pups\nNot only are puppies the most adorable thing, boy puppies have an inner kindness. Whenever they play fight with girl puppies, they often allow them to win.\n6. Falling Into the World\nGiraffes don\u2019t go to the hospital to give birth. Nor do they lay down. When a baby giraffe is born, they come into the world with a sharp *THUD*. That\u2019s the sound of them hitting the dirt, after falling six feet from the birth canal. That\u2019s right, despite the obvious challenges the strategy presents to their babies, giraffes give birth standing up.\n5. Too Fluffy to Fail\nA baby sea otter is so covered with fluff that it couldn\u2019t drown even if it tried; they float like little furry beach balls.\nThe flip side of that extremely cute coin? They are also born with so much fluffy hair that they can\u2019t pull themselves out of the water. Meaning they must wait to learn how to dive (and therefore live alone) until they mature and lose some of their cuddle capacity.\n4. Baby\u2019s First Steps\nGiraffes don\u2019t need any time to walk! It only takes about 30 minutes for a baby giraffe to get to stepping and begin honing its long stride. Though it does take them some time to shake their adorable clumsiness.\n3. Playmates\nA pack of lions sticks together. One way their connection is maintained is in the way that they all give birth around the same time as each other, which allows for their cubs to grow up together and form bonds.\n2. Talking Through the Shell\nBefore they even hatch, baby chicks form a communication bond with their mothers by chirping through their eggshells. This process of tapping, chirping, and generally causing a ruckus, is called pipping or piping. Farmers recognize this stage in a chick\u2019s development as the moment the begin to learn how to breathe, and strengthen their lungs for a life outside the shell.\n1. No Squirrel Left Behind\nSquirrels look out for their own. If one squirrel has found an abandoned baby squirrel, it will adopt it and raise it as its own. I\u2019m not crying, you\u2019re crying.\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9"}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Lion | Smithsonian's National Zoo", "url": "https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/lion", "text": "Social Structure\nLions are the world's most social felines. They live in groups of related females, called prides, which may comprise several to as many as 40 individuals, including adults, sub-adults (between the ages of 2 and 4) and cubs, plus one or more resident males. Abundance of prey availability plays a significant role in the size of a lion pride. Pride mates associate in sub-groups within the pride.\nFemales usually stay in their mothers' prides for life, unless food scarcity forces them out. Young males are driven from their prides when they grow large enough to compete with the dominant males (usually between the ages of 2 and 4). They create coalitions, usually with brothers and cousins, and search for a pride to take over. Males entering a new pride will kill all cubs that cannot run from them. Adult males that are fortunate enough to achieve residency within a pride hold tenure for an average of two years, often leaving due to eviction by another coalition of males. In India, female and male lions live apart, joining only to mate.\nMales take on most of the defensive duties. However, both males and females mark their territories by roaring \u2014 which can be heard up to five miles away \u2014 and scent marking with urine. Females raise the cubs and are the primary hunters, although males will sometimes join females during a hunt. Depending on the prey item, several lions may stalk prey from different angles to within 100 feet (30 meters) before attacking the targeted animal. Nomadic males must hunt alone or scavenge from other animals."}

And Other Cheetah Facts", "url": "https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/news/why-do-cheetahs-have-spots-and-other-cheetah-facts", "text": "Discover the answers to some of the most-searched questions about these lightning-fast cats!\nWhat is the fastest land animal in the world?\nYou guessed it: the cheetah! With the ability to accelerate from zero to 45 in just 2.5 seconds, these cats are built for speed. They are the world\u2019s fastest land mammal, bolting up to 60 to 70 mph.\nWhere do cheetahs live?\nIn the past 50 years, cheetahs have become extinct in at least 13 countries and today are most prevalent in Kenya and Tanzania in east Africa, and Namibia and Botswana in southern Africa. In Namibia, they live in areas with grasslands, savannahs, dense vegetation and mountainous terrain.\nDo cheetahs roar?\nCheetahs don\u2019t roar, but they do make other noise. They purr, bark, stutter, growl, hiss and chirp!\nWhy do cheetahs chirp?\nA cheetah\u2019s chirp has many meanings. Females in estrus often chirp to attract mates. Both male and female cheetahs also chirp when distressed.\nMales may chirp when separated from members of their coalition and when reunited. Moms and cubs will do the same. Cheetahs may even be able to identify each other by the sound of their chirps.\nDo a cheetah\u2019s claws retract?\nCheetahs have blunt, semi-retractable claws. Their paw prints have visible claw tips, appearing more similar to a dog than a cat!\nHow do cheetahs hunt?\nUnlike most cats, which are nocturnal predators, cheetahs primarily hunt in the early morning and late afternoon. They rely heavily on sight, scanning the countryside from atop termite mounds or kopjes \u2014 small, rocky hills.\nOnce a cheetah spots its prey, it creeps closer before its final sprint. If a cheetah successfully catches its prey, it suffocates the animal by clamping down on its windpipe; the cheetah\u2019s jaw creates a strong, vise-like grip.\nWhat do cheetahs eat?\nThese carnivores eat small antelope, including springbok, steenbok, duikers, impala and gazelles, as well as the young of larger animals, such as warthogs, kudu, hartebeest, oryx, roan and sable. Cheetahs also hunt game birds and rabbits.\nA cheetah must eat its kill quickly, as it can be bullied away from its catch by lions, hyenas or even groups of vultures.\nWhy do cheetahs have spots?\nA cheetah\u2019s spots cover nearly its entire body and may serve as camouflage by offsetting shadows in the gray-hued grasses they inhabit. Camouflage is not only essential for stalking prey but also for protecting cheetah cubs from predators.\nDid you know? Much like a human fingerprint, a cheetah\u2019s spots and the ring pattern of its tail are unique!\nHow many cheetahs are left in the world today?\nIt is estimated that cheetahs have disappeared from 89 percent of their natural range throughout Africa, with just 7,500 to 10,000 remaining in the wild.\nHow do cheetahs run so fast?\nBeyond a streamlined body and light bones, many other adaptations allow cheetahs to run incredibly fast! Special paw pads and semi-retractable claws offer great traction, while large nostrils and lungs provide quick air intake, so cheetahs can easily breathe while running.\nVertical shoulder blades, which are not attached to the cheetah\u2019s small collarbone, as well as hips that swivel on a flexible spine help lengthen the cheetah\u2019s stride and provide superior acceleration. The cheetah\u2019s spine works as a spring for its powerful back legs, extending its reach with each step. Meanwhile, the tail acts as a rudder for making quick turns, counteracting its bodyweight.\nStop by Cheetah Conservation Station to see the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo\u2019s cheetahs during your next visit!"}

The animals make up around 17% of the entire wild giant panda population.\nQinling pandas have been isolated for thousands of years due to a long history of human habitation around the mountain range. Their restricted range makes them particularly vulnerable to the loss of food resources.\nBamboo, which carpets the forest floor where the pandas live, is the sole item in the bears' diet and also provides essential food and shelter for other animals.\nThe plant's unusual reproductive cycle limits its ability to adapt to climate change. One species studied by the scientists only flowers and reproduces every 30-35 years.\nTuanmu's team assessed how three dominant bamboo species were likely to fare in the Qinling Mountains as the climate warmed.\nEven the most optimistic forecasts predicted major bamboo die-offs by the turn of the century.\nConservation efforts should now aim to protect areas that have a better chance of supplying pandas with food, despite climate change, said the scientists. Natural \"bridges\" could also be created to help the pandas escape from a bamboo famine.\nCo-author Jianguo Liu, from Michigan State University in the US, said: \"Understanding impacts of climate change is an important way for science to assist in making good decisions.\n\"Looking at the climate impact on the bamboo can help us prepare for the challenges that the panda will likely face in the future.\""}

It is found in the Sahara Desert and the Sahel; a dry grassland / savanna region that stretches across Africa from Mauritania in the west to Ethiopia and Eritrea in the east.\nWhy are African spurred tortoises endangered?\nPrimary causes for the African spurred tortoise\u2019s endangered status are habitat loss (due to farming and bush fires), capture for the pet trade, and being hunted for meat.\nBack to animal index\nAfrican Wild Dog\nScientific name: Lycaon pictus\nType of animal: Mammal\nWhere found: Africa\nAfrican wild dogs are found in Sub-Saharan Africa (the part of Africa south of the Sahara Desert). These endangered canids live in packs consisting of an alpha pair and their offspring. They hunt at dawn and dusk, pursuing prey such as Thomson\u2019s gazelles and other mid-sized antelopes.\nThe African wild dog is easily identified due to its patterned coat, which gives the species its alternative name of African Painted Dog.\nIt is estimated that fewer than 1,500 adult individual African wild dogs are left in the wild. The species\u2019 population is fragmented over a wide area.\nWhy are African wild dogs endangered?\nThe biggest threat to the African wild dog is habitat loss. This is a species that needs a lot of space; a growing human population in the dogs\u2019 natural habitat restricts the area in which it can hunt.\nYou can read more about African wild dogs on this page: African Wild Dog facts.\nBack to animal index\nAlabama Red-Bellied Cooter\nScientific name: Pseudemys alabamensis\nType of animal: Reptile\nWhere found: North America\nThe Alabama red-bellied cooter is a species of turtle found in Alabama\u2019s Mobile\u2013Tensaw River Delta, a 260,000 acre wetland region. The species is Alabama\u2019s official state reptile.\nThe Alabama red-bellied cooter grows up to 1 ft. / 30 cm in length and its plastron (the shell covering the turtle\u2019s undersides) is orange in color (hence the species\u2019 name).\nThis endangered reptile belongs to the family Emydidae, whose members are also known as \u201cpond turtles\u201d or \u201cterrapins\u201d.\nWhy are Alabama red-bellied cooters endangered?\nAlabama red-bellied cooters are endangered primarily due to habitat loss and illegal capture for sale to the pet trade.

The species grows to lengths of up to 8.2 ft / 2.5 m and weights of around 680 kg / 1,500 lb. It preys on squid and fish, and some individuals are thought to live as long as 50 years.\nWhy are Atlantic bluefin tuna endangered?\nThe Atlantic bluefin tuna is a popular food fish and the primary cause of its endangered status is overfishing.\nBack to animal index\nAye-Aye\nScientific name: Daubentonia madagascariensis\nType of animal: Mammal\nWhere found: Madagascar\nThe aye-aye is a species of lemur that lives in the rainforests of Madagascar, an island located in the Indian Ocean off the coast of East Africa.\nThe endangered mammal, which reaches a length of around 3 ft. (90 cm), including its long tail, is the world\u2019s largest nocturnal primate.\nThe aye-aye finds food by tapping on trees with its fingers; it can tell by the sound if there\u2019s an insect grub hidden beneath the bark.\nWhy are aye-ayes endangered?\nSome local people believe that the aye-aye brings bad luck, and the species has faced persecution due to these beliefs. This, and habitat loss, are the main reasons that the aye-aye is endangered.\nYou can find out more about aye-ayes on this page: Aye-Aye Facts\nBack to animal index\nBarbary Macaque\nScientific name: Macaca sylvanus\nType of animal: Mammal\nWhere found: Africa, Gibraltar\nA small colony of Barbary macaques lives in Gibraltar (a British territory on the southern coast of Spain), making the species the only monkey to be found in the wild in Europe. Barbary macaques are also found in northern Africa.\nUnlike most other monkeys, the Barbary macaque lacks a tail. This has led to the species\u2019 alternative name of \u201cBarbary ape\u201d (apes lack tails).\nWhy are Barbary macaques endangered?\nIn Africa, the Barbary macaque lives in high-altitude forests, and in Gibraltar, in rocky coastal areas. It is due to the loss of its African habitat that the monkey is endangered.\nBack to animal index\nBasking Shark\nScientific name: Cetorhinus maximus\nType of animal: Fish\nWhere found: Oceans worldwide\nThe basking shark is the world\u2019s second-largest fish. It grows to an average length of 26 ft / 7.9 m, but can reach lengths of up to 28 ft / 8.5 m; only the whale shark, another endangered species, is larger.\nUnlike most sharks, the basking shark is a filter feeder rather than an active hunter. It swims through clouds of zooplankton (tiny ocean animals) with its large mouth held wide open, filtering the food from the seawater with comb-like projections from its gills known as \u201cgill rakers\u201d.\nWhy are basking sharks endangered?\nThe basking shark is endangered due to overfishing. Although the species is no longer targeted, it is still caught accidentally and, due to its surface-feeding habits, is occasionally struck by boats.\nYou can find out more about basking sharks on this page: Basking Shark Facts\nBack to animal index\nScientific name: Mustela nigripes\nType of animal: Mammal\nWhere found: North America\nA list of endangered animals is not just about famous animals such as tigers and elephants; other, lesser-known species are also facing extinction.\nThe black-footed ferret is one such animal. Found in North America, it is a member of the family Mustelidae, which also includes weasels, badgers, the wolverine, and related animals.\nIn 1979 the black footed ferret was thought to be extinct in the wild, but in 1981 a small population was discovered in Wyoming.\nA captive breeding program saw the species being reintroduced in several locations in North America.\nAlthough several thousands of black footed ferrets have been reintroduced since the 1990\u2019s, today\u2019s wild population consists of just 206 adults.\nWhy are black-footed ferrets endangered?\nBlack-footed ferrets are endangered due to persecution of its main prey source, prairie dogs. The black-footed ferret\u2019s fortunes are directly linked to the availability of these prey animals. Prairie dogs are capable of damaging crops, and were therefore persecuted by farmers. This, together with habitat loss, led to a fall in prairie dog populations, and a resultant decline in the black footed ferret population.\nYou can find out more about the black-footed ferret on this page: Black Footed Ferret Facts\nBack to animal index\nBlack-Headed Spider Monkey\nScientific name: Ateles fusciceps\nType of animal: Mammal\nWhere found: Central & South America\nThe black-headed spider monkey is an endangered monkey found in tropical and subtropical forests in Colombia, Ecuador and Panama.\nThe black-headed spider monkey has black or dark brown fur (it is also known as the brown-headed spider monkey). Like all spider monkeys it has extremely long limbs and a long, prehensile tail. (Prehensile means \u201cable to grab\u201d.) The tail is used like a \u201cfifth hand\u201d while the monkey is climbing.\nOf the seven species of spider monkey, five (including the black-headed spider monkey) are endangered, one is critically endangered, and one is rated \u201cVulnerable\u201d.\nWhy are black-headed spider monkeys endangered?\nThe black-headed spider monkey is endangered due to being hunted for food, and by the loss and fragmentation of its forest habitat.\nYou can find out more about spider monkeys on this page: Spider Monkey Facts\nBack to animal index\nBlue Speckled Tree Monitor\nPhoto: Hectonichus, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons (cropped/resized by ActiveWild.com)\nScientific name: Varanus macraei\nType of animal: Reptile\nWhere found: Asia\nThe blue-speckled tree monitor is a monitor lizard found only on Batanta island, part of the island country of Indonesia. The species, which is also known as the blue-spotted tree monitor, grows to around 3.5 ft (1.1 m) in length, and it is black with blue scale patterns.\nEquipped with a long, prehensile tail that helps it climb, the blue-speckled tree monitor is largely arboreal (tree-living). It is found in tropical forests.\nWhy are blue-speckled tree monitors endangered?\nThe blue-speckled tree monitor is targeted by hunters who collect live specimens for sale to the pet trade. Deforestation is another threat to the species.\nBack to animal index\nBlue Whale\nScientific name: Balaenoptera musculus\nType of animal: Mammal\nWhere found: Oceans worldwide\nBlue whales are the largest animals ever to have lived on the Earth; they\u2019re bigger than the biggest dinosaurs. Blue whales can weigh up to 200 tons, yet their diet consists almost entirely of tiny crustaceans called krill.\nWhy are blue whales endangered?\nBlue whales are endangered due to historic overhunting. The species was once hunted almost to extinction. Today, the blue whale is protected worldwide and is making a slow recovery. However, with a population that currently numbers between 5,000 and 15,000 adult individuals, the blue whale remains an endangered species.\nYou can find out more about blue whales on this page: Blue Whale Facts\nBack to animal index\nBonobo\nScientific name: Pan paniscus\nType of animal: Mammal\nWhere found: Africa\nBonobos are very similar to chimpanzees (both species belong to the genus Pan), but are usually slightly smaller, with longer legs and darker faces. Bonobos are found in the tropical forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Africa.\nWhy are bonobos endangered?\nThe bonobo is endangered due to poaching (hunting of the bonobo for bushmeat continues despite being banned) and habitat loss caused by logging and slash and burn agriculture.\nYou can find out more about bonobos on this page: Bonobo Facts\nBack to animal index\nChimpanzee\nScientific name: Pan troglodytes\nType of animal: Mammal\nWhere found: Africa\nChimpanzees are primates that live in the forests of central Africa. They are our nearest living relatives, sharing around 98% of our genes. They belong to the great ape family Hominidae, along with humans, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans.\nThese intelligent apes are among the very few animals known to use tools. Chimpanzees have been observed using sticks to extract insects such as termites and bees from their nests, and stones to crack open nuts.\nWhy are chimpanzees endangered?\nThe greatest threat to the chimpanzee is poaching; despite being protected, the species is targeted by hunters for its meat.\nYou can find out more about chimpanzees on this page: Chimpanzee Facts\nBack to animal index\nDhole\nScientific name: Cuon alpinus\nType of animal: Mammal\nWhere found: Asia\nAlso known as the Asian wild dog, the dhole is a canid (member of the dog family, Canidae) found in several Asian countries, including India, Bangladesh and China, and also the islands of Sumatra and Java.\nDespite its large range, the dhole\u2019s population is thin and fragmented. The entire adult wild population of dholes is thought to number a maximum of 2,215 individuals.\nWhy are dholes endangered?\nOne of the main reasons that the dhole is endangered is competition with human hunters. Overhunting of the dhole\u2019s natural prey by humans creates a scarcity of food for the dogs. Habitat loss has also played a large part in the species\u2019 endangered status.\nYou can find out more about dholes on this page: Dhole Facts\nBack to animal index\nEgyptian Vulture\nPhoto: T. R. Shankar Raman, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons (cropped/resized by ActiveWild.com)\nScientific name: Neophron percnopterus\nType of animal: Bird\nWhere found: Africa, Asia, Europe\nThe Egyptian vulture is found across a large part of southern Europe, northern Africa, and Asia. It is a striking bird with white plumage, a yellow face and a 5.58 ft. / 1.7 meter maximum wingspan.\nLike most vultures, the Egyptian vulture is primarily a scavenger.\nWhy are Egyptian vultures endangered?\nToday, much of the carrion eaten by the Egyptian vulture contains either poison or lead shot, which eventually proves fatal for the scavenger. In addition, drugs administered to livestock upon whose carcasses the vulture preys are harmful to the bird. Collisions with wind turbines and electrical cables also reduce the bird\u2019s population.\nBack to animal index\nGal\u00e1pagos Penguin\nScientific name: Spheniscus mendiculus\nType of animal: Bird\nWhere found: Gal\u00e1pagos Islands\nThe Gal\u00e1pagos penguin is found on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, an island group in the Pacific Ocean 563 miles off the coast of Ecuador. The Gal\u00e1pagos penguin is the only penguin found north of the equator. It is the second-smallest penguin: only the little penguin is smaller.\nWhy are Gal\u00e1pagos penguins endangered?\nThe Gal\u00e1pagos penguin\u2019s population is strongly affected by ENSO (the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation), a cycle of warm and cold sea temperatures in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. In El Ni\u00f1o years, the water temperature rises, causing food to become scarce for the penguins.\nYou can find out more about the penguins on this page: Penguin Facts\nBack to animal index\nGal\u00e1pagos Sea Lion\nScientific name: Zalophus wollebaeki\nType of animal: Mammal\nWhere found: Gal\u00e1pagos Islands\nThe Gal\u00e1pagos sea lion lives on the coast of the Gal\u00e1pagos islands. It is the smallest sea lion species. There are only around 10,000 Gal\u00e1pagos sea lions left in the wild.\nWhy are Gal\u00e1pagos sea lions endangered?\nLike the Gal\u00e1pagos penguin, the Gal\u00e1pagos sea lion is affected by El Ni\u00f1o events. These cause a reduction in the amount of available food and a resultant poor breeding season. Disease (possibly spread by dogs) also causes significant declines in the sea lion\u2019s population.\nBack to animal index\nGolden Lion Tamarin\nScientific name: Leontopithecus rosalia\nType of animal: Mammal\nWhere found: South America\nThe golden lion tamarin is a monkey that lives in Brazil\u2019s Atlantic Coastal Forest.\nThe species belongs to a group of primates called the New World monkeys. This group split from the Old World monkeys around 40 million years ago. The nostrils of New World monkeys open to the sides, whereas those of Old World monkeys open downwards.\nWhy are golden lion tamarins endangered?\nThe primary cause of the golden lion tamarin\u2019s endangered status is deforestation. Over 85% of the Atlantic Coastal Forest in which the monkey lives has been destroyed. In addition, the golden lion tamarin is hunted for sale to the pet trade.\nYou can find out more about the golden lion tamarin on this page: Golden Lion Tamarin Facts\nBack to animal index\nGolden Poison Frog\nScientific name: Phyllobates terribilis\nType of animal: Amphibian\nWhere found: South America\nThe golden poison frog is a brightly-colored frog that lives in the rainforests of Colombia.

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "7 Things You Didn't Know About Red Pandas", "url": "https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/7-things-you-didne28099t-know-about-red-pandas/", "text": "Here's one thing you already knew: red pandas are adorable. While they're not domesticated and therefore are probably not suitable as pets, some people keep them as pets anyway - especially in Nepal and India - and upload their adorable hijinks to the internet for the world to see.\nHere are seven other facts about red pandas (Ailurus fulgens) that you might not already know.\n1. Red pandas aren't pandas. Despite their name, red pandas aren't actually closely related to giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), but it wasn't until the last ten or fifteen years that scientists settled upon just where red pandas fit on the evolutionary tree of life. It was clear that red pandas were members of the taxonomic \"infraorder\" Arctoidea, placing them in a group with bears, pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walrus), raccoons, and mustelids (weasels, skunks, otters, and badgers). Research published in 2000 in the journal Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution determined that they were not most closely related to bears or to raccoons as had been previously suggested. Instead, red pandas form their own phylogenetic family, alongside skunks, raccoons, and mustelids. From a genetic perspective, they're more like the skunks and raccoons you might find in your own backyard than the giant pandas with whom they share habitats.\n2. Herbivorous carnivoran. As a member of the Order Carnivora, the red panda is a carnivoran. But unlike most carnivorans, it's not actually a carnivore. That is, the red panda is a mostly an herbivore. It's actually one way in which the red panda is more like the giant panda than its genetic relatives: its diet consists almost entirely of bamboo leaves, plus bamboo shoots when in season, and the occasional fruit, flower, and (rarely) an odd egg or bird. The other carnivoran who is also primarily herbivorous? The binturong, the funny-looking bearcat that smells like popcorn.\n3. Sweet tooth. Speaking of diet, red pandas like fake sugar. In a 2009 study in The Journal of Heredity, researchers presented a variety of Carnivoran species with bowls of plain water, naturally sweetened water, or artificially sweetened water. They discovered that red pandas preferred three artificial sugars: neotame, sucralose (Splenda), and aspartame (Nutrasweet or Equal). That makes them the only non-primate species known to be able to taste aspartame, an ability previously thought unique to Old World monkeys, apes, and humans.\n4. Blending in. Take a look at the reddish-orange tint of the red panda's coat and you might not immediately think \"good for camouflage,\" but that's where you'd be mistaken. It turns out that the red panda is pretty good at hiding from predators by disappearing into the branches of fir trees which are usually covered with reddish-brown moss. Which is pretty handy because death by snow leopard seems like a particularly bad way to go.\n5. A Cheesy Problem. Okay, stay with me on this one. Red pandas, classified as \"vulnerable\" by the IUCN, are threatened by habitat loss and poaching, despite being protected by legislation in the countries where they're found. Because of that habitat loss, wild populations of red pandas are increasingly fragmented. One fragment that hosts a population of around forty red pandas is Nepal's Langtang National Park, in the Himalayas. Even within the national park, those forty pandas are fragmented into four groups. In Langtang, the red pandas have another problem, and it's cheese. You see, the park is also home to two cheese factories that produce a combined 14,000 kilograms of cheese each year to be sold in nearby Kathmandu. To amass the 140,000 liters of milk necessary to make the cheese, farmers keep large herds of chauri, a yak-cow hybrid, and those herds are permitted to graze within the park. The competition over food sources with the chauri combined with other threats to their lives from the herders and from their dogs has led to the death of many, many red pandas. \"This problem might be solved,\" write a pair of researchers in the journal Conservation Biology, \"by reducing cheese production and restricting the number of chauri while commensurately increasing the price of cheese so that farmers\u2019 income from milk could remain the same.\"\n6. Red pandas tweet. They don't tweet in 140 characters like you or I do, but they tweet nonetheless. Actually, to be accurate, the sound they make is known as \"twittering.\" Have a listen (source):\nAccording to researchers at the National Zoo, twittering seems to mainly used to signal reproductive intent. Which, now that I think about it, is not all that different from some twitterers of our own species either.\n7. It Could Have Been Called The Wah. Red pandas have different names depending on where you are. In Nepal, they're called bhalu biralo. Sherpas call the critter ye niglva ponva or wah donka. But the Western world did not always call it a red panda. In 1821, the English naturalist Major General Thomas Hardwicke made a presentation on the creature at the Linnean Society in London. That is typically regarded as the moment the red panda became known in Western science. In his presentation, titled \"Description of a new Genus of the Class Mammalia, from the Himalaya Chain of Hills Between Nepaul and the Snowy Mountains,\" he argued that the animal be called a \"wha,\" explaining, \"It is frequently discovered by its loud cry or call, resembling the word \u2018Wha\u2019, often repeating the same: hence is derived one of the local names by which it is known. It is also called Chitwa.\" Unfortunately, Hardwicke's paper wasn't published until 1827, by which time the French zoologist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cuvier had already published a description of the species along with a drawing. Naming rights, therefore, went to Cuvier.\nFlynn J.J., Nedbal M.A., Dragoo J.W. & Honeycutt R.L.

As of 2020 there are approximately 600 giant pandas in captivity. Giant pandas are on the World Conservation Union\u2019s Red List of Threatened Animals. The U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) protects giant pandas, as well as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). While hunting and poaching have been reduced due to strict laws by the Chinese government, accidental capture of giant pandas in traps set for other animals still possess a serious problem.\nThe future of the giant panda is interwoven with the Chinese people. New advances in environmentally responsible farming, high yield crops to reduce logging, and population control efforts will all help the giant pandas. The Chinese Government also has several projects for reforesting hillsides, protecting grasslands and nature reserves for the giant pandas. There are also plans to pay farmers to turn cropland back to forests and to establish commercial tree farms to replace logging. Bamboo planting, in Sichuan Province, for the captive and wild pandas is an ongoing project.\nStatus Change \u2013 Some people have questioned the change in status of the giant pandas, by the IUCN, from Endangered to Vulnerable. Let us take this opportunity to say, on one hand, this is cause for celebration. It shows that with your support, progress is being made in panda conservation. The Chinese have been working since the 1960\u2019s to save their national treasure and this affirms the efforts are paying off. The captive population is currently stable, as the number in captivity well exceeds the number set forth in the Species Survival Plan.\nThat said\u2026..there are still great concerns and we have definitely NOT reached even modest goals in panda conservation. The IUCN states that the vulnerable status is still at high risk of extinction in the wild.\nWhat does it mean for Panda Conservation? Our greatest fear is the public and our supporters will think the pandas are safe at the present time and become complacent and that is not the case. If the government or the public gets lax in conservation efforts, the pandas could rapidly slide backwards. There may be many unintended consequences of this change including more human activity and trekking in their habitat. A recent International Conference on Panda Conservation published conclusions which state the giant panda is still endangered.\nPremature \u2013 Professor Zhang Hemin, head of China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Pandas, said he felt it was too early to down grade their status. He expressed concerns about the severely fragmented natural habitat which still threatens the lives of pandas. Concerns regarding the genetic status of the different populations that while improved, but is still not satisfactory. Climate change is widely expected to have an adverse effect on the bamboo forests which provide both their food and their home. Zhang feels there is still a lot to be done in both protection and management terms.\nAccording to Zhang, \u201cThe wild giant panda population is broken up into 33 isolated groups, some with fewer than 10 individuals, severely limiting the gene pool. Of the 18 sub-populations consisting of fewer than 10 pandas, all face a high risk of collapse\u201d. This is a major reason Pandas International supports the reintroduction programs.\n\u201cWith the conservation status downgrade, protection work might slacken off and both the panda population and their habitat are more likely to suffer irreversible loss,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cPresent protection achievements will be lost and some small sub-populations may die out\u201d according to Zhang. So we must look at the big picture of the entire species, if one of these populations dies off it would be very harmful.\nFragmentation is one of the largest problems for the wild Giant Pandas, and although there has been talk of corridors for years, none have been constructed at this time.\nAdditionally, the reintroduction program is in its infancy and has a long way to go before it can be declared a success. Plus extensive research needs to be done on contagious diseases in order to protect both the captive and wild giant panda populations."}

Unlike its more ruthless omnivorous North American cousin the brown/grizzly bear, and its more curious troublemaking cousin the black bear, the gentle panda is an extremely reclusive and solitary vegetarian (well, mostly vegetarian), spending about two-thirds of its day feeding on bamboo and the remainder of the day resting deep in the lush forests within the Minshan Mountains of the Sichuan province of China.\nHere are five more amazing characteristics of this fascinating, yet extremely endangered species.\n1. Who Needs to Sleep?\nPerhaps the better question is, do all bears hibernate? And in the case of the giant panda, the answer is decidedly no. Perhaps in answering this we should first consider whether or not the panda is in fact a member of the bear family as more popularly believed, or as more recently considered is it a closer relative to the raccoon? We\u2019ll let you research that one a bit further and let us know what you think.\n2. An opposable thumb?\nThat\u2019s right, something we share with this amazing creature is that the giant panda has an opposable thumb. Although this bony ligament is in fact not a true thumb, it nevertheless serves a much-needed service. The panda can press its false thumb against the pad of its palm to both grab and help tear the up to 20 different kinds of bamboo shoots that it needs to consume all day to survive.\n3. Don\u2019t call me lazy!\nAlthough the giant panda can come off as relatively \u2018sloth\u2019-like (sorry sloths!), the fact is that it can really get around. In fact, a panda can climb up to 4,000 meters (over 13,000 feet!) to feed on higher mountain slopes in the summer season. Umm, that\u2019s super high.\n4. I\u2019m all good right here.\nOk so maybe they\u2019re a bit lazy. Rather than spending a lot of time looking for the right place to lie down and rest or take a snooze, it seems that the giant panda will simply plop down wherever it\u2019s at and call it a day.\n5. Please help me!\nDid you know that there are only about 1,800 giant pandas left in this world? They are one of the most majestic yet most endangered creatures on Earth, mostly due to habitat destruction for crops, followed by poaching and a reduced variety of bamboo, it\u2019s staple diet. This is despite the government\u2019s effort to set aside needed nature reserves as sanctuaries for this precious creature.\nPandas have been around for two or three million years\u2014a lot longer than us\u2014yet it is completely up to us to make sure they stick around for more than another two to three decades. Scientists are working hard to grow the giant panda population to 5000 \u2013 6000 by 2025. If you want to learn more about this incredible creature, or even to be one of the very few Westerners to event witness the giant panda in the wild, then be sure to join us on a once in a lifetime trip to wild China with Nat Hab and WWF, where you may also have the chance to witness rare moon bears, golden monkeys, the shaggy takin and numerous exotic birds."}

The article highlighted findings from some of the first visits by western scientists to three important giant panda reserves (Tangjiahe, Wanglang and Fengtongzhai) and included descriptions of the physiography, flora and fauna, and conservation management of these areas.\n1984 \u2013 1989\nLing-Ling and Hsing-Hsing produced four more cubs during this time. One cub was stillborn in 1984. Twins were born in 1987 \u2015 one died quickly from a lack of oxygen and the other succumbed to an infection four days later. The last cub, born in 1989, died of pneumonia 23 hours after birth.\n1983 \u2013 1991\nIn addition to the five pregnancies, Ling-Ling also experienced many pseudopregnancies, when giant pandas\u2019 behavior and hormones mimic a pregnancy even if they are not pregnant.\n1992\nLing-Ling died Dec. 30, of heart failure; she was 23.\n1999\nHsing-Hsing, suffering from several debilitating, age-related diseases, including terminal kidney disease, was euthanized Nov. 28, 1999; he was 28.\n2000\nThe Zoo\u2019s second pair of giant pandas, Mei Xiang (may-SHONG) and Tian Tian (tee-YEN tee-YEN), arrived in Washington, D.C. Dec. 6. An agreement reached with the Chinese government stipulated the pair would live at the Zoo for 10 years in exchange for $10 million. Funds were raised from private donors, including Fujifilm and media partner Animal Planet.\n2001\nAs part of long-term capacity building, Smithsonian ecologists led the first training in the use of geographic information systems or GIS in wildlife management for 50 protected area staff at Wolong Nature Reserve in China.\nThe Smithsonian's pioneering first attempts to cryopreserve giant panda semen showed it is resilient to cold storage at subzero temperatures. Frozen samples from genetically valuable male pandas could now be shipped between breeding institutions for artificial insemination and \u201cbanked\u201d for use in the future.\n2003\nMei Xiang and Tian Tian attempted to natural breeding but were unsuccessful.\n2004\nScientists vaginally inseminated Mei Xiang with Tian Tian\u2019s sperm during a non-anesthesia procedure after attempts at natural breeding were unsuccessful. Mei Xiang experienced a pseudopregnancy.\n2005\nScientists and veterinarians artificially inseminated Mei Xiang March 11, after it was determined that no successful natural breeding occurred between the pandas during the previous 24 hours. Mei Xiang gave birth to the Zoo\u2019s first surviving giant panda cub, Tai Shan, July 9, at 3:41 a.m.\n2007\nScientists and veterinarians performed two artificial inseminations on Mei Xiang April 4 and 5. The procedures used semen collected from Gao Gao, the adult male at the San Diego Zoo. The procedures were unsuccessful and Mei Xiang experienced a pseudopregnancy.\n2008\nScientists and veterinarians performed an artificial insemination on Mei Xiang March 19, using fresh semen from Tian Tian. The procedures were unsuccessful, and it is believed that Mei Xiang experienced either a pseudopregnancy or the loss of a developing fetus.\n2009\nScientists artificially inseminated Mei Xiang Jan. 17, using a semen sample from Tian Tian. The procedures were unsuccessful and Mei Xiang expierenced a pseudopregnancy.\n2010\nScientists artificially inseminated Mei Xiang Jan. 9 and 10, using semen from Tian Tian. Mei Xiang experienced a pseudopregnancy.\nTai Shan, the only surviving giant panda cub born at the Zoo, left for Wolong Nature Reserve, China, Feb. 4, to participate in breeding research.\nBy 2010, Smithsonian scientists and veterinarians published more than 50 books, book chapters, and scientific articles on captive and wild giant panda populations in collaboration with more than 100 Chinese co-authors.\n2011\nDennis Kelly, director of the Smithsonian's National Zoo, and Zang Chunlin, secretary general of the China Wildlife Conservation Association, signed a new Giant Panda Cooperative Research and Breeding Agreement Jan. 20. The agreement stipulated that giant pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian would remain at the Zoo until Dec.15, 2015.\nMei Xiang and Tian Tian\u2019s attempts at natural breeding Jan. 29 were unsuccessful. Reproductive experts from China and the Smithsonian performed an artificial insemination with frozen semen collected from Tian Tian in 2005. A second artificial insemination was performed Jan. 30. Scientists confirmed that Mei Xiang experienced a pseudopregnancy July 21.\nThe Zoo announced David M. Rubenstein donated $4.5 million Dec. 19, to fund its giant panda program through the end of 2015. It also announced if Mei Xiang and Tian Tian failed to produce a cub in the 2012 breeding season, it was possible that both or one of the bears would return to China.\n2012\nA team of Smithsonian and Chinese scientists artificially inseminated Mei Xiang April 29 and 30, using semen from Tian Tian collected and frozen in 2005, after attempts at natural breeding were unsuccessful. Mei Xiang gave birth to a cub Sept. 16, at 10:46 p.m. The cub died Sept. 23. Necropsy results revealed that the cub was a female and had under-developed lungs, which resulted in liver damage.\nSmithsonian ecologists and Chinese partners published one of the first studies showing the potential impacts of climate change to giant panda habitat and providing recommendations for mitigation strategies.\n2013\nMei Xiang and Tian Tian attempted to mate March 29 but were unsuccessful. A team of Smithsonian scientists, veterinarians and Chinese colleagues performed two artificial inseminations on Mei Xiang March 30. The artificial inseminations used fresh semen and frozen semen from Tian Tian collected in 2003, and frozen semen collected in 2003 from the San Diego Zoo\u2019s panda Gao Gao. Mei Xiang gave birth to Bao Bao Aug. 23 at 5:32 p.m. Mei Xiang gave birth to a second stillborn cub 26 hours later. DNA analysis confirmed Bao Bao was sired by Tian Tian.\n2014\nAs of 2014, Smithsonian ecologists trained more than 1,000 protected area staff, wildlife professionals and students in ecology, wildlife survey techniques and geospatial technologies in support of applied conservation research and management in China.\n2015\nMei Xiang was artificially inseminated April 26 and 27. Both procedures used frozen semen from Hui Hui (hWEI-hWEI), a 10-year-old panda living in China, and fresh semen collected from Tian Tian. Veterinarians saw a fetus on an ultrasound Aug. 19. Mei Xiang gave birth to two male cubs Aug. 22, at 5:35 p.m. and 10:07 p.m. The smaller of the two cubs died Aug. 26. Zoo pathologists and veterinarians determined that complications associated with aspiration of food material into the cub\u2019s respiratory system resulted in the development of pneumonia.\nOn Sept. 25, 2015, in celebration of the state visit and as a special honor for the Zoo\u2019s cub, the First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, and the First Lady of the People's Republic of China, Peng Liyuan, named the cub Bei Bei (BAY-BAY) which means \u201cprecious, treasure\u201d in Chinese.\nDennis Kelly, director of the Smithsonian's National Zoo, and Li Qingwen, deputy secretary general of the China Wildlife and Conservation Association (CWCA), signed a new Giant Panda Cooperative Research and Breeding Agreement effective through Dec. 7, 2020. The agreement was announced Nov. 19, 2015.\nSmithsonian ecologists and Chinese partners published an article analyzing tracking data from giant pandas in the northern and western mountains, discovering distinct seasonal and daily movements between the groups, driven by differences in terrain, temperature, and bamboo nutrients. These behavioral differences are important considerations reintroducing giant pandas to the wild.\nSmithsonian ecologists and Chinese partners published an examination of how giant pandas impact other species that share bamboo forest. This study directly improved the conservation of other native wildlife.\n2016\nTian Tian slides in the snow during the infamous 2016 Washington, D.C. blizzard. The video capturing the moment was shared on January 23 across the Zoo\u2019s social media channels and viewed more than 93.7 million times.\n2017\nMei Xiang\u2019s second surviving cub, Bao Bao, departed for China on Feb. 21, 2017. The Zoo created a #ByeByeBaoBao celebration and special video as part of her farewell.\n2018\nSmithsonian ecologists and Chinese partners published an article demonstrating that by utilizing biological traits of bamboo in climate change models, the predicted impact was not as severe as what has been predicted by models using only climate.\nSmithsonian ecologists and Chinese partners published an article using giant panda data to advance selection of species distribution models, allowing for improved predictions of where species potentially could survive as climate changes.\n2019\nOn Feb. 23, 2019, the Zoo hosted a public housewarming celebration to open the new exhibit inside the panda house at the David M. Rubenstein Family Giant Panda Habitat. The interactive exhibit highlights the ecology, history, reproduction, conservation and care of giant pandas through a series of games and activities.\nMei Xiang\u2019s third surviving cub, Bei Bei, departed for China on Nov. 19, 2019. The Zoo created a #ByeByeBeiBei celebration and special video as part of his farewell.\nSmithsonian ecologists and Chinese partners published an article showing how reserves established for one endangered species can be effective in conserving other endemic endangered species.\nSmithsonian ecologists and international partners publish an article evaluating the potential for a large-scale bamboo flowering event in the Qinling and Minshan mountain ranges, which support the majority of wild giant pandas. Using scenario modeling the authors assess the risks and highlight measures to protect giant panda from severe population crashes.\n2020\nMei Xiang was artificially inseminated on March 22 using frozen semen from Tian Tian. Veterinarians saw fetal tissue on an ultrasound on Aug. 14 and Mei Xiang gave birth to a fourth surviving cub on Aug. 21, at 6:35 p.m. The cub is male. On Nov. 23, following a public vote, the cub was named Xiao Qi Ji (SHIAU-chi-ji) which means \u201cLittle Miracle\u201d in Mandarin Chinese.\nXiao Qi Ji\u2019s birth is the first outside of China from artificial insemination with frozen-thawed semen only and demonstrates the value and key role of systematic biobanking in species conservation. The semen used in 2020 to inseminate Mei Xiang was collected from Tian Tian and frozen in Feb. 2015.\nOn Dec. 7, 2020, the Zoo announced a three-year agreement extension that giant pandas will continue to live at the Zoo through the end of 2023. The three-year agreement extension signed by the Zoo and China Wildlife and Conservation Association. The terms of the agreement extension are similar to previous agreements. Cub Xiao Qi Ji Mei Xiang , and Tian Tian will go to China at the end of the three-year agreement extension.\nSmithsonian ecologists and Chinese partners published an article demonstrating how giant panda reserves have been very successful at conserving giant pandas but not large carnivores which have continued their decline over the same period giant panda populations have increased.\nThe Giant Panda National Park is officially established in China in 2020. Smithsonian ecologists and Chinese colleagues published an article on opportunities, challenges and management strategies for the park which incorporates 81existing protected areas and an additional ~6,000 km2 land previously unprotected.\nSmithsonian ecologists and Chinese partners publish an article based on giant panda movement inside Wolong Nature Reserve. Using GPS tracking, the authors analyze giant panda microhabitat selection and home range to develop strategies for improving habitat management, restoration, and corridor construction.\n2021\nOn Jan. 27, 2021, the Zoo provided a real-time, up-close look at giant panda cub Xiao Qi Ji during a livestream, broadcast simultaneously to the web, Facebook and YouTube.\nOn Jan. 31, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian were caught on the Zoo\u2019s Panda Cam sliding and somersaulting in the freshly fallen snow. A video capturing the snow day frolic has been viewed more than 22 million times on the Zoo\u2019s social media channels.\nTo date, Smithsonian ecologists have trained more than 1,500 protected area staff, wildlife professionals, and students in ecology, wildlife survey techniques, and geospatial technologies to support applied conservation research and management.\nTo date, Smithsonian scientists and veterinarians have collaborated with more than 150 Chinese partners to produce over 115 books, book chapters, and scientific articles on wild giant pandas, associated wildlife, their habitats, as well as husbandry, veterinary care, and reproductive research on giant pandas in human care.\nSmithsonian ecologists and Chinese partners published an article using population densities of giant pandas in five nature reserves in the Qinling Mountains to identify potential dispersal routes and areas posing risks for depleting giant panda populations to inform decision makers and protected area design strategies.\n2022\nOn Jan. 3, the Zoo shared a video of panda cub, Xiao Qi Ji, enjoying the first snow of the year in Washington, D.C. The 16-month-old cub plowed face-first into the fresh powder, belly-slid down a snow-covered hill and rolled around Mei Xiang."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Panda Fact Sheet | Blog | Nature | PBS", "url": "https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/blog/panda-fact-sheet/", "text": "Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca): A bear native to south-central China. It is considered a national treasure to China and is protected by law in its bamboo forest home.\nAKA: panda bear or panda\n| Animalia| Chordata| Mammalia| Carnivora| Ursidae| Ailuropoda| melanoleuca\nScientists long debated whether pandas are a type of bear, raccoon, or something all their own. Through studying their DNA, scientists have confirmed that pandas are related to bears. Giant pandas are similar to other bears in their general looks, the way they walk and climb, their skull characteristics, their social system and their reproductive biology, according to the San Diego Zoo.\nSize and Weight:\nA newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter, about 3 to 5 ounces, which is about 1/900th the size of its mother. Female pandas can grow to be about 200 pounds, while males can grow to be about 300 pounds as adults. Adults can grow to be more than four feet tall.\nAppearance:\nPandas are well-known for their round bodies and the large, black patches around their eyes. They are known for their black and white coloring. Each panda\u2019s markings are unique and differ slightly from any other panda. Scientists are not sure the reasoning behind their coloring but suspect it has to do with camouflage or for finding a mate. Not all pandas are black and white, there is also a rare brown and white variation of the giant panda.\nDiet:\nA panda\u2019s diet is almost entirely bamboo. They eat the leaves, stems and shoots of various bamboo species. Because bamboo contains very little nutritional value, they must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending on what part of the bamboo they are eating. They spend at least 12 hours each day eating bamboo.\nPandas branch out from time to time, with about 1% of their diet comprising of other plants \u2013 and even meat. If they branch out, they are known to eat grasses, bulbs, fruits, some insects, and even rodents and carrion.\nHabitat:\nPandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China.\nGeography:\nChina\u2019s Yangtze Basin region holds the panda\u2019s primary habitat.\nBreeding:\nPandas spend most of the day eating and sleeping like other bears. Wild pandas are solitary creatures and are protective of their space. Their territorial behavior is due to their reliance on large amounts of bamboo for their survival. If two pandas happen to cross paths, they\u2019ll typically growl, swat, lunge at each other and possibly bite each other. The only exception for this behavior is the very brief mating season and the mothers with cubs.\nPandas have a slow reproductive rate. Mature females usually breed just once every two or three years, and a typical female panda may bear about five litters in her lifetime. The average pregnancy of female pandas is about 135 days, but the true gestation of the fetus only takes about 50 days. The female will give birth to one or two cubs, which weigh only three to five ounces at birth. The mother will nurse the cubs until they\u2019re 18 months old. At which time, she will send them out into the wild so she can prepare for the next litter. Females reach sexual maturity between four and five years old, where males reach it around six to seven years old.\nLifespan:\nPandas can live 14 to 20 years in the wild and up to 30 years in managed care.\nThreats:\nHabitat loss and hunting are the largest threats to pandas. Infrastructure development is increasingly fragmenting and isolating panda populations, preventing pandas from finding new bamboo forests and potential mates. While the Chinese government has established more than 50 panda reserves, only 67% of wild pandas live in these reserves, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).\nHunting is another threat to pandas. While poaching has declined in recent years, largely due to the enactment of the Wildlife Protection Act in 1988, pandas may accidentally get caught in snares.\nLow reproduction rates and bamboo shortages are among other threats to panda populations.\nPandas have few natural predators, fewer now than they did historically. Tigers are generally not found in what remains of panda habitat, and leopards are found in reduced numbers.\nConservation Status:\nPandas are classified as vulnerable. There are approximately 1,864 in the wild, according to WWF.\nConservation Efforts:\nIn China, panda protection efforts began in 1957. In 1989, the Chinese Ministry of Forestry and WWF formulated a management plan for the giant panda and its habitat. It called for reducing human activities in panda habitat, managing bamboo habitat, extending the panda reserve system and maintaining captive populations of pandas.\nWWF continues to work with the Chinese government\u2019s National Conservation Program to conserve the giant panda. As a result of the program, panda reserves now cover more than 3.8 million acres of forest. China has also set up 65 panda reserves that protect panda habitats from further development.\nChina continues to make strides to protect the panda and its habitat. The government has enacted policies, such as the \u201cGrain-to-Green\u201d program, that have helped the nation gain forestland. However, it is still unclear if this newly forested land is suitable for pandas.\nThe San Diego Zoo is another organization that works to conserve pandas. In the 1990s, scientists doubted whether they could save pandas from extinction. There was not much research on their behavior in the wild, and they did not reproduce well in zoos. San Diego Zoo Global partnered with Chinese colleagues to create a conservation strategy. They developed early-detection pregnancy tests and milk formula for panda cubs, which raised survival rates from zero to a hundred percent. By 2010, there were 300 pandas in zoos worldwide and breeding centers in China. Researchers believe this milestone number will ensure a self-sustaining population.\nHow You Can Help:\nAdopt a panda: Make a symbolic panda adoption to support WWF\u2019s conservation efforts.\nSupport: Conservation groups like the San Diego Zoo Global Wildlife Conservancy can use your help in their efforts.\nSource: WWF and the San Diego Zoo"}

(Must Read)", "url": "https://bestofpanda.com/how-many-giant-pandas-are-there-in-the-world/", "text": "A few years ago, it was as though the giant pandas would go extinct. Fortunately, there have been positive changes to the panda\u2019s population. Come to think of it, how many giant pandas are there in the world today?\nThere are over 2,400 pandas both in the wild and in captivity, according to a survey of the giant panda population. Without efforts from the Chinese government, the pandas\u2019 population would have been reduced reasonably.\nStill, the Chinese authority is not backing off in ensuring the giant pandas and their habitats are well protected.\nNow, you know that there are over 2,400 giant pandas in the wild and in captivity. This is great! But you may be thinking, out of 2,400 pandas, how many pandas are actually in the wild?\nSit down, relax and prepare to learn something new in this article!\nHow Many Pandas Are In the Wild?\nAs of now, there are over 1,800 pandas in the wild, which means these animals are no longer an endangered species. There was a time when the panda population was at risk of becoming non-existent. They were constantly attacked by man through killing and deforestation.\nSince the pandas feed majorly on bamboo, they also suffered starvation when people destroyed their habitats for farming and building purposes.\nThe pandas, that did not suffer directly from man, died of starvation. This was one of the reasons the panda population became lesser in past years.\nHowever, the Chinese government came up with a solution. They restored the bamboo forest; to save them from starvation. In addition, the Chinese authority made strict laws to prevent hunting the pandas illegally.\nBreeding and research centers were also set up to help the pandas reproduce and their habitats were also increased. Although it took a lot of years for the Chinese government to achieve its aim, their effort did not go to waste.\nNow, the giant pandas in the wild can live their lives in safety. Hopefully, in the coming years, their population will likely increase.\nHow Many Pandas Are In Captivity?\nPresently, in captivity across the world, there are more than 600 giant pandas. China\u2019s amazing conservation program and breeding centers made this possible. In 2020, 44 baby pandas were born and properly taken care of and monitored.\nWith the improvement in technology, panda breeding has become easier and more effective. It was almost impossible for baby pandas to survive after birth a long time ago. At birth, the baby pandas are always tiny and blind, making them helpless and at risk of dying.\nBut now, lots of panda cubs have did not die young and others will still survive due to the advanced technology in breeding centers.\nHow Many Giant Pandas Are In the US?\nAs of 2013, there were over 12 pandas in zoos across the US.\nCurrently, only four zoos have giant pandas in the United States. These facilities help pandas reproduce by their breeding programs, which sometimes work and other times, don\u2019t work. Pandas cubs are really weak and helpless at birth, and helping them to survive is great work.\nDeciding on the number of giant pandas in the US may not be accurate. Since the panda bears are loaned from China, they\u2019ll have to be returned when the loan agreement expires. Keep in mind that all giant pandas in the world come from\nTo see giant pandas in the US, visit Zoo Atlanta in Atlanta, National Zoo in Washington DC, Diego Zoo in San Diego, and Memphis Zoo in Memphis.\nHow Many Giant Pandas Are In China?\nRecent statistics show that there are 1,800 giant pandas in the wild, mostly in the Sichuan Province in China. Also, around 600 giant pandas live in captivity in China.\nChina can be described as the \u201chome of the giant pandas\u201d because all the panda bears you see across the world come from there.\nThey loan these panda bears to other parts of the world, making it impossible to determine the number of these creatures in captivity. Some of them may have given birth, while others may have died.\nIf you want to see giant pandas while in China, visit the popular Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Center, Ocean Park in Hong Kong, and other Zoos.\nHow Many Giant Pandas Are In India?\nCurrently, there are no giant pandas in India, only red pandas can be found there. I know it sounds surprising but it is true. Note that while giant pandas and red pandas share certain similarities, they are not the same.\nWhile the Chinese government is actively protecting the lives of the giant pandas, the Indian government is also preventing the red pandas from extinction.\nHow Many Giant Pandas Are In Japan?\nAs of 2008, there were 8 giant pandas in Japan. Now, we can\u2019t figure out the number of pandas in the country because they are all on loan from China. And the facilities will, at a point, return the pandas to where they loaned them from.\nOnly one giant panda, Lin Lin, was given to Japan from China as a symbol of friendship in 1992. Unfortunately, Lin Lin died at the age of 22, which means there is no free panda in Japan again.\nBut Japanese love and adore giant pandas. Believe me, pandas are naturally lovable and cute, despite their clumsy, solitary, and lazy nature. Maybe that\u2019s why they have a place in the heart of the Japanese.\nFAQ\nHow Many Giant Pandas Are Left in 2021?\nThere are 1,800 giant pandas in the wild and over 600 pandas in captivity. China\u2019s continual effort to ensure the animals remain safe is a priceless action. Still, the Chinese government is working on increasing the pandas\u2019 habitats and restoring the bamboo forests that have been destroyed.\nDespite the efforts from the Chinese government, the pandas are not completely safe from the danger of deforestation due to climate change. However, there is a high chance that the panda population will continue to increase and remain safe in the coming years.\nHow Many Red Pandas Are Left in 2021?\nThere are less than 10,000 red pandas in the world presently. Same as the giant pandas, the red pandas\u2019 population is faced with threats in their habitat.\nAnimals like leopards, eagles, yellow-throated cats, and others prey on the red panda cubs.\nTheir habitat was constantly destroyed by deforestation, farming, road construction, and more. There\u2019s also the issue of hunting by humans. Let\u2019s say, humans were the main predators of the adult red pandas.\nAll these factors contribute to the reduction in the number of red pandas.\nBut the Indian and Chinese governments have continued to do everything possible to protect the lives of these creatures.\nWhy Are Giant Pandas Endangered?\nOne major reason the giant pandas were considered as being endangered is the loss of habitat. As the number of people in China was increasing, there was a need for more houses to accommodate inhabitants. This led to the destruction of the pandas\u2019 habitat, thereby leading to a decrease in their main diet \u2013 bamboo.\nSometimes, the pandas are left with nothing to eat and their habitat becomes too small to house them. During those periods, a lot of them couldn\u2019t survive the constant attacks.\nLuckily, the Chinese government planted more bamboo, thereby creating more habitats for the pandas. Moreover, they set up laws against giant pandas\u2019 illegal hunting. Whatever happens, the giant pandas must continue to in the world!\nSo far, all measures put in place have produced a positive result. Now, the giant pandas are no longer at risk of going into extinction soon.\nConclusion\nNow, we\u2019ve come to the end of this article. Take a look at what we\u2019ve discussed before leaving.\nWe said there are 1,800 giant pandas in the wild as of now and over 600 of them in captivity. Also, we mentioned that keeping the exact figure of pandas in the US, and Japan may not be accurate \u2013 the giant pandas have to be returned to China at an appointed time.\nDon\u2019t forget, there are no giant pandas in India but they have red pandas. And keep in mind that there are less than 10,000 red pandas on earth presently.\nFinally, the panda population was formally an endangered species majorly because of habitat loss.\nDo you wish to learn more about the interesting life of pandas?

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant Panda Cub FAQs | Smithsonian's National Zoo", "url": "https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/giant-panda-cub-faqs", "text": "Bears in the wild, including giant pandas, give birth in small dens. In China's Wolong Reserve, pandas make their dens in large hollow conifer trees, with a diameter of about 3 feet. Where there aren't any trees, pandas den in caves with a little bedding of twigs. They stay in these dens for about the cub's first 100 days.\nZoo keepers strive to recreate these surroundings for Mei Xiang. She always has access to her larger enclosures, though for the first few months of a cub's life she will spend the vast majority of her time in the den. She will occasionally venture out to eat, drink, urinate and defecate. Those trips will become increasingly longer as a cub grows.\nIn January of 2013, in anticipation of the breeding season, keepers rearranged Mei Xiang's den, including shifting the angle of the bars, so that keepers would have more direct access to Mei Xiang and her cub while they are resting in the nest area. The old bars were recycled, making the renovations not only a little greener, but also a little less overwhelming for Mei Xiang. It was as if the \"furniture\" was simply rearranged one day."}

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Red Panda images!\nRed Panda Classification and Evolution\nThe Red Panda is a cat-sized species of carnivorous mammal that is found inhabiting the temperate mountain forests on the slopes of the Himalayas. As their name suggests, they are related to the larger and more famous Giant Panda (although the exact closeness of their connection still remains uncertain to science), along with also sharing a number of characteristics with the Raccoon and so Red Pandas are classified in a family of their own. The Red Panda is also known by a number of different names in their native regions including the Lesser Panda, the Red Cat-Bear and as the Fire Fox in Nepal. Like their much larger cousin, the Red Panda is an animal that relies on bamboo to feed and with rapid deforestation of these unique areas there is less and less for these animals to eat, which has ultimately led to the Red Panda being listed as being an endangered species.\nRed Panda Anatomy and Appearance\nThe Red Panda is a very cute animal that is about the same size as a large housecat, with a cat-like face and a long, bushy tail. Their rusty coloured thick fur covers their body with the exception of their almost white coloured ears, cheeks, muzzle and spots above their eyes. The Red Panda also has reddish brown stripes that run down either side of their white muzzle, along with alternating light and dark rings on their tails. The Red Panda also has semi-retractable claws to aid climbing and stability amongst the branches and strong, tough jaws which they use to chew on bamboo. Like the Giant Panda, the Red Panda also has an extended wrist bone which acts a bit like a thumb, allowing them to hold onto bamboo whilst they are chewing it. The Red Panda also has dense fur which helps to keep it warm during the cold winter along with having thick and woolly fur on the soles of their feet which not only helps to keep their feet warm but also prevents them from slipping on the wet branches.\nRed Panda Distribution and Habitat\nThe Red Panda is found inhabiting the temperate forests in the Himalayas at altitudes of between 1,800 and 4,000 meters. These high mountain slopes tend to be covered in deciduous hardwood forest with a bamboo under-storey that is crucial to the Red Panda\u2019s survival. Their historical range extended through Bhutan, Nepal, India, Myanmar and China where their range overlaps that of the even rarer Giant Panda, but today the Red Panda is extinct from certain areas and population numbers are rapidly declining in others. Due to the fragile ecology of their native, mountain forests and their reliance on eating bamboo, the Red Panda is being pushed into smaller and more isolated pockets of their once wide range with other factors including climate change affecting the lack of abundance of bamboo.\nRed Panda Behaviour and Lifestyle\nThe Red Panda is a nocturnal and generally solitary animal with the exception of males and females coming together to mate during the breeding season. Red Pandas spend the daylight hours sleeping in the branches high in the tree canopy with their long, bushy tail wrapped around them to keep them warm. Although they are known to feed in the trees, they usually come down to the ground after dusk to begin foraging in the safety of the darkness. The Red Panda is a territorial animal that marks its patch with droppings, urine and releasing a musky secretion from its anal glands. They are also known to communicate between one another using short whistles and squeaks. The Red Panda is a strong and agile climber that not only sleeps safely in the branches during the day but also can dart up a trunk if threatened by predators aided by its sharp claws.\nRed Panda Reproduction and Life Cycles\nRed Pandas usually breed between January and March and after a gestation period that lasts for around four months, the female gives birth to 1 \u2013 5 cubs that are born blind and although they begin to open their eyes within a couple of weeks, the eyes of the Red Panda cubs don\u2019t fully open until they are about a month old. Before her cubs are born, the female Red Panda builds a nest in a tree-hole, roots or bamboo thicket which is lined with leaves, moss and other soft plant material. Red Panda cubs may not leave the nest until they are three months old and are strong enough to negotiate the tricky branches. They feed solely on bamboo until they are old enough to stomach other foods and reach their full adult size after about a year. There is however a high mortality rate in young Red Pandas with up to 80% not reaching full adulthood.\nRed Panda Diet and Prey\nAlthough the Red Panda belongs to the carnivorous group of mammals, their diet is almost vegetarian as bamboo shoots comprise the majority of their food. However, as the Red Panda is a mammal it has a short digestive system meaning that although bamboo holds little nutrition anyway, they are unable to get the most of their meals. Unlike the Giant Panda though, the Red Panda will also eat a variety of other foods to supplement its diet like acorns, berries and grasses, along with grubs, mice, lizards, chicks and birds\u2019 eggs. Along with its excellent sight, smell and hearing the Red Panda also has long, white whiskers on its snout which help it to navigate through the dense vegetation in the darkness of night, when it is most actively foraging for food. For a complete list of foods red pandas eat, check out out \u201cWhat Do Pandas Eat?\u201d page.\nRed Panda Predators and Threats\nDue to the fact that Red Pandas inhabit high-altitude mountain forests, they actually have fewer natural predators than they would have living further down the slopes. Snow Leopards and Martens are the only real predators of the Red Panda along with Birds of Prey and small carnivores that prey on the smaller and more vulnerable cubs. The biggest threat to the Red Panda however is people who have affected this species mainly through deforestation of their incredibly unique habitats. Due to Human encroachment, illegal hunting and poaching there have been drastic declines in the Red Panda population numbers with these populations also being pushed into more separate, isolated areas. One of the main concerns with this is that these populations will although be threatened by inbreeding leading to less successful individuals in these areas.\nRed Panda Interesting Facts and Features\nLiving high in the cold mountain climates means that Red Pandas are well adapted to keeping warm with their dense fur and blanket-like tail. However, on really cold days Red Pandas have been known to sunbathe high in the canopy to warm themselves up whilst sleeping during the day. A study conducted in 2001 found that 79% of the Red Pandas reported where found within 100 meters of the nearest body of water, indicating that a good water source may also to be crucial to their already strict habitat requirements. Evidence also suggests that Red Panda reproduction rates have been declining which is believed to be related to the decline in the foods that they eat in order to survive and reproduce successfully.\nRed Panda Relationship with Humans\nRed Pandas have been admired by people for years but many of the experiences that we have with them are in zoos and animal institutions as these rare and secretive animals can be incredibly hard to spot in the wild. This is however one of the factors in their demise as one Indian village reported that 47 Red Pandas were captured and sold to zoos around the world in just one year. Human interference of their unique and specialised habitats though is believed to be the biggest reason for the decline in Red Panda numbers throughout the Himalayas with deforestation mainly in the form of logging being one of the primary culprits. As with the Giant Panda, the Red Panda relies heavily on high-altitude bamboo thickets to survive and without them it has no-where else to go.\nRed Panda Conservation Status and Life Today\nToday, the Red Panda is listed on the IUCN Red List as being an animal species that is Endangered in its natural environment and is therefore severely threatened by extinction in the near future. There are estimated to be less than 3,000 Red Pandas remaining in the wild with the majority of these inhabiting small protected zones within national parks. A number of captive breeding programs have also been established in Asia, Europe and North America and appear to be having relative success in their work.\nView all 71 animals that start with R"}

The giant panda can weigh from 165 to 330 lb. The head and body of the panda is mainly white with the exception of its ears, eye patches, nose, shoulders, arms, and legs. The giant pandas eyes are very small and its vision is poor. Enlarged bones in its wrists allow it to grip bamboo stems. They have very strong jaws and large molar teeth that are used to crush the tough bamboo stems. Pandas are very good climbers and use their skill to escape predators. They are also able to move quickly and silently allowing them to evade predators through tunnels of bamboo.\nGiant pandas eat mostly bamboo leaves and shoots. But they can also eat fruit and berries, fungi, grass, and even small mammals, birds and fish. Pandas live alone most of their lives, only coming together when it is time to mate. Females give birth to cubs that are hairless and blind and weigh only 100g. Cubs depend on their mothers for about 18 months, and then it is time to find and establish its own territory. They use their scent glands beneath their tails for marking territory.\nThe giant panda is only found in central and western China, and only 1000 to 2000 remain in the wild. Causes of their decline include destruction of habitat and poaching. And the panda is heavily dependent upon its main food source, bamboo, which is becoming rare in its habitat. In an effort to save this species, the World Wildlife Fund and the Chinese Ministry of Forestry have developed a conservation management plan outlining 14 new panda reserves and five corridors connecting patches of panda habitat. This species is also legally protected to prevent poaching.\nWikipedia Article\nWikipedia Article\nCopyright Notice: This article is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License.

Besides the nominate subspecies, it is the first giant panda subspecies to be recognized.\nCharacteristics [ edit ]\nIt differs from the more familiar nominate subspecies by its smaller skull and dark brown and light brown (rather than black and white) fur, and its smaller overall size. Its eye spots are under the lower lid, instead of around the eyes. Brown pandas are very rare.\nDistribution and habitat [ edit ]\nThis subspecies is restricted to the Qinling Mountains, at elevations of 1,300\u20133,000 metres (4,300\u20139,800 ft). Its coloration is possibly a consequence of inbreeding: as the population is closed off from genetic variation and this might have led to the preservation of the mutation responsible.\nConservation and threats [ edit ]\nThere were an estimated 100 Qinling pandas living in the wild as of 2001.\nOn August 30, 1989, a female of this species was captured and brought to the Xi'an Zoo to be mated with a regular giant panda. This panda's offspring was black-and-white, but reportedly started becoming brownish as it aged. According to other reports she gave birth to three cubs, all of whom died shortly after being born. The mother, named Dan-Dan, died in 2000.\nDue to the Qinling subspecies being restricted in range, it has been exposed to metal toxicants such as copper, nickel, lead, and zinc that are now present in bamboo and soil as a result of the environmental pollution that is ongoing in China. More specifically, studies have indicated that the Qinling subspecies faces such anthropogenic threats so directly due to the fact that heavy concentrations of metals in bamboo and soil are positively correlated with high elevations, thus the Qinling Mountain Range is increasingly affected. Therefore, the conservation of the Qinling pandas may be compromised in the future due to air pollution in China.\nDental health is important for the survival of the Qinling Pandas. These pandas have a survival rate of 5-20 years. The most common dental abnormalities that Qinling Pandas face are dental attrition and fractures. These two abnormalities can impact the survival rate of these pandas.\nReferences [ edit ]\nData related to Ailuropoda melanoleuca qinlingensis at Wikispecies"}

Pandas are probably the cutest bears in the world, but how much do you really know about these tubby teddies? Do they really eat only bamboo and are all pandas black and white? Read on to discover fascinating and funny panda facts about the world\u2019s favourite bears, including what\u2019s so special about their \u201cthumbs\u201d and why they do handstands.\n1 It\u2019s a fact: We love cute pandas!\nThey\u2019re gorgeous balls of fur but sit around all day and can be a little boring! So, why do most people find these beasts so adorable? Scientists believe it\u2019s because they look like human babies with big, round heads and soft, roly-poly bodies. They also need a lot of help to survive, so we want to mother each and every cute panda.\n50% Off Your First Box! Craft ideas newsletter\n2 There is more than one type of panda\nThe famous black and white bears from China are giant pandas. Yet there\u2019s another cute panda that deserves your love: The red panda is about the size of a cat and lives in the high Eastern Himalaya mountains. It has red-brown fur and a long, shaggy tail, so it looks a bit like a teddy dressed up as a squirrel. Like the giant panda, it eats bamboo and waddles.\n3 Giant and red pandas are not cousins\nAlthough they\u2019re both furry cuties, they are not part of the same animal family. The giant panda belongs to the Ursidae group and the red panda has its own unique family, called Ailuridae. The red panda is the only real panda! The giant panda was discovered later and is in fact a bear. But because both animals have similar faces and love bamboo, they were both called panda.\n4 Baby pandas look like a big baked bean\nPandas are born looking like naked, pink slugs and weigh just 100 grams. These baby bears are blind and completely helpless! After 2 weeks they start growing hair and their eyes open at 3 weeks. At 3 months old they start walking, and at 6 months they can eat bamboo and play. The bears are fully-grown when they are 2 years old.\n5 The panda diet is rather dull\nIf these bears ate at restaurants the menu would be very boring: Bamboo, bamboo, and more bamboo! The average giant panda eats around 9 - 20 kilograms of bamboo shoots and leaves a day and spends 10 - 16 hours eating. Very occasionally, it treats itself to a small rodent for pudding. Red pandas also snack on fruit, insects, and bird eggs. Bamboo splinters can\u2019t hurt pandas because they have a special armour in their windpipe and stomach to protect them.\n6 Pandas sound like a farm animal\nThey are usually rather quiet, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t speak when they want to. Pandas bleat a bit like sheep and can also squeak, growl, and bark. You can listen to different panda voices here. What could they be saying?\n7 They\u2019re not that lazy!\nThey might look like they lounge around all day munching bamboo, but pandas are also excellent climbers. Cubs clamber up trees when they\u2019re just six months old. They can also swim (but they can\u2019t do Kung Fu like in the movies). Other bears hibernate during the cold months, but not pandas. So, they\u2019re not as lazy as you might think!\n8 Giant pandas can wee upside down!\nThey can\u2019t build fences around their homes like we do, so pandas wee to mark the boundary of their territory. They have a cute panda habit: They climb a tree backwards, moving their hind legs up until they\u2019re doing a handstand! This lets them wee higher up so that the scent spreads further. Don\u2019t try this at home!\n9 Their eyes are different to normal bears\nGiant pandas have cat-like eyes, which is very unusual for a bear! Instead of round pupils, they have vertical slits, just like felines, which let them see better at night. They are short-sighted, so would need glasses if they ever had to read a book.\n10 They have special hands\nIf you watch a video of pandas eating, you\u2019ll see that they hold their food with what looks like a thumb. This isn\u2019t actually a thumb but an extra-long wrist bone that sits opposite their five fingers. This bone allows their paws to work more like hands, gripping and expertly manoeuvring delicate bamboo stalks.\n11 They don\u2019t make good pets\nNo! An adult panda can weigh more than 150 kilograms and can be 1.5 meters long from top to bottom. Imagine a teddy that\u2019s nearly as long as your bed and weighs as much as three 13-year-old boys! Also, they bite and can poo 40 times a day. Imagine the cleaning up! It\u2019s a much better idea to watch them here in China on this live cam.\n12 Pandas are endangered\nAlthough giant pandas have no predators and are adored by humans, they\u2019re still not safe from us and the species has been declared vulnerable. Today, there are only around 1,800 giant pandas left in the wild. As the human population grows, the panda habitat is destroyed. The red panda is critically endangered, so it\u2019s even more at risk of extinction.\nLet\u2019s help these adorable bears by preserving their wild world! If we don\u2019t, they will only exist in zoos. The Chinese government has re-created vital panda habitats where farming fields have been left to grow back as forest. There are now 13 panda nature reserves.\nCelebrate pandas and do treat yourself to a healthy snack with these \u201cbeary\u201d tasty sandwiches!\nNot tried toucanBox yet?\nEach toucanBox is also personalised with your child\u2019s name, so they will be so excited when something addressed to them personally comes through the letterbox!\nSign up today and save 50% on your first box!\nNot ready to commit?

The definition of poaching differs as you ask different people. Some say it means to capture a panda but others say it means killing. In the end it leads to the same thing happening, killing a panda. The main reason why people poach a panda is for its skin. Since pandas are such rare animals their skin is treasured and can be sold for a lot of money. A panda skin was sold for $65,000 once! In addition to this, it isn\u2019t too hard to capture a panda from the wild. Groups of around 6-10 people go out into the wild and when they find a panda they have some heavy duty material in between two sticks of bamboo and put the panda onto the material and carry it to their car then drive off with it.\nhttp://nastyish.com/\nhttp://advocacy.britannica.com/"}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "5 Facts About Red Pandas in Honor of International Red Panda Day", "url": "http://www.vetstreet.com/our-pet-experts/5-facts-you-dont-know-about-red-pandas", "text": "Thinkstock\nSeptember 20 is International Red Panda Day. To celebrate, we spoke to Nicki Boyd, behavior husbandry manager at the San Diego Zoo and chair of the board of Red Panda Network, about how cool these animals are and how the organization works to conserve them.\nHere are five facts we bet you didn't know about these fascinating creatures.\n1. Red PandasWere the First Pandas\nWhen you hear \"panda,\" everyone tends to think of that big black and white bear, but the red panda had the name first. \"They were discovered first, about 50 years before the giant panda,\" Boyd says.\nPanda is probably derived from a Nepalese word meaning \"eater of bamboo,\" but because red pandas range over many countries in Asia, they also have many local names. One nickname may be familiar if you use a certain Web browser: That little animal in the logo for Firefox is a red panda. \"It's one native name for them, because of the coloration and the big bushy tail,\" Boyd says. Another name is \"wah,\" in imitation of one of the sounds they make.\n2. Red Pandas Are Bamboo-eating Carnivores\nAlthough they share a name, red pandas and giant pandas are not closely related. The classifications of both species have changed as scientists have studied them, but now giant pandas are placed in the bear family and red pandas are in their own family, which is more closely related to raccoons, coatis and kinkajous.\nBut the two pandas have some interesting similarities because they've evolved to suit the same lifestyle \u2014 what naturalists call convergent evolution. Both are classified as carnivores, so their closest relatives are meat eaters, yet both live mainly on bamboo. \"Both have a false thumb that allows them to grip and hold the bamboo,\" Boyd says. It's called a false thumb because it evolved from a bone in the wrist; it's not the same structure as the thumb on creatures who have five digits. (Both pandas have five fingers, plus that extra bone.)\n3. Red PandasHave Fascinating Feet and Awesome Voices\nThe climate red pandas live in is cold, so even the bottoms of their feet are covered with the thick fur that insulates their bodies. They also spend a lot of time in trees, so they've got special adaptations for climbing.\"They have semi-retractable claws that are super-sharp \u2014 they're almost catlike in the way that their claws work,\" Boyd says. \"And when they want to climb down, they can rotate their rear feet to grip the tree as they head straight down.\"\nThey also have a variety of interesting vocalizations. \"They have a chittering that sounds like a bird chirping. And if they're cornered, they let out the loudest sound, called a huff-quack \u2014 it sounds like a big bear is in the room. It scares the daylights out of you,\" she says, \"and then you think, Whoa, that came out of that little animal there?\""}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "What Is The Size of A Giant Panda? (Explained) - BestofPanda", "url": "https://bestofpanda.com/what-is-the-size-of-a-giant-panda/", "text": "It seems like I want to cuddle a giant panda now. These lazy bunch, yet charismatic bears capture the heart of many, because of their huggable size. But, do you have any idea what the average size of a giant panda is?\nThe average body length of adult giant pandas is about 3 to 6 feet and roughly 180 to 265 lbs body mass. So, what are your thoughts on the average size of a giant panda? I think you already picture in your mind how big they really are, right?\nThis article features how big can a giant panda get, how tall is a giant panda, how the size of a male giant panda differs from the size of a female panda, and what is the size of a baby panda. Looks pretty interesting?\nJust continue reading and find out more about these lovable animals.\nHow Big Can A Giant Panda Get?\nWell, an adult panda can actually grow up to 3 feet at the shoulder, 5 feet from nose to rump, and a 10-15 centimeters (less than a foot) tail. They weigh up to 275 pounds, male pandas are 10% larger and 20% heavier compared to female pandas.\nThinking about why they get big like this? Well, giant pandas are always hungry when they eat. Yes, they are impossible to satisfy.\nAlmost or should I say 99% of their daily diet is bamboo shoots and leaves. Although they eat so fast, they still spend 12-16 hours a day consuming approximately 28 pounds of bamboo (using their enlarged wrist bone) to satisfy their tummies.\nThis is because bamboo is not that nutritious. So, they need to eat a lot for them to stay healthy. Due to this, pandas defecate 40 times every day. Fun fact, right?\nHow Tall Is A Giant Panda?\nNormally, a panda is 2 to 3 feet tall when on all four legs and roughly 4 to 6 feet long. Meaning to say, even the tallest pandas when stood on their two legs will still look shorter next to the tallest humans. Is it surprising?\nHave you seen a zoo keeper sitting or standing next to a giant panda in a zoo? I know you will agree with me if I say that their difference in size is very noticeable.\nGiant Panda Size vs Human Size\nPhoto Source: Dimensions\nThe average giant panda size in terms of height is around 3\u2032 11\u2033 to 6\u2032 3\u2033, while the average human size is around 5\u2032 5\u2033 (female) to 5\u2032 7\u2033 (male). So we can say that in terms of height, humans are way taller than giant pandas, but not in every way.\nOn the other hand, the average size of a giant panda in terms of weight is around 180 to 275 pounds, while the average human weight is around 114 to 153 pounds. Hence, it proves that giant pandas are heavier than humans in almost every way.\nSize Difference of a Male vs Female Pandas\nMen on average are bigger and taller than females. This is a typical characteristic among mammals or in almost all of our domesticated animal species. Same goes for our pandas. Male and female pandas differ in size.\nWhat Is The Size Of A Male Giant Panda?\nMale giant pandas are a little longer than females, and are heavier like 10 to 20 percent. They also have stronger forelegs than females. Their length is about 6 feet (1.8 m). In terms of weight, male pandas are about 190 to 275 pounds (85 to 125 kilograms).\nWhat Is The Size Of A Female Giant Panda?\nOther Size Comparison: Panda Bear vs. Grizzly Bear vs. Polar Bear\nI think it would be a great idea to compare the size of panda bears, grizzly bears and polar bears. The three are truly captivating species of bear. So, which do you think is heavier among the three?\nYou learned from the above information, the biggest male pandas are no more than 330 pounds. Well, male grizzlies can grow to be over 3 times that size! Is it surprising? How about grizzlies\u2019 close cousins, the polar bears? Which one do you think is bigger?\nIt is actually interesting, because grizzlies and polar bears are almost of the same size and weight. Let\u2019s see if you guess it right.\nBody Mass Comparison: Panda Bear vs Grizzly Bear vs Polar Bear\nOn average, adult male grizzlies weigh 395 to 795 pounds, while male adult polar bears weigh 772 to 1543 pounds. This says that male polar bears are reasonably bigger than the male grizzlies.\nMeanwhile, if we compare the weight of female polar bears and female grizzly bears, there will be no significant difference between the two. However, female polar bears are still a little bigger than female grizzly bears.\nAdult female grizzly bears weigh approximately 287 to 397 pounds. On the other hand, the weight of female polar bears is about 331 to 551 pounds. But, overall female pandas are still the least in terms of weight, weighing 180 to 220 pounds on average.\nPanda Bear Grizzly Bear Polar Bear Male 220-270 lbs. 395-795 lbs. 772-1543 lbs. Female 180-220 lbs. 287-397 lbs. 331-551 lbs.\nBody Length Comparison: Panda Bear vs. Grizzly Bear vs. Polar Bear\nFor polar bears, in an overall body length, their males measure about 12 feet. For grizzly male bears, their overall body length measures about 8 feet. And male giant pandas only measure about 6 to 7 feet.\nOn the other hand, adult female polar bears measure around 10 feet. Meanwhile, the body length of a grizzly female is approximately 7 feet. And, the female giant panda only measures about 5 feet in length.\nPanda Bear Grizzly Bear Polar Bear Male 6-7 feet 8-9 feet 12-13 feet Female 5-6 feet 7-8 feet 10-11 feet\nWho will win: Panda Bear vs. Grizzly Bear vs. Polar Bear?\nPolar bears will definitely win over the two. If there will be a tournament between these species of bears, I think our charming and cuddly pandas are simply not a match for any of these bears.\nYou\u2019ve been able to reach this far; I think you find this article pretty interesting. Let\u2019s see the cute babies of these captivating pandas. Keep on reading.\nHow Big Is A Baby Panda?\nA typical newborn cub weighs 3-5 ounces, it resembles the size of a stick of butter. The cub size is 1/900th the size of its mother. They are pink in color, usually hairless, and unable to see and move.\nBut do not worry, because this will not stay permanently. They are able to open their eyes when they reach 6-8 weeks old and move when they are 3 months old.\nTake Note: Excluding kangaroos and opossums, the panda cub is the smallest newborn mammal relative to its mother\u2019s size? Yes, \u201ccub\u201d is what we call the young of bears.\nHold on, there are more captivating things about these cute babies. Cubs are very secured and safeguarded nearly 100% in their first month. They are resting on their mother\u2019s front, and mother pandas used their paws, arm and head to cover them.\nBut of course, being a baby panda is not fun at all times. For, they are also expected to imitate their mother and learn how to look for food on their own.\nThe mother panda is teaching them how they will be able to survive on their own,because they will live their way when they are about 1\u00bd and two years of age.\nYes, cubs are well loved by their mother pandas. But, there are rough times too! Especially when they over play. Cubs are very playful and full of energy particularly when hibernation has ended.\nThat\u2019s why when mother pandas get irritated, baby pandas will get a hit from their mother\u2019s paws! Ouch!\nConclusion\nIn this article, you have learned the real size of giant pandas. So on average, they can measure about 5 to 7 feet in length, and have a mass of around 180 to 270 pounds. Also, you found out that pandas are heavier than humans on average.\nMoreover, we have compared the sizes of panda bears, grizzly bears, and polar bears in this article, too. The same is true with the size of a newborn panda cub, which is very interesting, right?\nLet\u2019s always keep in mind that giant pandas and other animals deserve love, respect, and protection regardless of their size.\nHere are some of the articles that might interest you.\nHow did you find this article? Is it informative and interesting? Don\u2019t forget to share it with your friends."}

They can rise up onto their hind legs for short periods in order to reach higher shoots of bamboo.\nPandas mostly move about on their own. Young pandas may travel with their mothers for several years before striking out to find territory of their own, and pandas sometimes come together to visit with one another as well as during their brief mating seasons.\nInfant pandas cannot move at all for quite some time. They are born small, blind and helpless and develop slowly under their mother\u2019s care, eventually opening their eyes and learning to forage for themselves. Pandas do not gain the ability to walk until 3 months of age at a minimum, an unusually long time to remain immobile for a placental mammal.\nADVERTISEMENT"}

Yang Guang, whose name means \u201cSunshine\u201d, might be a larger and, to all appearances, more affable creature, but Tian Tian (\u201cSweetie\u201d) is a panda with more edge, more wit and more dash.\nThese are unusual qualities. Pandas are vegetarian bears with slow metabolisms. They subsist almost entirely on bamboo, which they digest poorly. They do everything they can to avoid unnecessary exertion. If you give Yang Guang a ball, he will most likely see if he can eat it, then let it go. Tian Tian, on the other hand, has been known to skip after balls and do forward rolls. Sometimes she hangs from the bars on the top of her indoor den \u2013 a pose that her handlers call \u201cninja panda\u201d \u2013 just for the hell of it. She is not all nice. Tian Tian has bullied keepers off the job, and sometimes takes sly swipes with her enormous claws at passing vets. \u201cShe has got her own mind, most definitely,\u201d said Alison Maclean, the chief panda keeper at Edinburgh zoo, who seems to love her deeply for precisely this reason. \u201cYou have to be very, very careful around her.\u201d\nThat afternoon, as they prepared to leave for the day, the panda team at the zoo was watching Tian Tian especially closely. When she stood up and wandered over to a pale green grate that separates her enclosure from Yang Guang\u2019s, Maclean, who was sitting in her office a few hundred yards away, followed her on one of 16 cameras that monitor the bears day and night. Late March is right in the middle of the short, fragile and confusing period that is the panda breeding season. Female pandas ovulate just once a year. The optimum window for them to mate \u2013 \u201cthe drop zone\u201d in zoo parlance \u2013 is about 24 hours long. Depending on the vagaries of climate, diet and bear, the build-up to this moment can be conspicuous and last for weeks, or it can arrive suddenly, with no warning at all. \u201cThe signs can be very subtle,\u201d Simon Girling, Edinburgh zoo\u2019s head vet, told me. \u201cWe are always worried that we are going to miss the window.\u201d\nOn the screen, Maclean watched Tian Tian approach the grate and continue her calls. Having evolved to lead solitary lives, pandas are kept in separate enclosures in zoos, to prevent them from killing one another. The only exception to this is the breeding season, when the bears are invited to communicate and are ultimately, according to the euphemism, \u201cintroduced\u201d. Seeing Tian Tian through the bars, Yang Guang, who had spent the afternoon sitting on top of a cave, eating, called back. \u201cWe thought, this was quite good,\u201d said Maclean, \u201cquite interactive, quite nice.\u201d\nMaclean was cautious, though. Since the pandas\u2019 arrival, the team at Edinburgh zoo had already tried three times to breed the bears \u2013 with considerable fanfare and public attention \u2013 and each attempt had ended in disappointment. After a thoroughgoing review of these attempts in late 2014, this year\u2019s season carried with it a sense of added pressure. But the keepers had also come up with one or two new tricks. A few weeks earlier, Maclean had daubed urine from Long Hui, an impressive male panda kept at Sch\u00f6nbrunn zoo, in Vienna, all over Yang Guang and Tian Tian\u2019s enclosures, in order to spice the air with competition and possibility. \u201cShe spent a lot of time sniffing and seeing what was going on,\u201d said Maclean. \u201cHe came out and was just like, \u2018Whoa!\u2019 He was all over the place.\u201d\nAs in previous years, however, most of the keepers\u2019 match-making work took the form of minute monitoring \u2013 of bamboo consumption, behaviour, daily photographs of Tian Tian\u2019s vulva \u2013 to ensure everyone was primed for the big moment. An important part of this surveillance is the analysis of hormones in Tian Tian\u2019s urine. From mid-March onwards, Maclean and her team try to collect up to four samples a day, but this is a challenge. Females coming into heat have evolved to pee in ponds and streams, to alert potential mates, and although Tian Tian has been trained to urinate on command, she frequently refuses to comply. \u201cQuite often she is like, \u2018I\u2019m holding on to this,\u2019\u201d said Maclean. Keepers scurry in with syringes to collect precious drops from the ground when she is not looking.\nThe urine samples go by bus or taxi to Forbes Howie, an endocrinologist at Edinburgh University, but their ultimate interpretation is the domain of Iain Valentine, the director of the panda project at Edinburgh zoo. A tall, toothy, loping man, Valentine is Edinburgh\u2019s maverick and its schemer, the person who first dreamed of bringing pandas to Scotland \u2013 the most northerly place the animals have ever been known to live \u2013 about a decade ago. Since then, he has been both evangelist and architect of the zoo\u2019s efforts to produce the UK\u2019s first-ever panda cub. Every spring, Valentine, who is 51 and an expert on the capercaillie, a large woodland grouse, spends weeks puzzling over fluctuating levels of panda oestrogen and progesterone, as well as various other proteins, looking for telltale signs of impending ovulation \u2013 \u201cdouble peaks\u201d and \u201cbig falls\u201d \u2013 and hankering for the next set of results from the lab.\nBy the afternoon of 25 March, Valentine was convinced that Tian Tian had reached \u201ccrossover\u201d \u2013 a threshold when her oestrogen levels overtake those of progesterone \u2013 12 days earlier, and that she was due to ovulate in two or three days\u2019 time. A measure of warning is vital. Because the pandas are so rare, and the opportunities to breed them are so fleeting, it is standard practice in zoos to artificially inseminate females, as well as to attempt to mate them naturally. For scientific back-up and political cover (all pandas are officially on loan from the Chinese government), Valentine already had two experts from the CCRCGP \u2013 China\u2019s main panda research facility \u2013 installed in the Holiday Inn next door to the zoo, and he had a team of reproductive biologists from Germany booked on flights the following day to prepare for the artificial insemination. The Germans, led by Prof Thomas Hildebrandt from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, had artificially inseminated Tian Tian in the two previous years.\nValentine watched Tian Tian through the cameras. In a urine sample taken that morning at 8.30am, he had noted a small decrease in her oestrogen, but thought little of it. The team took a second sample at 9.50am, but decided not to send it, and to wait instead for those results to come in with the afternoon sample, which was taken at 2.30pm. \u201cWe thought nothing much was going to happen,\u201d said Valentine. With no new data expected until later in the evening, and quietly encouraged by the images of Tian Tian and Yang Guang bleating through the grate, the panda team went home.\n* * *\nValentine lives in Newburgh, a village on the banks of the river Tay, about an hour north of the zoo. He was preparing supper when he received an excited message from Howie, the endocrinologist, at 7.08pm. \u201cResults up,\u201d it said. \u201cYinks!\u201d The tests showed that Tian Tian\u2019s oestrogen levels had dropped suddenly in the short interval between her two samples that morning. She had almost certainly ovulated, and that was now nearly 12 hours ago. Tian Tian was well into the drop zone. \u201cSneaky minx,\u201d Valentine texted back. The clock was ticking, and his mind began to race with decisions and difficulties \u2013 all the people he had to phone and bring together. \u201cThe Chinese are in the Holiday Inn. The vets are at home. The keepers are at home,\u201d he told himself. \u201cThe Berlin team is in Berlin.\u201d\nThe first person he called was Zhaoyuan Li, a Chinese field biologist based in Scotland who has acted as the zoo\u2019s interpreter and liaison with Chinese scientists and bureaucrats since 2008. Li was in the hotel with the two Chinese scientists, and Valentine wanted their take on the test results. Then he rang Girling, the head vet. Maclean got a call from one of her keepers while she was in the supermarket. She put her shopping back on the shelves and ran out to her car. The Germans tried to change their flights.\nIain Valentine, the director of the panda project at Edinburgh zoo. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\nThe first captive-bred giant panda, Ming Ming, was born in Beijing zoo on 9 September 1963. The first successful artificial insemination was carried out in 1978. Even so, almost 40 years later, breeding pandas in zoos remains a business of conflicting opinions, uncooperative bears, and near-hysterical levels of public and press interest, and occasional disaster. (At London zoo in the early 1990s, keepers had to spray their bears with fire extinguishers after one bit the other during an introduction. In 2010, Xing Xing, a 14-year-old male on loan to Japan, died after a routine electro-ejaculation.) Only a handful of zoos outside China have managed it successfully. The key decision facing Valentine and the team that night was whether they had to attempt an artificial insemination, or even natural mating, in the next few hours \u2013 or if they could safely wait until the following day. Valentine knew that American teams often wait more than 24 hours after ovulation before inseminating pandas, but in Europe, the rule of thumb is to do it as soon as possible. The pandas were not giving any clues. Logging in to the cameras from home, Maclean saw that Yang Guang was sound asleep.\nGirling, the vet, lives a short distance away from Valentine, and the two men decided to drive to Edinburgh to meet the Chinese vets. Before they left, they told the rest of the team to assemble at the zoo. During the drive, Girling and Valentine were apprehensive. They became increasingly convinced that they should inseminate Tian Tian that night. It was too risky to attempt a natural introduction, in case Tian Tian got injured, and it did not look as if the Germans could get there quickly enough. \u201cIf we were going to do this, we were going to have to do it ourselves,\u201d Girling said. By the time they reached the Holiday Inn, at about 10.30pm, the Chinese experts had arrived at the same conclusion.\nThe team \u2013 keepers, vets and the zoo\u2019s head of animals, Darren McGarry \u2013 gathered in a room at the animal collections department towards midnight. There were about a dozen people. Almost all of them had been involved in the previous inseminations of Tian Tian and had been preparing for this moment for several months. There were not enough people for both bears to be sedated (most zoos prefer to use fresh semen, which they coax from the sedated male panda using an anal probe) so Girling, who had not inseminated a panda before, would use a frozen sample from February 2014. The vet took a gas-powered pistol loaded with anaesthetic and walked down the hill to the enclosure.\nMaclean was with Tian Tian when she went under. \u201cThe last person she sees when she goes off to sleep is me,\u201d she said. The night was cold. It took four people to lift the panda on to a stretcher, and then on to a set of hay bales that acted as an operating table. A heated blanket kept her warm. Next door, in a small kitchen, Valentine and the Chinese scientists defrosted straws of Yang Guang\u2019s semen and examined them under a microscope. The only delay came when there was a slight disagreement \u2013 exacerbated by translation problems \u2013 over whether Tian Tian should be inseminated in her vagina or her uterus.\nIn the end, Girling injected two catheter-fulls of Yang Guang\u2019s semen directly into her womb. Tian Tian woke up alone in her cage, with Maclean on the other side of the bars. At around 5am, Girling and Valentine got in the car to drive home. The adrenaline of the night had given way to fatigue. Girling was relieved, but Valentine remained unsettled. He has described producing a cub as \u201cthe icing on the cake\u201d for Edinburgh\u2019s panda project, but in truth it is much more than that.\nA baby panda in Scotland would be proof of the bears\u2019 wellbeing, a measurable contribution to the saving of the giant panda and the biggest event in the zoo\u2019s 116-year history. It would also be an immense personal validation of Valentine\u2019s work as a scientist and a conservationist. And that night, the insemination of Tian Tian had the feel of a rushed job. \u201cThis was the first year where, if I am being honest, I had a question mark,\u201d he told me. In the dark Scottish dawn, it began to snow.\nPandas are the oldest extant bear. A set of fossilised cheek teeth found in southern China in the 1980s suggests that the species diverged from the main Ursus family around 7m years ago. They used to roam across east Asia: panda fossils have been found as far north as Beijing and as far south as Burma. It was probably climatic changes, and the advance of humankind, that drove the bears, with their unusual sixth digit (the panda thumb) and piebald markings, into the steep and inaccessible mountains of south-west China.\nThere they embarked on one of biology\u2019s great love stories: of carnivore and plant. Lots of things about pandas \u2013 their genes and digestive systems, for example \u2013 suggest that they should eat meat, but instead they have a diet that is 99% bamboo. Indeed, the relationship of pandas and their chosen food source is the framing device of almost all scientific research into the animal (sample paper: \u201cGiant Panda Bear Genome Unveiled: Bamboo Diet May Be Linked to Inability to Taste Savouries\u201d), a kind of meta-narrative for the overall particularity of the bears and their long survival.\nThat is because \u2013 to the casual observer, at least \u2013 bamboo and pandas appear to be in a marriage of profound inconvenience. In the wild, bears eat for up to 13 hours a day, digesting about 17% of what they consume, compared to, say, 80% for a grass-eating deer. Owing to their low-calorie diet, pandas are unable to build up sufficient fat reserves to hibernate and have smaller brains, smaller kidneys and smaller babies than other mammals their size. Surviving \u2013 just about \u2013 on bamboo is both the evolutionary genius of pandas and the limiting factor of their existence. George Schaller, a pioneering biologist who tracked giant pandas for five years in Sichuan during the 1980s, describes eating the plant each day as their \u201cone great vision in life\u201d.\nGiant panda Tian Tian plays with log at Edinburgh zoo \u2013 video Guardian\nForaging alone, and sleeping when they are not eating, wild pandas seldom come into contact with humans. In the canon of Chinese history, art and folklore, they make only tiny and fragmentary appearances. The Classics of Seas and Mountains, a work of geography written some time between 770 and 256BC, speaks of the mo, \u201ca bearlike, black and white animal that eats copper and iron\u201d. (Pandas were most often encountered by herb-diggers in mountain camps who would find their cooking pots chewed out of shape.) From then on, the bears occurred under such a variety of names \u2013 around 20, including meng shi shou (beast of prey), bai bao (white leopard) and shi tie shou (iron-eating beast) \u2013 and implausible descriptions that by the time western explorers and missionaries began turning up in China in the 19th century, they did not know whether the beast was real or not. When Ted and Kermit Roosevelt, sons of the US president, Theodore, became the first westerners to shoot a panda, in western Sichuan in April 1928, they said it was \u201clike the animal of a dream\u201d. When Ruth Harkness, a New York fashion designer, became the first foreigner to capture a live panda eight years later, she named it Su Lin, meaning \u201ca little bit of something cute\u201d.\nScientists generally agree that there are five main factors that make primates, birds, bats and carnivores candidates for extinction: large body size; small geographic range; slow life cycle; high position in the food chain; and low population density. Giant pandas possess four out of five of these liabilities, but they also have one almighty advantage in a human-ravaged world \u2013 a direct line into our tender hearts. When Chiang Kai-shek wanted to thank the American people for sending aid to China during the second world war in 1941, he despatched, in his words, two \u201ccomical, black and white, furry pandas\u201d to the Bronx zoo.\nNo one seems truly able to explain the emotional appeal of pandas, except to say that it is massive, instant and near-universal. Sir Peter Scott knew what he was doing when he made a largely invisible bear the logo of the World Wildlife Fund in 1961. At Edinburgh zoo, Alison Maclean has watched hundreds of thousands of visitors come and sigh and sometimes blink away tears as they watch Tian Tian and Yang Guang slowly cavort in their dens. \u201cThe way they sit, the way they pick things up, and eat \u2026 People just have an instant connection with them,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they can look like someone in a suit.\u201d\n* * *\nOf course, in the larger scheme of things, our soft spot for pandas has not counted for much. Biologists believe there were once 100,000 pandas in Asia. By the time Schaller and the WWF were invited to China to study the animal in 1980, there were little more than 1,000. Pandas had been under official protection in China for decades, but it had not made the slightest difference. Poaching, deforestation and snares left out for deer and wild pigs had devastated the population. By 1985, after a bewildering bamboo die-off in Sichuan, during which hundreds of pandas starved to death, the icon of the global conservation movement, a survivor of ice ages, was about to disappear.\nZoologists around the world wondered how to get the numbers up. One possibility was by breeding the bears in captivity. The question was how. The only accounts of panda reproduction in western scientific literature were tantalising scenes from Schaller\u2019s fieldwork. Crawling through bamboo thickets in the fog and snow, Schaller had watched complex mating rituals in which lone females climbed hemlock trees and moaned while four or five males paced and fought below, pushing each other off cliffs. \u201cAt 17.50, she descends,\u201d Schaller wrote of one such encounter in 1981. \u201cHe mounts briefly four times in rapid succession. Both squeal, chirp and bleat, and the male pants.\u201d\nYang Guang, Edinburgh zoo\u2019s male panda, eating bamboo in his enclosure. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\nOne of the myths that biologists are keenest to dispel is that pandas are bad at breeding. You don\u2019t survive for 7m years without knowing a thing or two. It\u2019s just that panda sex, like many other things about pandas, is not quite like anything else. There is the \u201cfetalised\u201d panda penis, with its unusually small and winged baculum (penis bone), which seems to place a certain emphasis on technique, and those short, passing hours when the females are ready to breed. The whole reproductive event is shrouded by the same energy shortage that defines panda lives. Cubs are born ludicrously small and immature, weighing around 100g \u2013 000.1% of their mothers, or the size of a mouse. If a panda gives birth to twins, she will abandon one in a matter of days because she cannot look after both. Schaller concluded that successful mating in the wild rested on an intricate process of \u201csynchronisation\u201d, in which males and females subtly geed each other up, over the course of days if not weeks, through calling, scent-marking and other indecipherable means, until they were ready to take the plunge.\nThe difficulty has been in recreating those conditions in captivity. Schaller, who is now 82 and the vice-president of Panthera, a big cat conservation organisation, is among those who believes it is more or less impossible. \u201cIf you sit next to the same animal year after year,\u201d he asked me, \u201cwhere is the excitement?\u201d\nFor a long time, international efforts to figure out the problem were chaotic and poorly coordinated. Western zoos poured millions of dollars into panda displays \u2013 pandas cost $1m a year to borrow from China \u2013 with scant thought for their conservation, while China\u2019s domestic panda work was stultified by bureaucracy and paranoia. The absence of the bears from pre-communist iconography allowed them to emerge during the 1960s and 1970s as powerful and politically safe symbols of the new China. But the country\u2019s zoos and panda reserves were short on funding and expertise. They were mortified when foreign biologists proved more successful at breeding pandas than they were. In 1991, vets at London zoo learned that their new female panda, Ming Ming, who had been sent to the UK ostensibly to breed, had already been artificially inseminated around a dozen times in China without success, and was almost certainly infertile. \u201cWe all knew: I knew. They knew. I think they knew we knew,\u201d Jo Gipps, the zoo\u2019s former director, told me.\nOut of sheer desperation, things began to change. By the mid-1990s, there were 117 pandas living in captivity in China, a worrying proportion of them descendants of a single, libidinous male called Pan Pan. At a conference in Chengdu in December 1996, a group of international breeding specialists, together with around 50 Chinese scientists, agreed to overhaul the programme. A proper studbook, recording the genetic information of captive pandas, was introduced (Tian Tian is number 569, Yang Guang is 564) and every bear got a health check. Biologists swapped hunches and the breeding rate ticked up. In the 25 years between 1963 and 1989, 119 pandas were born in captivity, of which around one in three survived. In the decade that followed, 109 were born and 66 survived.\nSince then, China\u2019s captive population, which is mainly based in large breeding centres, where females have plenty of mates to choose from, has increased to 396 pandas \u2013 a level regarded as genetically safe from inbreeding. The wild population has enjoyed a similar, quiet recovery, although these animals remain trapped in their long, slow dance with extinction. Earlier this year, the latest quadrennial survey reported that a total of 1,864 pandas are living in around 30 fragmented populations in the forests of Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu. If they were people, you could fit them on a couple of tube trains.\n* * *\nIain Valentine is an unguarded, hopeful soul. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I am a serious scientist,\u201d he told me one morning in the old keeper\u2019s bungalow at the zoo, where he has his office. \u201cBut I have an inquisitive brain, so I will puzzle something out or have a theory or an idea about something.\u201d The thought of bringing pandas to Edinburgh first took hold in 2005. Valentine had just got hold of some koalas from San Diego zoo, which has one of the best panda-breeding records outside China, and he decided to ask their advice. \u201cOf course they all fell about laughing,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause they realised that you are crazy if you start the journey.\u201d\nIt took six years. Pandas in China are the preserve of the State Forestry Administration (which runs the reserves and breeding centres) and the Ministry of Construction (which runs the zoos). A few initiatives, such as the country\u2019s reintroduction programme, in which captive pandas are trained to live in the wild \u2013 with the help of scientists in panda suits, smothered in urine and faeces \u2013 are run by both at the same time. Valentine sent emails and beseeched diplomats. He made fact-finding trips to Beijing. When China\u2019s main panda breeding centre, in Wolong, was destroyed by the Sichuan earthquake in 2008 (one panda was killed), he had Edinburgh zoo send \u00a315,000 and a set of satellite phones.\nThe years of waiting gave him time to devise his own plans. Valentine thought the bears would do well in the cold and wet Scottish climate, and that it wouldn\u2019t be hard to grow bamboo for them to eat. To increase his chances of producing a cub, he decided to brook convention and ask for two adult pandas that had already bred \u2013 Tian Tian gave birth to twins in 2009 \u2013 rather than a sub-adult pair who would come into sexual maturity at the zoo. \u201cI thought, \u2018Hey hey, I\u2019m off and running here,\u2019\u201d he told me. \u201cI was wrong. I was wrong on lots of fronts.\u201d\nAlison Maclean, chief panda keeper at Edinburgh zoo. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\nThe deal to bring Tian Tian and Yang Guang to Edinburgh was signed on 10 January 2011, as part of a \u00a32.6bn trade package between the UK and China that included an agreement to pursue deepwater drilling in the South China Sea. It came at an exceptionally turbulent time for the zoo. Poor summer weather in 2009 and 2010 and the impact of the recession had pushed the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland to the edge of financial collapse. The zoo was then hit by a series of scandals and fallings-out among its senior staff. (One manager was accused of stealing money intended for the chimpanzee enclosure). After Valentine and Maclean went to the Bifengxia panda reserve to meet Tian Tian and Yang Guang for the first time in March 2011, Valentine was suspended from his job for four months, briefly threatening the whole project. (He was subsequently reinstated to a post more narrowly focused on the pandas, and the deal got back on track.)\nThe arrival of the bears, however, swept the gloom away. They turned up on a FedEx truck on 4 December, and went on display 10 days later. During a typical December, Edinburgh zoo gets around 8,000 visitors. In the last two weeks of 2011, 56,000 people came to see Tian Tian and Yang Guang, and their popularity has proved surprisingly resilient ever since. Zoo economics says that you can expect a 70% bounce in visitor numbers in the first year of a panda loan, with the increase fading to 9% by year three, but the bears in Edinburgh have bucked the trend. Last year, the zoo\u2019s numbers were still 25% up, three years in, and that has been without a cub to really pull in the hordes.\nWhen I asked Valentine what a baby panda would mean for the zoo\u2019s finances, he garbled his words in excitement. \u201cThe sky\u2019s the rocket,\u201d he said.\n* * *\nThe Edinburgh team had its first shot in the spring of 2012, just a few months after the pandas arrived. By then, Maclean and Valentine had already realised that the bears were much more sensitive than they had previously thought. They hated the wind, and were easily spooked by noise. They spent most of their time in indoor viewing areas attached to their enclosures, rather than outside. Their keepers, meanwhile, got a crash course in bamboo. Yang Guang, in particular, has turned out to be something of a gourmand, discarding one species of the plant in favour of another, and switching between stalks and leaves, sometimes on a daily basis. (Maclean now serves the pandas 24 different species of bamboo, which are shipped in weekly from a plantation in the Netherlands). At the same time, Tian Tian began to show flashes of her mercurial personality. When Chinese keepers came to check on her, they surprised Maclean by calling her \u201cBad Panda\u201d.\nThe first breeding season was more or less a trial run. In fact, it is the only time the pandas have ever been put together to mate. I watched footage of one of their introductions, and saw Yang Guang hoisting himself uncertainly in Tian Tian\u2019s direction, while she squirmed under him and seemed to bark unhelpful instructions. \u201cHe\u2019s a gentleman and maybe he shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d said Maclean. \u201cDo you know what I mean?\u201d\nIn 2013, a long winter and gale-force winds seemed to play havoc with Tian Tian\u2019s hormones. \u201cWe thought she would never get to the point,\u201d said Girling, the vet. Even a Chinese expert from Wolong was \u201ca little bit flummoxed\u201d, according to Valentine. Eventually, Tian Tian started sending contradictory signals to Yang Guang as well, calling him into her enclosure and then scaring him away. \u201cHer behaviours just weren\u2019t conducive,\u201d said Valentine. Last year was a similar story: \u201cHe was interested in her, she was not interested in him.\u201d Zookeepers do not like being drawn on questions of animal rapport, but there is obviously something missing between Edinburgh\u2019s bears. \u201cShe is not seeing him,\u201d Maclean explained, \u201cas the big, butch male.\u201d\nThe team has resorted to artificial inseminations, but in their way, these have only revealed new layers of mystery. Like other bears, female pandas experience embryonic diapause, which means that once a fertilised egg has become a blastocyst, it can float around in the uterus for months until the mother is in a prime state to embark on her pregnancy. Among energy-starved pandas, this wait can last a very long time. Gestation periods have been timed at anything between 83 days (a little short of three months) and 163 (closer to six). For unknown reasons, female pandas also often experience \u201cpseudo-pregnancies\u201d, generating all the symptoms \u2013 hormonal changes, nipple development, even the production of bright-green first-stage breast milk \u2013 just without the cub. They can also lose the foetus \u2013 re-assimilating it back into their tissue, a process known as \u201cresorption\u201d \u2013 at any point. \u201cIt blows your mind,\u201d said Maclean. Ultrasounds rarely help, because panda foetuses are so small.\nThis means that summers at the zoo have taken on an aching, expectant quality, with keepers, vets and visiting Chinese experts often reduced to their own personal theories and coping strategies to survive the months of hope and doubt. \u201cYou can get befuddled with the numbers,\u201d Maclean admitted. The press and the outside world do not help, getting revved up in the spring about panda sex and the \u201ctunnel of love\u201d \u2013 as the rarely used connecting passage between Tian Tian and Yang Guang\u2019s den has been called by the Scottish papers \u2013 then bored in the summer and cynical by the autumn. Last year, Edinburgh even had to put up with sniping from San Diego zoo, where a spokeswoman cast doubt on Tian Tian\u2019s reported pregnancy. Valentine insists that Tian Tian fell pregnant in both 2013 and 2014, only to resorb the foetus a few weeks later. He says she has the scars on her uterus wall to prove it.\nThe whole thing is a drama. And the sense of spectacle \u2013 the press releases, the inseminations, the fabulous cost (Edinburgh\u2019s pandas cost up to \u00a32m a year to run, about 20% of the zoo\u2019s budget) \u2013 provokes questions about what exactly pandas in western zoos are meant to achieve. From a strict conservation point of view, everyone knows that shipping individual pairs of pandas across the world, to strange cities in strange climates, is a terrible way to make more of them. \u201cHow do we save giant pandas? Send them all back to China,\u201d Gipps, the former director of London zoo, told me. \u201cPut them into breeding situations where they can really make babies.\u201d\nMany wildlife campaigners even question the scale of China\u2019s captive breeding programme, believing that now it has passed the point of ensuring genetic diversity, the emphasis should be on reintroducing the bears in large numbers to the wild. (Since 2006, just four pandas are known to have been released, of which two have died.) And then there is the equally problematic, but more subjective, issue of how the pandas feel about it all: after making it through the Miocene and Pleistocene eras, do they really want to stick around for a life of panda cams and anal probes? As Chris Packham, the BBC wildlife presenter, put it in 2009: \u201cLet them go with a degree of dignity.\u201d\nAlison Maclean with an incubator that has been kept ready for a baby panda arrival. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\nWhen I put this to Valentine and Maclean, they rehearsed the familiar arguments for sending pandas abroad. The bears generate millions of dollars for important scientific research and conservation work in China. They are what campaigners call an \u201cumbrella species\u201d \u2013 a charismatic mammal saving the hides of tens of thousands of less lovable organisms in the bamboo forests of Sichuan. And there are still so few of them, the logic goes, that even a cub produced at vast expense in Scotland is still one more panda. (Maclean and the other keepers hope that any offspring of Tian Tian might one day grow up to enter China\u2019s reintroduction programme). For people in the business of selling conservation to a paying public (a ticket to Edinburgh zoo costs \u00a318), giving up on pandas would also mean giving up on the idea that people\u2019s emotional response to the natural world matters at all. \u201cIf you can\u2019t save the panda, then what can you save?\u201d Valentine asked me. \u201cBecause I am going to find it really hard to get people interested in snails.\u201d\nAfter so many years of trying, though, these abstract arguments give way to more personal hopes. Spending time at the zoo this summer, I got the impression that the members of the the panda team at Edinburgh had each developed their own motives for wanting Tian Tian and Yang Guang to breed. One afternoon, Maclean and I stood talking about Tian Tian\u2019s prickly personality. Her outdoor enclosure stood empty; she was taking a nap inside. Maclean wore a purple training whistle around her neck. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would ever stop trying,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it is very important that she has cubs. You know, it is the only time I would say she is going to be sociable with another panda \u2013 when she is with a youngster.\u201d\nValentine, meanwhile, is a man with a riddle to crack. Once he described breeding pandas as a \u201cbiological moonshot\u201d, and the entire enterprise \u2013 its complexity, its farcical notes \u2013 seems to give him great pleasure. In late July, as the rest of the zoo slipped into the now-familiar summer longueur of diapause and advanced panda semiotics (\u201cAs we like to say, \u2018She has a bun in the oven, but the oven is not switched on yet,\u2019\u201d the panda presenters told the crowds every 10 minutes or so), Valentine buzzed around with graphs and theories. He dropped hints about a new battery of tests, monitoring Tian Tian\u2019s prostaglandin metabolites, a compound that helps induce labour in humans, which he believed would help track the progress of panda pregnancies with more accuracy and certainty than ever before. Valentine described this work alternately as \u201cclassified\u201d and \u201cnew science\u201d. \u201cYou have to understand,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m a much more optimistic than a pessimistic person.\u201d\nThe bears, of course, gave nothing away. One day I watched Yang Guang drink slowly from a dish of water, then transport himself with implausible grace from a wooden platform to a metal bed filled with hay, where he covered himself in bamboo, as if tipping a salad bowl on top of his head. Tian Tian, meanwhile, specialised in her own amusement. She has a habit of going into her indoor viewing area for a drink, waiting just long enough for the keepers to spot her on their cameras, and then slipping out of view as the crowds arrive. One morning, in a seemingly restless mood, she walked up and down along the glass wall of her outdoor enclosure, a display of strolling that quickly filled the stands with visitors. Tian Tian sat down in a pond and looked out at us. There was a long moment when the bear seemed to become mutually transfixed by a toddler in a blue coat who was wearing a set of reins. The panda stared at us. We stared back. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d the boy asked, finally, pointing at Tian Tian. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n* * *\nAccording to Valentine\u2019s data, Tian Tian became pregnant during the second week of July. In recent years, scientists at Memphis zoo, in Tennessee, have developed a test involving ceruloplasmin, an enzyme produced in the liver, which they claim can distinguish between real and pseudo panda pregnancies. By early August, Valentine was confident that this reading tallied with Tian Tian\u2019s other hormone data. He picked up a spike in her prostaglandin metabolites as well, another good sign. Tian Tian was also acting differently. She ate less and slept more. Her mammary glands grew. She began to spend more time in and around her cubbing box, a basket that her keepers had placed in her den and modified this year to include a heating element. She dragged in rotting logs, and scratched at the bark on the walls.\nWhen I called to check in with the panda team on the afternoon of 12 August, Girling told me that Tian Tian was \u201cjust grand\u201d. Valentine\u2019s voice was thick with an elation I had not heard before. \u201cShe\u2019ll give birth next week,\u201d he said. \u201cI am 90% certain it is going to happen.\u201d\nAfter years of trying, Valentine explained, everything was finally falling into place. The labs had used the new tests to analyse old urine samples collected from Tian Tian in 2013 and 2014, and Valentine was confident that he now understood what had gone wrong. The foetus in 2013, he explained, had only developed for a week before it was resorbed. In 2014, it was two and a half weeks. We were well past that stage now. \u201cThe numbers are very different this year. That is what we wanted,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we are over the hump.\u201d\nThe keepers began a 24-hour watch of Tian Tian two days later, logging into the cameras from home and monitoring her in four-hour shifts. Because of gaps in her urine data, which made timings difficult to predict, Valentine forecast a four-day window for the birth, from August 18 to August 21. Maclean and her team competed for slots on the watch rota. For two years, her office has contained a fold-out hospital bed and intensive care baby incubator \u2013 in case Tian Tian gives birth to twins, and she has to rear one herself. The walls are covered with instructions on how to prepare puppy formula, which is used for baby pandas. Maclean unfolded the bed, and sterilised the room. On the afternoon of August 17, the zoo closed the panda enclosures and thanked visitors for their cooperation \u201cduring this exciting, but delicate period\u201d.\nEdinburgh zoo\u2019s female giant panda, Tian Tian. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\nTian Tian withdrew into herself. Treated decorously by her keepers all year round, they gave her extra space, and fed her bamboo shoots. She kept her back turned, making it difficult to conduct even visual examinations. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get near her,\u201d Maclean said. Sometimes the panda growled and barked. It became impossible to contemplate carrying out an ultrasound, which might reveal a glimpse of the cub, and even to collect urine samples, whose analysis Valentine hoped might give a 24-hour warning of the birth. On the night that the zoo closed the panda enclosures, he emailed: \u201cWe are flying blind and not sure what is going on.\u201d\nRelying on their observations of Tian Tian alone, the panda team were not sure how to interpret her behaviour. They had never seen her so intransigent before, but they had also never believed themselves to be so close to the birth of a cub. Valentine veered between worry and bursts of overwhelming excitement. \u201cThis is the first time ever,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has never happened to us.\u201d\nLast Tuesday afternoon, Maclean noticed damp patches appearing on Tian Tian\u2019s cubbing box. They came from under her tail. They were clear, vaginal secretions. The panda began to lick herself and the team prepared for her to give birth. \u201cIain was the level-headed one,\u201d Maclean told me. \u201cWe were skipping around the section, trying not to grin from ear to ear.\u201d But nothing came. Valentine, who does not have access to the cameras at home, went to bed and prayed for the phone to ring.\nThe same pattern repeated the following day. More secretions. More skipping. No cub. \u201cWe got to the point where we thought, \u2018This is a bit strange,\u2019\u201d said Maclean. \u201cBut you let your heart rule your head.\u201d On Thursday, Tian Tian dragged more logs into the cubbing box. The increasing agony of waiting in Edinburgh was interrupted by happy news from abroad: a successful ultrasound, followed by the birth of twins, at the Smithsonian zoo in Washington; Malaysia\u2019s first ever panda cub, born in Kuala Lumpur.\nWhen I spoke to Valentine last Friday morning, on the last day that Tian Tian was expected to give birth, he did his best to sound pleased about the other zoos. \u201cIsn\u2019t that wonderful?\u201d he said. \u201cIt is great when other people do it.\u201d But his voice was empty, and tired. \u201cThis is tough,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is really hard. We\u2019re grabbing on to the positive behaviours we see, but also we start to think, \u2018Well shouldn\u2019t we be seeing this by now?\u2019\u201d He hadn\u2019t had a urine sample from Tian Tian for over a week. Valentine talked me through the scientific progress of another breeding season: from the insights gained by the prostaglandin work, he explained, he was close to a final, precise figure for the length of a panda pregnancy. But he was already wondering what on earth had gone wrong.\nThe following night, at around 10pm, Valentine emailed the rest of the panda team and told them they could stand down. For a fourth year in a row, there would be no cub. They had never come so close. \u201cThis has been another step,\u201d he told me later. \u201cBut how many steps do we need? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\nYesterday the panda enclosure at Edinburgh zoo was closed. A black gate barred the entrance. Padlocks hung on the doors to the indoor viewing areas. At around lunchtime, I slipped inside with Valentine and Maclean. There was no wind, and the air smelled slightly of fish, from the penguin exhibit next door. \u201cMy husband was like, \u2018Will a cuddle help?\u2019\u201d Maclean said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Nope. Step away.\u2019 It\u2019s sad. It\u2019s hugely sad. I wanted it for her. But we will pick ourselves up and go again.\u201d\nYang Guang was in his den. We fed him a couple of apples. When he stood on his hind legs, he came up to my shoulder. There was a small set of TV screens in the corner, and one of them showed Tian Tian in her own den next door. She was on her back, legs splayed, on top of her cubbing box. Earlier, Maclean had been in to see her, alone. When she turned on the lights, Tian Tian had covered her eyes with her paws. Now she lay in the gloom, staring up at the bars on the ceiling. It was her 12th birthday."}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "10 Unusual Examples of Mutualism Observed in the Animal Kingdom", "url": "https://unbelievable-facts.com/2019/08/mutualism.html", "text": "Animals can be quite fascinating creatures. Even though they do not have the same thinking capacity as humans, they have a way of solving their day-to-day problems. Some animals mutually coexist with other animals of different species. In this type of arrangement, both animals benefit from each other indirectly. From having play-dates together, hunting together, cleaning, to security, below are 10 unusual animal relationships observed in the animal kingdom. This relationship is called \u201cmutualism.\u201d\n1 Ravens and wolves exhibit unusual animal mutualism. They mutually benefit from each other in that the ravens guide the wolf to a carcass. In return, the raven gets food from the wolf\u2019s effort of splitting the carcass open.\nRavens and wolves have a spot in both legends and facts. A symbiotic relationship between a wolf and a raven has been proven. The two animals exhibit fascinating collaboration where they both benefit mutually. Wolves and ravens have not only been observed playing together but also hunt together. Wherever there is a carcass, there is a wolf and a raven. The reason for this odd phenomena is that ravens help wolves ward off predators from attacking the wolves, and in return, they get a share of the carcass. \u200c In some instances, the ravens will lead the wolves to prey or carcass. The wolf will do the hard job of tearing the meat apart making it easier for the ravens to get at the food. Ravens use their unique vocals to alert the wolves. \u200c\nResearch done by biologists in Yellowstone National park showed that on average a total of 30 ravens are present in a wolves carcass. A record of up to 135 ravens has been captured savoring on a wolves\u2019 prey. Even though the ravens are smaller than the wolves, they whisk away the bigger chunks of the carcass, leaving the desperate wolf with a small portion of the food. However, wolves have devised ways of curbing this situation. They move in packs to minimize the amount of food lost to ravens. When not hunting, ravens tease the wolves and play with the pups. (source)\n2 Giant tarantulas exhibit a mutual relationship with tiny frogs. The small frogs protect the tarantula\u2019s eggs in exchange for a safe environment.\nAlthough giant tarantulas could potentially prey on the tiny frogs (michrolyd), they have an exceptionally exhibited mutual relationship. Research done across various countries like Peru, India and Srilanka have revealed that the small frogs felt much safer with a giant tarantula around. In some cases, the tiny frogs live together with the giant tarantulas. Surprisingly, giant tarantulas have a way of recognizing their mutual friend from other frogs. They identify their partners using chemical cues. The tiny frog\u2019s skin is made up of unsavory toxins hence the reason why tarantulas do not eat them. In some instance, the tarantulas pick the tiny frogs and carefully examine them using their mouth.\nHow these two animals benefit from each other is fascinating. The giant tarantula offers protection to the tiny frog from being eaten by snakes and other arthropods. On the other hand, the small frog eats ants in tarantula\u2019s nest protecting the eggs. The little frog also gets food by eating insects that frequent the tarantula\u2019s nests. Primarily, they both benefit from each other. (1, 2)\nAdvertisements\n3 Sloths have green fur due to the presence of algae. This is a symbiotic relationship between the sloth and algae. The green fur helps the sloth in camouflaging, while the algae get a place to grow.\nSloths are one of the slowest-moving and lazy animals. These creatures take a minute to cover a distance of two meters. To add to that, they sleep for over twenty hours hanging upside down in the tallest trees in the jungle. But, it\u2019s not its speed and laziness that has baffled researchers but rather their odd, green fur. Sloths\u2019 hair turns green during the rainy season and brown during dry seasons. The researchers sought to understand this unusual phenomenon. Here is what they found out.\nSloths have long and coarse fur that makes an ideal environment for fungi and algae to grow. The fur traps water accelerating the growth of the algae. During the rainy season, the sloth\u2019s fur turns green due to the presence of algae making it hard for predators to locate them. And during the dry season, the hair turns brown to look exactly like the dry plants around them. Camouflaging protects the sloth from predators, and in return, the algae have a place to grow.\nThe study, by researchers from the University of Helsinki, looked at the fur and algae at a molecular level to examine this relationship. Research done at a molecular level showed that the presence of moths, cockroaches, and other insects accelerated the growth of algae. Surprisingly, the sloth will eventually feed on the algae supplementing its vegan diet. Young sloths get algae directly from its mother at birth. (1, 2)\n4 The hornbill offers the security system to the mongoose as it forages on the ground. Mongoose will provide food to the hornbill as a way of saying thank you.\nRavens and wolves are not the only animals with unique collaborations. Hornbills and dwarf mongoose, too, form the \u201cbest friends forever\u201d type of relationship. These two animals not only share play-dates but also have fascinating food-hunting escapades together. The yellow-billed hornbill and the dwarf mongoose have a typical diet fattening up on crickets, grasshoppers, beetles, and locusts, and for this reason, they are mostly seen together foraging in the shrubs.\nWhen the mongoose is hunting on the ground, the hornbill perches itself on a shrub grabbing any insect coming from the land disturbed by the mongoose. In return, the hornbill offers security to the mongoose by alerting them about a predator nearby. The mongoose can then quickly scampers for safety, avoiding being turned into a meal. This mutualism is so stable that in some cases, the birds go near the mounds where the mongoose spent the night and supposedly wake them up to go hunt together. Should the hornbill delay their daily visits, the mongoose will appear restless and insecure. After a heavy meal, both the mongeese and the hornbills head over to their playing grounds and look to tease each other. Extreme, right? (1, 2, 3)\nAdvertisements\n5 Leafcutter ants do not eat leaves. They use the leaves to cultivate fungi and later feed on the fungi. The fungi will get a place to live while the leafcutter ants get food by eating the fungi.\nLeaf-cutter ants are known as the busiest organisms on earth. These tiny creatures work in a systematic and organized manner throughout their entire lives. Usually, they live in colonies of up to ten million ants and work in clusters. But, did you know that the leaf cutter ants do not eat the leaves they cut? Yes, leaf-cutter ants use the leaves to cultivate their gardens and later consume food from the garden.\nThe queen has the responsibility of laying eggs, while the rest of the colony does the hard job of finding food. Another group of leaf-cutter ants protect the nest, \u201cworkers\u201d cut and collect the leaves, while a smaller group of ants tend to the fungal garden. They chew and integrate the leaves to the fungi. Another group of ants does clean up within the fungus garden. Typically, they carry away the waste products to keep the garden clean. Also, the ants release antibiotics that help fight diseases in the garden.\nResearchers concluded that this phenomenon is a type of mutualism. The fungi benefit from the nutrients brought in by the ants to the garden. In return, the ants get food when the fungi are ready for consumption. Just like humans, the leaf-cutter ants cultivate their food. (1, 2)"}

But while the breadth of earthly biodiversity may be well known, the incredible things our animal counterparts can do are often hidden to humans. From furry creatures you never realized kissed to those who enjoy getting tipsy, these amazing animal facts are sure to wow even the biggest animal lovers out there.\n1 Koala fingerprints are so close to humans' that they could taint crime scenes.\nKoalas might not seem to have a lot in common with us, but if you were to take a closer look at their hands, you'd see that they have fingerprints that are just like humans'. In fact, they're so similar when it comes to the distinctive loops and arches, that in Australia, \"police feared that criminal investigations may have been hampered by koala prints,\" according to Ripley's Believe It or Not. Any koalas who want to commit crimes would be wise to do so wearing gloves.\n2 Parrots will selflessly help each other out.\nParrots may be associated with pirates, but it turns out African grey parrots are nothing like the infamously greedy, treasure-seeking criminals. Instead, researchers have discovered that the colorful birds will \"voluntarily help each other obtain food rewards\" and perform \"selfless\" acts, according to a 2020 study published in Current Biology. Study co-author Auguste von Bayern noted, \"African grey parrots were intrinsically motivated to help others, even if the other individual was not their friend, so they behaved very 'prosocially.'\"\n3 Prairie dogs kiss.\nPrairie dogs are quirky creatures for a number of reasons: They're giant rodents, they dig massive interconnected underground homes, and they kiss. While they're actually touching their front teeth in order to identify each other when they seem to be sweetly sharing a smooch, the BBC explains that scientists believe prairie dogs \"'kiss and cuddle' more when they are being watched by zoo visitors,\" because they \"appeared to enjoy the attention.\"\n4 Ghost crabs growl using teeth in their stomachs.\nCrabs may be able to intimidate other creatures with their claws, but if that's not enough, ghost crabs will growl at their enemies like a dog. However, unlike our canine friends, crabs make these fearsome noises using teeth located in their stomachs. \"There are three main teeth\u2014a medial tooth and two lateral teeth\u2014that are essentially elongated, hard (calcified) structures. They are part of the gastric mill apparatus in the stomach, where they rub against each other to grind up food,\" Jennifer Taylor, from the University of California, San Diego, told Newsweek. She and her colleagues were able to nail down the source of the noise after noticing that \"the crabs [were] 'growling' at\" them.\n5 The mantis shrimp has the world's fastest punch.\nYou might think that boxers have the most impressive jabs, hooks, and uppercuts on the planet, but it's the mantis shrimp that boasts the world's fastest punch. Traveling at about 50 mph, when a shrimp punches, its little fist of fury (which, of course, isn't a fist at all) is \"accelerating faster than a .22-caliber bullet,\" according to Science. National Geographic shared the tale of one such small smasher, explaining that \"in April 1998, an aggressive creature named Tyson smashed through the quarter-inch-thick glass wall of his cell. He was soon subdued by nervous attendants and moved to a more secure facility in Great Yarmouth. Unlike his heavyweight namesake [former professional boxer Mike Tyson], Tyson was only four inches long. But scientists have recently found that Tyson, like all his kin, can throw one of the fastest and most powerful punches in nature.\"\n6 Female lions do 90 percent of the hunting.\nWhile male lions attract their fair share of attention thanks to their impressive manes, it's the female lions who do the bulk of the work when it comes to feeding their families. \"Lionesses, not male lions, do the majority of hunting for their pride,\" according to CBS News. \"Lionesses hunt around 90 percent of the time, while the males protect their pride.\"\n7 Narwhal tusks are really an \"inside out\" tooth.\nNarwhals are unlike most other whales because they have what appears to be a giant tusk. But that's not actually a tusk at all\u2014what you're seeing is a tooth. Harvard University's Martin Nweeia told the BBC that the \"tooth is almost like a piece of skin in the sense that it has all these sensory nerve endings,\" adding that it's \"essentially built inside out.\"\n8 The world's oldest known breed of domesticated dog dates back to 329 BC.\nDogs are well known for being man's best friend, and it turns out that's a relationship that goes back longer than you might expect. According to Guinness World Records, the oldest known breed of domesticated dog goes all the way back to 329 BC. \"Saluki dogs were revered in ancient Egypt, being kept as royal pets and being mummified after death,\" they note. \"There are carvings found in Sumer (present-day southern Iraq) which represent a dog, closely resembling a saluki, which date back to 7000 BC.\"\n9 And the oldest evidence of domesticated cats dates back 9,500 years.\nCats have also been hanging around humans for thousands of years. Guinness World Records reports that we've been domesticating cats for 9,500 years. Proof of this came in 2004 when the \"bones of a cat were discovered in the neolithic village of Shillourokambos on Cyprus. The position of the cat in the ground was next to the bones of a human, whose similar state of preservation strongly suggests they were buried together.\"\n10 Puffins use twigs to scratch their bodies.\nPuffins surely have enough to be proud of with their beautiful beaks, but the seabirds also happen to be quite clever. According to a 2019 study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), Atlantic puffins in both Wales and Iceland were observed \"spontaneously using a small wooden stick to scratch their bodies.\" Indeed, in a video shared by Science, a little puffin can be seen picking up a tiny twig before using it to scratch an itchy spot on its belly.\n11 Bottlenose dolphins are even more right-handed than humans.\n\"Most humans (say 70 percent to 95 percent) are right-handed, a minority (say 5 percent to 30 percent) are left-handed,\" according to Scientific American. And the same holds true for bottlenose dolphins. In fact, the savvy swimmers are even more right-handed than we are. A team led by Florida's Dolphin Communication Project took a look at the feeding behavior of bottlenose dolphins and found that the animals were turning to their left side 99.44 percent of the time, which \"actually suggests a right-side bias,\" according to IFL Science. \"It places the dolphin's right side and right eye close to the ocean floor as it hunts.\"\n12 There's a kind of ant that only lives in a small area of Manhattan.\nIf you're ever in the area of \"the Broadway medians at 63rd and 76th streets\" in New York City, keep an eye on the ground for crawling critters and you might spot something rare. That's where the \"ManhattAnt\" can be found, an ant that only lives in the one small area of the city. \"It's a relative of the cornfield ant, and it looks like it's from Europe, but we can't match it up with any of the European species,\" Rob Dunn, a biology professor at North Carolina State University, told the New York Post. Dunn and his team discovered the isolated ant variety in 2012.\n13 Cows painted with zebra-like stripes can avoid being bitten by flies.\nCows have to deal with pesky flies that are beyond annoying for the docile creatures. Luckily, farmers can now protect their animals by painting them with zebra-like stripes. According to a 2019 study published in PLOS One, \"the numbers of biting flies on Japanese Black cows painted with black-and-white stripes were significantly lower than those on non-painted cows and cows painted only with black stripes.\" IFL Science suggests this might work because \"the stripes may cause a kind of motion camouflage targeted at the insects' vision, confusing them much in the way that optical illusions \u2026 confuse us.\"\n14 Capuchin monkeys wash their hands and feet in urine.\nMonkeys are undeniably cute. They can also be pretty darn gross. Capuchin monkeys, for example, urinate on their hands and feet when they're feeling \"randy.\" \"We think the alpha males might use urine-washing to convey warm, fuzzy feelings to females, that their solicitation is working and that there's no need to run away,\" primatologist Kimran Miller told NBC News. \"Or they could be doing it because they're excited.\" Either way, ew!\n15 Sperm whales in the Caribbean have an accent.\nPeople who come from different areas around the world tend to speak with inflections, fluctuations, and patterns that are specific to their home regions. Apparently, the same can be said for whales. Researchers from Dalhousie University in Canada and the University of St. Andrews in the UK have found evidence that seems to show whales in the Caribbean have a different \"accent\" than whales in other oceans.\n16 Some pigs in China are the size of bears.\nIn Nanning, the capital of China's Guangxi province, a man named Pang Cong has a rather remarkable animal living on his farm: a 1,102-pound pig. That's roughly the same size as a full-grown adult male polar bear. According to Bloomberg, massive swine of that size \"can sell for more than 10,000 yuan ($1,399), over three times higher than the average monthly disposable income\" in the area.ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb\n17 Some sharks glow in the dark.\nSharks boast some enviable\u2014and terrifying\u2014features, like their sleek design and razor-sharp teeth. And while glow-in-the-dark sharks sound like something you'd see in a sci-fi film, they're totally real, as noted in a 2019 study published in iScience. Researchers were already aware that some shark species produce a glow that only other sharks can see, but now scientists have discovered that \"previously unknown small-molecule metabolites are the cause of the green glow,\" according to CNN. This glow \"helps sharks identify each other and even fight against infection on a microbial level.\"\n18 Some snails have hairy shells.\nWhile it's not a secret that snails have shells, you probably didn't know that some actually have hairy shells. These hairs are rather handy to have, as they help a snail stick to wet surfaces like leaves.\n19 Cowbirds use secret passwords to teach their young.\nCowbirds lay their eggs in other bird species' nests, which means that the little ones eventually need to reconnect with their own kind when the time is right. And when that time comes, the young birds have a trick for figuring out who to reach out to. \"Juvenile cowbirds readily recognize and affiliate with other cowbirds. That's because they have a secret handshake or password,\" according to Science Daily. To put it more simply, they use \"a specific chatter call\" to beckon each other.\n20 Baby Tasmanian devils make life-long friendships.\nIf you have best friends who have been around since you were a child, then you have something in common with Tasmanian devils. Research has shown that Tasmanian devils form bonds when they're young that last for the rest of their lives. As Zoos Victoria's Marissa Parrott told IFL Science, \"In the wild, when baby devils leave their mums, we believe they all socialize together.\" As the website notes, \"young devils have their own dens,\" \"engage in friendly sleep-overs,\" and when given the chance, they prefer \"to share with their \u2026 original friends.\"\n21 A grizzly bear's bite is strong enough to crush a bowling ball.\nThose who find themselves in the presence of a grizzly bear will surely want to stay out of reach of this animal's super sharp claws. But they'll certainly also want to keep out of the grizzly's mouth, because these creatures \"have a bite-force of over 8,000,000 pascals,\" according to National Geographic. That means grizzly bears can literally crush a bowling ball between their jaws. Yikes!\n22 Humpback whales use bubbles to hunt.\nYou might think that a whale's massive size is the only edge they'd need when it comes to hunting in the open waters. But humpback whales actually team up to use a \"bubble-net\" technique in order to catch their prey. \"Sometimes, the whales will swim in an upward spiral and blow bubbles underwater, creating a circular 'net' of bubbles that makes it harder for fish to escape,\" Science News reports.\n23 A housefly buzzes in an F key.\nWhen you hear a housefly buzzing around your home, you might be annoyed by the persistent sound. However, the next time it happens, try to soothe yourself by noting that the airborne pest is actually buzzing in an F key. How melodious!\n24 Moray eels have a second pair of \"Alien-style\" jaws.\nIf you already thought that eels were kind of creepy, then this fact isn't going to make you feel any better about them. Moray eels have what's called pharyngeal jaws, which are a second pair of \"Alien-style\" jaws that are located in the throat and emerge to grasp prey before pulling the unfortunate meal down into the eel's gullet.\n25 Ducks can surf.\nOver in New Zealand, surfers have noticed the same thing that those who ride the waves in California have witnessed: ducks can surf. The birds do so in order to catch food or simply to move through the water quickly. Sports reporter Francis Malley spotted a female duck and her babies catching a wave and told the New Zealand Herald, \"The mother was surfing on her belly on the whitewash. I've never surfed with ducks before so this was a first.\"\n26 Slow lorises are the only venomous primates.\nThey may be cute, but their bite can kill. According to Popular Science, these adorable animals secrete toxins from a gland in the crook of their inner arms. Their bites have caused anaphylactic shock and even death in humans. Better watch out!\n27 Pigeons can do math.\nYou might think of pigeons as\u2026 not that smart. But it turns out, they're actually quite intelligent. In fact, one 2011 study published in the journal Science found that the birds are capable of doing math at the same level as monkeys. During the study, the pigeons were asked to compare nine images, each containing a different number of objects. The researchers found that the birds were able to rank the images in order of how many objects they contained. Put simply, they learned that the birds could count!\n28 Zebra stripes act as a natural bug repellant.\nCows may benefit from artificial stripes, but zebras have the real deal. One 2012 report published in the Journal of Experimental Biology suggests that zebras' black and white stripes may be an evolutionary feature to fend off harmful horsefly bites. \"A zebra-striped horse model attracts far fewer horseflies than either homogeneous black, brown, grey or white equivalents,\" the researchers wrote.\n29 Wild chimps like to drink.\nHumans aren't the only animals who enjoy a drink or two. A 2015 study published in the journal Royal Society Open Science reveals that chimpanzees in Guinea had a fondness for imbibing fermented palm sap and getting tipsy in the process.\n30 Sea otters are adept at using tools.\nWhile many scientists believe that tool use among dolphins is a relatively new phenomenon, a 2017 study published in Biology Letters suggests that otters may have been using tools for millions of years. Sea otters frequently use rocks to break open well-armored prey, such as snails.\n31 Frogs can freeze without dying.\nWhy tolerate the cold when you could just freeze yourself solid? According to Kenneth Storey, a professor at Carleton University in Ottawa, frogs undergo repeated freeze-thaw cycles. \"We have false springs here all the time where it gets really warm and all the snow melts and then suddenly\u2014bam\u2014the wind comes from the north and it's back down to minus 10, minus 15 [Celsius], and they're fine,\" Storey told National Geographic.\n32 Male horses have way more teeth than their female counterparts.\nMale horses have 40 to 42 permanent teeth, while females have just 36 to 40. According to the VCA Animal Hospital, the original purpose of these extra teeth was as fighting weaponry.\n33 Koalas sleep up to 22 hours a day.\nIf you thought your cat was sleepy, just wait until you hear about koalas. According to the Australian Koala Foundation, these cuties sleep between 18 and 22 hours a day. The koalas' diets require a lot of energy to digest, which is why they've got to nap so much.\n34 A group of ferrets is called a business.\nNo, it's not because they're so professional\u2014it's a modernized form of \"busyness,\" the word originally used to describe a group of these weasel-related mammals.\n35 Octopuses can taste with their arms.\nAnd yes, they are called arms, not tentacles. According to the Library of Congress, the animals can taste and grab with the suckers on their arms. Even more impressive? Octopuses are capable of moving at speeds of up to 25 miles per hour.\n36 Dolphins have names for one another.\nYou already know that dolphins are smart. But did you know that they even have their own names? One 2013 study published in PNAS found that bottlenose dolphins develop specific whistles for one another.\n37 Reindeer eyes turn blue in the winter.\nReindeers have beautiful baby blues\u2014but only in the winter! According to the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, \"the eyes of Arctic reindeer change color through the seasons from gold to blue, adapting to extreme changes of light levels in their environment.\" The change in color impacts how light is reflected through the animals' retina, and improves their vision.\n38 Giraffes have black tongues.\nScientists believe that it's so they don't get sunburns while they eat. The animals' tongues are also around 20 inches long.\n39 Alligators will let manatees swim ahead of them.\nIn busy waters, manatees will nudge alligators to get in front, and alligators generally oblige.\n40 Sloths can take up to a month to completely digest a single leaf.\nEverything about life is slow for these sleepy mammals. Most sloths will only have a bowel movement once a week, and it can take them up to 30 days to completely digest a single leaf. For comparison, it takes the average human 12 to 48 hours to ingest, digest, and eliminate waste from food.\n41 Adult cats only meow at humans.\nYou probably know that cats love to talk to their humans. But did you know you're unlikely to see your feline friend interact the same way with another cat? That's because other than kittens meowing at their mothers, cats don't meow at other cats.\n42 Elephants and humans have similar self-soothing techniques.\nElephant calves will suck their trunks to comfort themselves. The babies do it for the same reason humans do (it mimics the action of suckling their mothers).\n43 Female bats give birth to babies that weigh up to a third of their weight.\nAccording to Bat Conservation International, bats give birth to babies\u2014known as pups\u2014that can weigh as much as one-third of the mother's weight. If that doesn't sound like a lot, imagine a person giving birth to a baby that weighed 40 pounds.\n44 Painted turtles survive winter by breathing through their butts.\nNot all creatures head to warmer climates when it gets cold out, and that means they need to learn to survive in chilly conditions. Painted turtles need to adapt to frozen ponds, which restrict their access to the air above the water. They do that by breathing through their butts\u2014specifically, the all-purpose orifice called the cloaca. Thanks to a process called cloacal respiration, the turtles are able to get oxygen directly from the water around them.\n45 Dogs have way fewer taste buds than humans.\nWhile you may think that Fido has the same dinnertime experience as you do, he's actually got a much different taste bud arrangement. Humans have about 9,000 taste buds, while dogs have only around 1,700. And while they can identify the same four taste sensations as people, dogs are not fond of salt.\n46 Otters have the world's thickest fur.\nThey're thought to have up to one million hairs per square inch. Their fur consists of two layers and is designed to trap a layer of air next to their skin so their skin doesn't get wet.\n47 Alligators can grow for more than 30 years.\nAccording to a 2018 study published in Copeia, alligators often haven't hit their full size until 33.\n48 A group of owls is called a parliament.\nTheir legislative powers, however, are still up for debate.\n49 Snow leopards don't roar.\nSnow leopards have less-developed vocal cords than their fellow large cats, meaning that they can't roar, but make a purr-like sound called a chuff instead. For a 2010 study published in the Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, scientists researched why some cats have a higher-pitched meow than others. They found that it's not size that determines a kitty's call, but habitat.\n50 Axolotls can regenerate their parts.\nThe salamanders are the only vertebrates that can replace their skin, limbs, tail, jaws, and spines at any age. On the flip side, humans can regenerate lost limb buds as embryos and fingertips as young children.\n51 A group of rhinos is called a crash.\nIndividual male rhinos are referred to as bulls, and females as cows.\n52 Squirrels will adopt orphans.\nTurns out, squirrels have an intense motherly instinct. One 2010 study by researchers at the University of Guelph found that the animals will take in the orphaned pups of their late family members.\n\"Social animals, including lions and chimpanzees, are often surrounded by relatives, so it's not surprising that a female would adopt an orphaned family member because they have already spent a lot of time together,\" said lead researcher Andrew McAdam, an evolutionary biologist. \"But red squirrels live in complete isolation and are very territorial. The only time they will allow another squirrel on their territory is the one day a year when the females are ready to mate or when they are nursing their pups.\"\n53 Giant anteaters have two-foot tongues.\nAccording to National Geographic, it's the longest tongue of any known mammal.\n54 Cows have best friends.\nCows have stronger social ties than you might think. One 2013 study conducted by researchers at the University of Northampton found that when cows were separated from their BFFs, their heart rates increased as a sign of stress.\n55 Moths experience love at first scent.\nWhen a male moth catches a whiff of a female moth, he'll travel miles to find her\u2060\u2014based off her scent alone. According to the experts at Audobon, \"they don't know what the female sounds like, or even what she looks like. But when they smell her, boy, do they know it, and they use her seductive musk to track her down.\"\n56 Horses have distinct facial expressions.\nHorses can make 17 facial movements, which is 3 more than chimps and only 10 fewer than humans, according to a 2015 study published in PLOS One.\n57 Deer can run up to 35 miles per hour.\nYes, white-tailed deer can hit top speeds of 35 miles per hour. Think that's fast? Reindeer can run up to 50 miles per hour.\n58 An octopus has three hearts.\nOctopuses have two more hearts than you do. Two hearts are used to pump blood to their gills, while the third brings blood to the rest of their body. If that's not enough, they also have nine brains.\n59 Some worms can jump.\nCertain species of the Amynthas worm, which have recently been identified in the Midwestern United States, can jump and detach their tails when disturbed.\n60 Crocodiles can live up to 100.\nNile crocodiles can live for a full century. And they can do a lot of damage over the course of those 100 years: Approximately 200 people die every year from Nile crocodile attacks.\n61 Ravens are masters of deception.\nJust how smart are ravens? A 2002 study published in Animal Behaviour found that these tricky birds have the ability to deceive each other. The entire corvid family\u2014which includes crows, ravens, and jays\u2014is exceptionally intelligent. These birds have also been known to play pranks on one another, and to tease other animals.\n62 Rats laugh.\nWhile scientists don't exactly think they have a sense of humor, rats will make a laugh-like sound when tickled.\n63 Tigers have striped skin.\nYou might think it's just their fur, but no, tigers have striped skin. And speaking of those stripes, much like our fingerprints, they're unique to every tiger.\n64 Cats recognize their own name but choose not to respond.\nSorry, cat owners, you're not just being paranoid: Your pet does know when you're calling their name, and they're ignoring you anyway. In a 2019 study published in Scientific Reports, researchers discovered that while cats can distinguish their own name, they don't necessarily feel obligated to respond.\n65 Cows produce more milk when listening to slow music.\nCall it a moo-d. Researchers at the University of Leicester School of Psychology found that cows produced 1.54 more pints per day\u2014a 3 percent increase\u2014when they were played slow music, as opposed to more upbeat tunes.\n66 Butterflies taste with their feet.\nNot only do butterflies taste using their feet\u2014the receptors on their legs are also 200 times stronger than human taste buds. When a butterfly lands on a plant, they use these sensors to determine whether or not what they're standing on is edible.\n67 The spur-winged goose's diet makes it poisonous.\nDon't plan on eating a spur-winged goose if you happen to come across one during your travels. These birds, natives of sub-Saharan Africa, have flesh that's often poisonous to humans, thanks to their diet of blister beetles, which contain the deadly cantharidin poison.\n68 Vampire bat saliva keeps blood from clotting.\nVampire bats do more than just bite their prey\u2014they also keep the other animal's blood from clotting. Their saliva works as an anticoagulant, so that the blood can flow freely as they feed. Here's another fun fact: The protein in the anticoagulant has been nicknamed \"Draculin.\" Spooky!\n69 Wombat poop is cube-shaped.\nWombats use their droppings to warn other animals to stay off their turf. Luckily, their cube-shaped poop makes it easy to see that a spot is governed by wombats, as the little squares tend to stay put more easily than spherical droppings would.\n70 Giraffes with darker spots are more dominant.\nYou can learn a lot from the color of a giraffe's spots. According to a 2019 study in Animal Behaviour, giraffes with darker spots are more dominant than giraffes with lighter spots. And not only that: Dark-spotted giraffes also tend to be more solitary.\n71 Orcas can learn to speak dolphin.\nGroups of killer whales have their own dialects that are further influenced by the company they keep. A 2014 study published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America revealed that orcas housed with bottlenose dolphins over a long period of time were able to replicate the dolphins' language.\n72 Queen mole rats make other female mole rats infertile.\nTo ensure her dominance, the queen mole rat works to make it impossible for other female mole rats to have litters. In fact, the queen can produce a substance in her urine that renders other female mole rats infertile.\n73 Horned lizards squirt blood from their eyes.\nThe horned lizard has a pretty impressive trick for evading predators. When a horned lizard finds itself in a perilous situation, it can squirt a stream of blood from its eyes. The predator then runs off, because, well, wouldn't you?\n74 Catfish have taught themselves how to kill pigeons.\nRelax, pigeons\u2014it's not all catfish. But yes, in southwestern France, a group of European catfish have learned to kill pigeons, launching themselves out of the water to grab the sunbathing birds.\n75 Primitive crocodiles could gallop.\nIf you think crocodiles aren't frightening enough, consider this: They used to gallop. While modern-day crocodiles can move surprisingly fast, giant crocodiles during the Cretaceous period could use their legs to chase and kill dinosaurs.\nAdditional reporting by Desir\u00e9e O."}

One of the fun facts about animals that look innocent, like the platypus, are their strange defense mechanisms. The heels of their back feet have spurs that can release venom, making these wild animals one of the few types of poisonous mammals. While the venom isn\u2019t strong enough to kill a human, it\u2019s extremely painful and can cause swelling and even hyperventilation, and that\u2019s definitely enough to make platypuses one of the innocent-looking animals that are actually dangerous.\n4 / 60 Parkol/Shutterstock Sloths You probably think of sloths as one of the slowest wild animals out there\u2014and they are pretty slow, to be sure! But they actually have a neat talent that you may not know about. They\u2019re skilled swimmers\u2014and they swim about three to four times faster than they usually move! According to Live Science, they do the breaststroke just like humans do, and it\u2019s a vital skill for them to survive in rainforests that have a tendency to flood. If you thought it wasn\u2019t possible for sloths to get any cuter, just imagine one swimming! Or take a look at these adorable sloth pictures you need in your life."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant pandas still face high risk of extinction - Futurity", "url": "https://www.futurity.org/giant-pandas-extinction-habitat-2605412/", "text": "Share this\nArticle Facebook\nTwitter\nEmail You are free to share this article under the Attribution 4.0 International license. University Duke University\nGiant pandas in the wild are more fragmented and isolated than they were 30 years ago and many continue to face a high risk of extinction despite recent gains in their overall numbers, a new study finds.\nClimate change, habitat loss, and reduced breeding viability\u2014an inherent risk in small, remote populations where potential mates are few\u2014could pose a triple whammy for these animals, the research suggests.\nScientists need to find ways to restore connectivity between these populations or introduce new breeding animals into them, the study\u2019s authors say.\n\u201cOur models show that populations with fewer than 30 individuals have, under a best-case scenario, a one in five chance of going extinct in 100 years on average. Some may not be that lucky,\u201d says Stuart Pimm, professor of conservation ecology at Duke University\u2019s Nicholas School of the Environment, who helped design the new study.\nBrighter long-term prospects for giant pandas?\nAs climate change intensifies in coming years, pandas will be driven higher and deeper into China\u2019s mountains in search of their dietary staple, bamboo, and their populations will become even more fragmented and vulnerable to extinction, the models predict.\nThis vulnerability will be heightened by the synchronistic mass flowering, and subsequent mass deaths, of bamboos across large parts of the pandas\u2019 range\u2014an episodic event that, historically, occurs every 65 to 120 years. The next flowering in China is due to occur in the coming decade or two, Pimm says.\nDemographic accidents, such as the premature deaths of breeding-age females or imbalances in the number of male and female offspring born over a period of years, can also speed an isolated population\u2019s demise. So can inbreeding, which reduces fitness.\nTo assess the combined effects of these factors on animals in each of the 33 giant panda populations identified in the Fourth Giant Panda Census in 2015, scientists modeled each animal\u2019s fate from birth to death under dozens of different scenarios.\n\u201cDoing individual-based models is quite time- and labor-intensive but provides a wealth of raw data about the likely fate of these populations, at a granular level that wouldn\u2019t be possible by modeling at a broader scale,\u201d Pimm says.\nThe study comes at a time when giant pandas\u2019 long-term prospects seem to be brightening. Conservation by the Chinese government has helped the species\u2019 wild population rebound in recent decades by an estimated 17%, to around 1,850 individual animals. In recognition of these gains, the IUCN Red List upgraded the pandas\u2019 status from \u201cendangered\u201d to \u201cvulnerable to extinction\u201d five years ago, and earlier this month, the Chinese government followed suit.\nProtected corridors can help\nThe creation of the new Giant Panda National Park that China is developing will further boost some pandas\u2019 odds of survival, Pimm says. When completed, the park will connect 67 existing giant panda reserves in Sichuan, Gansu, and Shaanxi provinces and make it easier for animals there to crossbreed.\nAnimals outside the park won\u2019t be as lucky.\n\u201cThere will still be many lonely pandas who can\u2019t find a date,\u201d Pimm predicts. \u201cAn estimated 59 pandas, or about 3% of the total population, live in 14 geographically isolated populations outside the park\u2019s future boundaries.\n\u201cThere are also four populations with 41 individuals inside the national park that are isolated from other populations by roads and natural barriers. These are the populations our models show as being the most vulnerable to extinction without timely intervention.\u201d\nWhile the number of these unlucky outliers may seem small, with a total species population that\u2019s still shy of 2,000, \u201cany losses are worrisome losses,\u201d Pimm says.\nTo prevent declines, corridors of protected land should be created\u2014or restored, in some cases\u2014to connect the isolated populations to each other and the new park, the study\u2019s authors argue.\nFailing that, new breeding stock should be introduced. One possible way to do this is to train pandas that have been bred and raised in captivity to forage for their own bamboo and then release them into the wild near isolated populations.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the easiest thing in the world. Some are going to starve to death, and no one wants that,\u201d Pimm says. \u201cBut we have to start trying to rescue these isolated populations while there is still time.\u201d\nThe research appears in Nature Ecology & Evolution. Additional coauthors of the study are from the State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences\u2019 Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences in Beijing.\nThe Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences\u2019 Strategic Priority Research Program funded the work.\nSource: Duke University"}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Do Giant Pandas Hibernate in Winter? [Solved]", "url": "https://bestofpanda.com/do-giant-pandas-hibernate-in-winter/", "text": "Do pandas hibernate or migrate in winter? This is a question that has been asked by many people over the course of the years. It is because giant pandas are considered part of the bear family but they seem to live differently.\nIf you are referring to hibernation, the answer is no, but if you are referring to migration, the answer is yes. Giant pandas cannot hibernate in winter, but they migrate to different places. This is due to their diet that is based on bamboo.\nWhat is the big deal with their diet and how does it affect the hibernation of the pandas? Well, let\u2019s all find out in this article. So, I suggest that you keep reading until the end because there\u2019s so much to learn about our cuddly bears.\nWhy Don\u2019t Pandas Hibernate?\nPandas do not hibernate because they have to keep eating bamboo every day. They can\u2019t build the fat reserves necessary for survival during the winter because bamboo has a low nutritional value. This is how their diet affects their hibernation.\nIn the winter, bears and several other animal species go through this long-term sleep phase to survive the cold temperatures, but not the pandas. After all, winter can\u2019t be easy when there is little food and extremely uncomfortable temperatures.\nPandas do not participate in any form of hibernation process. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t like to sleep; they just can\u2019t simply do what others do during winter. Besides, even if it\u2019s not winter, giant pandas sleep around 8 to 12 hours per day.\nNo matter what season it is, giant pandas will always go by their daily routines.\nSince they have relatively little fat, they are less able to protect themselves against cold temperatures. Well, the good thing is that they have thick fur to resist too much cold. They prefer to continue eating bamboo then let themselves die in winter.\nHow Do Pandas Survive Winter?\nGiant pandas survive winter using their thick black and white fur. Another thing that makes them survive is their seasonal migration. When the weather gets cold during winter, they move to lower elevations to find places with warmer temperatures.\nOne study published in 2016 by Liu et. al. looked at factors that lead giant pandas to live in habitats with a temperature of about 64-69 degrees Fahrenheit. Similar studies are vital as China identifies habitat areas for protection and future reintroduction programs.\nEven when they are awake and active during winter, they still try to conserve as much energy as possible. They especially avoid moving around when it\u2019s cold and they stay in caves or burrows to keep warm.\nHow Do Pandas Migrate During Winter?\nPanda bears simply move down to the lower parts of the mountains during winter where there is a warmer temperature than the higher parts. They are actually looking for bamboo at the same time. Well, they have to feed on bamboo regularly to survive.\nMigration among pandas is not the same as what you are expecting. They will not cross countries or continents. but rather they will move to the patches of bamboo on the lower part of the mountain where they live in solitude.\nBesides, they are endemic to Central China, so they will not move far away from it.\nMost giant pandas live in Sichuan or most commonly known as the home of the giant pandas. In this place, there are 216 different bamboo species. However, giant pandas only prefer to eat 32 of them.\nFurthermore, only two of these 32 species are their favorites: the cold arrow bamboo and the unbudged arrow bamboo. Panda bears eat other kinds of bamboo if the two are not available for them.\nAlthough bamboo grows widely in many countries, the bamboo species they like to eat are concentrated in Sichuan and surrounding areas. There is no wonder why pandas only naturally exist in China.\nMoreover, the western regions do not have enough rainfall, which is not suitable for the growth of bamboo. This is the main reason why they migrate but not too far.\nDo Red Pandas Hibernate?\nDuring the winter, red pandas do not hibernate. Their thick fur and bushy tails protect them from harsh weather, such as the cold, wind, and snow. Therefore, none of the pandas (red or giant) do hibernate at all.\nThey live in southern China, Myanmar, Nepal, and India in high mountains within bamboo forests, but unfortunately (like so many other animal species), they are endangered.\nThe red panda has so many names to be defined, including the cat bear, the bearcat, the lesser panda, the fox bear, the Himalayan raccoon, and the firefox.\nBoth pandas have modified wrist bones that contain a thumb that helps them grip bamboo during a feeding. The giant pandas, however, do not care about what part of bamboo they eat, whereas the red pandas eat only the leaves and shoots.\nWell, the size difference explains it all.\nAre Pandas The Only Bears That Don\u2019t Hibernate?\nNo, pandas are not the only ones. Sounds intriguing? Let\u2019s reveal them all.\nThe bears in Southeast Asia namely: sun bears and sloth bears do not undergo hibernation periods. The same is true with the spectacled bears of South America.\nThey all live in climates where food is not in short supply during the winter, therefore, they don\u2019t have to hibernate at all. Sloth bears sometimes hide out in dens during monsoons. Well, if you have the same amount of hair, you would definitely do the same.\nEven the male polar bears do not hibernate. Well, the cold season is no surprise for polar bears; they live with it all their lives. Take it literally from their names.\nLastly, adult male black bears are also known for not hibernating in the cold season. Their winter is spent munching on acorns, beechnuts, and more of the same kind.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nHere are commonly asked questions across the internet related to the topic. Let\u2019s answer them one by one.\nWhat Do Pandas Do Instead Of Hibernating?\nInstead of hibernating, they migrate to lower altitudes and continue their regular life, eating a huge amount of bamboo and sleeping for many hours. Well, it\u2019s good to remember that most bears sleep in the hibernation period except for pandas.\nHow Far Do Pandas Migrate?\nEvery day giant pandas travel around 2.45 miles (4 km) to 6.21 miles (10 km) per day just to look for their favorite food (bamboo). They also spend their time looking for clean water to drink or sometimes swim, and tree shelter to spend their time sleeping.\nWhere Do Pandas Migrate To?\nGiant pandas migrate but not too far from where they live. They only move to lower altitudes during the cold season and go back to high altitudes during the hot season. They can migrate within the mountains (as low as 4000 feet and as high as 11,000 feet).\nWhat Do Panda Bears Do In Winter?\nSince pandas don\u2019t hibernate in the winter, you will see them migrating down the mountains to avoid the extremely cold temperature. They will more likely stop in an area where there are thick bamboo patches. Just as we all expected, they will go here to eat.\nMoreover, they have to eat every day even if the snow is falling. Oftentimes you will see them playing or rolling on snow, which is quite usual for the pandas.\nDo All Pandas Hibernate?\nNo, giant pandas do not hibernate at all. Besides, there is no need because they sleep up to 12 hours daily. It\u2019s like they do daily hibernation.\nHow Long Do Pandas Hibernate?\nLet\u2019s keep in mind that pandas do not hibernate. So, there is no answer to this question. On the other hand, we can say that after the winter season, they will move back to high altitudes to live a lonely life, considering they are solitary animals.\nConclusion\nIn this article, you learned that giant pandas do not hibernate in winter, unlike other bears. However, you also learned that they migrate during the cold season. Pandas cannot stop eating bamboo to survive, so no weather can stop them from eating.\nDuring the winter months, many pandas might seem to be sleeping, but in fact, they are only conserving energy. Their bodies do not receive enough nutrients from the grass and bamboo all year long. Therefore, they have to eat more food to stay healthy.\nEvery animal has their own way of surviving the winter season. We should not abuse them during this vulnerable time. Always remember that each one of them struggles for survival, just like we do.\nHere are some articles that you might find interesting, too.\n1. Say what?! Do you mean a panda can exist in Africa? Is it a fact or a bluff?\n2. Have you seen the whiskers of the pandas? Wait, do they even have whiskers?\n3. What a cute sight! A panda egg! Do pandas lay eggs?

Destruction of the panda's natural habitat. In the eleven years from 1973 to 1984, suitable panda habitat shrunk by 50 per cent in six isolated, but otherwise ideal , areas. A 1998 logging ban implemented by the Chinese government helped to slow the habitat destruction, but poaching and illegal logging are still a problem. 2. Interruption of migration routes. Bamboo, the Panda's main food, flowers (produces seeds and dies) once every 10 to 100 years depending on the species. When the bamboo in one area flowers, pandas have to move to areas that have not flowered. Historically, it was easy for pandas to move from one area to another, but now it is not. Human population has expanded, roads and settlements have been built, and forests have been cleared for agriculture, fuelwood, and timber. These changes make panda migration difficult, often leaving pandas restricted to \"islands of forest.\" 3. Consumption of Wild Meat Although pandas are occasionally hunted for their pelts, most pandas that are injured or killed by poachers are inadvertently harmed when the pandas are caught in traps meant for musk deer, takin, bear, and other animals. Wild meat is sold in the markets and restaurants in cities nearby the reserve. Eating wild meat in China is a threat to panda survival.

Purchasing through these helps us further the A-Z Animals mission to educate about the world's species..\nView all of the Anteater images!\n\u201cA single anteater can consume up to 35,000 ants in one day.\u201c\nAnteater refers to several medium-sized insect-eating mammals found in the Southern Hemisphere. Anteaters are edentate animals, meaning they have no teeth. However, they use their long tongues to eat the insects that comprise the bulk of their diet. Giant anteaters, the most well-known of the four species, can consume as much as 35,000 ants or termites in a single day. Most zoologists will tell you, \u201cDon\u2019t mess with an anteater because it really, really doesn\u2019t want to be friends\u201d\n5 Incredible Anteater Facts\nThe anteater has the longest tongue of any animal in relation to its body size.\nin relation to its body size. The pygmy sloth is one of the anteater\u2019s closest relatives, but their common ancestor is more than 55 million years old .\n. Their legs, which look like panda faces, are part of the giant anteater\u2019s protective coloring. Baby anteaters have similar coloring, which allows the baby to \u201cvanish\u201d while making its mother look bigger .\n. The paws of all four species feature enormous, long and sharp claws that require the animals to walk on their knuckles or wrists to avoid stabbing themselves.\nAnteater Scientific Name\nThe giant anteater\u2019s scientific name is Myrmecophaga tridactyla, which is Greek in origin and means three-fingered anteater. This is the animal that most people think of when referring to anteaters. Other anteaters are southern tamanduas (Tamandua tetradactyla), northern tamanduas (Tamandua mexicana) and silky anteaters (Cyclopes didactylus), the smallest animal in this classification. Tamandua means anteater in the native language Tupi and in Brazilian Portuguese. Tetradactyla is Greek for four claws. Cyclopes, also from the Greek, means squirrel, while didactylus means two-toed.\nAnteater Appearance and Behavior\nOf the four anteater species, the giant anteater is the largest, usually measuring five to eight feet long from nose to tail, weighing up to 140 pounds. It has a long nose and a narrow head with small eyes and round ears. Giant anteaters have coarse grey or brown hair with a white-and-black stripe running the length of its body. The bushy tail is two to three feet long.\nGiant anteaters are animals with long front claws, which they curl under to walk. They use their powerful legs and claws to ward off larger animals and can become aggressive when cornered, rearing up on their hind legs, using their tails for balance. They are generally asocial, avoiding other animals, including other anteaters, only coming together to mate.\nThese animals have poor vision, so they use their keen sense of smell, which is 40 times more powerful than humans, to find food. Giant anteaters have tongues that can reach two feet, beginning at their breastbones. Backward-facing spiny projections cover their tongues, which, combined with their sticky saliva, helps collect bugs.\nNorthern Tamanduas are much smaller than giant anteaters, their body length ranging from 1.5 feet to 2.5 feet, with tails measuring 1.3 feet to 2.2 feet. These anteaters are fawn to brownish in color with a distinct, black \u201cV\u201d running down their backs. These anteaters are active both in the day or night, usually for about eight-hour stretches and spend about half of their time in trees, many of which are hollow.\nSouthern tamanduas, also known as collared anteaters, range from 1.7 feet to 2.9 feet, with tails measuring 1.3 feet to 1.9 feet. Some have strong black markings on a body that is blond, tan or brown. The underside and the end of the tail are hairless and somewhat scaly. They are primarily nocturnal but are occasionally active during the day. Collared anteaters spend much of their time foraging arboreally as they are somewhat clumsy on the ground. When threatened in a tree, this anteater may grasp a branch with its hind feet and tail, using its powerful forearms for self-defense.\nTamanduas are sometimes called the \u201cstinkers of the forest\u201d because of their ability to detonate a skunk-like stink bomb from a gland under its tail when it is threatened.\nSilky anteaters are, by far, the smallest of the species, weighing less than a pound. They are nocturnal creatures, living high up in trees, rarely descending to the ground. These animals almost look like little creampuffs because of their silky fur that resembles the seed pods of the Ceiba trees where they primarily live. They are difficult to find in the wild, so little is known about their social habits.\nGiant Anteater seaching for food Borsi112 / Creative Commons\nAnteater Habitat\nThe giant anteater is an animal that lives in the grasslands, forests, jungles and lower mountain regions of Central and South America. To thrive, they require large grassy areas that are abundant in ants along with patches of forest.\nNorthern tamanduas live in rainforests, plantations, gallery forest and arid savannahs. They often live beside streams and trees with abundant amounts of vines, which often house ant and termite nests. When not active, they rest in hollow trees or burrows of other animals. In Panama, northern tamanduas often swim between islands.\nSouthern tamanduas live in South America, ranging from Venezuela and Trinidad southward to northern Argentina, southern Brazil and Uruguay at elevations up to 6,500 feet. These anteaters also commonly live near streams and rivers.\nAnteater Population\nGiant anteater population numbers are declining primarily due to habitat loss and over-hunting by humans. Reports indicate that about 5,000 to 10,000 individuals are left in the wild. According to IUCN, the tamanduas and silky anteaters are relatively widespread, but no population estimates are available.\nAnteater Diet\nAll types of anteaters use their sharp claws to tear into anthills and insect nests. They eat quickly, flicking their long tongues up to 150 times per minute. Most giant anteaters and tamanduas feed on anthills or termite mounds in less than 40 seconds. These quick meals have a two-fold purpose. For one, they leave some of the insects in their nests to repopulate so that they have a continual source of food. Secondly, they avoid painful stings from ants when the insects begin to realize the danger to their nests. Silky anteaters consume insects found in the tops of trees. Southern tamanduas avoid eating army ants and leaf-eating ants as these species have strong chemical defenses. They also eat honey and bees.\nAnteater Predators and Threats\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List officially classifies giant anteaters as vulnerable, as they are the most threatened mammals in Central America and are extinct in Guatemala, El Salvador and Uruguay. The loss of their grassland habitats is a major threat as sugar cane growers regularly burn their fields, ultimately affecting anteater habitats. Some humans hunt them for food, while others kill them simply because they consider anteaters to be pests. In the Brazilian Cerrado Biome, many are killed by road traffic. Cougars and jaguars are their natural predators.\nThe Iber\u00e1 Project has rescued more than 10 orphaned anteaters and reintroduced them to the wild in Argentina. Conservationists are collecting data in the Cerrado Biome to determine how roadways affect these animals in the hope that new protections will be enacted.\nNorthern tamanduas are not considered threatened. Their natural predators include jaguars, large snakes, and eagles. Harpy eagles, eagle-hawks and spectacled owls prey on silky anteaters. The conservation status of tamanduas and silky anteaters is listed as least concern.\nAnteater Reproduction and Life Cycle\nAll female anteaters give birth to a single baby, although the gestation period varies by species and sometimes by region. Giant anteaters have a gestation period of about 190 days, while tamandua gestation ranges from 130 to 150 days. Silky anteaters have a 120-day gestation.\nFemale anteaters give birth standing up. Babies immediately climb onto their mothers\u2019 backs and have a full coat of hair and adult-like markings. They spend much of their nursing period on their mothers\u2019 backs to remain safe from predators, remaining there until they are about half the size of their mothers. They can spend up to two years with their mother and usually become independent when the female becomes pregnant again. Male anteaters hide their testicles inside their body; little is known about their breeding habits, but they can breed as often as every nine months. Anteaters reach sexual maturity between 2.5 and 4 years. Their lifespan is 14 years in the wild and as much as 26 years in captivity.\nTamandua females are polyestrous, meaning they will come into heat multiple times during the mating season if they don\u2019t become impregnated. Mating normally occurs in the fall, with birth in the spring. These babies also cling to their mothers\u2019 backs, but the female will sometimes place a baby on a safe branch while she forages. Their maximum lifespan is approximately 9 years.\nSilky anteater females place their young in a nest of dry leaves inside a tree trunk. Both parents raise the young, with the male sometimes carrying the baby on its back. Parents feed their offspring by regurgitating semi-digested insects. These animals have an average lifespan of 2.3 years.\nAnteaters in the Zoo\nAbout 90 giant anteaters live in zoos around the world. Breeding occurs year-round in captivity, although births are rare. The San Diego Zoo is one of the few facilities that have anteaters. The first anteaters came from Paraguay in 1937, and the first birth at the zoo occurred in 1980. Their diets may be different, too, with anteaters in captivity getting a specially manufactured high protein diet along with fruit and meat in addition to insects.\nBoth the San Diego Zoo and Denver Zoo often keep their anteaters off exhibit, using them primarily as animal ambassadors, meaning they are only displayed for special events or outreach programs.\nView all 122 animals that start with A"}

Since becoming an icon for the conservation movement in the 1980s, 67 panda reserves and countless wildlife corridors have been created in the bamboo forested mountain ranges of central China. The most recent census suggests all that effort has paid off. There are 1,864 pandas living in the wild today, up from 1,000 in the late 1970s.\nBut in a new study, researchers discovered that what\u2019s good for the panda may not necessarily be good for the rest of the ecosystem. After studying images from camera traps over ten years, they found that large carnivores \u2013 the leopard, snow leopard, wolf and dhole (an Asian wild dog) \u2013 have retreated from where giant pandas have thrived. Their numbers appear to have fallen significantly in these panda reserves, and the researchers note that the wolf and dhole may be functionally extinct within them, while the tiger has already been driven to extinction here. Panda conservation doesn\u2019t appear to be benefiting other species, or the wider ecosystem.\nThese findings shake the foundations of one of conservation\u2019s most enduring ideas \u2013 that investing time and money into protecting particular large, influential species can pay dividends for the other species and habitats they coexist with. In the aftermath of that revelation, what do we really know about how to protect ecosystems and save wildlife from extinction?\nHow to think about ecosystems\nSingle species conservation was the dominant idea during the latter half of the 20th century. Conservation groups and governments identified particular species in need of urgent help and used their images to raise public support to help save them from extinction.\nThe poster children of this approach were the giant panda and the tiger. Both of which have been success stories, for the target species at least.\nBut while lavishing these charismatic species with attention and resources, this approach tends to overlook less attractive species, such as worms, despite them potentially having more ecological value.\nToday, conservationists place much greater emphasis on protecting ecosystems and entire landscapes. The logic being that you can more effectively maintain an area\u2019s ecology if you treat it as a functional system.\nJason Gilchrist, Author provided\nA useful analogy is to compare an ecosystem with an organism, such as the human body. Each is made up of many working systems, whose roles are maintained by species in the case of the former, and organs in the latter.\nA respiratory system needs healthy lungs, but both depend on the rest of the body\u2019s systems. The lungs need healthy arms and legs to find and collect nourishment. The digestive system needs to be able to process that food to unlock the nutrients for the rest of the body, while the circulatory system needs to transport them to the lungs so they can do their work to keep the organism alive.\nAlternatively, replace our organism with an aeroplane. For the aeroplane to fly and land safely, all the components need to work. If an engineer only maintains one component, like the engine, and ignores the wings, wheels and navigation system, the flight is going to end badly.\nThe lesson from both analogies is that all components and the roles they perform are necessary for keeping the whole functional and healthy. An aeroplane may only tolerate the loss of so many rivets, before losing one that\u2019s vital, or losing enough to cause mechanical breakdown. Losing the function of one organ can cause multiple systems to fail within the body.\nFocusing on a single species in conservation isn\u2019t necessarily wrong, though. A focal species can act as a flagship, an ambassador that raises support (and money) for conservation of an entire area. Pandas are very good at this.\nBut there are also umbrella species. For example, beavers modify their habitats so extensively that they create numerous niches for other species to occupy. In that sense they\u2019re like an umbrella, that if protected, will provide shelter for other species.\nSo why did panda-targeted conservation fail to revive populations of large carnivores in central China? Well, a panda\u2019s habitat requirements are small compared to a wolf\u2019s or a leopard\u2019s, and the threats facing them in the wild are very different. Pandas are also famous for their specialised diet \u2013 a carnivore turned herbivore \u2013 and so their needs differ greatly from your average large predator. Put simply, a habitat catered to sedate, bamboo-munching pandas isn\u2019t likely to help a nomadic, meat-loving leopard.\nRead more: How conserving nature's 'umbrella' species could benefit whole habitats\nConserving large carnivores\nLarge carnivores don\u2019t have it easy worldwide. They need large areas of suitable habitat and lots of prey. In most areas they once occupied, humans have destroyed habitat, removed native prey species and killed large carnivores by gun, trap or poison, either because they hunt livestock or because they are seen as a danger.\nThe tiger is one of the few large carnivores whose populations have increased in recent years. India has seen its tiger population grow by a third since 2014. Considering the challenges of coexisting with these large predators \u2013 animals that occasionally kill humans \u2013 this success is impressive.\nIndia\u2019s approach to tiger conservation prizes tolerance, education and working closely with the communities that live alongside this species above all else. Part of that education is recognising the tiger as just one part of the ecosystem, all of which needs protection.\nRohan Chakravarty, Author provided\nWhat the panda study tells us is that we cannot assume a flagship species will also be an umbrella species. While individual species are important, some are more important than others for maintaining a healthy ecosystem."}

They live in bamboo forests, which are at risk due to climate change.\nAre albino pandas endangered?\nGiant pandas are an endangered species and albinism doesn\u2019t occur in a lot of animals \u2014 so the Albino Panda is rarest of the rare.\nAre humans on the endangered list?\nGENEVA \u2013 Nearly a quarter of all deaths worldwide are linked to environmental issues. That\u2019s 12.6 million deaths every year, according to WHO. \u201cHuman beings really are the most important endangered species,\u201d said Margaret Chan, WHO\u2019s outgoing Director-General.\nDo any zoos in the us have pandas?\nGiant pandas currently live at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.; Zoo Atlanta in Atlanta, Georgia; the San Diego Zoo in San Diego, California; and the Memphis Zoo in Memphis, Tennessee. These zoos participate in the Giant Panda Species Survival Plan, overseen by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\nDo humans eat pandas?\nThough humans apparently ate panda in prehistoric times, contemporary Chinese have little taste for the animal. There is an oft-cited saying that Chinese people will \u201ceat anything with four legs except the table\u201d \u2014 including braised camel hump, monkey brains, and shark\u2019s fin on the occasional (luxe) Chinese menu.\nHow long have pandas been endangered?\nGiant pandas first became endangered in 1990 due to excessive poaching in the 80s and deforestation, depleting their bamboo food source. A fickle species, bamboo can grow extensively in mountainous or barren lands, but then dies in the winter.\nIs panda endangered 2021?\nBut this summer, pandas also became a global symbol of conservation success. Chinese officials announced that the animals\u2014whose wild population has almost doubled after 30 years of government-led recovery efforts\u2014are no longer endangered.\nWhat day is panda day?\nDid you know March 16th is National Panda Day? Here are some adorable pandas and some fun facts about them to brighten up your day!\nWhat does a kangaroo taste like?\nKangaroo has a bold, earthy flavor with a mild hint of gaminess. It isn\u2019t as flavorsome as venison, but is stronger than lamb or beef. The dark red flesh is very lean and is comparable to chicken or rabbit. When cooked correctly, the meat will be tender, more so than that of deer.\nWhat species is not extinct?\n1. Southern White Rhinoceros. Not to be confused with the Northern White Rhino, of which there are only 2 females left, the Southern White Rhino is the second largest land mammal on earth.\nWhere are pandas on the endangered list?\nChina has announced that giant pandas are no longer an endangered species, thanks to successful breeding efforts. With more than 1,800 pandas currently in the wild, the beloved animals have now been re-designated as a \u201cvulnerable species.\u201d\nWhy apes are endangered?\nHumanity\u2019s population expansion is the main cause for the extinction threat, with 5 billion humans living in countries with primates. Habitat loss due to logging, mining and agriculture; hunting; the illegal pet trade; and climate change are all top reasons for the decline, Garber said.\nWhy are pandas almost extinct?\nOne the main reasons that panda populations have declined is habitat destruction. As the human population in China continues to grow, pandas\u2019 habitat gets taken over by development, pushing them into smaller and less livable areas. Habitat destruction also leads to food shortages.\nWhy are pandas considered vulnerable?\nDriven nearly to extinction by habitat loss and poaching, these elusive and secretive mammals are among the rarest in the world, with only an estimated 1,800 remaining in the wild. The low reproductive rate of giant pandas makes them more vulnerable to threats and extinction.\nWhy monkey is endangered?\nHabitat loss due to logging, mining and agriculture; hunting; the illegal pet trade; and climate change are all top reasons for the decline, Garber said.\nDo pandas eat humans?\nGiant panda attacks on human are rare, especially by those bred in city zoos. The giant panda is a mammal classified into order Carnivora, suborder Caniformia, family Ursidae, and subfamily Ailuropodinae [ 1 ], and lives in the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Gansu. Considered a Chinese national treasure, the giant panda is regarded as having a gentle temperament and is protected under the First-Grade State Protection Act by the Chinese Government [ 2 ]. We present three cases of giant panda attacks on humans at the Panda House at Beijing Zoo from September 2006 to June 2009 to warn people of the giant panda\u2019s potentially dangerous behavior. The clinical treatment was conducted according to the World Medical Association (WMA) Declaraton of Helsinki-Ethical principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects.\nAre pandas cuddly?\nDespite being bears, pandas are cuddly, gentle creatures. Though pandas have developed into the habit of eating bamboo, their canines and claws are well developed, and the musculature in their limbs and jaws is can inflict serious damage upon humans and other animals as well.\nAre pandas tasty?\nA panda bear tastes like a polar bear with black patches or a black bear with white patches. Since those bears are so rare these days carving a steak or roast off of one would get me into so much trouble it would most certainly not be worth the effort.\nDo all pandas have chinese names?\n32 Famous Pandas Around the World They are originated in the Sichuan Province so that their names are in Chinese. Their names are romanized in pinyin. For example, the name \u767d\u96f2 translates to Bai Yun in pinyin, which means White Cloud.\nDo bamboo products harm pandas?\nThe variety of bamboo that pandas depend on as a food source is different from the larger, industrial, woody variety that is used for flooring and furniture and generally grows in different provinces. Purchasing bamboo products therefore should not impact the panda\u2019s food resource.\nShould pandas be allowed to go extinct?\nBut pandas also play a crucial role in China\u2019s bamboo forests by spreading seeds and helping the vegetation to grow. \u2026 So by protecting pandas, we\u2019re helping to safeguard the broader environment, which so many people and animals depend on. Pandas themselves are also economically and culturally valuable."}

It is Japan's oldest zoo, opened on March 20, 1882. It is a five-minute walk from the Park Exit of Ueno Station, with convenient access from Tokyo's public-transportation network. The Ueno Zoo Monorail, the first monorail in the country, connects the eastern and western parts of the grounds.\nThe zoo is in Ueno Park, a large urban park that is from home to museums, a small amusement park, and other attractions. The zoo is closed on Mondays (Tuesday if Monday is a holiday).\nHistory [ edit ]\nThe zoo started life as a menagerie attached to the National Museum of Natural History. In 1881, responsibility for this menagerie was handed to naturalist and civil servant Tanaka Yoshio, who oversaw its transition into a public zoo. The ground was originally estate of the imperial family, but was bestowed (\u6069\u8cdc, onshi, forming the first part of the name in Japanese, untranslated officially) to the municipal government in 1924 \u2014 along with Ueno Park \u2014 on the occasion of crown prince Hirohito's wedding.\nWorld War II [ edit ]\nIn August 1943, the administrator of Tokyo, Shigeo \u014cdachi, ordered that all \"wild and dangerous animals\" at the zoo be killed, claiming that bombs could hit the zoo and escaped animals would wreak havoc in the streets of Tokyo. Requests by the staff at the zoo for a reprieve, or to evacuate the animals elsewhere, were refused. The animals were executed primarily by poisoning, strangulation or by simply placing the animals on starvation diets. A memorial service was held for the animals in September 1943 (while two of the elephants were still starving) and a permanent memorial (built anew in 1975) can be found in the Ueno Zoo.\nShortly after the March 1945 bombings of Tokyo, the Japanese placed U.S. Army Air Force navigator and bombardier Ray \"Hap\" Halloran on display naked in a Ueno Zoo tiger cage so civilians could walk in front of the cage and view the B-29 prisoner.\nRecent renovations [ edit ]\nThe zoo provides animals an environment similar to the natural habitat. In recent years, the old-fashioned cages of the past have been replaced with modern habitats, such as the \"Gorilla Woods,\" built after two well-publicized mishaps in 1999.\nAnimals [ edit ]\nPolar Bear at the Ueno Zoo\nTiger at the Ueno Zoo\nThe zoo is home to more than 3,000 individuals representing over 400 species. The Sumatran tiger, and western lowland gorilla head the list of the zoo's population. Ueno has more species on exhibition than any other zoo in Japan.\nAt some point, redistribution of the animals among Tokyo's other zoos (including Tama Zoo and Inokashira Nature Park) left Ueno without a lion. However, in response to public demand, Ueno borrowed a female from the Yokohama Municipal Zoo.[citation needed]\nPrincipal animals [ edit ]\nWestern lowland gorilla at the Ueno Zoo\nGiant panda at Ueno Zoo\nAfter the death of Giant panda Ling Ling in 2008, Ueno Zoo was without a member of this species for the first time since 1972. Two new giant pandas arrived from the Chinese Wolong Nature Reserve in February 2011. The male panda, Billy (\u6bd4\u529b \u30d3\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc) was renamed in Ueno to L\u012bl\u012b (\u529b\u529b \u30ea\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc) to emphasize his playful vitality. The female's name Siennyu (\u4ed9\u5973 \u30b7\u30a3\u30a8\u30f3\u30cb\u30e5 \u2018Fairy\u2019) was changed to Shinshin (\u771f\u771f \u30b7\u30f3\u30b7\u30f3), referring to purity (\u7d14\u771f) and innocence (\u5929\u771f). The new names were based on a public poll. The final choices picked by the zoo were, however, not among top choices. Reduplication is very common in panda names.\nNotable species [ edit ]\nSee also [ edit ]\nReferences [ edit ]\nFurther reading [ edit ]\nItoh, Mayumi (2010).

Fortunately, for its fellow mammals, the Giant Sloth was restricted to South America, which was cut off from the earth's other continents during most of the Cenozoic Era and thus bred its own particular assortment of plus-sized fauna (a bit like the bizarre marsupials of modern-day Australia). When the central American isthmus formed, about three million years ago, populations of Megatherium migrated to North America, eventually spawning giant-sized relatives like Megalonyx, the fossils of which were described in the late 18th century by the future U.S. President Thomas Jefferson.\nGiant sloths like Megatherium led much different lifestyles than their modern relatives. Judging by its huge, sharp claws, which measured almost a foot long, paleontologists believe Megatherium spent most of its time rearing up on its hind legs and ripping the leaves off trees, but it may also have been an opportunistic carnivore, slashing, killing and eating its fellow, slow-moving South American herbivores. In this regard, Megatherium is an interesting case study in convergent evolution: if you ignore its thick coat of fur, this mammal was anatomically very similar to the tall, pot-bellied, razor-clawed breed of dinosaurs known as therizinosaurs (the most imposing genus of which was the huge, feathered Therizinosaurus), which went extinct about 60 million years earlier. Megatherium itself went extinct shortly after the last Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago, most likely from a combination of habitat loss and hunting by early Homo sapiens.\nAs you might expect, Megatherium captured the imagination of the public just beginning to come to terms with the concept of giant extinct animals (much less the theory of evolution, which wasn't formally proposed, by Charles Darwin, until the mid-19th century). The first identified specimen of the Giant Sloth was discovered in Argentina in 1788, and definitively pegged as a sloth a few years later by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier (who at first thought Megatherium used its claws to climb trees, and then decided it burrowed underground instead!) Subsequent specimens were discovered over the next few decades in various other South American countries, including Chile, Bolivia, and Brazil, and were some of the world's best-known and best-loved prehistoric animals until the start of the golden age of dinosaurs."}

You probably know what a panda looks like - it is very large and has a distinctive black and white coat. Giant pandas mainly eat bamboo but will also eat some small animals.\nWhy is it endangered?\nThe giant panda is one of the world's rarest animals and it is very shy. The giant panda eats a lot of bamboo. As people cut down more and more bamboo to clear land for building, industry and farming, the panda loses its food source and its home. The giant panda is very slow to reproduce, it has only a few babies during its life, and this also contributes to its vulnerability.\nNow that people have realised that pandas are so endangered they have started to protect them.

High up in the mountains, it gets cold a lot, but that doesn't bother the red pandas. They can wrap their tails around themselves like blankets to keep warm.\nRed pandas live in forests in the mountains and like to spend most of their time in trees. Their red-brown color is good camouflage in the forests because a lot of red-brown moss grows on the tree trunks. The red pandas blend right in with the moss! Red pandas also have feet that are built for climbing, with flexible ankles and claws to grab hold of the tree trunks.\nToday, red pandas are in danger because people cut down their forests to make room for fields or to get wood for fuel.\nDiet\nLike giant pandas, red pandas mostly eat a green leafy plant called bamboo. But red pandas also eat all kinds of other plants and roots, the eggs of other animals and even small birds.\nRed pandas are most active at dawn, when the sun is rising, and at dusk, when the sun is setting.

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Giant Panda Breeding Efforts Have Actually Been Really Successful", "url": "https://gizmodo.com/giant-panda-breeding-efforts-have-actually-been-really-1614308529", "text": "Pandas are typically thought of as a lost cause. They're one of the most endangered species on the planet; just 2500 giant pandas live in the wild. They're notoriously difficult to breed; zoos keep them around primarily to attract tourists rather than for any ostensible conservation benefit. At least, that's the perception.\nUntil as recently as the 1990s, efforts were indeed plagued by low rates of conception and high rates of disinterest among matched pairs. Even when a panda cub was born, they were not likely to survive very long. Only 30 percent of captive giant pandas successfully reproduced, and of those cubs, more than 60 percent died in infancy.\nBut two important innovations allowed for recent successes in panda breeding. The first was artificial insemination, either with freshly collected or with frozen and thawed sperm. The process is now routine at panda breeding centers, both in China and abroad. Second, the care for newborn pandas has improved tremendously. A large proportion of neonatal deaths can be attributed to the intentional \"discard\" of one of two twins by a panda mother. More recently, however, husbandry techniques have been developed for the successful rearing of panda cubs by humans. In 2002, neonatal survival had increased to 71%.\nAdvertisement\nA 2010 study revealed that while 52 bird, mammal, and amphibian species creep their way closer to extinction each year (that is, they get more dire classifications according to IUCN criteria), that rate would could be as much as twenty percent worse if not for active conservation-related efforts. In fact, that study identified 68 threatened species whose conservation status was improved, thirteen of which were due to breeding and reintroduction programs. Despite the contentious nature of captive breeding, for some species at least, they seem to work. Like pandas.\nThere are three large Giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) breeding centers: Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, China Research and Conservation Center for the Giant Panda at Wolong, and Shaanxi (Louguantai) Rescue and Breeding Center for Rare Wildlife. Combined with the Beijing Zoo, the four centers are responsible for maintaining genetically healthy panda populations, both in the wild and in captivity; China even oversees the majority of captive panda work even in US institutions like the San Diego and National Zoos.\nG/O Media may get a commission Save $70 Apple AirPods Max Experience Next-Level Sound\nSpatial audio with dynamic head tracking provides theater-like sound that surrounds you\ufeff Buy for $479 at Amazon Advertisement\nBy the late 1990s, the captive panda population included more captive-born individuals than those born in the wild. By 2012, there were 341 giant pandas in captive breeding programs.\nThat relative success means that researchers are finally beginning to plan the strategic release of captive-born pandas back into their wild habitats. But the success of a release program depends not just on \"a large population, but also ample genetic variation as a genetic resource bank for wild populations.\" That's according to conservation biologist Lei Shan of the Chinese Academy of Science's Institute of Zoology.\nAdvertisement\nAbove: San Diego Zoo panda Zhen Zhen ( Nathan Rupert/Flickr )\nAs part of the preparation for a reintroduction plan, Shan and colleagues set out to determine whether the population of captive pandas has sufficient genetic diversity. It is a common belief, they say, that the pandas in the four breeding centers suffer from severe inbreeding, and there is little information on whether there is any gene flow between the four centers. To address the question, the researchers assessed genetic variation and inbreeding levels in 240 individuals, which represents nearly two thirds of the entire captive panda population.\nAdvertisement\nHappily, the captive panda population turns out to harbor quite a bit of genetic diversity! In fact, the diversity in the captive populations is comparable to previous estimates for wild panda populations. The genetic diversity in the captive panda population is actually even higher than that of captive populations within other high-profile reintroduction programs, like black-footed ferrets and the California condors. In other words, the captive population is sustainable; it doesn't need an influx of new genetic material from wild individuals. It also means that is reasonable to transfer individuals from the breeding population back into the wild.\nAdvertisement\nLeft: A juvenile San Diego Zoo panda, Yun Zi ( Nathan Rupert/Flickr )\nThat's all great news, but everything isn't perfect. While the captive population as a whole is genetically healthy, some issues did arise when the individual breeding centers were considered on their own. The Shaanxi (Louguantai) Center, for example, has only 19 individuals and is itself at risk of serious inbreeding. However, the solution isn't as simple as encouraging more transfers among the centers. That's because the wild animals that founded each of the captive populations may have had important evolutionary adaptations that allowed them to survive just a bit better in their slightly different environments.\nAdvertisement\nThe \"Qinling\" population, for example, of which the Shaanxi pandas are members, diverged from the rest of the species a third of a million years ago. Since then, the Qinling evolved unique anatomical features that distinguish them from other pandas. If the Shaanxi center traded individuals with the Chengdu center, from a genetic perspective, it would effectively represent a trade between the Qinling and non-Qinling wild populations. How would non-Qinling individuals survive if reintroduced into the Qinling environment, and vice versa? What about hybrid offspring? \"This exchange may disrupt patterns of local adaptation established over hundreds of thousands of years, and thus would result in an unpredictable impact on wild populations if captive individuals were reintroduced into their original environments,\" writes Shan.\nRather than the traditional route towards avoiding inbreeding, which involves trading individuals or sperm between centers, the researchers advocate that the Shaanxi center be managed on its own, to retain the genetic uniqueness of that sub-population. On the other hand, they recommend that the remaining three centers increase their trade of individuals or of sperm in order to maintain current levels of genetic diversity.\nAdvertisement\nThe most comprehensive survey of the captive giant panda population ever attempted, this study reflects the effectiveness and success of China's giant panda captive breeding program. But Shan's research also underscores the supreme importance of considering not just population-wide genetic diversity but also the genetic compatibility of candidates for release with the environment and community into which they are to be released. Not all pandas, it seems, are created equal.\n[Molecular Biology and Evolution]\nRelated:\nAdvertisement\nHeader image: Panda at Chengdu station via Erin G./Flickr"}

Today I will be exposing this horrific conspiracy for the ugly, putrid thing that it is. This update will rock you to the core. It will shake your foundations. You will never be the same.\nWe're not talking about animals being abused, sold into slavery, or being killed off for their fur, which is very soft and comfortable by the way. No, it's a scam worse than anything ever sent to your inbox from Nigeria.\nGood natured humans are being defrauded by the so-called panda \"bear\" for everything they are worth. Think you're just an innocent bystander? Think again. If you've ever paid admission to a zoo to see a panda you are part of the conspiracy. Folks, it's everything we have feared and more.\nThe Giant Panda is secretly pretending to be endangered and helpless so human beings will pamper them forever.\nEvery year a bazillion gajillion zillion billion dollars and forty cents is wasted attempting to care for, track, and rebuild the species. Conservationists are now using satellite tracking technology to monitor wild pandas having sex, the BBC reports.\n\"Tracking them with advanced technology and observing their sex activities might help us find ways to avoid their extinction,\" an official said.\nI'll tell you why they have a poor breeding record. THEY ARE PLAYING YOU ALL FOR CHUMPS, THAT'S WHY! What's worse is that there is now a panda kindergarten to educate cubs! YOUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK. These pandas are only being educated in one thing, how to fool humans for the rubes they are.\nOh, we're poor pandas. Cry cry, sniff sniff we're going to go extinct if you don't help us! Heh heh heh, look at all the humans, believing our every word, humanitarians they are. Oh yes, take us in and help us breed. Give us the best bamboo, the best dens, and the best luxury sport sedans. Why not? I'm a panda. I'm endangered. Give me everything I want! Ha ha ha!\nThat's what they think of you, my friends. And if we don't stop it pandas will continue to play us all like the bleeding heart liberal hippie bastards we are. Democrats aren't the only ones to blame for the panda conspiracy. Even conservative talk show host Bill O'Reilly has been taken in by these cute little bears. Here in a 2002 transcript Bill extends his gratitude towards the species.\nAnd before we end today's program I'd like to salute the Giant Panda. Any friend of the panda is a friend of The Factor. The Factor's ratings are up an astonishing 256% this month and we'd like to thank every panda for making us number 1. Thank you.\nEven our very own Rich \"Lowtax\" Kyanka has been fooled by pandas stating in a 2003 update, \"I am not tired of having sex with panda bears.\" He went on to make suggestions on how to solve the panda bear mating problem. Oh how ignorant we were back then. If only we knew what we know now!\nThis is not a partisan issue. This is a global issue. In order to stop this conspiracy we must unite together. But first, what do we know about the conspiracy and how it is perpetuated? What follows is our special investigative report, four years in the making.\nTrust: An Endangered Species\nWhile pandas are widely considered to be bears they bear a striking resemblance to the raccoon family. Raccoons are the thieves of the animal kingdom. They are tricksters and derive pleasure from mischief and mayhem. Pandas are merely raccoons in disguise. I could prove it if only I had 3DO bios for a secret project I'm working on. Pandas are currently on the endangered species list. That in itself is true. There are estimated to be only 1,600 pandas in the wild and about a hundred in captivity. How they got that way is sketchy. Pandas are thought to have become endangered because of pollution, destruction of their habitat, and poaching. This is simply not true. Pandas are more than capable of surviving in the wild according to this 1992 study by the ESA. They want to be endangered. I don't even get a birthday cake or a birthday but the damn panda gets a cake oh well I don't care that's fine it's not like I want a birthday or anything... sigh. Pandas, on the other hand, love the zoo. They've used their greatest weapon, cuteness, to trick humans into pampering them and treating them like kings. If you thought panda kindergarten was bad, wait until they build panda hotels, panda casinos, and panda Dave & Buster's. Pandas loving the zoo when every other animal there wants to die? It's starting to raise more than a few eyebrows. Don't buy into their endangered species propaganda. Would a panda help you if you were endangered? What happens when all of civilization is threatened by peak oil, global warming, and Rosie O\u2019Donnell\u2019s triumphant return to television to oust Star Jones as the supreme fat woman of daytime TV? Will pandas bathe us, shelter us, and wipe our asses? I think not.\nMuch has been made of the panda\u2019s legendary reluctance to mate. We'll debunk that myth in the next section.\nThe Reproductive Factor\nPandas stay on the endangered species list by refusing to mate. Humans go to great lengths to tempt pandas into having sex with each other. They even go as far as showing panda pornography to males to get them in the mood. Most are able to resist hot and sweaty panda on panda action. When the zoo keeper says, \"Panda, go have sex!\" the male panda says, \"No Peg.\" Then the zoo patrons hoot and holler as the panda flushes a toilet. It's the most popular exhibit at the San Diego Zoo and brings in 10 million in ticket sales annually. A rare image of pandas copulating. These pandas may be having fun now but they risk being outcast from their pack. If you're a panda it's not in your best interest to reproduce. Building up your species' numbers means you go back to the wild. There goes the panda birthday parties, the kindergarten, and the panda porn. It isn't always that easy. Some pandas do break down and succumb to their biological urges. Those that break ranks and start banging are ostracized from the panda community. They are shamed and risk being offed by their fellow pandas. As one former panda who mated told me in this exclusive interview, mating can mean the end. We shot the interview in silhouette per his request. You really don't know what it's like until they've been in that situation. Yeah, I mated. The temptation was too great. After my mating session I was met with a great backlash. Other pandas wouldn't talk to me. I was blocked from getting bamboo. I even received death threats. I was forced to don a disguise and move to the hippo pen. It was the only thing I could do. The conspiracy permeates through panda society almost as if it were instinct. From birth pandas are taught to uphold the conspiracy at all costs, even if it means their life. Those that defect are outcast and forgotten. You really don't want to mess with this. It goes all the way to the top. I've heard rumors that the Chinese government is in on it. I don't even want to think about that.\nAt this point our panda informant broke down in tears and asked that the cameras be shut off. But before he left he told us that if he had a choice, he would not have been born a panda. Half of all pandas born probably wish they were not born pandas. Mothers that give birth to two cubs abandon one of them. Is this the type of behavior you want to support?\nThe Financial Connection: Chinese Secrets Revealed\nOur story doesn't end there. The Chinese government has known about the conspiracy for years. That's right, the Chinese government you know and trust supports the panda conspiracy ever since they found out about it in 2000. Inside sources tell us that Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao first became aware of the plan when he visited a panda den at Ocean Park in Hong Kong. There he found plans detailing a massive conspiracy, the very same we have exposed in this report. I have conclusive images of these plans but the batteries in my digital camera are dead and my scanner is broken. China's economy may be booming, but at what cost to the rest of the world? SECRET CHINESE WARHEAD DEVELOPMENT. Giant Pandas are not ambassadors of goodwill. They are pawning every hard-working American that has ever visited a zoo. They are playing us for chumps and helping the Chinese government amass a great wealth of arms. Should the panda trade continue we may all be eating with chopsticks in ten years and saluting our great Chinese superiors. The Chinese government is even developing new ways to perpetuate the endangered lie. Chinese scientists have developed new hormones that suppress the panda sex drive. Chinese leaders want to get the panda population down to 500 so they can command an even higher price for panda loans. Rumor has it that loans may reach as high as five million dollars a year in the near future. What can you do to help? Don't support The Giant Panda! Support American pandas made from American plants and manufacturers. Don't support retailers that import from Chinese companies! Resist shopping at Wal-Mart. If you must shop at Wal-Mart consider soiling yourself in the electronics department to discourage others from shopping there.\nA word of caution before we end this piece. Please do not blame Chinese-American citizens for the Chinese government's refusal to stop the panda conspiracy. Chinese-Americans are hard working people like you and I and hate the panda trade as much as any of us. It would sadden me to see violence befall Chinese-Americans because of ignorance and misplaced anger. We must learn from the mistakes of the past for a better tomorrow.\nWe've given you the facts, the evidence, and the cold hard truth. What you do with it now is up to you. Goodnight, and good luck.\nUpdate: Since posting this report our giant panda informant who sought amnesty in the hippo pen has been found dead. Zoo officials don't yet know the cause of the death but they are suspecting foul play. It's just another reminder of how deadly the panda trade can truly be.\n\u2013 Hassan \"Acetone\" Mikal"}

{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "17 Animals that Go Through Metamorphosis (A to Z List ... - Fauna Facts", "url": "https://faunafacts.com/animals/animals-that-go-through-metamorphosis/", "text": "17 Animals that Go Through Metamorphosis (A to Z List & Pictures)\nExamples of animals that go through metamorphosis include Peacock Spiders, Ladybugs, Flamingo, Butterflies, and Grasshoppers.\nAnimals that go through metamorphosis are fascinating. They start out as one animal and end up becoming something completely different.\nWe all know the classic example of a caterpillar turning into a butterfly, but there are many other animals that do this too.\nWhat Is Animal Metamorphosis?\nMany amphibians, such as frogs and toads go through metamorphosis. They start out in the water with gills like fish but eventually they leave the water and live on land so they grow lungs instead of gills.\nSome insects like cicadas and dragonflies start out as underwater nymphs. These creatures spend years in the water before they emerge from the surface and grow wings to fly around.\nThere are two main types of metamorphosis \u2013 complete and incomplete.\nThe first stage is the egg, which will hatch into a caterpillar or nymph depending on the type of insect it belongs to\nDuring complete metamorphosis, the young will hatch from an egg before becoming something completely different over time.\nDuring complete metamorphosis, the young will hatch from an egg before becoming something completely different over time this includes\nInsects\nFrogs\nToads\nOther amphibians\nMany people think insects go through incomplete metamorphosis, but this isn\u2019t always the case.\nThese animals are often called \u2018incomplete\u2019 because they don\u2019t have a pupal stage that is found incomplete metamorphosis.\nIncomplete metamorphosis is found in insects like grasshoppers, as well as some other animals such as crabs.\nExamples of Animals that Go Through Metamorphosis\n1. Butterflies\nScientific Name Rhopalocera Type of Animal Insect Range Worldwide Diet Herbivore\nButterflies, moths, and skippers all go through metamorphosis.\nFirst, the caterpillar hatches from an egg laid by its mother butterfly or moth. It starts out small but then quickly eats plants to grow into a larger size so it can build up energy reserves that will last throughout its transformation.\nThen it enters the next phase of life. The caterpillar releases enzymes that dissolve the inside of its body, liquefying it.\nThis process is called \u201cGoing Into a Pupa\u201d, or Metamorphosis. Once this has happened, the animal attaches itself to something solid using silk thread and forms a chrysalis around itself out of hardened skin cells.\nAfter some time passes, the pupa begins to change. The animal inside starts growing again and takes on a completely different shape than it had before, including wings and legs.\nWhen this process is complete, all that remains of the caterpillar are its shed skin cells on the surface of the chrysalis.\nEventually, these pieces will fall off too, and then we see what the animal really looked like all along, a butterfly or moth.\n2. Chalazodes Bubble Nest Frog\nScientific Name Philautus chalazodes Type of Animal Reptile Range Kerala, India Diet Carnivore\nIt only exists in a small area of India and is highly endangered, with its habitat diminishing at an alarming rate.\nLike many other frogs, these species were originally thought to deposit eggs that matured into tadpoles on pond surfaces.\nHowever, it was revealed in 2014 that the frogs use a different reproductive strategy: they crawl inside a live bamboo stalk with a hole in it (perhaps caused by insects or rodents) and lay their eggs there. The organisms do not go through the tadpole stage, instead of hatching as froglets.\nThe species does not require water to deposit its eggs since it does not have a tadpole stage.\n3. Crown Of Thorns Starfish\nScientific Name Acanthaster planci Type of Animal Starfish Range Indo-Pacific region Diet Carnivore\nThe Crown of Thorns Starfish is a starfish that has hundreds of poisonous spines protruding from its body. These spines are used to defend themselves against predators, but they also cause extreme pain when humans step on them.\nWhen born the juvenile looks like an amorphous shape that looks like little more than a translucent, floating blob. Over time, it grows arms and then spikes before attaching itself to rocks to eat coral.\n4. Eastern Hellbender\nScientific Name Cryptobranchus alleganiensis Type of Animal Amphibian Range southern New York to northern Georgia Diet Carnivore\nThe Eastern Hellbender is a species of giant salamander that lives in the United States. They are found living under large rocks or other debris near strong currents, where they feed on fish and invertebrates.\nIn addition to their size, these creatures also have an odd appearance with wrinkly skin all over their bodies. In fact, they don\u2019t like this when they are small.\nWhen they grow older they look like a river monster when they are in their natural habitat.\n5. Flamingo\nScientific Name Phoenicopterus roseus Type of Animal Bird Range Worldwide Diet Omnivore\nFlamingo chicks have gray or white feathers at first, then acquire the same pink color as their parents as they get older.\nWhy? Because you are what you eat, flamingoes consume shrimp and algae rich in carotenoids, which give shrimp its pink color when cooked.\n6. Flatfish\nScientific Name Pleuronectiformes Type of Animal Fish Range Worldwide Diet Herbivore\nOne of the most amazing animals that go through metamorphosis is a flatfish. These fish start as normal-looking fish with eyes on both sides of their head.\nAs they grow, one eye migrates from its original position to meet up with the other eye on the other side of its body.\n7. Giant Panda\nScientific Name Ailuropoda melanoleuca Type of Animal Mammal Range southwest China Diet Herbivore\nThe giant panda is a perfect example of an animal that goes through metamorphosis. Giant pandas start out as tiny, blind, and hairless babies when they are born.\nThey even have to be nursed by their mothers for the first six months! These little creatures feed on milk and slowly grow into black-and-white furry giants\n8. Grasshoppers\nScientific Name Caelifera Type of Animal Insect Range Worldwide Diet Herbivore\nGrasshoppers and dragonflies are examples of insects that go through metamorphosis. They start out as a nymph, which is not the same as an actual bug because it looks more like a small fish than anything else.\nThe nymphs live in water until they mature into adults with wings. In order to survive in water, they have gills so that they can breathe.\nBut in order to survive on land, these animals need to get rid of their gills and develop spiracles (holes).\nDragonflies are usually green or brown when they are nymphs but turn bright colors like red or yellow once they become adults!\n9. Immortal Jellyfish\nScientific Name Turritopsis dohrnii Type of Animal Fish Range Mediterranean Sea Diet Carnivore\nThis jellyfish is one of the only animals that can revert back to its juvenile state after starting adulthood.\nJust like a butterfly goes through multiple stages, this jellyfish starts out as an egg and then turns into several polyps before turning into an adult medusa (jellyfish).\nThe interesting part about this animal is that it has the ability to revert back to its juvenile stage after it reaches adulthood.\nThis is due to the fact that this jellyfish has a complex life cycle of polyp, ephyra (juvenile), and medusa stages.\n10. Kea\nScientific Name Nestor notabilis Type of Animal Bird Range South Island of New Zealand Diet Omnivore\nA Kea is a type of parrot that lives in New Zealand. They are known for their intelligence and curiosity, which makes them very difficult to keep as pets.\nWhen they are babies, these birds look like any other parrot, but within two years they will shed their colorful feathers and start to take on the appearance of an adult kea.\nThey grow a more powerful beak and the feathers on their heads turn from green to yellow at this time as well.\n11. Ladybugs\nScientific Name Coccinellidae Type of Animal Insect Range Worldwide Diet Omnivore\nThese little bugs start out as larvae and look like tiny black worms. They don\u2019t have the spots we associate with ladybugs until they turn into adults.\nOne of the most interesting things about these insects is that during their larva stage, there are actually two different types of larvae: one that eats plants and one that eats other insects.\nThis way, they can gain some protection from predators by getting their food either in or on the ground.\nRelated Article: Red Ladybug Spiritual Meaning & Symbolism\n12. Laysan Albatross\nScientific Name Phoebastria immutabilis Type of Animal Bird Range Pacific Ocean Diet Carnivore\nAnother species of a bird where the young don\u2019t look anything like their parents. Baby Laysan albatrosses, unlike kea babies, hatch as adorable fuzzy gray clumps.\nThe youngsters gradually get adult feathers and shed their baby feathers as they mature.\n13. Mayfly\nScientific Name Ephemeroptera Type of Animal Insect Range Worldwide Diet Omnivore\nOne of the most fascinating animals that go through metamorphosis is an insect known as a mayfly.\nMayflies are found all over the world, but they mostly live in freshwater bodies of water like rivers and lakes.\nThe life cycle of these insects lasts less than five minutes, which makes them short-lived compared to other bugs.\nThey only spend a few hours as adults before they mate and die.\nMayflies start out their lives in the water, where they live for about two years.\nThese young insects are called nymphs. They have gills to help them breathe underwater and spend most of their time feeding on plants or small animals that live under rocks at the bottom of rivers.\nWhen a mayfly is ready to become an adult, it will climb out of the water and molt.\nMolting is when an insect sheds its outer layer so that it can grow. Once this process is complete, they are able to leave the water for good.\nThey spend just two days on land before mating with other adults and then die.\n14. Mimic Poison Dart Frog\nScientific Name Ranitomeya imitator Type of Animal Reptile Range northeastern Peru Diet Carnivore\nThe mimic poison dart frog starts out as an egg. When it hatches, the little tadpole will live in freshwater for up to four months while its body changes and grows.\nThe tadpoles are dark brown and black in color, getting more colorful with age until they reach adulthood and become the bright colors we know.\n15. Peacock Spider\nScientific Name Maratus volans Type of Animal Insect Range Australia Diet Carnivore\nPeacock spiders are close relatives to the jumping spider, and they live in Australia. These tiny creatures only grow up to about half an inch long.\nThey go through a dramatic transformation as adults that involves growing new pigmentation patterns on their abdomens.\n16. Termites\nScientific Name Isoptera Type of Animal Insect Range Worldwide Diet Herbivore\nTermites are little insects that live in many parts of the world, including North America. They survive by eating wood and other plant material (such as leaves).\nWhen termite babies hatch out of an egg, they look nothing like their parents.\nInstead of being white with a long body and six legs, they have a brown head and a brown body.\nAt this stage in their life, they are called \u201clarvae\u201d and spend most of their time eating wood particles.\nThese termite babies become adults by shedding their skin. Once they are fully grown, the termite has wings and looks more like an adult.\n17. Virginia Opossum\nScientific Name Didelphis virginiana Type of Animal Mammal Range north of Mexico Diet Omnivore\nThe North American Opossum is native to the United States. It lives in forests, woodlands, and swamps. This omnivorous marsupial eats just about anything it can find including insects, fruits, rodents, birds\u2019 eggs, and dead animals.\nVirginia Opossum has pouches on the outsides of their bodies where babies stay until developed enough to leave their mothers.\nWhen they are born they resemble pink jellybeans at birth. They develop fur, pointed teeth, and long tails over the course of three to five months as they mature."}
{"animal": "giant panda", "title": "Gila monster | Smithsonian's National Zoo", "url": "https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/gila-monster", "text": "Food/Eating Habits\nThe Gila monster is one of only small number of venomous lizards (including the Mexican beaded lizard, the Komodo dragon and some Australian species). It can bite quickly and hold on tenaciously. Rather than injecting venom through hollow fangs like venomous snakes, Gilas have enlarged, grooved teeth in their lower jaw. When they bite, their powerful jaws chew the venom in through capillary action along the grooves in these teeth. Gila monster venom is about as toxic as that of a western diamondback rattlesnake. However, a relatively small amount of venom is introduced in a Gila bite. Gila monsters may hold onto a predator for more than ten minutes. There is no antivenin for Gila bites.\nGila monsters most often raid nests to prey on small birds and eggs. They also catch small mammals, lizards, frogs, insects and carrion. They can eat up to one-third of their body weight in one meal.\nTheir large size means they can store more energy than smaller lizards. They store fat both in their tails and their bodies. Their low metabolic rates and ability to eat large meals combined with their capacity to store fat, make frequent searching for food unnecessary. Therefore, Gila monsters often stay hidden underground. It has been suggested that Gilas can consume all the calories they need for a year in three or four large meals. Their top speed is only 1.5 miles per hour (2.4 kilometers per hour).\nAt the Smithsonian's National Zoo, Gila monsters eat mice every other week. Occasionally, they get a hard-boiled egg."}

Like most animals, male giant pandas weigh more than females. It is rare for a female giant panda to exceed 220 pounds.\nStanding between 2 and 3 feet at the shoulder, the giant panda is roughly the size of an American black bear. They maintain their weight by eating continuously for up to 12 hours at a time, consuming 28 pounds of bamboo a day. In fact, 99 percent of the giant panda\u2019s diet is bamboo. Pandas do occasionally eat wild grasses and rodents. In rare cases they may feed on the fawns of musk deer.\nADVERTISEMENT"}

They then shoot their tongue like a cannon to snare their prey.\nThe tongue of Rhampholeon spinosus, an endangered chameleon from Tanzania, can produce a peak acceleration that\u2019s 264 times greater than the acceleration due to gravity. If it were a car, its tongue could accelerate from 0 to 60 miles (97 kilometers) per hour in 1/100th of a second.\n46. License to Krill\nA blue whale\u2019s tongue weighs as much as an adult elephant. Blue whales are the largest animals ever to have lived on earth, and they feed almost entirely on some of the smallest marine life \u2013 tiny shrimp-like animals called krill.\n45. A Great Bloody Party Trick\nA great white shark can detect a drop of blood in just twenty-five gallons of water and can sense tiny amounts of blood up to three miles away.\n44.

That\u2019s why it constantly chews on tree trunks and branches: to prevent them from getting too long.\n42. Shell Game\nOysters can change gender multiple times throughout their lifespan. That\u2019s right, they\u2019ve been gender-fluid for millennia.\n41. Leaning In\nClownfish are all born male and will change sex to become a dominant female.\n40. Get Up and Jump\nA flea can jump a distance up to 100 times their body length.\nSign up to our newsletter. History\u2019s most fascinating stories and darkest secrets, delivered to your inbox daily. Making distraction rewarding since 2017.\n39. Noisemaker\nThe water boatman can make a noise that reaches 105 decibels (roughly the same as a lawn mower) by rubbing its penis against its belly. This makes the water boatman the loudest animal relative to its body size.\n38. Monkey Business\nThe loudest land animal on land (not relative to anything) is the howler monkey who can be heard up to three miles away. They howl mostly to warn other monkeys that this is their territory and to let others within their own group know where they are.\n37. Trump\u2019s Favorite Monkey\nAlthough loud, howler monkeys are harmless and their way of dealing with humans they don\u2019t want near them is to innocently pee on them.\n36. A Wail of a Whale\nThe loudest mammals, period, are blue whales that can produce low-frequency pulses heard from more than 500 miles away.\n35. The Claw! The Claw!\nThe loudest known living creature (not a mammal) is the snapping shrimp, which has specialized claws that can shoot jets of superheated water up to 62 miles per hour and explode at 200 decibels to stun or even kill its prey.\n34. The Need for Speed\nA cheetah can go from zero to 60 miles per hour in three seconds, which is exactly the same as a Corvette. Except when you ride a cheetah, you don\u2019t look like a douchebag.\n33. All He Can Think of is an Omelette\nMale emperor penguins will stand in the Antarctic cold, taking care of an egg without eating for up to two months while the female goes to feed.\n32. Waiting His Turn\nWhen the female returns, she\u2019ll have a belly full of food that she regurgitates for their newly hatched chick and then it\u2019ll be the male\u2019s turn to go and eat.\n31. My Little Sea Pony\nSeahorses are monogamous and mate for life, presumably because seahorses haven\u2019t yet discovered Tinder.\n30. Mr. Mom\nAlso, seahorses are the only animal on earth where the male is the one who gets pregnant. We\u2019d like to think that it was because seahorse men were so irresponsible that nature came up with a way to ensure they take care of their kids.\nShutterstock\n29. Polarized\nA polar bear has black skin underneath all that white fur. The white fur is to blend into the snow and ice. The black skin is to soak in the sun\u2019s warming rays.\nWikimedia Commons\n28. Gonna Make You Sweat\nHippos secrete a red oily substance from their skin that acts as sunblock, moisturizer, and protection against germs.\n27. Team Effort\nThe Portuguese Man-O-War is actually not a single organism, but a collective of four organisms that work together to float, sting, eat, digest, and reproduce.\n26. Overkill\nThe 2-inch golden poison dart frog contains enough venom to kill 10 adult men. The frog eats flies, crickets, ants, and termites, so why so much poison?! Why? Nature is weird.\n25. The Shocker\nThe electric eel can deliver up to 600 volts of electricity, which is five times the power of a standard American wall socket, so it\u2019s just common sense not to stick your tongue in either.\n24. Don\u2019t Bother Running\nGrizzly bears can run at speeds up to 30 miles per hour. To compare, Usain Bolt was clocked at 27.8 mph during the 100 meter sprint. Long story short, if a bear wants you dead, you\u2019re dead.\n23. The Century Club\nGalapagos tortoises can live a long time, with average lifespans over a century. The oldest known tortoise was 152 years old. His name was Lonesome George. They tried to get him to breed. He refused. He wasn\u2019t just over the hill. He was over the hump.\n22. Snakes ARE the Plane\nThe flying snake can glide in the air for distances up to 330 feet and can even make turns. Yeah. Because snakes weren\u2019t bad enough. Now they can fly? Screw you nature. Screw you.\n21. A Hardy Bunch\nScorpions are incredibly resilient, able to live on a single insect per year. Scientists have even frozen scorpions overnight, and once thawed, they walked away like nothing happened.\n20. Bamboozled\nAn adult panda spends 12 hours a day eating and consumes 28 pounds of bamboo on a daily basis. Unsurprisingly, a panda also poops over forty times a day. Somewhere, right now, a panda is pooping.\n19. Anty Maim\nAnteaters eat 35,000 ants a day. Gross.\n18. Where\u2019s the Beef?\nVampire bats feed entirely on blood and a colony of 100 bats will drink 25 cows worth of blood per year.\n17. A Sloth Gathers All the Moss\nA three-toed sloth will sleep for up to 20 hours a day and is so sedentary that algae grows on its back.\n16.

I Believe I Can Fly\nFlying fish can reach speeds up to 37 mph and, once they\u2019ve breached the water, can glide 655 feet, which is more than twice the length of a football field.\n14. Body Shop\nWhen tarantulas molt, they can also replace internal organs including stomach lining, female genitalia, and even grow new limbs. Just when you thought spiders couldn\u2019t get scarier.\n13. It\u2019s Complicated\nAfter mating, a male tarantula will run away from the female because if he sticks around, she\u2019ll eat him. God forbid if he doesn\u2019t at least drop a text later.\n12. Butt Out!\nAs a defense mechanism, sea cucumbers will eject their internal organs via their anus.\n11. Looking Down On Us\nAt 18 feet long, the king cobra is the largest venomous snake in the world and can raise itself up to 6 feet off the ground, enough to tower over most humans.\n10. Seal of Approval\nDuring breeding season, dominant male elephant seals can collect a harem of up to fifty females.\n9. Never Left the Party\nThe coelacanth is a prehistoric fish that was thought to have gone extinct 65 million years ago but was rediscovered in 1938. It is believed that they represent an early step in the evolution of fish to four-legged animals.\n8. Fat Head\nA coelacanth\u2019s brain occupies only 1.5% of its cranial cavity. The rest is filled with fat.\n7. Beware the Early Bird\nA snowy owl will eat up to 1,600 lemmings a year. That\u2019s three to five every day. Between \u201ceaten by owl\u201d and \u201cjumping off a cliff\u201d lemmings don\u2019t seem to have a lot of great life options.\n6. Ballers\nWhen anacondas mate, competing males can gather around a female in a writhing mass called a breeding ball. The ball can last up to four weeks and during that time the female can breed with several of the males.\n5. Bee Story\nWhen a queen bee dies, the workers will create a new queen by feeding her royal jelly.\n4. Better Living through Chemistry\nQueen bees can regulate the activity of a hive by releasing chemicals into the air to modify the behavior of the other bees. Chemicals. Hit songs. Potato, potahto.\n3. Calamari for Dinner\nThe biggest giant squid on record was 59 feet long, weighed nearly a ton, and had eyes the size of beach balls.\n2. Sail Away\nSailfish are the fastest fish in the ocean and can leap out of the ocean at speeds up to 68 miles per hour.\nShutterstock\n1. That\u2019s One Horny Fish (Not a Fish)\nThe narwhal has two teeth, one of which can grow into a nearly nine-foot tusk in males, earning them the name the \u201cunicorn of the sea.\u201d Of course, had we seen them first, we would have named them tunacorns.\nSources: 1 2"}

Male Ravi lives in the Holtzman Wildlife Foundation Red Panda Forest. The habitat features more than 14,000 square feet of naturalistic space with a flowing stream and waterfall, an arboreal pathway through the habitat, misting areas, land for exploration and a variety of nesting places. A canopy walkway extends 80 feet through the trees in the habitat and provides unparalleled views of these arboreal animals for adventurous guests.\nDescription\nAs their name suggests, red pandas\u2019 fur is mostly rusty-red color. They have white markings on their ears, cheeks, muzzles and above their eyes. Their bushy tails are ringed with light and dark variations of the rusty-red color. Their fur also covers the soles of their feet to help give them traction and prevent them from falling off slippery, wet branches."}

In fact it looks like a cross between all three! It is reddish brown with a very thick ringed tail. Red pandas lives in Asia and shares some of its habitat with the giant panda. They both share some similar lifestyle facts. Both animals like to eat bamboo, although the red panda will supplement its diet and eat addition foods when available. They are both solitary creatures and endangered. They even share breeding and reproduction characteristics. Despite all of their similarities, the red panda family classification is Ailuridae. Information on their life cycle in the wild is not complete. The red panda is also known as the lesser panda, fire cat, small red panda, and western red panda. HABITAT The red panda lives, eats, and raises its babies in forest mountain terrains. Its habitat range includes central China, Nepal, Myanmar(Burma), and Bhutan. Precise information on their habitat distribution is not known since wild population facts are difficult to gather.

Predators : Snow leopards, martens.\n: Snow leopards, martens. Breeding frequency: 1 or 2 years. ENDANGERED STATUS Once living in many parts of Asia including greater China, the red panda is now confined to parceled territories that collectively are a fraction of its original habitat. These isolated parcels interfere with feeding, migration, and breeding activities. Many facts indicate that reproduction rates are on the decline. The foods it must eat to maintain its lifestyle and reproduction cycle have been reduced by habitat loss, global warming, hunting, and poaching. Their greatest threat is therefore mankind. Research facts show many baby red pandas do not survive to adulthood. The red panda is classified as endangered. In fact it is now extinct in several countries according to information from conservation groups. LIFESTYLE Although complete information on these scarce creatures is not documented, certain facts are known. Adults lead solitary lives. However this endangered species has been observed to be more social prior to reproduction cycles. They are active from dusk to dawn and their primary habitat is above the ground in trees. In fact they breed and sleep in trees. A major characteristic is the ability to traverse tree branches easily. These pandas like to eat, clean themselves, mate, and sleep. Life style of this animal includes a lot of play and mischief. Baby red pandas are energetic from the start. DIET Bamboo is the main diet of the red panda and is abundant in its natural habitat. However it will also eat a variety of other foods such as fruits, nuts, eggs, flowers, and seeds. Information from their droppings reveal additional diet facts, such as their taste for other prey such as rodents and small birds. Red panda cubs eat bamboo until they are mature enough to expand their diet. Their bamboo ranges are endangered and threaten the life style of this unique species. REPRODUCTION Breeding season is in the late fall through winter. The gestation period is about four months. Baby red pandas are born in an average litter size of one to four babies and are born in the late spring and summer. They build a nest or use hollow tree trunks or small caves to give birth to their newborn. The mother red panda takes care of her cubs until they reach adulthood when the next mating season begins. After birth adulthood is reached in 16 to 18 months. At 18 months both male and female are ready to mate and repeat the reproduction process."}
